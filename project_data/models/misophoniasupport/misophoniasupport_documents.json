["I want to live without fearing children screaming Disclaimer: I do like kids. I do not hate them. \n\nI have this from a traumatic experience with a neighborhood that was full of little kids and disgusting parents. They were screaming everyday, playing outside. Their screaming made me mad, so I moved to another place. It is nearby a kindergarten (I had a good experience with a kindergarten before) so I did not bother.\n\nBut now, my everyday life is depending on when they are outside: I am scared hearing them screaming. We have some neighbors not far away who also have children but they are not outside that often.\nThe kindergarten lets the children out for about 4-6 hours a day so you can imagine why I like rainy days.\n\nWhenever I see or hear children, I become scared and anxious. It is making my life worse to be that sensitive. I listen to music all day with headphones and I want to live without headphones. I do not want to be scared of the warm seasons where the children go outside and play.\n\nHow can I change myself so that I do not bother children screaming anymore?\nNote: I have a therapist but she does not care about my problem and finding a new one means waiting a long time. I feel for you. I think waiting for a therapist who actually cares enough to help you with the things you need help with is better than being with one right now that does not. Why do you have a therapist if she does not care about you No answer. But can relate. The shrieking and uneven, rapid movement patterns freak me out.", "Sometimes I wish I could go deaf It is progressed to the point where I am triggered by the slightest thing, and if it is really bad if feels like I am being attacked- like someone is just jabbing at my brain. It hurts so, so much. It is gotten so bad, and now it is starting to interfere with my other disorders and it is made me a utter mess, and I am trying so hard to cope with my other disorders but it is been so difficult as my misophonia has progressed. I feel like a burden, it is so hard being around my family now without feeling like a shitty son. I hate this so much.", "Voice of a particular child This was removed from r/misophonia so I guess I will try here.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9\u2019s son (7) has a lisp due to baby teeth falling out. He also cannot say his Rs so, for example, when he says \u201cfireworks\u201d it comes out as \u201cfiyowoikth\u201d. He has ADHD and also does not ever stop making random noises (explosion sounds, high pitched \u201cwacky\u201d sounds, grunting, WHINING, baby babbling noises, etc.)\n\nWe only get him every other weekend so I have not gone completely unhinged yet, but it seems like the longer I know him the more irritated I get. I really hoped that the more time I spent with him the less irritation I would feel; the opposite\u2019s proven true however.\n\nIt is gotten to the point where I have asked my fianc\u00e9 to not have him on speakerphone when they talk. (I was extremely anxious to ask him this, because it sounds insane-who could take that unoffended?) I cannot explain it except I feel fast and strong waves of rage surging through me when I hear him speak. It affects my breathing sometimes and often I will start sweating. When he visited over the summer for a month I nearly exploded. I felt like a caged animal with no outlet, trapped.\n\nI have not ever really had this experience before in my entire life (I am in my mid 30s). Is this misophonia? Am I just an intolerant jerk? Do I need to see a psychiatrist? I have brought this up repeatedly to my therapist but she just kind of laughs it off. At random times throughout the day I will hear his voice in my head saying the sounds I cannot stand. I will become mildly enraged and he could be miles away. I feel you. Whiny kid voices and noises were my first misophonia trigger, all the way back when I was 2 1/2 and I started preschool. They (along with dogs whining and whiny vocals in music) continue to be my most extreme enraging trigger. \n\nWith my own daughter, I pretended I could not understand what she was saying if she used a whiny voice. I would ask her to take a deep breath and try to say it again in a normal voice. She rarely whined. I had her 100% of the time, though, so it was easy for me to train her not to trigger me. I have adhd, and would recommend asking the parent if they have considered getting a diagnosis from a medical professional. This could help not just you, but also the child himself. I wish you a lovely holiday season and all the best to you and your family &lt;3 nah, i feel it. i had to switch my math class in my last year of high school because the teacher's voice not only triggered my misophonia, but also gave me migranes. \n\nhopefully once his teeth grow in, things will get better! This definitely sounds like misophonia, I am so sorry you have to go through it. I have the same experience with my mother in-law (who I work with everyday) and I wear headphones all day to suppress the hissing sounds she makes when she speaks, which really helps. The headphones I use are Sony MDR-XB50AP. If you have such reactions to him, and i saw you said(4 months ago) you feel sick of his \"fukin voice and face\", it might not be so simple to call it \"Misophonia\" and then forget it.\n\nIf you think you have such bad reactions to the child generally , which include his voice as well, then you should be clear about that with yourself and with your fianc\u00e9.\n\nIt can be difficult on you and unfair to that child. That sub is getting worse and worse all the time. They remove everything it seems. Unfortunately when he whines his dad coddles him even more. I cannot stand to be around it. It is terrible to watch. He is been diagnosed and is already on two medications.  At this point maybe I need another medication for myself to deal with it. I purchased the wh-1000-xm3 headphones this summer just to deal with it.  Sometimes I am the only person around so I cannot really just put them on and ignore him. I am really trying to find out why I am having such a visceral reaction. I honestly do not know if I have misophonia or if I am just an intolerant asshole, I know he is 7 and he cannot help things. I do feel shame at times when I am around him for the way I feel. I am not mean to him in the slightest, I try my best to be nice. I am really surprised at my own reaction to a child. When his medication is on full force he is able to play quietly for a few hours by himself. At those times I do not feel poorly towards him. Oh my gods he is making it worse! \n\nI am so sorry. I could not hang out with anyone with whiny kids. I stopped seeing a very close friend because of this. We went texting only for several years. I just cannot put myself in a situation where I end up resenting or hating a child, and I was starting to hate her kids. you are not a jerk. &amp; misophonia is just as real as adhd. none of us would choose to be bothered by such weird shit if we had the choice. also, some kids are just kind of annoying lol but remember he will not be missing baby teeth forever. i am sorry you are going through this, i read a book once that explained how to help the brain learn to work through the response. also try decibel earplugs as they help soften sounds a bit.", "Do you have any of these along with misophonia? If you have several diagnosis just vote for the one you think affects you the most OR press other and specify in the comments.\n\n(", "\u201cIf you do not remove your earbuds, you cannot talk to me\u201d So I was casually discussing something with my mom and all of a sudden she says \u201comg you have those things in again, take them off now!\u201d And I told her why because I could hear her, I only had one on and it was not even playing anything. I just feel more comfortable to have some kind of protection in case someone made a sound. \n\nAnd she starts going off about how those irritate HER so much and how I am going to suffer from brain damage and how that is the reason my concentration is so bad nowadays(tf?)\n\nSo then she was like \u201cyou either remove them, or this conversation is done\u201d so I said fine, stood up and left. I just cannot believe why it would bother others when I am the one that has to constantly suffer. You would think your mother would be most likely to understand but no\u2026..ugh I am so done Some parents are just way too entitled for any bs. \n\nIf it was a kid of someone else, they would be like \"Oh, they are mentally ill!? What a poor kid. Do not you need anything from me? I will do my best so I will not trigger you.\" \n\nWhen it is their own kid, they are like \"I AM YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO TELL YOU WHETHER YOU ARE MENTALLY ILL OR NOT, AND I TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE NOT, SO I DO NOT HAVE TO BE BOTHERED BY IT!!! NOW GET OVER IT AND CONCENTRATE GODDAMIT... JEEZ KIDS THESE DAYS\" Righttt??? Like we are not ALLOWED to be mentally ill lol. My mother said that if I loved her enough, it would not bother me because *ahum* \u201cI am YoUr MoTher\u201d and when I tell her that it is real and that there is even scientific research and evidence, she says \u201cwell we should not trust all things that are written on google and the internet in general\u201d \n\nI am glad tho that I do have common sense and that I do not have the same mindset. If my mother ever told me that, I would use it as an excuse to never talk to her again, full on Tarantino style. What in the world Yes\u2728 Hang in there you are not alone Aw thank you so much, we at least have each other Do not be so sure about that, you would have to occasionally get some info from such mum while living with her. They always act like we do it on purpose just to insult them Do not underestimate the power of select mutism tho", "For me it is more \"when your neighbor is scrolling through their playlist instead of playing a song\"  \"when your cat starts to slowly put their leg down\" I do not get it.  How do you hear someone scroll?  Is this a specific app that has scrolling sounds.  Because that just sounds like annoying design, and would drive anyone crazy. No, i mean instead of playing their music they are finding a song to play. bass makes me crazy and most speakers have it, so by scrolling through their songs they would have paused their current one (who does that? my neighbors) and there would be o bass, similar to how yiur sister can just pick up the bag of chips again and start eating away, they can just click on a song and you are back to suffering Ah, got it.  It is the anticipation.  Bass/music is not a \"trigger\" for my misophonia, so it did not make immediate sense to me. What is worse is when they stop for a few minutes and you convince yourself that it is over, but there they go again. oh my god do not \ud83d\ude2d", "Im seriously at my limit Im a 15 year old girl, went to therapy for misophonia and I have a psychologist. We found out that my case of misophonia is verg severe compared to others, and considering I developed it when I was around 7 and my parents neglected it, I did not get the help I needed in time. \n\n\nIve had misophonia for around 8 years now, and its starting to become unbearable. I have a lot of other stuff going on at home, im diagnosed with PTSD due to traumatic events in my family. Due to Covid, I cant leave the house as often. At school, I can barely make a test because of sounds around me. \n\nAlmost every human noise triggers me at this point, even my own sounds can. I used SH as a way to cope but I dont want to elaborate on that. Whenever I get triggered, i cant even think anymore, its just me going insane in my own head trying not to attack my family that I care so much about. I cant stand this anymore. The therapy only barely helped me. Does anyone have any idea of what I should do? Because i dont know if I can continue like this anymore if I have to 24/7 conceal the violent impulses that are inside of me. Im desperate Ear plugs all the time, noise cancelling headphones, journaling, go for walks outside EVERY day, listen to loud music, take long relaxing baths or showers, leave the room whenever you need to. Do NOT expose yourself to triggers on purpose, do not try to 'put up with it,' this will make the triggers worse. Avoid being sleep deprived. Listen to ASMR if you can find some you like, I like GentleWhisperingASMR on youtube, I feel like it 'cancels' out the misophonic response and gives my brain a break.\n\nRemember, this is not your fault and you may get some really dark thoughts, that is normal for people under lots of stress like you. This is the very worst age for misophonia, BTW. It will never go away, but it will get better when you move out.\n\nAll you can do is cope and try to not beat yourself up. CBT is pretty useless, honestly. They do not understand, there is no formal treatment plan yet. Maybe try an SSRI. Birth control can also help because symptoms get worse when you are PMSing.\n\nWish I could help more. Wish I could give you a cure.\n\nPS I have heard of alternatives for SH, like holding ice cubes and drawing with markers. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy can help with that  If you can get them, noise cancelling headphones are always the best. I would recommend brands like Cowin or Muze, as they are the best I have had. You are not in this boat alone, and if you need any more advice on headphones I am willing to answer to the best of my knowledge. Wooooo personally speaking I find that asmr is insanely triggering it is interesting to see someone else experiences the opposite   Haha then I would not call it ASMR in your case.", "Am I being controlling? Firstly, a story that comes back later and does not quite fit into a full venting post.\n\nThis story happened in the dark times (April 2020), and I was doing my schoolwork at 2:00. My brother was practicing his guitar in the room directly below me. I knew I had a problem but I did not know it had a name yet. I was seen as an unsupportive, and controlling asshole who could not take the fact that my brother was talented at something. I told him to move somewhere else with it (He was playing acoustic), I was met with \"go back to your work\" and \"you are fine\". After 10 minutes I could not take it anymore and in a misophonic rage, screamed at him to move into the basement with all the better sound quality down there. I was met with my mom screaming that he can play guitar whenever the fuck he wants and to get over myself. I blame her for my guitar Misophonia getting worse because I was playing my music in my headphones at dangerous levels and could still hear it.\n\nOnto the main event, I went to a the doctor for a well visit and a flu shot. In the waiting room, they give everyone over 12 a depression survey. I answered 11/27 on the checklist but answered strongly in one area (feeling bad about myself and feeling like a failure to those closest to me.) That was enough to qualify me for mild depression. The doctor told my mom about it and all was well healthwise. On the car ride, she was telling me that it must be linked to my time on the computer, and that I need to give it a rest. She questioned me about the strong question and I told her that she holds me to such a high standard academically that if I score an 80% on something, I feel like I failed. I also told her that the root cause was the fact that every single time I bring up Misophonia in the house, I get nothing but shit for it. She tells me that she has never been adverse to it and totally respects that I have this condition. I almost laughed in her face because of the story above, and that she has told me that I am fighting a losing battle. She then went on a rant about how I owe my dad for keeping a roof over my head and feeding me and that the least I could do was to respect him doing his favorite thing in the world (guitar). She told me the classic hypothetical \"How would you like it if your dad told you not to run your 3d printer while he is home and that he cannot take it even though it is a fun hobby of yours?\" First of all, my printer only sounds like a fan with the occasional mechanical whirr. If anything, the paper printer generates more of that noise. Second, 3d prints take a long time. Depending on size and settings, it could be anywhere from 2-22 hours. I personally hate it when they target my hobbies to validate them not accommodating my issues. My mom then went on a whole spiel that I have a deep seated need for control. She said that I tell people not to eat (I only tell people to chew like people, not wolves) and tell people not to play guitar (I tell them to play with headphones in or play the acoustic guitar in the basement) She says that I only deal in extremes. I do not. In fact, I might be the only one compromising. She has repeatedly told me that she will not be controlled by my issue and in her awful words \"I recognize that you have a problem, but I will not tiptoe around you. I will not be controlled by you.\" I then told her that my dad gives me annoyed looks, yells at me, and even tries to make light or fun of my condition. He is not in the slightest bit understanding, and that needed to change 6 months ago.\n\nShe finally recognized that I was crying my eyes out and tried to make me feel better by saying generic things you say to an inconsolable person. You know, the things like \"It is ok\" \"do not cry\" \"cheer up\" and the crown jewel \"It is not your fault\" She said that she will try to be more considerate towards my Misophonia ant tell dad to try to be more understanding and considerate.\n\nAt least with a serious mental illness like depression, maybe they will take that more seriously.", "just a vent This morning I woke up to the sound of my mom coughing (a trigger) repeatedly in the room that shares a wall with my bedroom.  I tried to turn my music up to drown her out but the coughs continued and became all I could focus on and eventually I started crying, which point I realized that I would not be able to go back to sleep.  I got up and went to the kitchen to distance myself but she heard me and asked why I was up so early, to which I replied that I just could not sleep. I did not have the heart to tell her that she affected me that much by doing something that she cannot control so now I just feel guilty for that *and* for lying to her. Well, technically, you could not sleep **because** of her. So you could not sleep anyway. Also, both my friend and I have misophonia, and neither of us like to tell anyone because we feel it hurts them. I actually found a meme for this, got to look for it again. It is okay. ( would have let you sleep through that Thank you, and if you find that meme, you should send it to me! thank you, I will check it out!", "How do I tell my friend about the trigger noises he does? Everyday it is a routine I come home from school normally smoke a little and play with my good friend of like 7 years on apex or something but when he gulps and make noises with his mouth due to his mix placement I cannot help but just want to yell at the top of my lungs each time I hear one of those noises it really has impacted our friendship to the point of sometimes I will just leave for 30mins to 1 hour just to clear my head any advice is appreciated I am fairly new to reddit thought I would ask for some advice here thank you to all who reply :) Have you talked to him about having Misophonia? Some people are really understanding when you tell them about your situation and will try to accommodate you. Maybe since you have been friends for like 7 years he would be willing to make some accommodations. Maybe he can mute himself for you when he takes a drink or move the mic away?  I have told him about it I just get aniexty about telling him I suppose thank you for your input! :) I think today I am going to try and explain it better today to him I think You can always send him some links and have him read about it. In the past I have just asked friends to google it and they do some research and come back to me with a better understanding. I rarely confront my friends directly about it because I suggest they learn on their own - since they are mostly good people they understand right away what accommodations are needed. ", "Sent to mental hospital once for a misophonia meltdown - parents still ignore me I honestly do not even feel like ranting. I am at a loss of words and I am just so tired. but I should say that the psychatrist, therapists.... assistants? at the mental hospital kept treating my case of misophonia like schizophrenia even though I insisted it was not and thought I was having some sort of stress-induced psychotic episode. I hated being there and there was no trigger sounds anywhere so they let me go pretty quick but because of that my parents think... there is nothing wrong with my brain and I was indeed just being dramatic.\n\nDoes anyone have any effective ideas on how to tell them about how real my misophonia is? \n\nand if they take it the wrong way or label me as being dramatic and \"spoiled brat who complains too much\" (not only about this but I am a picky eater for obvious reasons :s) they are likely to just kick me out... I would have nowhere to go... is it worth it?\n\nIs there a way I can go get a diagnosis? Like.. for cheap? Any advice appreciated I am so sorry you are dealing with this. \u2764 It might help to show them resources online instead of just speaking from your own experiences. If you could show them articles and studies done on misophonia it could help. Or show them other people who suffer from it. If they are likely to kick you out, you need to come to some personal determination to separate yourself from them. They are not being good parents. You do not owe them anything, especially if they are not capable of extending to you the bare minimum of empathy that qualifies us as human.\n\nUnfortunately there is no easy route to being diagnosed, and cheap medicine is not a thing in America.\n\nWhat are your trigger sounds? Chewing, smacking, a lot of other mouth sounds (which they make a lot of when they talk), whispering (which they do alot for some reason, especially in the morning), and door slamming but that rarely happens so all I really ask them to do is to stop eating or making mouth noises when I go out of my room (which is usually only for food, sometimes can take a while to prepare) and I live in a big family so there is always someone eating or drinking. They ALL eat with their mouth open, even the little kids. Sometimes they walk in my room and make weird mouth sounds and literally SEE ME twitching and fidgeting and dismiss it. When my mom pops gum and I can hear it through the wall, last time I asked her to stop she started yelling at me very viciously which is weird because she is usually so calm and gentle otherwise but when I ask her to stop making a noise she get's so angry.\n\nI have had a personal determination to seperate myself from them for a while. I just do not have.. shit. No job no car no friends no nothing. so if I am to be kicked out my best bet is a homeless shelter, I guess. I cannot give you any tangible financial advice, but general ideas. A cheap motorcycle or scooter is a good investment. FAFSA grants can get you into a community college, and I knew more than one person going to school from a tent. College is a good place to make friends and find cohabitation. So are clubs, like fencing or cosplay or chess or whatever. When you have no tangible resources, people are your best bet, develop relationships. You will run into your triggers wherever you go, though. But not everybody is so callous, there *are* people out there who get it, who are capable of getting it with healthy communication, and who already get it because they live it themselves.\n\nYour parents sound like they have problems that you will never be able to make them confront. I do not know what it is about being asked to not make loud noises (in general) that makes people take such offense, but I have found it to be unfortunately commonplace. This is a society of narcissism, that is what I think it really comes down to. Making mouth noises freely is a really weird expectation people have. In my experience, people who chew with their mouths open are too self-centered or too oblivious to work with. It is not worth the fight.\n\nA practical option for you in the immediate moment is to get some noise-cancelling earbuds or headphones. In my experience this disorder comes with a benefit: heightened sense for detail in sound. Sound is beautiful, sound has shape and color. I think its why certain sounds are painful to us, we have a heightened experience of this sense that is not available to most people. Maybe you could put them in touch with this source at Duke University \n\n\n\nDuke University has been doing active research on misophonia for years now and perhaps there are medical doctors there they can get in touch with to explain your situation and that it is not psychosomatic. another example of a broken system.", "I have misophonia and my brother has tourettes. This is something I have been dealing with since many years, but only recently I have talked to my parents about misophonia, so this is really the first time I am talking about my brothers tourettes like this. \n\nA little backstory, so my brother is three years older than me and during our childhood he was diagnosed with tourettes. His tics were mainly nasal sounds and sometimes really aggressive behavior. Luckily during puberty his tourettes got very mild. The only thing that stayed were his nasal sounds. I do not know exactly how to describe them, but it is like sniffling every few seconds.\nOver the years I have gotten used to it and block these sounds out most of the time. But over the holidays, when he was home, he started to clear his throat constantly. Even he suspects it to be a new tic.\nBoth of these sounds trigger my misophonia heavily. Family dinners around the holidays were extremely stressful and I just feel extremely bad.\nI know my brother cannot do anything about it. I know very much that he cannot stop or suppress it. But I do not know how to deal with it.\nMy brother does not know about my misophonia and I am scared that if I talk to him about it, he will think I am being inconsiderate. And I also do not think he will take me very seriously and just say I am being sensitive.\nI do not know what to do because I know that neither his tics, my misophonia or family dinners will stop. So I am just stuck like this. Your misophonia is as real as your brother\u2019s Tourette\u2019s. You know that. I think you should discuss it with your brother. It is very possible your brother will be empathetic towards you. And if not, at least you tried.\n\nIt sounds like you are giving your brother allowances that you will not give yourself. \n\nIn any case, I wish you well! Check my last post in misophonia subreddit.\n\nAs in family dinners you do not need to focus on anything or do not do something that requires quite place, that tip might help you.\n\nAfter writing on a paper that the noises do not bother you.\n\nIt might help. Those types of sounds are annoying and grating to people without misophonia too. I get he cannot control it but he cannot really expect people to be happy to have to listen to that. It sounds like everyone needs sympathy in this situation.", "Recently moved into an apartment. And I am going bananas. So many loud stair stomps because people cannot walk normally up or down the stairs for some reason. So many scratchy sounding bumps on my bedroom wall. So many idiots letting their apartment door slam shut behind them. WTF are people even doing that touches a wall anyway.  I have got to the point where I have screamed \"shut the fuck up\" and some other profanities as loud as I could a few times. I was in my own apartment so I dunno if anyone heard it, but still. Thanks for reading my rant. \ud83d\ude35 ear plugs or headphones and white noise works wonders, also I have found figuring out the source of the noise helps me. Like the touching of the walls is probably peoples belongings bumping against it as they go up the stairs. You are very much not alone! I moved into my apartment a few months ago and love how quiet it is... until someone decides to fuck it up.\n\nWhen I first moved in, I was having all kinds of rage fits because when the people above me play music, all I get is their repetitive bass coming down on me. I have had many \"shut the fuck up\"s in the 3 and a half months I have been there. \n\nA couple of people and their dog just moved into an empty unit on my level.  I have never seen them but I can hear them clearly. They seem to be the only residents who cannot enter or exit their front door without alerting the entire freaking building that they are in the hallway. No one else has a problem closing the door and walking away! I prefer brown noise. I play it literally all day long from my Alexa device. I do not even realize it is playing. Same, OP. Someday I will move away from others and be freed of other's noises. Until then,  I will be listening to plenty of my own music in noise-cancelling headphones, using earplugs, and playing white noise.", "Earbud recommendations?

I cannot tell if I have misophonia or I just get annoyed very easily. It is been very amplified recently, as I moved in with a roommate a few months ago and I am experiencing extreme annoyance/anger in response to noises she makes. This includes scraping plates/bowls with metal utensils, scraping utensils on her teeth, sniffling, clearing her throat, chewing, dragging her feet on the floor, typing on her keyboard, slamming drawers, etc. This also applies in the presence of other people, but I think its worse with a roommate because I grew up with my own bedroom and was not subjected to these noises constantly. What confuses me, however, is that I listen to and enjoy ASMR, including videos like mukbangs. Chewing and whispering do not affect me when I am watching ASMR videos, but they drive me insane when I hear them in real life. Does it sound like I have misophonia, or am I just annoyed by some sounds? I have had a number of other roommates in the past but nobody has ever annoyed me this much, but they also have not been as noisy as this one.", "My misophonia is driving me insane. I cannot live like this ", "i am a n g r y i just wanted to relax and watch twitch BUT NO &amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was just watching a pretty popular streamer play some among us, AND LOW AND BEHOLD this one girl in the vc with him just makes this smacking sound with her mouth when she talks. I LEAVE. I LEAAAVE\n\nI JUST WANTED TO WATCH SOME TWITCH  WHYYY whyy I have seen some that eat with microphone on omg (not tryna be sexist) It seems like girls usually lip smack (when talking) more than boys do, idk why... i have noticed this too, especially while scrolling through tiktok. wonder why I have noticed that as well  I have had to turn off streams and lets plays because of that too :( I am a big Game Grumps fan, but when Arin is eating or drinking something I cannot be there.\n\nI had a professor this semester that made mouth smacking noises at LEAST every 5 words. I could not get through a single lecture. It made the class ridiculously hard but I just could not stand it. Omg, the episodes where they purposefully eat and make mouth sounds into the microphone? The WORST.\n\nAlthough I am sure they do not know what misophonia is so they are just trying to be funny and not purposefully make people upset, but still, shivers down my spine This is totally true and it is one of the reasons I do not have a girlfriend, not even joking.", "The next person to suggest I listen to ASMR is going to get cussed like a rubber skillet. I do not get how 'I have problems with mouth sounds' magically turns into 'Hey, why do not you send me material that basically has ever sound I cannot stand in it?'. I have had no less than four different people think that ASMR can somehow 'help' me. All it does is make my skin crawl and make me angry. One of said people even told me to keep listening to it. I had to explain very carefully that such a thing would be more likely to make it worse than help to cure it. Then she got an attitude. I would honestly prefer to have someone snapping gum and not knowing there was an issue than knowing there was an issue and suggesting something this tone-deaf. Who tf are you talking to? Just delete them from your life, they are stupid. These are friends of mine, people I care about. I find it more effective to just sit down with someone and talk it out. Well it seems like they do not care enough about understanding your problems since they are only repeating themselves and trying to convince you that ASMR will help you. That does not seem like friends to me. Again, they are stupid. I am honestly telling you that you need better friends. People do not ditch close friends like that. Like Pythia said, ghosting someone is not nearly as effective, and in my opinion, is a complete dick move. I maintain agency of what friendships I choose to retain. Three out of the four of these friends of mine were able to hear me when we had a focused discussion about this issue. One of them, especially, there is a negative-integer chance of me shoving them off. They are pretty stubborn, and there are things we argue about, but we will not part ways despite that.\n\nI spoke of *one* situation where there were problems. One. There is much more good about these friends of mine than there is bad. With situations like this one, I use something that carries me through when a trigger happens and I cannot immediately get away from it: Dialectical Behavior Therapy. I also said 'cuss out', not 'cut off'.   \n\n\nYou have a right to respond that way if someone does something similar; this is not about me trying to make you wrong. My choice is communication. The simple fact is that, despite it being a weird way to go about it, they do care and they do want me to heal. Not everyone is out to be a shitlord. Well you can keep somebody close and still be immensely suffering from it. Therefore ghosting somebody is very effective, even tho you consider it a dick move. You got to keep yourself mentally well first, then you take care of others, because you are with yourself for your whole life. Once you cannot handle the suffering anymore, your life becomes an avalanche. \n\nYou can think w/e you want, Pythia can do w/e she wants with these people. I left a piece of advice for her with an intention to help her. If she did indeed decide to leave them, these people would either finnaly understand what she is been going through thanks to her misophonia, or they would accept it and move on, which would mean they were not real friends in the first place and they in fact did not even care about her. \n\nAnd also people do not ditch close friends like that for multiple reasons. They can falsely believe they are close, or they are afraid they would become and stay lonely. Also people are way too often worried about what others might think of them. People are damn pussies in doing what is the best for them, because they would rather lie to themselves with false security they find in bad friends compared to being alone for a while and in a search for actual good friends. People's brains are very underdeveloped when it comes to getting rid of other people, because they are still evolved for tribal lives. \n\nI am preaching to be a complete psychopath and not care about anyone, but goddamit when somebody makes you uncomfortable, then do not be a pussy and make them feel it. Nobody owes anyone tolerating their incompetence at understanding their problems, especially not when well explained, which I believe Pythia did provide to her socalled friends. I pulled a copy of... whatever this is supposed to be into Notepad. When someone goes off on a rant, I will often go line-by-line and deconstruct what they are saying. However, after a look through posts you have made in general, I find you to be suffocatingly negative and have decided not to waste pixels on you.\n\nYou only too obviously have no concept of what it means to be friends with someone. You seek to project your negativity onto other people\u2014there is nothing you have surmised as my motivation that is anything close to what is happening with me and with my friendships. (See above about the fact that you do not seem to grasp what 'friendship' means.)\n\nI do not cut people off like that. The only person I did cut loose, this was only part of a pattern of behavior. The other three people read the links I sent them and made sure I knew that I had been heard. In each case, it took one solid discussion and some information and all has been well since.\n\nTl;dr: you do not know them, you do not know me, and you are a lousy mind-reader. First of all: Ok stalker. \n\nSecondly: All see nowdays are people talking about *negativity* like it is something bad. What you all confuse it with is rather hedonism. You bathe in *positivity* and point it out on others who do not do that and never ask what they are doing. People take anything slightly unpleasant and call it *negativity*. That is a sheep behaviour and nobody questions it. You got to understand nothing is 100% bad/good, or positive/negative, then you get right to talk about that. \n\nThirldy: If you do not even consider my advice, then I dunno, keep ranting on reddit or smth, I am sure that is very positive w/e that means to you or anyone. \n\nFourthly: You call me a lousy mind-reader with that closed sheepy mind. Pff. First of all: Okay, person that does not understand that if they post something publicly, people can and will read it\u2014that is how social media works.\n\nSecond of all: Wallowing in negativity is not good socially, nor is it good for your mental health, whether you choose to recognize it or not. And... sheep? Nope. If you knew the rest of the picture with me, you would choose other petty insults. When I say 'negativity', I am not talking about an internet slapfight or two. I am talking about a pattern of behavior that is not something I choose to immerse in. Your very use of the word 'sheep' proves me to be right. I have plenty of plain-spoken friends, one of whom is completely and diametrically opposed to my politics and my views on gender. But there is far more to them than merely those things. And that is just one example. You, on the other hand, are a pustule of rudeness and ***negativity,*** and I have neither the time nor the patience for people like you.\n\nThird of all: Did you happen to notice that this sub has a flair for Venting? I am allowed to use it and to... *vent.* No like, no read.\n\nFourthly: Then stop projecting your lousy world view into people. *You* are the one with the narrow mind. Also, cynicism is not a symbol of maturity. It is the opposite.\n\nFifthly: I am done with you. As I said, I do not have the time or the patience. Ah, the classic ad hominem argument. An angry rant about how terrible a person is is not the way to win an argument. Every single word you type is making you look more and more ridiculous. Right? Pretty quick to call me a 'sheep' just because I have had therapy and choose to *use* what I have learned. I suppose I can be happy with the fact that it is made it easier for me to experience less distress overall. And also not to be a bitter little cynical pill. Maybe in your eyes. I will not respon anymore because you are immensely ridiculous in my eyes, since you cannot even understand what I say or even what you say, because you were saying the very same you areaccusing me of. You will not respond anymore because you are wrong. You showed your ass and got called on it. You are immensely contemptible in my eyes. You could not deal with the results of what you posted, so you are using the same tired old techniques of ad hominem and flouncing.\n\nDo not let the door hit you in the backside. I actually like ASMR, but I am very very picky in what ASMR I choose to listen to.\n\nI very much dislike whispering, too many S sounds. I most prefer when people talk normally but have a nice voice that is naturally relaxing. I prefer to listen to people who have accents like Chinese, Indian, or Central American accents for example. I do not care much for the sound of European or American accents. If I do not like how their voice sounds or I am just not in the mood I then listen to ASMR with no talking.\n\nI do not like tapping, stroking, squishing, eating (*especially* eating), heavy breathing, buzzing, and clackity nails sounds. Any sound I hear has to have a purpose to it other than to make noise. Like I like listening to the sounds of people organizing their makeup drawer for example because I know each little clink is something being put satisfactorily in its place. I can tolerate some pointless noises but I can only tolerate so much until it becomes too repetitive for me. I usually like to listen to unintentional ASMR for this reason, which basically means videos that have ASMR elements, but were not made for the purpose of being ASMR (example include spray paint art, lego assembly videos, unboxing videos, repair/restoration channels, etc).\n\nI know you probably do not want any suggestions, but if it sounds like anything I have mentioned might also be enjoyable to you I can give you some channel/video suggestions. I understand if you do not though as not everyone is capable of experiencing ASMR and among those who do, not everyone is tastes line up.", "TW: Question About Triggers. If you are susceptible to acquiring new triggers from hearing about them, use caution. I am triggered by literally any sound that comes from another room. Sometimes the same sound triggers me if in the room with me, but, without fail, if I can hear it from another room, it triggers me. Is this normal for misophonia, or is it perhaps a bigger sensory issue?\n\nExamples would be footsteps, talking, dishes, chairs being pushed around, cups sat down, really just any sound of movement... dogs making any sort of noise, playing/barking, their toenails on the floor.\n\nI am just trying to figure out if it is related to miso or if I am just hypersensitive in general. I feel the same way and idk if it is misophonia but it is definitely anxiety. I am the exact same!  I cannot stand noises from another room, especially people talking and the TV. \n\nI am very sensitive in other areas as well so I honestly do not know whether its related to misophonia either, although I would also like to know. Audio (music, TV) through walls... I cannot stand it", "Despite me talking to the therapist about how my dad's behaviour is wrong and how he is taking away my one coping strategy, he still continues to be a shithead and take away my headphones. I cannot do this. It seems no matter how much I try or complain to the professionals about how my dad's behaviour is wrong he still chooses to wilfully ignore me and them too in the belief that he is getting me more independent, when in fact he is doing the opposite.\n\nThis guy is delusional, he wilfully ignores mental health professionals, never listens to my plight no matter how many times I try, I do not think hew ill even listen to me if I start breaking down crying. I feel like a sitting duck. Wow I cannot imagine going through such a thing due to one persons ignorance. What an asshole. I am so sorry. That is awful. I used to have a similar problem with my dad not understanding that misophonia is a real thing. I wish there was a way to make non-sufferers understand the magnitude of our triggers. I am hoping you have other supportive people in your home that can perhaps advocate for you, I have found that sometimes when it comes from someone without misophonia, people that think it is silly might take it a little more serious. \n\nWishing you the best. &lt;3 Problem is nobody else will vouch for me because they are in on it. And I cannot go into the house because that would be trigger suicide for me. Sorry to hear that. Did your therapist tell your Dad you should be able to wear your headphones? That is so fucked... I am sorry you are dealing with that level of ignorance. \n\nAre they taking your headphones because it is headphones (I guess I am asking if it is sorta like \u201cI am taking your phone away so you will learn\u201d) or is it solely to take away your coping mechanism? \nThe only thing I can think of is those orange earplugs you can stick in your ear, they are usually pretty affordable, I use those to drown out the leaf blowers they use every single day around here. \n\n&lt;3 Time to move out", "Undiagnosed Misophonia I have never really reached out or looked deeply into Misophonia but I have been experiencing extreme discomfort and emotional responses to sounds since I was a child. The most upsetting sounds to me come from people chewing, gulping, and slurping. My mother used to mock me about it and embarrass me over it because she loves to chew gum. I used to have the hardest time in school because the alphabetical seating arrangement always had me seated in front of a girl who would always smack and chew gum behind me. I suffered through it because I was too afraid of being mocked for saying anything. My family is the worst about eating loudly, to the point other people without Misophonia have mentioned it to me. Most of my life has been spent with me missing out because the only way I could tolerate being around my family was to try and damage my hearing with loud music or just leave and eat my food alone, fat away from the table. I am now approaching 29 and i still live at home because of financial reasons, but I still have to basically confine myself to my room at all times. Last night things came to a head when I was trying to have dinner with the family as my sister is in for her birthday, I immediately could not hold back from making a remark about how loudly they gulp their drinks and I got yelled at for it being a \"me problem that i make an everyone else problem\". I tried to calm down and explain Misophonia is an actual condition and though Im not diagnosed I feel it is explains alot for me. My sister just told me to get therapy and they shunned me for the rest of the night. I do not have insurance and I cannot even afford proper treatment for a condition i have with my eyes so that I can see normally and they think I can just go to a therapist at will. Today I was just sitting at the table drinking coffee while everyone slept. I dont know how to convey how much I just want to sit at an actual table sometimes and I can explain my room is under ground with no windows, so sometimes I just long to be near day light. My sister came down and immediately started eating food loudly across from me so I retreated back to my hole. My emotional response was just haywire as i started crying and beating my own head and face. I tried calming down the self mutilation response by flicking a hair band into my arm repeatedly but that only resulted in the hair band breaking and making my emotional response that much more volitial. Im sure my response today is just a breaking point of years of trying to get my family to just bd considerate of me (for example they still do not knock before entering my room or think of my feelings when it comes to leaving me out of pretty much everything they do together). My mother even works with special needs children and knows how to care for those with Sensory Processing Disorders but for some reason I am just a selfish problem child. I am more or less venting here because I have never spoken out about this and the self harm concerns me. I try to meditate and do yoga already and I have had a cat for 7 years now so the licking noises are annoying but I have learned to calmly react to it by letting him out or distracting him with toys if the sound becomes over whelming. I am just at a loss for what I should do from here on out. I am not properly diagnosed either. I do not need a doctor to tell me I am 'crazy' and cannot deal with my shit, lol.\n\nI also have a problem with 'mouth-noises' (mostly auditory but I think it can sometimes be psychodynamic when I visually see it but do not hear so my brain inserts the expected noise). Eating was the main one when it manifested in late middle school. My parents thought I was being overly sensitive and tried to tell me to get used to it because I did not live alone. They started realizing how bad it was when I become a sobbing mess in the middle of meals. They still did not know what was going on but they still partially thought I was just being overly sensitive.\n\nIt was not until my dad heard on the radio about a Misophonia Convention (I cannot imagine how this can be in anyway conductive when everyone is making people noises, lol). He had that \"oh, shit moment\" and when he got home, he and my mom apologized and said they really thought I was being 'crazy'. They did not know I was /literally/ crazy. Not their words, but it was the gist (ie we did not know it was a real problem). While they understand it more, it does not stop them from getting frustrated cause they sometimes just do not grasp that I /cannot/ just /deal/. It fucking sucks.\n\nI totally get just wanting to sit at the table with family and just eating or sitting down in your home and being able to focus on your book without every, little noise distracting/distracting from the mood. I totally get the self hatred and the self mutilation. I sometimes just hit my head against a wall or pull my hair as I sob and scream in emotional agony. Misophonia is just freaking frustrating sometimes... I hate how it literally triggers the fight or flight instincts and you just want lunge across the table sometimes and carve peoples' eyeballs out of their sockets or rip out their throats for 'daring to trigger you'. This, of course, does not help control the urge of commenting on their 'transgression'. /Total/ mood setter, lol.\n\nI will have to inform you that sadly, there is NO cure. NO true therapy. Only a \"Yep, your fucked up, have a nice day\" doctor's visit. Thankfully, research is being funded and people are looking into this. We now know more about it, thank God. Imagine having none of the knowledge we have now and thinking your crazy-crazy. Kind Of glad to not be perceived a hysterectomy... \ud83d\ude31\ud83e\udd22 The mere thought of it... *Shivers*\n\nJust try to find what works for you in copping. I use music during meals and occasionally putting in some ear plugs (on extreme occasions, my gamer headphones on top of them to cancel all noise). I have also just gotten into using this essential oil called Adaptive by Doterra. It works in helping to calm the fight or flight instinct, it truly does. It also helps to temper my ADHD the same way coffee can. Not a true medication but it is a good band-aid for the problem.\n\nHope this helps. :) Thank you so much. i literally broke down in tears reading your response because I truly have never spoken with anyone about my level of discomfort from what I know is a common everyday noise. I know my response is irrational but knowing people understand my inability to just control that response, its beyond valuable. \nI will definitely have to try that oil and thank you so much for sharing. Have you considered possibly showing them some of the informational videos on misophonia? I have thought about doing this with my mom, who also does not understand. They may still not care to help you, but they would not be able to mock you as it is now a recognized mental disability. Your most welcome. I wish I had this sort of support group when I first exhibited signs.\n\nTrue Story:\n\nMy ADHD has taken a nose these past few years and so the consecutive decision of the parental unit (and your's truly) that meds needed to be readded to the equation.\n\nSo I try the first batch of meds for 3 days.\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nMy already tenuous LV 11 issue was magnified by another 11 levels. \n\nI was off my rocker. My emotions were all over the place, I was hysterical, my hyper-focus became unbearable, and I could not deal with my shit at all. \n\nI legit was trying to do my hw and all the house noises, my brother making mac-n-cheese, and my lack of ability to reign my ADHD in to focus on simple thoughts caused me to go into a full blown catatonic melt down. Accidently ripping my textbook page was the last straw.\n\nI let a shrill screech of emotional pain and turmoil, ran out of the kitchen, sobbing, cursing, and manic. I ended up banging my head against the wall for a little bit (nothing to bruise, never have taken it that far yet) and then curled into a corner and cried.\n\nI ended up just staring into space after the crying was done and felt empty. Nothing suicidal but it was dark pit of despair.\n\nThe next executive decision was to take me off the trial meds 7 days early.\n\nWas NOT fun. I really do not know what to say, so I am just wishing for good luck for you I am so sorry your family is not willing to accept that it is a real condition and therefore will not try to avoid triggering you or even just show some support and understanding. I agree with other comments about showing your family some online resources explaining that it is real and how the condition affects people. \n\nThankfully my family is very understanding so they know I will always go eat my meals in my room alone. They are not loud eaters, it is just that even polite chewing drives me crazy too. As well as slurping, gulping, cutlery hitting dishware, and even breathing. All of those and many more things trigger complete black out rage within me. I sit in my room 98% of my life and I wear headphones or ear plugs constantly. They are lifesavers for me. I buy the foam 3M earplugs in bulk and keep them in the pockets of all my clothes and purse. Also I figured I would mention that white noise is an excellent thing to have on in the background as it helps drown out smaller noises. So having a fan going or a white noise machine helps. There is apps for it on smart phones as well. \n\nSorry for the wall of text-it is 2am here and I am sleepy. But I hope some of my words help. I have dealt with this stuff since I was a baby(my parents could not make any sounds or I would scream my head off) so I know exactly how hard it is to deal with. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or need some advice/tips. Good luck to you friend. Thank you so much, I will look into the ear plugs as well as the white noise apps. If nothing else it might help me be able to co exist until I can move out. Being able to discuss it openly and hear that others have similar experiences is helping so much. Thank you I may try this, I am just not sure how to approach it. Hopefully it works in your situation as well and you can receive some understanding from your mother. Here is hoping for both of us lol I hope those things help you at least cope better until you can leave as well. They have been my life saver on many occasions. I know how frustrating this condition is, and I cannot imagine living with people who are not supportive. It is already hard enough to deal with. I wish you luck and feel free to chat if you ever need to.\n\nEdit typo Ive got something that might help. Maybe 4 or 5 months ago my old headphones broke so I started looking for new wireless ones with noise cancelling. After actual hours of searching for cheap but good quality headphones I came across ( for $70 at the time. In the 4 to 5 months Ive had them I havent noticed any wear and tear on them, the battery life is really decent and charges pretty fast, the bluetooth works over a fairly large distance, the passive noise cancellation is good and the active noise cancellation is slightly better, and these headphones pretty easily have some of the highest sound quality Ive ever heard (kind of heavy in bass which I enjoy but you might not). I absolutely recommend them.

Almost every time I try to fall asleep, I hear a trigger noise so loud that it wakes me all the way up and starts echoing in my head and severely bothering me. The thing is, the noise is not actually occurring. It is so loud when I hear it- like it was real and right next to my ear- but half the time when I do it is either late at night when I am the only one awake and the other half of the time I am completely alone. Does anyone else experience this? I have actually had this happen to me before. It is hard to describe but I know exactly what you mean. It sounds really real and it also only happens in one ear with me as well. It only happened to me a couple of times and only when I was trying to sleep.\n\nI think it happens more when you are deprived of sleep. For me it started going away once I got more sleep, it only happened during a time where I would only get a couple of hours every other day. Yes I have that echoing too! Very frustrating, I wonder why our brain does that. Glad to not be alone no but since I was a kid I cannot go to sleep without some kind of radio on.. usually BBC world .. just in the background .. something for my brain to kind of focus on a bit.. Dono if that would help I am not sure if this is the same thing you are going through since I do not hear echoing, but I definitely hear a noise every once in a while that did not happen. \n Thank you for the resource, I had no idea this existed. I have been hearing \"phantom\" triggers since I moved. The place I am in now is pretty quiet, but sometimes, usually when I am half asleep, I will hear voices or what sounds like music (triggers at my old apartment) and it will wake me up. Then I realize I have moved, and I have my ear plugs in and the AC is on so there is no way I am hearing that. I think it is anxiety. My brain is on edge and anticipating triggers where there are none. \n\nFor me the noises are not very loud though.

The community in general is amazing, but if noise avoidance is what you are looking for i highly suggest you look for a place that is like WAY away from neighbors.  People mow their lawns almost CONSTANTLY.  It is almost like they have nothing else in their lives to do.  I live in a very suburban neighborhood. But there is like massive forested areas around me, just for reference.  I live on a 1 acre plot with tons of trees.  I thought i would have quiet.  I do not. Good point. Moving to suburbs or the countryside absolutely does not guarantee quiet. Gas engines are everywhere in our society.", "Finding Overlap Between Misophonia and ASMR - Research Hello friends! If you are over the age of 18, your participation is requested for a study investigating the relationship between trigger noises as they relate to the presence of clinically significant misophonia and the experience of ASMR. \n\nIf these phenomena are related, it is hoped that more information can be instrumental in identifying desensitization targets and new avenues for treatment. The study consists of a short survey which should take between 7 and 14 minutes to complete. More detailed information is available in the consent form that appears prior to the study. If you complete the survey and choose to provide an email address, you will be given a summary of the results following analysis and approval for publication purposes. Please let me know if you have any questions and ( bruh why 18 There is already a study that compares misophonia and ASMR. Its just a study tho, but just wanted to put that out there. Dont have the citation on me Yeah For some reason the link is not loading for me, but I am curious what the overlap is and what the study is trying to expose? Reason I ask is that I cannot sit for more than 10 seconds without feeling intense rage while watching any ASMR video. Does anyone else with misophonia feel like this too? As far as I am aware it is a legal issue. Minors might need parental approval and that can just be too complicated to mess with. nah man I use that shit to sleep you get a tingle down your whole ass body it is crazy oh well I just been pissed about all these studies being 18 when there is bitches 15 and below sending nudes around schools all the time and some legal guys think this kind of shit is where their time's best spent?

It can, understandably, be really hard for people to understand misophonia who have not experienced it. What do you tell your loved ones to help them better understand it?  I do not feel like enough is understood about it at this time. I do not tell people I have it because either people do not get it, or I have just pointed out a weakness they can use. It seems to me a lot of people will go out of their way to be annoying if you call attention to the behavior. They think it is funny. If it comes up or gets noticed in situations where I am not sure how it will be received, I generally just say I have sensory problems, or that I cannot filter noise well (a bit like having hearing aids in a place with lots of background noise) and get overwhelmed by it. This is what I told my boss, and, she is been very tolerant (helped by the fact that she has hearing aids herself).\n\nIn situations where I know or trust someone a lot, I give them the full rundown of how this works. I have had people not really understand the severity or that it cannot be controlled, but in general no actively negative responses. \n\n I once told a friend that I have an aversion to certain sounds, and they responded by getting up in my face and producing those noises to try and elicit a response. Due to that, I make sure to stress the amount of discomfort it causes me to those who I do tell, and I have found that my family do try and make sure that I am catered to (eg: radio on at mealtimes and so on and so forth)\n\nBut yeah, I usually do not try and make it too obvious that I have it; as u/floofyragdollcat pointed out, some people seem to think it is funny to try and evoke an emotional response.  &gt; I once told a friend that I have an aversion to certain sounds, and they  responded by getting up in my face and producing those noises to try  and elicit a response. \n\nEvery time. That Is why the answer to \"how do you tell people\" is usually \"I do not\". People do not know about miso and have a tough time understanding.\n\nAnd then you get situations where people realize there is something up with you, and they think you are a weirdo. \n\n&amp;#x200B; Yeah, before they realised that misophonia was actually a thing, my parents used to get really angry at me for showing signs of discomfort. It made me dread caravan holidays simply because of the relatively cramped conditions, and the fact that no-one had an ounce of sympathy. I have told my family that trigger sounds activate my fight or flight response.  I told my closest friends when we were already having a sensitive discussion on mental health. The mood was tolerant enough that they instantly knew to be supportive when I told them that talking about this is very scary and I really need them to not ask about (or produce) triggers. The key is to be sure that you can trust the people to be mindfull and carefull in the situation. Know your moment! :)  Whoa good advice! I have felt the need to entirely explain my misophonia but in the terrible fear that some people will start producing triggers to test if Im telling the truth. Only mentioning sensory problems solves this issue for me! Thanks! It is really a drag when you tell people and their first reaction is to try to trigger you, as if you have not heard that lame humor attempt 486,191 times already.\n\nLately I have been trying to come up with an analogy, along the lines of \"that is like shining a strobe light in the eyes of somebody with epilepsy,\" but that seems a little too much.", "Noise Cancelling Headphones Changed My Life My misophonia used to be pretty severe. I would now consider it mild to moderate mostly due to the impact of these headphones.\n\nI got my headphones (Bose QC 25s, for anyone wondering) as a Christmas gift from my grandma in 2016. I would been wanting them for a year or so.\n\nBefore the pandemic, I used them daily for like 8-12hrs at a time (or more). I use them pretty much whenever I am in public or I know my trigger noises will be happening a lot.\n\nThey literally made me able to go out in public and not have a panicky breakdown. They made it so I could sit through a college lecture and actually pay attention. I could finally work in public spaces! I could go out to dinner and not be constantly on guard and angry! I could sit at the dinner table!\n\nI do not really wear them at home, but because I am not exposed so much and constantly on guard my reactions are not as bad anymore.\n\nOf course they do not block everything and they have their downsides, but sometimes I think about how this one gift from someone who cared completely changed my life and I want to just sit down and cry.", "Do not mind me using yet another outdated meme format  \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Cannot retreat fast enough \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd72", "Misophonia Resources &amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is a comprehensive list of resources for coping, research, news and otherwise interesting misophonia content.

So I am pretty young, and while I have realized that little noises aggravate me more than they \u201cshould\u201d for quite some years now, I just learned about misophonia about a year or two ago. (I would like to add that I found this group today and have not read through everything so I apologize if someone has already posted something similar or if I go against guidelines.) I live with both my parents currently and stay at my sisters a lot as well. Of course, so many small noises bother me, whether it is knuckles cracking, sucking your teeth, people cleaning under their nails with their other nails (if that makes sense), drinking, chewing (open or closed mouths i can still constantly hear it), breathing, tapping, dripping, and literally any other noises you can think of at this point. However, I have come to realize my mom triggers me more than anything else. Like, I swear my ears have developed a way to hear any noises that come from her body no matter what other noises are going on around us &amp; no matter how far apart i try to get from her while still being in the same room. Is that something any of you experience as well? I truly have no idea what to do anymore, especially during quarantine, because I have tried many times to explain that I cannot help it, but she just yells at me and gets mad that \u201cI let the noises bother me so much\u201d. Having to deal with it even more than I usually do has made me have some horrible thoughts, as well as made me literally cry and have full blown break downs because there is nothing I can do. \n\n(I am not sure if this is supposed to be in the vent section, or if I am putting it in the correct place, or if I can ever post it at all, so please let me know &amp; I will fix any mistakes!) Hey! I am not too researched into the subject since I personally do not have too many problems with noises from family but I have heard that your triggers can be specific to family members or can be worse with a specific person! Feel free to correct me if I am wrong or missing but that is just what I have heard :) I definitely experience more triggers with my step dad. I think it is because he does more stuff, And so I have just naturally gone on high alert whenever I am around him. Its much more intense with him than with others. And he really does not ever seem to try to be conscious of himself. It is like an endless cycle. You understand me! I am not sure if it is cause she is the person I am probably around most or what, but it is forsure more intense with her as well. It is definitely an endless cycle, but I am glad I am not the only one who goes on high alert around certain people. Thank you!! :)) Thank you so much for your comment! Since you said you believe it is real (&amp; not something I have just developed in my head myself lol) I want to try &amp; find some more info on it and look for researches around it. I just wish there were more researches and test on this entire subject, along with more doctors and such who understand it and focus on it. :/ Again, thank you so much!! :) My husband is the source of 98% of my triggers. Unfortunately, he has Tourette\u2019s Syndrome and s chronic cough, so I am often going what feels like insane. Sniffing, coughing allllll day long, spitting noises, throat clearing, that noise people make in their nose to clear their sinuses, it is 24/7. I feel your pain. Mine is 100% my husband too, honestly I cannot even be in the same room as him if he is drinking a glass of water and he is extremely careful around me, supportive and aware of my triggers. It makes me feel like absolute shit Ugh, yes those noises are horrible, especially when people rub on their noses while sniffing!!! I praise you for making it work with your husband so well, I have a cousin with tourette\u2019s (trust me i know they cannot help it just like we cannot) &amp; i have had to find excuses to leave the room a few times when visiting because it builds up in me &amp; i feel so horrible when I do it because it is not their fault. I wish you two the best of luck though \ud83d\udc97 I feel you on that so much! I feel bad when I get triggered by things they cannot help. Like swallowing their drinks, ugh it bothers me so much (even if I can hear myself swallow sometimes) and I feel horrible when they cannot do anything about it. My mom does these weird burps so much, knowing it is a trigger for me &amp; does not try to do it in another room or do it with her mouth closed or anything, simply because my own burping does not bother me like hers does. She believes I just have a vendetta (i am not sure that is the right word but it is what came to mind) against her or something. You are lucky to have someone who is so supportive &amp; aware! Oh my goodness, reading your comment just took a weight off my chest. I have had misophonia for as long as I can remember, and I am engaged to someone with Tourette\u2019s. We have been together for 5 years and I have tried to learn the best ways to cope with it, but I have felt so guilty for being \u201cbothered\u201d by his Tourette\u2019s, like I should not be allowed to be triggered by it. It is a relief to know that there are people out there in similar situations! For me it is my brother. He is only eight so I feel really bad about it. He does not understand much, being a little kid, so he will intentionally trigger me all the time. Usually I just leave the room before it gets too bad. It is a rough combination, but as long as your fianc\u00e9 understands what miso is and knows you are not purposely being obtuse, you can make it work. He gets offended sometimes when i have an outburst like \u201coh my gosh!\u201d at the worst moments (the worst tic he has is a breathing one where he does not take a full breath while he is coughing and he sounds like he is gasping for a few seconds which makes me feel so PANICKED, like I know he is breathing ok but it makes my brain feel like I am suffocating somehow), but he does finally understand I am not angry at him in those moments\u2014it is miso. Exactly I think for me its my family as well, especially my mother. I cannot stand her breathing noise while she is sleeping, and also she does that weird thing with her mouth sometimes in which the sound and the view of it makes me tense up inside so much. Since I do not live at home anymore and only see them quite rarely it is actually really ok, and after many years they have kind of come around on me just being wired a bit differently so we can mostly work around it.\n\nI have a theory though why in my case my family triggers me disproportionately more than other people, but I am not quite sure: I initially thought that just the fact that someone is close to me seems to be making the triggers worse, but then I realized that the friends I am really close with do not trigger me at all (my ex also rarely did). I have realized that unfortunately I subconsciously push people in my life away from getting close to me that trigger me in some way, if it is something very obvious I do not even really build up a friendship to begin with. I love my family a lot but since I could not \"choose\" them the triggers are there and I need to deal with it. \n\nBut since some people here even seem to have married someone who triggers them a lot maybe that is just me (a lot of respect to those people btw, I can imagine that it is not easy). This will make me sound like a prick.  You are older and bigger than him, you could resort to bullying him if he eats like a pig. Reading your post means so much to me, it is actually insane reading it because it feels like you were describing exactly what I go through and I have never heard someone else with this issue before! I have some triggers that come from inanimate objects or random people, but the vast majority come from specific habits my family members have, and it seems like the most triggers come from the people I spend the most time with. This has been such a huge problem for me and caused so many arguments in my family of me reacting to my triggers like chewing or how my mom cleans her finger nails with her other ones and that clicking sound they make (kind of hard to explain but I think you know what I mean). It is so hard to deal with because I love my family and I do not want to criticize them when they are not trying to hurt me, but it is something I cannot control and it really hurts when they tell me to just ignore it, or that I am making it up for a reason to be mad at them. It is really awful how misophonia can negatively affect relationships with people you love. I am sorry to hear you have this problem too but at least we can relate to each other and work through this kind of stuff together. Thank god for the internet. First, I know exactly what you mean by the nail thing. My dad does it too and I just have to scream internally at this point. Second, I understand your difficulty with them saying those things, everytime I get the confidence to bring it up I just get told to ignore it, or \u201cdo not let it bother you so much\u201d. like I have a choice? Sometimes I cannot help but look in their direction or try to cover my ears or do things to distract myself from the noises, and then they get angry with me and yell just cause i am visibly expressing how it bothers me. Even when I try to hide it, yet they get mad if I bring it up too. There is truly no winning. But anyways, yesss Im so glad we have people to relate to, though I honestly would not wish misophonia on anyone. sadly, that child is a little demon. I mean I can totally beat him at wrestling but for some reason he is obsessed with kicking me in the face? And surprisingly it is super painful? Also I would get in trouble. Good advice though! My mom triggers me more than anyone! I cannot even eat dinner with her because of how she eats even just how she looks when she eats, which makes me feel bad because she always gets offended when I have to leave so I just stopped eating with her. No one else in the family\u2019s eating in particular bothers me MY GRANDPA. \nThere is no more annoying person in the entire existence!\nEating with his mouth open, coughing, sneezeing, snoring (his snoring is the worst one out of many people's I have heard) and even breathing with that soft squeaky sound at the end.\nWhen I had to sit in a car next to him for 2 hours I swear I was on a verge of tears.\nI love my grandpa and I know many of those sounds cannot be controlled because of his health and age but that is unbearable.", "I just learned that there is an actual name for what I suffer from, and while that is a small relief, I feel like I am slowly going insane and I feel like a burden to people around me. Hi, everyone. I have not been officially diagnosed with misophonia, but I know without a shadow of a doubt I have it. I have always been noise sensitive, even as a young kid. My triggers are frequency noises, or humming pitches. You would be surprised how many normal things make some sort of these noises! Our dishwasher makes an almost indiscernible high pitch frequency while it runs, during which I don a pair of noise cancelling headphones. Watching a movie in the living room is a chore sometimes, because depending on the cycle, the sound of the refrigerator running can send me into a god damn rage. \n\nMy husband, bless him, does not make me feel bad about my constant anxiety (\"do you hear that?\" \"HOW do you not hear that?\" \"Where is that sound coming from??\"). We were watching a movie recently and I had to pause the movie and spend 15 minutes searching for some high pitched noise coming from somewhere, until I realized it was coming from his PS4 that was left on, clear across the entire room. He was astonished I could hear it from THAT far away, over the volume of the movie. It is hard to explain exactly HOW I hear these noises, but it is just like my brain is tuned into them like a radio station. If they are happening, I can hear them. And while they are happening, that is ALL my brain can focus on. Cars driving down the street half a mile away? I can hear the hum of the engine, and lord help me if it happens while I am laying in bed. I cannot sleep anymore. Fans for white noise? I can hear the motor. The small, normal noise of even a fan running is enough to send me in a panic. Do you know how many fans I have purchased, because the previous one became too \"noisy?\" About 5. They are all in rotation, waiting for their turn when another one starts \"acting up.\" \n\nMost recently it is been our outdoor AC unit, which is installed RIGHT OUTSIDE OUR FUCKING BEDROOM WINDOW. What demented builder decided that was the best place to put something so noisy??? Something has happened recently where the metal fans are misaligned, and are creating a very subtle frequency that apparently no one can hear but me. After a week of sleeplessness, I broke down to my husband about it. He is not excited about the expense, but we have agreed to move the unit far enough away that I cannot hear it. A very expensive solution to an otherwise non-problem (he cannot even hear the noise I am talking about, but he believes me). I know it will just be some other noise down the line, but. Baby steps.\n\nHaving a shared office space at work has been the biggest struggle. One neighbor to the left of me hammers his enter key like he is punishing it for insulting his wife. clackclackclackclackclackBAM. clackclackclackclackBAM. The other neighbor to the right of me plays music on her computer, out loud, and hums out of tune and whistles. And okay, to be fair, the radio thing would probably bother anyone. But this is a vent post and I am just getting it all out of my system, lol. \n\nThis post does not have a point, but I am glad to have found this community. I have spent so many years feeling so alone and helpless. Like I was crazy. I am relieved to know there is a name for what has been driving me to madness my entire life, but at the same time, I am just so tired. I wish more than anything that noises did not bother me. I wish there was something I could do about it. Thanks for letting me vent, reddit. Feel you, thanks for posting. I can relate to so much of this. It is like I have hearing superpowers but nowhere near as fun as people might think. This sounds like hyperacusis Suffering from sounds is definitely easier to live with knowing you are not the only one.  And there is NOTHING better than a supportive partner or friends - cannot imagine how much this sucks for people stuck in families who lack empathy. \n\nI just wish either my therapist or psychologist did not give me a blank stare when I first brought up the condition.  It is amazing how common this seems to be with so little recognition, especially with health professionals. YES! Haha. Worst superpowers in the world. They are both very similar, so maybe. But the big distinction for me is that hyperacusis is usually associated with a painful response to noise, because people who have it perceive sounds as too loud. The noises that bother me are not too loud, my brain just picks them out and focuses on them. I have not been diagnosed with OCD either, but I am 99.99999% I also have that. I am going somewhere soon to hopefully get a diagnosis. Absolutely agree! I had no clue about this condition, and even then only managed to find it when I started to google very specific terms. Do you have any advice on bringing this up with a therapist/psychologist? I am making an appointment soon and I do not even know how to start. Have some research printed out or be ready to send them links to research on misophonia just in case they are clueless about it.  Hopefully they will be open minded and not annoyed or suspicious of the \"self diagnosis\".  \n\nI lead with \"Have you ever heard of misophonia\" - if they have, great, then it is pretty straightforward to ask for an evaluation to see if you suffer from it. I can totally relate to the feeling of slowly going mad. I am even seriously considering cutting contact with my family because they never take me seriously and they think I am just making a big fuss out of this condition. Thank goodness for supportive partners. That is fantastic advice, I will remember that for when I go. Thank you! I am so sorry to hear about your family. :( If you are close with them, maybe suggest a movie night and watch \"Quiet Please.\" It is an award winning documentary about misophonia, and from the reviews it looks like an interesting watch. And if you have Amazon Prime, it is free! \n\nMy husband and I are actually going to watch it tonight. He understands that I am having a hard time, but I do not think he really \"gets\" what is going on in my head. I am hoping it brings us even closer together, and maybe it can help with your family, too! That is a great idea. I have been hearing about \"Quiet Please\" a lot! My partner is the same; he completely understands that some noises trigger me, but he does not really get it, not having misophonia himself.\n\nYou mentioned somewhere about bringing this up with a therapist. During my intake session, I mentioned to mine that the sound of barking triggers a strong urge to flee the situation. She mentioned in a later session that she looked up the condition after our session. So it might be a good idea to describe your experience and thought process to them. I hope you find a good therapist who will not dismiss your feelings. Yes! I am so happy you have a supportive partner. \n\nAnd thank you so much for that advice! It is hard to really accurately describe how it makes me feel, but being in this subreddit is really helpful when it comes to articulating what is going on in my brain. I hope I find a good one too, fingers crossed! Welcome to the club! You are definitely not alone!!! Omg I totally relate to the humming frequency!! Cars and especially loud trucks drive me insane! Our old apartment had a loud refrigerator and I had to shut our bedroom door at night or wear ear plugs to cope and my husband thought I was crazy. You are not alone! I cannot ever sleep with the tv on because even if it is not playing anything I swear I can hear it buzzing. Absolutely relatable, especially the keyboard . Co-worker pounding those keys as if that will make the command react faster . My latest is hearing the tiny carbonation bubbles in their non stop action inside the coke can from across the room.

Today, I tried to muffle the noises at the dinner table using white noise + earphones. It managed to make me feel audibly comfortable, but I felt horrible after all. It is as if I was not really there \"living that moment\". Instead, it was the same thing as if I was eating alone or ignoring them.\n\nI cannot even eat with my family without being triggered and show that I am uncomfortable... How do you cope with that awful feeling?\n\nThanks for reading through here :) If you feel comfortable to do so, I would try explaining to your family why you wear the headphones in a gentle way. Something non-accusatory, that the regular sounds produced during a meal make you upset, and you do not want to be angry with them for their normal eating habits (even if they are not normal but obnoxiously loud instead... Unless you feel like confronting them about it). Tell them you are not ignoring them and that if they want to talk to you, they can tap you to get your attention, but that this is the best solution you know to make sure you are in the best mood possible towards them.\nBasically make them feel like you are doing it to protect them, if they are anything like my family, they would want to feel like it is something you do for them, not for yourself. \n\nTry these earplugs\u2014 It lowers background noise while still allowing you to hear people\u2019s voices and converse. It could be helpful! It is what I have been using", "Just a reminder that I know I could use  Hey, sorry if you have already seen this on the main misophonia subreddit.

So sorry they were turds about. Know that there is people out there that support you and understand what you are going through!! Reach out if you need anything.", "Fianc\u00e9s chewing triggering me Hey I am new to this subreddit! I have had misophonia since I was very young. When my fianc\u00e9 first moved in with me, no noises of hers bothered me, but then something changed and I do not know why. She knows I have this disorder, but I do not think she understands. I told her a noise she was doing was triggering the misophonia, but it is nothing against her (and I was not even asking her to stop) but she got down on herself and said the noise was gross and she should not be doing it anyway. I could tell she felt really bad. More recently, her chewing has started triggering me to the point I cannot be in the same room if there is no white noise or a show on YouTube. I have not told her because eating is something we have to do everyday and I do not want her to have to change the way she chews because of me. I do not want her to think I am lying either because I have told her that her chewing did not bother me in the past, but for some reason, it does now. DAE have any suggestions on how to move forward with this? I feel so stuck and I hate having this. It makes me feel like an asshole and a nag. But if I do not say anything, I suffer. I am sure you guys can relate. I recently had this conversation with my partner! It went something like, \u201cI love sharing meals with you, but my misophonia has shifted/gotten worse, and I need to have background noise set up before we start eating.\u201d\n\nYou can reaffirm that it is not about her\u2014 people make noise when they eat! it is very reasonable for those noises to happen!\u2014 but your needs when it comes to handling mouth sounds have shifted.\n\nIf meals are a big connection time for you, offering up another way to connect before or after a meal could be reassuring.\n\nUltimately, you know that this need is not about her doing something wrong, it is about having safe and comfortable space to be yourself\u2014 a person with misophonia who needs background/cover-up noise during meals. I always have the TV on and my partner knows he turns the TV on by himself already", "My sister will not stop eating crackers I am hiding in the bathroom but literally she just keeps eating them and it is so fucking loud. And I cannot say anything because in the past when I have said stuff she always makes fun of me and tells me I am overreacting or she will just give me a weird look. Or her boyfriend would think I am being mean or something. But I am also so so close to lashing out. which also would not go well. \n\nIm just so overstimulated and tired and I want to go home and hide under my covers rip :(", "I am very cautious with making certain sounds when I am the one that has misophonia. I just discovered a couple months ago (4-5) that I had misophonia. I did not tell anyone because I knew they would make an excuse for it or would simply not believe it. Misophonia is also not the most common thing to have so that makes it even more difficult to explain. \n\nAfter a while I decided to at least try to explain it to my mom since it had gotten worse. But like I expected she did not think it was real and thought it was all in my mind and that I could choose when to ignore it. ( I wish I could lol).  My sister said that I was just faking it.\n\ni am also really cautious with making those sounds myself because sometimes when i make certain sounds ( for example eating crunchy stuff ) they say something like : \" well if you do not like the sound then I do not either.\" or \" if you cant listen to those sounds, why are you making them.\"  they have only said it once or twice, but i am now really really cautious with the sounds i make  because i do not want someone to say that to me again. i also do not want to disturb them because I now the feeling of anxiety and anger that you get when hearing the sounds. I sometimes just want to grab something and shove it in my ear. ( I  hurt my throat today cuz i was trying to drink water without making a sound) \n\nI know im the one that is being irrational, and I do not  expect them to change just for me ,but they do not even try to understand what im going through. I mean they do not even believe it lol. THEY get irritated when I cannot stand a sound. It is very unfortunate how little understanding there is about misophonia honestly. I am at least happy to know im not he only one and that there are people that perfectly understand me... \\*sigh\\* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading \\^-\\^ I understand your rational completely. Personally, I always try to not be a hypocrite. I try not to do things I ask others not to do. But close friends, sometimes even friends I just made will tell me not to worry about it. That it is not hypocritical, and they do not mind if I do some things they cannot around me. So I feel it is important to keep telling people about it. Find those people who are understanding. You will be surprised how many there really is. Exactly, I do not want to be selfish and tell people not to do something when I do it myself. I am also not the person that wants everyone to know everything about me,( I am kind of a \"closed\" person and I also do not share emotions and stuff like that). I only mentioned it once very lightly to my best friend, but she just answered that it also annoyed her. So I knew no one was truly going to understand it unless they had it. Glad that you understand me and I am very happy for you that you have people around you that know and accept this.

Report her to the police, she is disturbing the peace.", "Noisy life in the US If you live in the US in any town or city, step outside and see how long you can go without hearing the roar of a muscle car, big truck, or motorcycle. In my city I cannot go more than 20-30 seconds without hearing one. That is my trigger and it is making me hate living in the US and the whole culture around motor vehicles = freedom. I cannot even be in my house without headphones because houses here are built with zero noise abatement, so all that noise comes right in. Not to mention my partner says it is like living with a deaf person because I cannot hear voices over the music playing in my headphones. I have lived in other countries where car culture was much smaller and it was much quieter. I wish moving abroad and uprooting yourself did not have to feel like such a huge task because I would already have done it. Low key looking forward to death someday and never having to hear another harley or ford mustang... I moved (back) to the country recently for this reason and unfortunately the traffic noise is just as bad here, somehow. I looked at aerial maps and chose a house with nearly 7 wooded acres on a dead-end road in a very forested area of the most forested state in the country, and I hear semi trucks and motorcycles and ATVs all fucking day long. The triggers themselves are bad enough but it is also been really painful to accept this reality when I had hoped things would be different here. There really is no escape from it because car culture is so ingrained in the culture. Having traffic/engine noise as a trigger is like having the sound of your own walking as a trigger, you are just forced to deal with it all day, everyday. The thought that I picked the \"wrong place\" haunts me, then I spiral down this rabbit hole of, it is the best I could have done. Other locations would have been the same. And that makes one part of me feel kind of better \u2014 like I did not waste my entire savings and lock myself into the wrong choice when I could have been living trigger-free by now. This mythical \"right place\" very likely does not exist. But that makes another part of me feel extremely depressed \u2014 like there is literally no escape. So \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Your property selection is not at fault. There is just no quiet place in the country. It is just a different kind of motor vehicle making noise in the countryside. :(", "Does hearing a trigger bring on violent thoughts? Or do I just have anger issues? I am not condoning violence, and I am not encouraging it either. These are just things that have happened in the past because of misophonia. Hopefully this does not get removed. (Basically a vent post because I do not know what to do anymore). Please no harsh comments or threats against me, it does not help things at all. Thanks. This post may get a bit intense, if you are sensitive to certain things then maybe do not read. \n\nHearing certain triggers for too long makes me incredibly angry. I have posted here before about my triggers, basically the main ones are barking and babies crying but bird noises and mouth sounds also bother me. \n\nUsually I will develop a panic attack after awhile, but sometimes I just turn into full on anger and want to OBLITERATE whatever is making the sound. If it is someone making weird mouth noises then I almost want to scream at them to stop. \n\nIf it is animal noises, then I become even more enraged. A few years ago I fed my mom\u2019s pet bird to one of her cats because it was so noisy and my brain was actually beginning to shut down. It felt like I was not myself anymore. Her and my dad were really pissed. I told her for months on end how the bird\u2019s constant screaming and squawking was putting me in a 24/7 cycle of distress and depression because I always had to listen to it. She did not care. She knew about my hearing issues before she bought the bird, and she still bought it regardless. She knew full well how loud birds are and how it affects me. \n\nOne day I just snapped and that was it. When she found out the cat ate it because of me she was yelling for awhile after that and finally just said \u201cI do not understand you.\u201d \n\nMy boyfriend at the time broke up with me because he said he was scared of what I did. Said some shit about how psychopaths murder small animals before moving on to humans. Oh great! Now I scare people apparently AND I am a psychopath on my way to becoming a serial killer. LMAO. Except, what he did not realize was that I did not kill the animal out of pleasure, I did it out of rage and frustration. I do not fucking sit here and torture animals for fun. I had no intention of torturing that bird to death. It died instantly. \n\nThere was also a time where my mom\u2019s cat was sitting in the hallway meowing loudly for no reason, constantly. I got so angry and fed up (meowing triggers me) that I grabbed the cat by the shoulders really hard and threw it outside. I did not realize in my rage how hard I grabbed it until it started meowing as if it were crying for help and that it was hurt. I instantly started crying really badly and ran into my room. I felt bad and just wanted to end myself because I could not deal with life anymore. I tried overdosing that day on some painkillers but my mom would not give them to me. She was worried. I just sat in my room and cried. \n\nThere are a number of other instances that happened which I will not say here. \n\nOver the years I have tried to cope, but it has not gotten much better. The next boyfriend broke up with me as well because he could not deal with me anymore. My anxiety and hearing issues ruined the relationship. We were also being emotionally abusive towards eachother. It was a rough break up. It did not really affect him, but I was left to figure it out on my own since I had next to no support during the whole thing. Took me over a year to actually begin to get over it. I do not date anymore or make close friends since no one can really tolerate it once they actually get to know me. I also just cannot do a lot of basic everyday things because of my triggers, so even if I did have friends irl I would not be able to do anything with them. \n\nIt is really hard because people like me and think I am friendly, but I cannot explain my misophonia since I am embarrassed by it. I also fear of being judged for things I have done in the past. I do not have anyone to talk to besides a couple of online friends, but I do not want to scare them away. I live alone, I work alone, I do not hang out with anyone or go anywhere irl. It is a lonely life. \n\nAm I the only one that gets this aggressive when hearing triggers? I know a lot of people get extremely angry when it comes to mouth noises, but for me it is more so with other triggers. \n\nThis is all just so damn frustrating and it is ruining my entire fucking life. I feel like an empty shell of a person most days because the constant sense of hopelessness of never being normal is always lingering in the back of my mind. I envy people who can go out and do normal people things everyday. I cannot even go to the damn grocery store or go for a walk without having constant anxiety and sometimes even full blown panic attacks. I just stay indoors constantly, playing instruments and video games because I do not know what else to do. You are disgusting try reading the entire post before commenting lmfao\n\nalso, I hope you know that telling someone they are disgusting over the internet literally helps nothing. I hope you know killing a bird or hurting any animal is fucking disgraceful.\n\nPsychopath. I honestly cannot tell if you are trolling or not Definitely 100% not trolling.\n\nDo you think it is ok to hurt and kill animals?\n\nI am here for the same reasons as you, noise bothers me a lot.\n\nI understand you get mad and I do too, but I would never ever in a million years feed a bird to a cat, that is just insane.\n\nI am sorry but it is just not right. Did you read my entire post? Did you read the part where I explicitly said I did not find pleasure in killing the bird?\n\nDo you think you are some sort of hero by calling me \u201cdisgusting\u201d? I get you. I will not go into details, but I did similarly terrible things, including assault. \n\nThe bad news is, none of the doctors I have seen recognized or acknowledged misophonia as an existing condition, even though I pointed them in that direction very clearly. \n\nMy case is very severe, and there is absolutely no chance for me to ever get support, get better, or live in an environment where I am able to control the soundscape, so I had to take extreme measures to ensure that I will not end up bashing someone is head in. It means I basically do not have a life.\n\nThat rage you describe, that blind drive to just obliterate the source of the trigger is what I fear the most. It completely overtakes me to the point where I cease to exist. It devastates me because I do not want to cause harm, I do not want to behave like a frothing madman, and I am scared that I will end up in prison because I might kill someone.\n\nSo I am slowly killing myself. Yeah, I am pretty depressed.\n\nIt is a bleak outlook. She is not disgusting, she has a neurological condition that is ruining her life. What are you even doing here? I have not read the whole post coz I am a little tired atm but yeah, I do too become quite violent when exposed to triggers. They say it is because you cannot really understand  what is going on and that results in anger I am so sorry to hear that man. It may be a bleak out look yeah, but it is kind of hard to look forward to anything when your entire life is based on suffering from this shit. I am sure you have tried things to get better, and I have as well, but it never seems to progress. I do not know what the answer is. \n\nThank you for the understanding comment btw. I was beginning to think that my post would get removed and that all I would get were comments bashing me. I just posted on the off chance that maybe someone knows what I am going through and that they themselves can relate. No one said it is right. It is wrong. Which is why she is asking for help and support. It is clear that for you misophonia is merely a bit of a bother. For some of us it results in uncontrollable impulses. I have the same thing, I would never hurt anyone or any animal ever because of misophonia. It is okay. I know it is a long post. I am happy that you did not read a paragraph or so and then start insulting me in the comments, but chose to actually try and provide a discussion. \n\nThat could be it yes. It sometimes even feels like my brain cannot comprehend what the heck is going on at all. It is as if it starts short circuiting. Yeah I read it all, I sympathised until you said you fed a bird to a cat because you were mad.\n\nNo I do not feel like a hero at all, probably five people will read this post; I do not give a shit.\n\nI am saying it because somebody needs to let you know that is not normal at all, if I knew where you lived I would send animal control to take all the pets out of the house and away from you.\n\nWhat you did WAS \u2018disgusting\u2019, and if you were my child I would take you straight to a mental hospital to get checked out. Okay, so your problem is not as severe. Hooray for you. \n\nDo not bash others who have it worse than you when it comes to this. Get off your high horse. I hope it will not get removed. For the majority of misophonia sufferers things are nowhere near this severe, but you are absolutely not alone. It is very scary, and very serious. If you start harming people or animals then I am sorry but that is when you check into a mental hospital, that is not going to fly with other people at all.\n\nGet help. Please do not kill anymore animals. Lmfao I would be concerned if you were my parent, taking me to a mental hospital without question instead of talking to me or at least trying to understand me. \n\nDo you think that I can fucking control this? It is a disorder. It is why I came here for support. Not to be insulted on how I am a \u201cpsychopath\u201d (please educate yourself on what a psychopath actually is before making such comments, btw. You are making yourself look like an idiot). And I certainly did not come to this misophonia SUPPORT sub just to be called \u201cdisgusting\u201d. \n\nIf you do not give a shit, then why did you comment? \n\nAlso, since you apparently do not give a shit, you should instead be focusing on actual problems going on in the world. How about instead of calling animal control on me, try standing up for all the farm animals who are basically tortured in the meat industry? Since you are so passionate about animals not being killed. Go somewhere else, you are not contributing anything meaningful to this subreddit. I do not remember saying I was going to Thank you. I am so tired of arguing with people who think I am crazy. It makes me feel like shit and does not help me at all. \n\nIt is serious. I came here for support, not to be insulted. Though I guess that is what I get for posting on the internet. Wanting a civil discussion online is like walking on egg shells. I do all that already.\n\nYou are not contributing anything to this world by murdering things that annoy you.\n\nStupid cunt I sought help, repeatedly, for years, in five different medical practices, in two different countries. I got no help, not even a clear diagnosis. \n\nNow I live with headphones 24/7, do not use public transport, do not go to supermarkets, I cannot live in a city, I cannot have a normal job, I cannot socialize. \n\nI took all these extremely restrictive measures VOLUNTARILY, to ensure that I DO NOT hurt anyone, because I got no fucking help whatsoever. \n\nSo get your head out of your arse and stop fucking talking about a mental hospital to me. Try it.\n\nYou might need to be hospitalised for a while. Ah yes, \u201ccunt\u201d I have heard that one before. Very creative. Thank you for your 10/10 intelligence input. \n\nYou are only calling me these things so you can feel better about yourself. Nope, I am a vet who cares about animals and when I saw you murdered one I rightly got triggered.\n\nI am sick of people like you taking out your frustrations on innocent animals, I see it all the time.\n\nI work all day to save these souls and you just kill them for annoying you. You are getting flamed because harming animals is a serious trigger for most people, and rightly so. Sadly in your case it sort of snuffs the actual topic, and all people see is that you murdered Bambi. Sympathy extends only so far for most people, unless they have very similar experiences to yours. \n\nAt this level, misophonia is a severely life altering medical condition, but when animals are harmed, people will only see the moral issue. At this point you ARE trolling. You think we did not try getting help? I have tried for years, there is barely any mental health resources where I live. Misophonia is not exactly a well known disorder. The most they have ever done for me was prescribe me some garbage meds and send me on my way. \n\nI have had a therapist outright tell that I am not a psychopath, after telling him the exact story I told here. \n\nWe try to get help, kind of hard to do that when literally no mental health professional around seems to understand or know what misophonia is. I know, my own doctor did the same thing to me.\n\nBut if you go back and tell them you are killing animals they might offer extra help? Do you think we will magically be cured after visiting these so called mental hospitals you keep talking about? The most they do from the ones I have heard about is medicate you and prevent your from killing yourself. That does not help much, besides not dying. This is exactly what I do as well. I am honestly not, I am just like you.\n\nBought a house six months ago and selling already as the noise is something I cannot deal with here.\n\nMy dream house, gone because of this condition.\n\nBut if I were assaulting people and killing animals then I would have to check into a facility because that is just unacceptable. You will get better meds; more counselling. I have KILLED an animal. I am not KILLING animals left and right like you keep referring to. I told them the exact story you read in my post. They said I am not a psychopath, and that I could possibly have misophonia but it is not a well known disorder so they do not have a proper procedure for it. They prescribed me meds, and sent me on my way. The meds did not help. I am not on meds because they make me feel worse. \n\nI am not sure what more do you want. Do not take it to heart. At this point he is purposefully trying to aggravate the situation. He does not care what your post really is about, he just wants to hurt you. I would advise ignoring him. Pretty much. Which is why it is hard posting about this stuff. Everyone now days thinks with their feelings, not their head. They cannot form any rational thought or even think beyond \u201cyou murdered animal, pls check yourself into a mental hospital thanks\u201d. \n\nI do not think any of these people have a clue about mental health matters at all. If I thought that checking myself into a fucking mental hospital would cure me, then I would have done that years ago. There is no use trying to argue with you. Good day. I know. Many people have done this to me online when I try to open up. I am a sensitive person, I should know better than to give these people the satisfaction of arguing with them. Oh I feel you. I have a pretty severe case and God I get so many, so fucking many violent thoughts. Every time I hear my trigger I just want to roundhouse the person making it or something. I am never actually acted on them because usually they are directed towards people, I have a big fear of getting in trouble, and I have not had misophonia for a super long so I have not had much time to act on those thoughts but I do understand where you are coming from. Misophonia is a beast and I am sorry that you have to deal with that, life is so unfair sometimes \"Mental hospitals\" are likely to cause further damage due to lack of privacy, and treatment that often disregards a person's dignity and in some cases bodily autonomy. I would have checked in myself if I thought it would help. I was advised against it, partly because I am perfectly sane, and partly because of the risks mentioned above.\n\nI think the moral of the tale is that perhaps be less detailed about the Bambi stuff in posts in the future. People are just unable to handle this stuff.\n\nETA: To clarify; do talk about it if you want/need to. Just keep in mind that it is a serious trigger for most people. Use a warning as well. Unless you have a severe case you do not know how bad it can be. I have a very severe case and it destroys your life, just thinking about hearing my trigger 24/7 sends me into a panic attack. I do not personally know Op and I do not know how they feel but as someone who has a very severe case I can tell you it is not something that just inconveniences you, it controls your life. You cannot take it lightly. You are disgusting for being mean to someone who has a very severe mental illness. You sound like a shit person for insulting someone who cannot help but feel that way because of their fucking mental illness Do you hurt defenceless people/ animals too?\n\nI also get panic attacks when I hear my trigger.\n\nWhen you start hurting other people/ animals you need more help.  That is exactly it. I am also perfectly sane, which is why I feel I do not belong there. I have heard stories of what goes on in the psych ward where I live, and I firmly believe that I do not belong with those people. In fact, if I were to check myself in, they would probably take one look at me and say \u201cwhy are you even here.\u201d Everyone else on that floor is either screaming, running around aimlessly, pissing all over the place (on purpose, just so they can watch the workers clean it up) mumbling to themselves, refusing to wear clothes, etc. Thanks, but I do not belong there. It is sad that those people are going through such mental agony, but how the hell is staying there going to help me? If anything it would make it worse. \n\nAnd yeah I guess. I sometimes forget how triggered people can get over stuff like that. The main point of anger is to deal with threats. While I do not condone of that bird being eaten, your brain, pumped up on adrenaline, did what it felt it had to do to deal with the threat. Anger makes us irrational, considering today\u2019s society, though, as acting immediately used to scare predators away. Not so handy when dealing with today\u2019s sources of stress.\n\nOne of my philosophies with Misophonia is that Miso anger is still general anger. Miso anger CAN be dealt with through emotional regulation. Trust me, I dealt with mine. Before I dealt with mine, I would act immediately to rid myself of anger. I would pound my head with my fist and scream because it is not like I could damage property or others. Now? I breathe, remind myself I cannot immediately control the situation, and walk away. \n\nAnger this bad probably has its roots in other unresolved problems. I would highly recommend seeing a therapist, as to find the sources of your anger. The most helpful piece of advice I follow is \u201cYou should not be mad at the things you cannot control\u201d. Hope this ramble helps :)   Yes, to both. \n\nI often get intensely angry due to sounds but it absolutely is not justification for lashing out. If you cannot control your anger enough to keep from physically lashing out against animals and people you need some serious help controlling it. You have abused animals and your disorder does not justify it. They do not realize their noise hurts you. It is not their fault. YOU however do have the capacity to control your behavior, as hard as it is. YOU know that killing the bird is wrong. YOU know that throwing the cat as wrong. You may not be a psychopath but just an FYI, not all abusers are psychopaths. \n\nIf I find myself wanting to slap my in-laws in the face because of the chewing, I go outside or to the bathroom to take a breather. I put in earplugs. It is NEVER okay to lash out.\n\nEdit* I want to point out that I can sympathize but I do not want you to get the idea that these actions are justifiable. I have self-harmed before due to misophonia. I share the feelings of embarrassment because no one takes it seriously, it is even hard for my SO to understand. I have wanted to cause myself deafness. It is so hard to live with. So I definitely can relate to those intense feelings. I do not hurt people or animals but OP did come to the sub looking for support, so when you seek out support apparently it is fine to insult the person looking for support, no it is not. So here is an idea, do not be a jackass and insult someone for looking for support  I have locked this post because comments are getting too close to condoning violence and breaking Reddit's content policy.\n\nAlthough nobody has straight-up said \"yes be violent,\" painting violent behaviour as a natural and acceptable reaction to Misophonia triggers is extremely inappropriate.\n\nOne could also argue that this discussion is off topic because one's lack of impulse control and ability to demonstrate empathy for living creatures is outside the bounds of Misophonia. That is, whether someone is a sociopath or not is an entirely different discussion and does not belong here.\n\nNevertheless. OP, your feelings, experience, and actions need to be analyzed and treated by a professional. Please seek professional help. This is largely incorrect based on my experiences, but ultimately depends on the region you are admitted. \n\nMany institutions have varying levels of privacy, depending on the risks of leaving you alone. The risk is assessed by a professional. \n\nThe statement that body autonomy is not respected also seems outlandish to me. \n\nMy opinions are formed through my six month stay in a Canadian mental health rehabilitation center.", "I have had misophonia since I can remember. Recently I have also noticed that I now have misokinesia Misophonia has had a huge impact on my life and to make it worse, I have noticed that I also have misokinesia(hatred of something seen). This probably started 3 years ago and I searched up what it was like last year so I KNOW it is not just in my head. The thing that triggers it the most is leg shaking. If I see any type of repetitive movement coming from someone is body it bothers me so much. Especially when I am at school trying to focus. It is hard for me to pay attention to anything else other then the movement once it catches my eye. I just wanted to know if I was the only one because man I already feel bad for those with misophonia, I am praying for anyone who has both because it is literal HELL. I have both of these. I was driving along the road yesterday and had to wait at a pedestrian crossing for someone to cross. It was a woman chewing gum and it really triggered me, I could just see her mouth moving in that repetitive camel motion and it made me so angry. FRRR LIKE I GET SO DISGUSTED. Like is it that good?????? I have both too... My sister always shaks her legs when she sits and this makes me so uncomfortable. I always put a hand in front of my eye so that I do not see it anymore.

It seems like certain sounds are a trigger at times and are not even noticed at others.\n\nI am trying to learn and improve. I want to make our home environment welcoming and peaceful. I feel ridiculous, warning her when I am going to use the sink, click my mouse, or rustle a bag, but I am doing my best to keep an open mind and adapt.\n\nI know she feels like she is repeating herself, and I am trying to listen. Any help, advice, links, or support would be welcome.\n\nAlso, glad subs like this exist. I already learned that significant volume is not necessarily to a trigger. That would explain why a seemingly quiet sound in a room full of noise can be a problem. ooo that is a good question and a real tough one to answer...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni guess all of us have our own individual triggers and i think it is a reasonably safe assumption that most of us may be more acutely aware at some times and more docile at others so it would be really hard for anyone to answer those specific questions other than your wife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing that seems to be consistent (this is based purely on my opinion from talking and listening to people here, in real life and my own version of this condition- i am not some super dooper genius or wizard) that increased stress levels generally makes us more sensitive or reactive. Which kind of makes sense for all of us i suppose with or without miso, the more stressed we are the more likely we are to snap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo i do not think it will be possible to give you a list of do's and don'ts  or offer some panacea of a solution other than what you already seem to be doing and that is talking with the person who is the sufferer, finding out as much as you can and being as considerate as is reasonably possible - for that she must already be thanking you a million times over. i do not feel i can speak for everybody here but i believe most of us would be ever so grateful to have a partner as considerate as you! Having miso is one of those things (in my opinion) that are give and take. If you are making noises that are easily avoidable that trigger your wife, then it would be very nice, and dare I say your responsibility, to not make those noises. \n\nSome examples would be: chewing with mouth open, pen clicking, popping gum, etc.\n\nThat being said, your wife needs to understand that certain  noises will be made regardless of any precautions people take. Mouse clicking is a fact of life type thing where you cannot not click if you are using a computer. The clinking of dishes in the sink while you wash is also another one. \n\nUs miso suffers cannot expect the world to conform to us, just like it does not conform to people who have other issues. \n\nLet your wife know that if there is a trigger you are creating that is literally unavoidable, then you will not be upset or personally offended if she removes herself from the surrounding area. If she gets upset at an unavoidable noise you make, let her know you are not doing it on purpose.\n\nAfter explaining that and she still lashes out at you, then she is the one that needs to change her attitude and how she reacts. \n\nI will be the first to tell you miso fuckin sucks. But as a miso sufferer, I found that I do not get as upset at triggers that are unavoidable because I know that they are not being made to target me. It takes work and patience with yourself to be able to calm yourself and understand that sometimes life is annoying.\n\nFor me, understanding that noises are not being made to piss me off has really helped. Apparently that is one of the reasons miso suffers get really angry at triggers. I personally get really upset at triggers because I feel they are being made to \u201cmock\u201d me. But like I said, having that ability to rationalize when a trigger upsets you is something that really helps manage feelings. \n\nHopefully your wife will be able to find that \u201czen\u201d part of herself that will allow her when trigger noises are made. \n\nGood luck to the both of you.  I think being aware of context is important. If you are eating in a room and she walks in and gets triggered, that is her responsibility to do what she needs to. \n\nIf it is the other way round, and she is in a room in the middle of doing something, and you walk in and start making a trigger noise, that is when you will get a bad reaction as she is unable to just remove herself or do whatever else she needs to. \n\nAlso tiredness, stress or trying to concentrate on something all generally make triggers worse.   Thank you for you thoughtful response!\n\nIt seems like being able to remove yourself from the situation is very important to dealing with misophonia is a healthy way. It sucks that we live in a bread-box (one room apartment). The only other \"room\" is a tiny bathroom with a door.\n\nI often feel like my actions are perceived as spiteful or inconsiderate. I have my own conflict issues to deal with as well, so conflict is rarely resolved in a healthy way.\n\nI will also say that misophonia is definitely just part of a greater whole. I hope that by better understanding of the parts that I can help the whole. Thank you for your response.\n\nI know I am too focused on \"fixes\". Not that I want to fix her or feel that she is broken. I just... It seems like a common male thing. I see an issue and I want to fix it, to make it better, and I can lose sight of her emotions and how she is feeling in my pursuit of never wanting to be in that situation of causing her distress again.\n\nShe feels like nothing is changing, like I am not trying, and, as someone who is really honestly trying, that is rough. I want to be able to show her progress and show her that I care. Yeah that is a toughie\n\nIt is a typical, innate response as a guy to try and come up with some kind of solution when someone is airing their problems. It can be very difficult to just shut up and listen, which is often all your SO wants. \n\nI am not in your relationship and I do not know either of you so it is very hard to offer a solution (which is the proper male thing to do right?). Everyone always says that to keep talking with each other is the best thing to do and you are already doing that... it sounds like a frustrating situation  I cannot really chime in helpfully, but know that you are a real catch...

I always seem to get assigned into a room with at least one snoring person and I am completely fed up with that shit. What is it about snoring that people refuse to get help for it? I have dealt with this my whole life, both my parents snore terribly and my partner is starting to as well. But I bring it up and they deny they snore. First why would I lie about that? Second how would you know when you are the one who is sound asleep and I am the one who is wide awake? And third should not you get this checked out for your health? It is just insufferable and was one of my worst triggers in my younger years living with my family... I really hope my partner can keep it under control because I cannot be the person who moves to the couch every night. I am 33 weeks pregnant and while my husband's snoring has always wreaked havok on my misophonia- it became so bad when I became pregnant and started having issues sleeping... That I wanted to MURDER him. \n\nAbout three weeks ago he came home with this little device... And the very first night he put it in his mouth- he STOPPED SNORING IMMEDIATELY. He had not had a single whine, wheeze, grunt or \"sawing of logs\" since. Seriously. It is peaceful now, even when he is flat on his back..\n\nI cannot recommend this thing enough...

I am 50 years old and have been with my husband for 24 years. I have spent many nights frustrated, exhausted, angry and full of rage. He has said he will do something about it but he never has. I finally just came up with my own solution which helps me a lot. The moment the snoring bothers me at night, I just get up and move to the sofa. I do not spend any time trying because the more I do that, the angrier I get. So I just moved to the sofa, where I usually am able to get a very good nights sleep.

Plus, I would like to still be able to hear my husband if he says something.  The Loop seems to be the best option out there for me and for my ears.  Ideas, personal experiences? I got the pros, they are really nice I love them and they work really well. The only time I have is my ears do kind of hurt but that is just going to come with earplugs.

There is one that is the absolute worst for me - the one that drives me up a fucking wall - and he just made that sound. As he made the sound, I was not facing him, but just sat there in silence, absolutely fuming, and trying my hardest not to explode into tears. He has not done it in a little while and I am now here by myself and crying. As far as misophonia goes, I am not \"out\" to anyone. I really want to tell my dad so that he would (hopefully) stop or try to stop making the sounds but for whatever reason my brain just *will not* allow me to ever say anything about it, despite how much it drives me insane. I have no clue what my fucking problem is. But it drives me absolutely crazy. I am pretty sure that with most cases of misophonia, people just have outbursts and are unable to control those outbursts. With me, though, I wish I could just let out the emotions and cry, but my brain just internalizes the anger and that feeling of wanting to explode, and I just wait until I am alone to release it all. Does this happen with anyone else where that one part of you just cannot tell the person making the trigger sound that it triggers you? Was this the case for some of you at one point but were able to tell them eventually? How were you able to tell them? please tell him, but only when you are calm. it is easier to explain and get your point across when you are relaxed and not triggered.\n\nnothing will change unless you speak to him about it and while he may not understand, you will not know until you try. welcome to the sub and good on you for doing your best! Thank you so much for the support, I really appreciate it. :) I do need to tell him about it sometime. I was very triggered when I posted this and needed to vent. I usually do not even swear on the internet lol. Anyway, thanks again! Hi! Long term recommendation would be to make sure your physical health is good. This can play a part in toning down your symptoms of misophonia. If you do not workout already, I would recommend to start with going on walks daily. When I have worked out that day, my misophonia is a lot more manageable. Eating less junk food is also another great indirect way of helping your misophonia. The less stressed out you and your body are, the less your miso symptoms will be. Other coping behaviors that could help would be meditation (I like the Headspace app or just stuff on YouTube). Keep the body and mind relaxed and strong, and the misophonia will not vanish but it will lessen. (Disclaimer: all of this is stuff I have done and the advice that is been given to me by mental health professionals). Thank you so much for the advice! I have never really looked into lessening my symptoms that much - I just try to avoid any situations where I might encounter the sounds as much as possible. I will definitely take your advice into account. :) For sure! That is understandable. That is how I felt before I knew what misophonia was. My mom would constantly make sounds tha annoyed me, she would eat yogurt next to me while I was studying. She got mad/sad when I kept telling her to get out or I would leave the room, because she thought that I found her disgusting etc. We had a huge fight. There were tears and shouting until I locked myself in my room. I searched on google and discovered what misophonia is. I did not have the courage to tell her, but since my brother has opened up about something similar, I thought it would be best to let her know so I left a note on her laptop to see what misophonia is. When se did, we had another small fight but then we sat together and watched some videos with people explaining the situation. I am sure it will be better to let your dad know, especially if you will live with him for a long time.", "Trigger warning: Sheeba perfect portions ad Title says it all.

It is definitely human noises, not cats or other animals if that makes a difference for you (it makes for me so I have spent a lot of time learning the difference). \n\nI recommend just turning the volume down as fast as possible, cause I got it as a unskippable and just now so that is not a option...

If it is illegal in your country, report this mismanagement to your local authorities. If they still continue to do this despite laws telling them not to then that could very well get them a fine, a prison sentence or their rights as managers revoked from them. If this is not possible and they still continue to get rights from this despite the many times you have reported them to the authorities then I would suggest making sure you check when your neighbours as well as other people of inconsiderate natures the hours they are around so you know when they can be avoided as well as finding alternative accommodation (I.E A hotel.) To stay in until the problem blows over.\n\nI suggest you do this as soon as you can in the risk that you do not develop misothemia or misonomia, which is shitty to deal with and only makes the sufferers life shiitier.

Before I can identify the flat where they live I cannot involve the authorities and management here cannot be bothered. I am afraid it is to late. What an awful situation. I think this would make anyone miserable. Does your lease say anything about noise disturbance? I have heard of people withholding rent until their landlords did something about the noise. Depending on your location you might also be able to report the noise to your local council. Yes there is a clause re general misconduct in the lease agreement. The landlord however gives it no heed whatever. According to them role are allowed to make noise. They deny that this is even happening - it is all in my head right? Will look into withholding rent thanks for that! No problem! You might also want to record the sounds and document when and for how long it occurs. Then they cannot claim it is all in your head. Good luck! I tried recording but it simply does not pic up the low frequency. I have many recs if my windows rattling.

Good luck!", "Medication ", "Why am I not bothered by dog eating I have not posted in here before\u2026 it just occurred to me that I never feel annoyed by the sound of my dog chewing on a treat or eating his food - sometimes I even think its cute. But with people? Hell hath no fury like mine when I hear a person eat. Anyone else notice something similar? I am listening to my puppy lap up water as I write this. No issue. Cute as hell. \nA person doing the same thing would send me into a rage. Here is an analogy I made to explain this:\n\nLet us say someone was tapping their foot on the back of your chair in the movie theater. You would be angry with them because that is a rude thing to do. So you turn around and politely ask them, \"hey, could you not do that please?\" They stop, then start doing it again and you get even angrier. But now imagine that the bumping was actually coming from the wagging tail of a service dog that had come in with it is owner. You would likely be much more understanding and much less angry, even though it might still be annoying. It is the exact same sensation to you, yet you have very different levels of anger.  \nMisophonia is very much informed by our perceptions (which are in turn made worse by misophonia). Chewing sounds made by my animals have almost no affect on me as well, but humans doing so has a severe affect on me. This is because the level of awareness the sound-maker has. A cat has no awareness that chewing with their mouth open, slurping up water, etc. is impolite or rude. A human does have this awareness. At least that is my theory. I really like this analogy. There is something about it being a person - it feels more personal, and I also think there is a unique kind of disgust we are capable of feeling for our own species, maybe. My ex always claimed she could not control how she ate - and I never guilted her or anything - I might sometimes say defensively that it is a \u201creal condition\u201d and go to another room, because she would get mad at me about it. But sometimes when I watched her eat (in a state of severe, silent irritation) I would think \u201cthere is no way she cannot control this, what she is doing.\u201d Haha it sounds so insane when you write about it, and it really was not that bad\u2026 but still I thought maybe she just did not care enough not to eat with her mouth open and make all these slurping and smacking sounds, and that was all Misophonia gives us crazy thoughts. I completely understand thinking that the person is doing it on purpose. I know that I am wrong, but it changes nothing. Yes agreed I think it bothers me the same (maybe a tad less) \n\nIt actually bothers me if I hear myself eating, I cannot eat with headphones on as the noise puts me off.. Whoa that is interesting. I only care about myself eating to the degree that I think other people can hear it, but my own eating never bothers me at all Once I hear it I cannot unhear it and then that is all I think about..  thankfully it is not often that it happens..", "Developing new triggers I am so tired of this. I have many triggers like any eating and drinking sounds, nail biting and picking, gum chewing, repetitive sounds, tap dripping, door banging, fabric rubbing, coughing, sniffing, heavy breathing and now my mother scratching her face. Wtf. Eating at dinner is already hard enough listening to them eat so loudly and even when I am done my dad bites and picks his nails until I scream to stop. And now, now my mother scratching her face literally makes me want to explode. I do not get it. I have already picked up a door banging as a new trigger during this pandemic I cannot deal with anymore I am so tired.  Man, I know exactly how you feel. Seriously, why do people have to be so indecent?!? It is not hard to just. shut. up. Have some respect, yanno?? I also recommend getting beta adrenergic receptor enhancing medication in case those synapses start getting so fatigued they start shutting down on their own due to neural adaptation. Pardon", "Coping with neighbor noises during the pandemic So, we are in the middle of a pandemic and we cannot get out of our homes.\n\nI have been having to live with sounds from my upstairs neighbors, which include:\n\n\\- Jumping or stepping hard on the ground\n\n\\- Dragging furniture around\n\n\\- Dropping heavy things or what seems to be pebbles\n\n\\- Random knocking sounds\n\nIt seems to me that my sensitivity is mostly related to vibration. Sounds that are accompanied by vibration, or sounds that are vibration (if that makes any sense) bother me the most. Another important information is that I think that the fact that they happen randomly, without any patern, also bothers me. They can make a sound, then it can take 5 seconds for another one, or 5 minutes, or 10. And they are not the same, and somehow that bothers me as well.\n\nI have always had noise sensitivity, like, I have had it for years, but most noises were not persistent and I did not have to coexist with them. Now I do and it is getting really hard to keep it cool. It seems that it intensified now, during the pandemic, because there were a lot of people changing stuff in their apartment and for some months there were hammering and drilling sounds, so maybe that is why I developed a strong reaction to that kind of noise.\n\nI recently went to a doctor which diagnosed my misophonia. She prescribed me a muscular relaxant and passed me a treatment, which is to have some relaxation moments, using relaxing music, being aware of my breathing, minding my physical reaction. She told me about Tom Dozier and his discoveries, which she summarized to me as \"if you control your body reaction, then the emotional reaction does not follow\". She told me to relax for some minutes and then play the annoying sounds for some time so that I can practice controlling my reaction.\n\nWhat I have been doing: I try to do some relaxing moments, listening to nature sounds, like of a river, or of wind on trees, which seem to calm me, then I focus on my breathing, on releasing the tension on my muscles (neck and belly mostly), and on making my ear relax (sometimes it is up and I do not even notice). Then I either use a video on Youtube with sounds which resembles the annoying sounds or I try to play my recordings (which are not too good, because my cellphone does not capture the sounds too well).\n\nAlso some of the noise wakes me up (even tho I use foam in my ears to block the sound. I tried sleeping with my fan on (to filter the sounds), but it did not work that well, however I only tried once.\n\nThis treatment, which is like a \"desensitization\", has been helpful - before that I would have some really intense heart beating and I got stressed in seconds, it was terrible, I would get immediatelly stressed up and I would not be able to focus on anything else. However, it still gets me sometimes.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had to deal with this kind of sound and how you managed to cope, and if what I am doing is a good way to go, or if I should change something. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR: my neighbors make a lot of noise through the day and the vibrating ones specially discomfort me. My doctor recommended me having relaxing moments and then replaying the sounds to \"desensitize\" to them. I am wondering if there is anything else I can do and if I am on a good path to cope with it.", "What everyone is chewing sounds like when you have misophonia  For anyone nervous- this post is pretty trigger friendly and you cannot really hear the hippo chewing It just sounds like water moving lol all of us when we get the urge to go up into the face of the person triggering us and mock/mimic them", "My relationship with my dad is awful because of my misophonia This is just a rant, feel free to ignore.\n\nMy dad is one of my biggest triggers. He finally understands a bit about miso, but will still get angry with me at times because of it. Mostly because he thinks that I purposely get triggered by him more than others because I do not like him or something, when, in reality, it is just because he makes the most trigger noises. Spending any time with him gives me so much anxiety because if he does make a trigger noise, I cannot tell him because he will get angry. That is the reason why I spend so much more time with my mom, because she actually stops when I ask her to. But he takes this as another sign that I hate him.\n\nBut none of this is the reason my relationship with him is just awful. At the beginning of this year, he developed a &gt;!cough!&lt; from what was probably bronchitis. That was not a huge trigger for me at first, but it quickly became one. I gathered up the courage and finally asked him to please go to the doctor. He was surprisingly nice about it and I thought he would. Nope. This past year my dad got super into being anti-mask and anti-vaxx and this apparently spread to being anti-doctor. In other words, he refused to see a doctor and instead tried to treat it with some vitamin C. Unsurprisingly, this did not work and he continued with the trigger. At this point, I was probably suffering more than I had ever before in my life. It was constant and never-ending (I share a bedroom wall and he would still &gt;!cough!&lt; in his sleep). It was torture. I could not do anything that did not involve a high volume of white noise. For example, I could not watch movies on my TV or have conversations when he was home (which was basically all day). It was honestly one of worst periods of my life. Finally I got the courage to ask again, and was very happy that he did not yell at me. But once again, he did not go and nothing changed. \n\nA few months later and the trigger is finally gone, but I just cannot forgive him. What he did hurt me so much and he did nothing to stop it. I love him, but I think our relationship has never been weaker. And he is realized. I do not spend time with him ever and do not even really talk to him if I do not have to. But he does not know why this happened. He does not realize the extent to which he hurt me and I know if I try to tell him why, he will get defensive and angry at me. It does not seem worth it for me to tell him, but I also hate leaving him thinking that I dislike spending time with him because of no good reason. I am sorry you are going through this, there is literally no real \u201csolution\u201d but you moving out when you can.\n\nI always read on this subreddit someone being a trigger could stem from a trauma or abuse, but for me it is neither. that person only happens to be loud &amp; have 0 self-awareness .\n\nIf i were you when he mentioned how your misophonia has gotten better, i would have politely responded that it has not &amp; my life is hell on earth but i am trying to be polite as to not offend him or make him uncomfortable because i love him dearly.\n\nEven if he does get angry, continue speaking out politely, show him love &amp; affection on the regular so you can soften his heart. If he does not do it on purpose or tries to trigger you intentionally then keep speaking your mind, it may get to him eventually you never know. I am really sorry you are feeling this way.\n\nI am triggered most by both my parents and my partner. I raised this in therapy, and my therapist highlighted that, because they are my nearest and dearest, I spend so much more time around them that I am bound to react more strongly. It also has something to do with m y feeling safer with them. I am not in danger if I am triggered whilst with them, where if I am triggered by a stranger I do not know how they will react. \n\nMaybe in a calm moment, you could try sitting your dad down and explaining it in these terms. It seems after reading that communication is really suffering between you (I know you have tried really hard). I can imagine that being told you are the reason for causing a loved one's suffering is a bitter pill to swallow and some folk deal with this through anger or ignoring it, because it is easier than having to accept that, despite it being unintentional, they are causing us pain.\n\nHas he always been a medical sceptic, or could it be he was worried about the cause of his cough? Again, it could be that he was afraid, and instead of dealing with it, he has focussed it on you and your difficulties being around him.\n\nI hope so much that you can find common ground with each other, and I hope that the situation improves for your sake. I know and understand how hard life is when you have to be around your triggers constantly. Please reach out if you ever need to talk. This was a really nice read. Thank you. He is become a medical skeptic this past year because he started watching Fox News again, then went down the Internet rabbit hole of conspiracies after that. When he did catch COVID back in September, he took a LOT of vitamin C and refused to call it COVID (until 6 months later, when he said that he was more immune to COVID than my vaccinated mom and I who also both had COVID). So I do not think he started being a skeptic because of the &gt;!cough!&lt; (that started in January). To me, at least, he did not seemed concerned at all about it.\n\nYour comment about the common ground is also a very good point. I think that is another reason our relationship is suffering. Even when I do talk to him, he always brings up politics or the latest conspiracy theory (crazy ones like Trump is supposed to be president, there are bugs in the COVID tests, Fauci engineered the virus, vaccinations cause infertility etc.), so that is definitely another reason. I will try to find something that we can talk about together when we do talk. \n\nThanks, again. Yeah, if he does ask me again, I would definitely explain a bit more. I think I said, \"no, it really has not\" or something, but that was it. And I try. I never yell back at him and try to articulate how I do not have a vendetta against him.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read and comment. OH MY GOSH I I going through almost the EXACT same thing with my dad. Except it is him chewing at mealtimes. I have always tried to explain it to him, or I got super angry (which to my family, was super dramatic). I do not know how to make them understand, and it is so frustrating when I explode from the noise or have to leave without them getting angry at me (huh?). He also tried a little to stop, but always makes excuses like \"these noises always happen with this food.\" But he chews SO OBNOXIOUSLY KAKAKS. lmao sorry I just came back from an incident and i cannot get the noise out of my head, but end of story I totally get you. It is hard to communicate with someone who just gets angry and defensive, and is kind of hard headed. My dad is the same way. What I have learned is that no amount of screaming, reasoning, or crying does anything. I feel like your energy should not be wasted on a person like this. This does not mean you have to stay silent, but for your own sake, do not put as much energy into him. It is just not worth it. As sad as it is, it is up to him to fix the relationship because you have done everything you can. Thanks for the kind words! I am sorry you are going through a similar thing, it really sucks. They really take it as a personal affront that they make these noises, and we are the bad people for telling them that it is hurting us. I am hoping to move out within the year so I can stop blasting white noise 24/7, hopefully you can do the same sometime soon.  I am also hoping to move out in a year!!!! Hoping it goes well for you, and I really really really hope this year is better for you &lt;3", "Meditation for misophonia? I want to try and overcome this demon holding me back from being at peace. \n\nHas anyone here tried any sort of meditation that helped them keep their calm when there are triggers around? If yes, I will be extremely grateful if you can share. \n\nxoxo Im doing yoga with adriene every evening and it helps me be at peace. I do think the main reason for an improvement is that we had a kid last year and I am just too exhausted to get upset. But I firmly believe that yoga can help everyone! Oh that is true in a broader sense too. I think when you have got something truly occupying your attention it is easier to not get triggered. \n\nAnd yes! I have been doing yoga too, I use flows on Keep Yoga, that keeps my body feeling good and I have not gotten the winter rust because of that, but that has not helped me keep myself at peace. Yes, TM.  I do not know that it affects the symptoms, but it is very good for self care in general, which is important with this problem.  It gives you periods of totally stress free moments in your day, which I am sure you crave.  Does not have to be TM, any kind of meditation and breathing exercises are beneficial.\n\nAlso exercise.  The more aggressive and exhausting the better. I only recently put a name to the issue thanks to this sub, but I have been meditating for years and using it to manage my emotional and physical reactions to sounds etc \n\nFor me, there are the sounds that are easier to block out and others that are nearly impossible.\n\nFor the easier ones, I can sort of change where my focus is (it moves more to my third eye when in this state, but its sort of loose) and I can maintain productivity, conversations etc. \n\nFor the more intense sounds, the ones that are beyond a clenched, in my teeth, moderate annoyance   and are in the realm of feeling like I am trapped in a cage and about to explode, I can put myself sometimes into a deep state of focus and my attention is purely from my third eye - however, I cant always access this state (if I have become too emotional already, I usually cannot reach the deep focus state) and even when I can access it, there is no productivity from me. It is a deep meditation that gets me out of the audio hell, but I cannot actually achieve anything beyond being in that state of mind while there.\n\nHope this helps. I should note that I have been studying and practicing different forms of meditation for well over a decade now. It has taken much practice and trial and error for me to get where I am at now. And I will continue to practice and learn and improve as my life continues.", "misophones who live with others, how do you cope? i have been living with my SO for 3 years now, and i am not sure if my misophonia is actually getting worse, or if moving to a quieter building has just made me more aware of triggers *inside* our apartment rather than *outside*. basically any sound that is just on the \u201cperiphery\u201d of my hearing makes me feel disproportionately annoyed/angry - so it used to be half-hearing neighbors\u2019 conversations, but now it is mainly my partner\u2019s constant humming. \n\ni know that humming is usually an expression of happiness, but it is starting to seriously fray my nerves. i would rather not ask him to stop because i feel like i have already given him a laundry list of things that trigger me and i do not want to stifle him, but i do not know what else to do. i do try to be the one to remove myself when i notice something is bothering me, but this is not really a sound i can walk away from. lately i have been wearing my airpods around the house to kind of \u201cmute\u201d noise but turning on music to cover up other sounds tends to overstimulate me. \n\nhow do you all cope with triggering noises that you cannot easily avoid, especially if they are coming from a loved one? I am starting to think i am just not cut out for living with others. Tbh I do not really know how to help. I have been going through the same thing as I am stuck at home well people in other rooms are talking and making noise. I have a really hard time even making it through the day sometimes without freaking out. As soon as I can though I try and move. I find that going outside for a walk or taking small breaks have really helped me cope. Although it is not ideal I also where earplugs and play music when I can to try and calm down. I do not know if this would help but I have also been doing acupuncture and that has significantly decreased my stress and help my misophonia. Sorry I do not have any concrete answer. Here is what I do, hope it helps:\n\n1. When I eat with my SO, we have headphones and we watch a TV show together (I even have a cap with a towel on to hide visual triggers). We still find a way to connect.\n2. When I eat with people who knows I have miso, I have some small earbuds and I out some white noise. They are aware of it so they speak a little louder when they are taking to me. I also got pretty good at reading lips haha.\n3. If you can, talk. Speak to your SO and close people around you about your condition. People who understand will help you. Find safe words. I constantly have to reassure my BF that I love him and it is not HIM, but the sound, but that is a low price to pay to be understood and have harmony.\n4. I have Sony MH1000XM3 noise cancelling headphones for all other moments at home or at work where there is noise I cannot control. I put a good playlist on so it takes of the stress a bit.\n5. Speaking of control, I noticed (for myself) that when I have control on some of the noise, it is less hard or hurtful... maybe be more aware of what you can and cannot control. \n6. Exercising. I do martial arts and it helps me.\n7. Take time for yourself... sound stupid to say, but when we get in a negative mood, sometimes it looks like there is no issue. Taking time to do something you enjoy can help take the focus away of the pain. \n\nOf course, we are all different people, some will and some wont work for you, but overall I hope this have you some ideas and helped a bit. :) I felt this way, even living with a roommate who also had misophonia. We both still drove each other insane, despite sharing a lot of the same triggers I live alone.", "Just do not know what to do I have not been diagnosed and would not know where to begin with this.

Well, kind of - the project is where you are supposed to write a short, convincing speech asking people not to do a pet peeve of yours, and I have decided to write about one of my trigger sounds, which is chewing gum. \n\nShould I mention misophonia as any of the points? I probably will not say *I* have it, but I can mention that some people might have adverse reactions to sounds such as chewing gum due to conditions such as misophonia and noise sensitivity. I think Misophonia might be a bit more than a pet peeve in some cases. Although, talking about Misophonia is never a bad thing.

We got kicked off campus in March due to COVID, so I went home to live w them until we went back to school in August. About halfway thru the summer I noticed my grandma makes a sniffling noise every time she gets done saying something or doing something (ie: getting something out of the fridge, once she closes it she will sniff loudly or if she drinks something she will immediately sniff after). I never noticed it for 18 years of living with her, and it does not even bother me all the time. Sometimes I do not even notice it, especially when im focused on something like gaming or homework or watching something i am interested in. However, when I do notice it, it gives me such an angry feeling for some reason. I have only let it get the best of me twice in the past 5 months, once I just had to get up and go to my room and close the door and put music on, and once I said something to her like \u201cwhy do you keep sniffing over and over?\u201d to which she had a negative reaction. Recently, school has been stressful and along with that the noise has started driving me crazy too. Is there anything you guys can recommend or that I can do to try and cope with it? The worst part is that she does not even know she does it, but Im at the point where I almost want to sit down with her (respectfully, and watching what I say) and tell her that I know it isnt her fault but it is driving me nuts", "School support I go to a Catholic school in Australia and have a meeting with learning support on ways to support me in the classroom.

Its going to be a messy and huuuge read, folks :,)\n\nMay delete later because my siblings have reddit and one of them knows about my misophonia and might follow this sub. Also, my whole immidiate family pretty much knows the story so they may recognize it, but I dont know if they really know how big of a role the sound-making object in this story played a role.\n\nSo.. deletelater if I am paranoid they may find it.\n____\n\n\n\nLast night, I saw a vent post on here that, in its final few lines, stated \"I cannot  ignore it like everyone tells me to.\"\n\n\nAnd it unlocked a part in my brain that I burried so deep down I would almost forgotten.\n\n I have been thinking of that line literally all day, and my eyes keep getting misty as I angrily think how things could have turned out differently that year if I would only known what the hell misphonia was back then.\n\n\nStory time:\n\n\nIn 9th grade, about 5-6 years ago, I was in an English class with an absolutely wonderful teacher. She was the most polite and nice lady I would ever met, and yet, the class of absolute hellspawn was brought upon her. That whole school year was a nightmare for myself, and for her.\n\nThat year, \"tech decks\"- or miniature desk skateboards that one uses their fingers to ride &amp; trick with- were all the rage, and kids used those things in class as the ultimate boredom killer. These horrible contraptions would clack and snap with every awful trick or movement that they made.\n\nAnd it drove me nuts.\n\nI did not know what misophonia was at the time, but all I knew is that this sound drove me insane. I wanted to grab the little skateboard out of my tablemate's hand and chuck it. Both of my tablemates that year absolutely loved to use the heck out of these noisemachines, but one used them far more than the other.\n\nWhen they found out the sound irritated me though, they loved using them even more, and kept on doing it while looking me in the eye, laughing or smirking.\n\nI told my teacher many times that it was bothering me, and she often took away the tech dechs.\n\n The students would steal them back from inside of her desk, and when I told on them for *that*, they proceeded to verbally berate me the rest of the year for tattling and for being a \"narc\".\n\nThis unbearable situation- them playing qith their skateboards and them harassing me- kept up the whole schoolyear, and had eventually brought me to blow up in anger and then crumble into tears, to which the whole class witnessed and I ran out of the room sobbing.\n\nUsually my response to the noise was to get angry. I always shot them glares and talked very very angrily at them, but that only made the problem worse because they would know their attempts at pissing me off had worked. I couldnt help getting angry though, and it was impossible for me to feel anything else other than searing rage. Looking back, I am suprised that I did not blow up more than once at them.\n\nAfter the whole blow-up-in-anger and crying thing, I was so ashamed and everyone thought I was just over-reacting. *I* thought I was over-reacting. I didnt even understand why I hated it so much and I hated myself for it.\n\nI hated myself for hating that sound, being a \"narc\" and not wanting them to play with those stupid things, not being able to \"ignore it\" like my councilors told me to every single goddamn time I came to them for help.\n\nI hated the councilors, and the students too, of course. I was really just filled of hate for that horrific year.\n\n.\n\nIt honestly had not \"clicked\" in my head that the tech-deck drama was started entirely because of my misohonia until last night when I read that line on that one vent post about \"ignoring it\".\n\n I still hate my councilor to this day for constantly telling me that. There are so many journal entries from that time, furiously written in caps about how that is impossible and my ears cannot help but hear it and that it was impossible not to react to, and how miserable I was.\n\nI can still imagine the kids saying that theyre not doing anything, its not bothering anyone, and asking what the hell I was being so angry for.\n\nI wish I knew what misohonia was earlier, so that I could have made that connection and told the councilor that I wasnt just \"annoyed\" by the noise and being a brat, but that I had an actual legitimate issue that I had absolutely no control over.\n\nI only found out what misophonia was much later, though, once the sound of eating started to bother me, and that was a whole 'nother issue. I was out of physical school by the time I learned what it was, I think.\n\nI was moved to an online school, so I have not has to deal with shit like that for a while, but... yeah...\n\n.\n\n\nToday, I keep wondering things like \"What if I had explained what misophonia was to the councilors, and that my stress reactions towards their tech deck shenanigans were uncontrollable? \n\nWhat if I had asked them to just BAN tech decks for being \"\"distracting\"\" before it all got so far?\n\nWhat if I explained to my teacher what misophonia was? Explained to the students who bothered me? (But that might have backlashed and made it even worse... Theyd probably try making other sounds to piss me off. Ugh.)\n\nI always came to my teacher, and only ever begged the councilors for help at the end of the year. They didnt want to bother with it because it was straight-up the end of the year..\n\n..But what if I had seeked their help at the begining?\n\nI felt it would extreme to ask the *councilors* for help at the begining, but really. What if I had just taken that \"extreme\" action? Would they still have ignored me if there was a lot of time left in the year?\"\n\nNo use thinking about any of that now, I guess, but god is it hard not to imagine confronting the councilors or kids and what I would say if I could see them today.\n\nAnyway.. yeah..\n\nI dont know how to end this, but I hope I never have to be seated next to that shitbag ever again.\n\n\nActually, yknow what? Now that I think about it, why the hell was my seat never moved away from that guy?? Did I ever ask to mive away from him? I have no idea!! But why were not we moved?? That would have stopped the conflict.. If we were on opposite ends of the classroom, I wouldnt have been able to hear the sounds over the other students talking.\n\nI wonder if she kept me near him because he was one of the 20-something trouble students and I was probably the most uptight, polite, and diligent student there.. (there were about 30 students total, so over half the class was a wreck).\n\nanyway.. im just rambling at this point but yeah..\n\nTLDR:\n\nKids played with tech decks- or desk skateboards- and got them taken away by the teacher because they were \"distracting\" me. \n\nThe kids stole them back from the teacher, played with them more because they knew it pissed me off, I told on them again and they harassed me and called me a \"narc\" the rest of the year. \n\nSchool councilors told me constantly to just ignore the guys, the tech deck noises, and harassment, instead of punishing the kids.", "Cannot stand my coworker  You are a fabulous, fabulous writer. That said, I assume that the target of your well-deserved ire has either an anxious tic or minor congenital malformation of the oropharynx that causes his ongoing noisemaking. \n\nI am curious, though: has he asked you why you wear headphones? I have no idea how folks such as he have made it through this life unassaulted by others he annoys. If you were to initiate a conversation about misophonia, and he discloses anything useful, let us know.", "I am desperate. My husband is now the source of all my triggers. We have been together for 5 years and now, out of the blue, he turned into the only source of all my triggers. He cannot stop doing mouth sounds all day long and I cannot stand his chewing. To make it worse he eats 24/7 and is ALWAYS chewing on something. It reached the point that i dread when he sits/lays too close to me because i know he will do disgusting mouth sounds. I tried to talk to him about it obviously, showed articles and everything, but he just laughs (like it is something i am making up) or ends up taking it personally which I completely understand... \n\nAlso, guess what were always our favourite activities as a couple? Cooking and eating together. Eating while watching tv and everything else that involves food. Just the thought of it now drives me crazy. \n\nI do not want misophonia to ruin my marriage :(\nmy anxiety simply skyrocket due to the sound antecipation. I need advice! Hey!   \nIn my experience, I go through bouts where my Misophonia is worse than other times. Sometimes this is months or years - then it improves for some reason. Just want to start off with that to communicate that you are not alone in the change. \n\nI think that this is one of those things that a partner really needs to work with you on. A relationship is supposed to mean that both people can make sacrifices where they are needed and within reason. This is one of those things, in my opinion. If your significant other is not taking this seriously, I would say to make it a more serious conversation. To me, I have discussions about Misophonia in a serious and firm tone. Moreover, my significant other and I have agreed many years ago that we would not eat together. We still cook together, but we eat in separate rooms. We still watch movies and do other things together, but it is all without food. I make compromises for my significant other, so in my opinion, this is a compromise they can make for me. Nevertheless our relationship is still quite good and we love each-other very much despite not eating together. \n\nMy recommendation is that if your partner does not take you seriously, then try to make them see it in the same light that you do - talk about it seriously. In the past, I have even said \"I would like to discuss something important with you after work\" and set a time up specifically for that conversation where you can sit down and talk without distractions. \n\nFinally, I would recommend coming to the conversation with solutions instead of just complaining. It is frustrating from your spouses perspective when you are in pain, you say it is their fault, and they do not know what to do. Even if you do not say it is their fault, that is all people usually hear.  Try to bring solutions to the table - accommodations that you think might work, or are at least worth a try. Maybe one of these things is not eating together, or not eating certain types of meals together; whatever you think is worth a try. Maybe one of these things could be your spouse not having anything in their mouth when they are around you, the specifics are going to be whatever situation you find is causing you stress. Regardless of the solution, just try to think about what you are asking for before you have the conversation; what is your goal?\n\nAnyways, I obviously do not know your specific situation, so take my advice lightly. I do hope you find something that works for you regardless. Good luck and stay positive! Thank you so much! It is always nice to know we are not alone in this horrible thing :~\nTrue, i need to address this to him in a serious way! I will have this conversation tonight hopefully! \n\nWorst thing is that we have 2 kids and none of them trigger me at all. In fact my toddler is a super loud chewer and never once her chewing triggered me, so it will be hard for him to understand that I cannot eat with him but i can with other people :((((( but let us see how it goes! I find if I have unresolved issues with someone, their sounds trigger me more than people with whom I am square.\n\nIt sounds like you are spending all day every day with him? That is a lot. When do you get a chance to just be you?\n\nUsually resolving the issues and focusing on my breath helps me get thru the most intense triggers. \n\nAs for your husband...\n\n&gt;he just laughs (like it is something i am making up) or ends up taking it personally\n\nYou only have control over you. Sharing articles and trying to explain is only worth doing if someone is open to it. Someone who cares deeply about you should *want* to know how they could make your life better. It sucks he is so focused on his own comfort he does not care about yours. That speaks to deeper problems. \n\nA better approach is to set boundaries for yourself, and people around you can choose to respect them, or receive consequences. Either way you have peace. Either way it does not matter whether or not they *believe* you, it only matters if they make effort to respect you and your boundaries.\n\nNot sure if he does this, but here is an example... \n\"Making mouth sounds on purpose feels hurtful. From now on, if you purposely make a mouth sound toward me, I am leaving the room. If you follow me, I am leaving the house. If you get upset about it, I am staying at (whoever's) until you give me a sincere apology for your behavior, not to be confused with 'I am sorry you feel that way' non-apology.\"\n\nThe critical part of this is to follow through. Boundaries are only as effective as your defense of them, otherwise the person knows you do not mean it and they will continue to cross the line with you. \n\nAnother idea, \"if I am in the bedroom with my headphones on, under a weighted blanket, and doing a quiet, calming, activity, I need you to let me be. I need this time alone in the quiet to heal. I will open the door when I am done. If you interrupt me, I will ignore you. If you take any action to gain my attention, to cause me to have to move or change what I am doing, I will leave the house.\"\n\nMake them simple, clear, and all about keeping your own \"safe\" zone. Rational, non-narcissistic people will understand your boundaries are for you and are not a personal attack. People who really care about you will respect them.\n\nPlease remember, you are enough exactly as you are &lt;&lt;internet hugs&gt;&gt; Why cannot your husband just ... you know, stop making the noises? As I only live with my husband, be is the source of my triggers.  Before that it was housemates, before that, my family.  It always seems to be those we are closest to.\n\nMy husband knows I have its understands it, but continually forgets - like he will start chewing food before leaving the room, or talk with his mouth full (which he did a few minutes ago and I am full of rage right now).\n\nWe have eaten in separate rooms for years now, but can eat at cafes and restaurants together, because the background noise helps.  Sadly covid means this has not happened in months.  Maybe once in a blue moon we will eat pizza whilst watching a film, but he needs to be on the other armchair, my hood is up, and it is a struggle.\n\nI would send your husband articles, that is all I can suggest, or even get a friend who understands you to talk to him.  It can take a while.  My parents thought it was a \"phase\" and I was overreacting/being silly, it was only till I found the term Misophonia that they took me seriously.   My twin has it too, but milder, so I am sure it is a genetic thing.\n\nGood luck with your husband, I hope he comes to be more supportive. Hi full of rage right now), I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 Hiya, if it helps I have experienced the same, but it is been enhanced by lockdown. We spend so much time together, I have become super sensitive to noises that irked me before - but now they can sometimes make me feel physically sick. I find breathing through it and reminding myself everything is ok, helps. I do not see how its possible to be married or even have a relationship.", "I was looking for misophonia information cards, you know the kind that give a summary of the condition, so you dont have to give a speech every time you try to explain it, and I found this blog post from 2016 (the latest thing), and THIS IS ONE HOT STEAMING MESS, I am so angry  Unfortunately there does seem to be a distinct lack of awareness and acceptance of misophonia across the Internet. It does hurt a lot to read that article, but it does not invalidate what anyone is going through. Misophonia is still a very real struggle and the opinions of people such as this do not affect our lives directly. Therefore, I encourage you to avoid articles such as this, which do more harm than good. Let us work on raising more *correct* awareness for misophonia through the organisations and resources which we already have. I absolutely agree with everything you said. I was not seeking out such an article, but I did find it, and I didnt know how to cope with the annoyance. Thank you for taking the time to share this obnoxious experience with me, it oddly makes me feel better just to hear someone else say it is hurtful.  It does not read like a real opinion piece. More likely rage bait. At least we are known enough to get targeted by trolls? Hi friends! FYI, soquiet.org will send you a free set of misophonia information cards. Thank you so much, this is exactly what I was looking for!! You are quite welcome! They sent me about 20 of them. I keep a few in my wallet and the rest at work. They are quite helpful. :) I find this very funny seeing as I am a descendent of Daniel Boone and I have Misophonia. \"What would Daniel Boone think??!!\"\n\n\"Bitch I *am* Daniel Boone^s^descendant\"", "My boyfriend eating triggers me so much Hi all, looking for some advice. \n\nMy boyfriend is an insanely gross eater - the whole 9 yards. Smacking, talking with his mouth full, chomping on chips louder than a normal person, picking his teeth with his fingers and tongue. \n\nI am at the point I can no longer take it. I have calmly explained to him to no end that I have a condition, It makes me upset and makes me uncomfortable, and he just gets annoyed and tells me I am being oversensitive and to stop nit picking him about it. He is convinced he is not gross and it is just me overreacting. I literally cannot eat with him anymore and that makes me sad.\n\nWhat can I do??? Anyone else experience something similar and have tips?", "I am not triggered at all by my dad ... and if the same sound made by others i cannot handle it.\nNo doubt it  because i have a very good relationship with my dad.\n\nDoes this happen to you also? That happens with me too. My cat makes a lot of sounds I would typically be triggered by but I am not triggered by them at all. Similarly if my dad sniffs or takes a loud bite I forget about it a lot quicker than if my anyone else does. Same but when my mom does it it is worse", "Need Advice For Young Child Developing Miso Symptoms  I started experiencing this around the same age, my parents went the exposure 'therapy' route and it was not good. Do not try any remedy without contacting a professional as you can make the issue much worse. Also try and get your child the help they need ASAP, the longer you wait the worse its going to get.  Sorry I took so long to approve your post. I find the less I am around my triggers, the better I cope when I must be around them. From my experience with my family, the best route is to allow him to learn what works for him, without forcing him to be exposed to triggers.\nFor me, I used to pick what dinners to sit in on, based on what food it was and how stressed I was feeling (not necessarily miso related). \n\nThat said, you do need to teach him that lashing out on others with anger is not acceptable, no matter how he is feeling, and the correct thing to do is leave, calm down and return. Explain that his brother does not mean to make the sound, even if it might sound intentional to him. \n\nIf the issue is at meal times, background noise will help him cope, especially if you add noise that interests him or will focus on very easily, such as a funny TV show or music he likes. My son is 9 and started having triggers about a year ago. The only thing that we have currently been working on is trying to help him understand what other people are experiencing when they are making the eating sounds. I am teaching him that people do not understand things the same way as him. His brain is on \"high alert\" for those sounds and when he hears them his brain tells him to fight or flight. We talk about the differences and similarities between fight or flight and anger. They both lead to rage but come from different types of experiences. I try to give him meal options where he can choose when and where he eats his dinner. Start teaching him the techniques of surviving through these triggers that work for you, and work outward from there. Sit with him when the panic is happening and talk him through it like you would yourself with your own thoughts. Most importantly, make sure he knows that he is loved and supported and not broken, and that many others suffer in the same way as him. I agree with this 100%. The more I am exposed to triggers the more tired and hazy I am making everything worse to handle. That is pretty typical for age of onset from what I have read. I have had misophonia as long as I can remember. Perhaps consider getting him earplugs or headphones. My family got me earplugs when I was little. It did not fix anything but I felt like I at least had another option that did not involve leaving the room. My family mostly ignored my problem, though, or treated me like I was being overly sensitive or dramatic. One thing I really hated was riding in cars while my family was eating. It was the absolute worse because there was no way to escape. So avoid doing that, I guess. It can be quite isolating as a little kid with this problem so just make sure he feels included and believed. It probably helps that his Mom understands it is a real thing having experienced it herself. Exposure makes it 10x worse 100 faster. Give him coping mechanisms, like headphones or leaving the room whenever he needs to.  I would recommend headphones/earplugs. I use my AirPods and play calming music through them to help me. I can still hear the family conversations while protecting my ears. Also try and sit him farther away from his brother. I do not have this luxury because I cannot stand chewing from anyone in my mine, but I sue farthest from my dad (the worst one) and use headphones to drown out everyone else Thanks. I will talk this over with my wife. Thanks. I appreciate this advice. We have started listening to music at dinner, and I think this has been helpful.\n\nIt is my hope that we can help him in the near-term by being strict on dining etiquette, and allowing my son to excuse himself. Unfortunately, my kids are all very young and do not have a lot of self-awareness yet. Thanks. I will keep that bit about car rides in mind. I will do my best to make him feel included and believed.  I see a lot of comments about getting him headphones, and I will purchase him some. Thanks. I will. Thanks.  I will get him some headphones and earplugs.\n\nGood idea on keeping the young ones further apart. I actually just ordered a large dining table with the intention to give the misophonia family members some space. :) This really resonates with me. I have had similar discussions with him about other topics, but my understanding of misophonia is mostly through my wife getting angry at me and what I have read.\n\nYour simple explanation makes a lot of sense to me, especially as I try and teach him about how to control his emotions in general. Thank you", "Just do not think about it, ya know  Sorry if you have seen this already. I had to delete and post again. My issue is Buzzfeed &amp; youtube made it kind of more popular where some assume they have it too.

I guess great minds think alike!", "Clearing your throat My god this is one of my biggest triggers. I remember every time I have had to be around somebody that would obviously have some shit in their throats but they would just try quietly clearing their throats which would not do shittttt. I figure it is because they do not want to be loud but JUST MAKE ONE BIG GIANT COUGH AND GET IT OVER WITHHHH The worst is the habitual throat clearers, who walk around the office all day long, clearing their throat as loud as possible each time they pass you. Yeah see a dr ffs can we not put triggers in the damn title please My dad does this. It is called a vocal tic. Something in this person's brain is not working properly just for some insight. Ugh this is my biggest trigger too I did a specific google search to find this post.\n\nBut only be=au7se it drives me crazy how some people do it constantly, wide open mouth. Like my new roommate. Phlegm is expelled when you do that, nasty mofo! Its just as bad as sneezing or coughing. Ive watched full loogies fly out from people doing that.

This conversation is a hilarious rollercoaster talking about miso and much more... growing up with miso in a well-known British family, being a single parent, life in LA, explaining it to parents, children, co-workers, and the often profanity-infused outbursts that come with the territory.

Certain sounds either annoyed me, made me felt pain, or in fight-or-fly mode. This includes loud bass, metals scratching each other (like clashing fork with spoon or plate), and someone being angry.\n\nRecently at a family dinner at a restaurant, I sat next to my 2 year old nephew. In the middle of it, he started to scratch his fork repearedly to the plate, which made me felt annoyed and physically hurt by the sound. I try to hold it in, and just make small pained voice. \n\nMy brother was annoyed and he just told me to just stop eating and go outside the restaurant. He also blamed me for sitting next to his nephew (even though I sat first). \n\nI just kept quiet, and I saw SIL change nephew's fork with a wooden chopstick, which sounds better. \n\nAm I overrracting? Or just that my family cannot comprehend that I am not just overreacting to certain sounds? Sometimes I feel like an asshole just having to have misophonia, which I wanted it to go away.  Totally understand the bass and the scratching metal...eww just reading the words is bad enough lol. You are in no way to blame. I have always assumed my reaction to people being angry was some kind of psychological issue - it is never occurred to me it could be miso-based! It causes me the same reaction (anxiety/anger) as other sounds...explains a lot...thanks! People often do not understand misophonia. I have been treated like absolute shit by the people who used to be my closest friends because of it. I advice showing your family some articles, maybe? You are definitely not overreacting, I think you are actually very good at keeping yourself calm from reading this post. So maybe showing some research articles about misophonia to your family can help you out, or at least make them aware that you are not overreacting", "GAH! Treecutting vent! My new neighbour is cutting down trees for the millionth day in a row and it is making me crazy! I work from home, and my usually quiet neighborhood in the middle of nowhere has gone from a quiet suburb to a hell of my neighbour's construction.\n\nI realise that in not being rational, hello misophonia! but how am I supposed to work when I can barely focus? I work from home because I have two chronic illnesses and it is hard to get traditional work. I am so happy to have a project to tide me over, and then this arsehole ruins the peace. \n\nDo you know what would make me feel better? A simple note saying \"we will be doing some work on our property for the next few days. We expect it to take X days. Thanks for your patience and sorry for any inconvenience\" Is that too much to ask?  Do you have a casual relationship enough with them to ask when they think they will be finished? I am sure you can inquire in a way that will not offend them.\nI can imagine that you are correct - having a deadline in mind will help you get through what seems like a never ending situation.\nIn the meantime, are you able to wear headphones when you work? Or crank up a fan right next to you? I am sorry you have to suffer :-( Just remember you will feel so much relief when it is over. It will get better, friend \u2764\ufe0f They are actually new neighbours so they have just moved in and are busy with lots of changes. They have stopped with the tree felling, thankfully, but they are now starting early Saturday and Sunday mornings to do their other renovations!\n\nI put ear plugs in under noise cancelling headphones and play white noise. The issue comes when I have online meetings since I cannot use my earplugs and headphones and it creates a noise other people hear!\n\nAnyway, thanks for your comment and I hope you have trigger-free days :)", "I have misophonia  This is a masterpiece Haha thanks! That gave me an idea\n\n Lmaooo i guess the rest of them were either misophonics or dead (", "Art Sought  Can you post a link for people who do not have facebook please?", "I had my first panic attack today Nobody believes I have any of this, they all just think it is in my head. Help... this stay at home thing is not making it ANY better. In fact it is getting so bad I had my first panic attack today. I was hyperventilating, crying... god, I am only 13. What do I do? Nobody in my family is going to believe me and if they did they would just think I was on drugs or something. Help? Please. First and foremost, IT IS REAL. I know that does not fix your problem. But just having confirmation and validation goes a long way. So yes, it is real. You are not crazy. It is not a result of drug use.\n\nDo you see a counselor or therapist at all? Would your parents take you if you asked? \n\nI am 39, and I have dealt with this since I was about your age. I know what you are feeling. Is it possible to limit your exposure to your trigger sounds? I am basically wearing ear buds or earplugs around my house almost every waking hour. Unfortunately, there are not any proven \"cures\", and I think most of us cope by limiting exposure to noises. i completely understand you, i am so sorry that you are going through this.\n\nyou could try make a powerpoint explaining misophonia and show it to your parents? there is a lot of information available online about misophonia and if your parents can clearly see that this is not made up they may be able to come to terms with it.\n\nhoping that things get better for you soon &lt;3 I am sorry that your parents do not understand. Mine did not either at first but now I have found out that both of them also have misophonia, although they do not address it like I do. It was bad when I was 13 too so I relate a lot. I would recommend to start wearing earplugs (I use wax but any, foam, etc work) I am 16 btw if you need support dm me. Why is it so hard for people to feel what we experience. Is it that strange? Sorry, people that do not have it will never understand why you cannot just ignore the noises. All we can do is to figure out what tricks work best - earphones or earplugs, masking with music or white noise, etc. \n\nIf I am understanding you correctly, you have not talked to your family about this? Maybe your parents will be more understanding than you expect. But if you have siblings that you think will purposely use this to bug you, do NOT tell them about it. Some people think it is just so hilarious to figure out what your trigger noise is so that they can start doing it on purpose. It IS nice to have confirmation. So... thank you. My parents? They would never, having a child that needs to go to a therapist would \u201crUiN tHeIr RePuTaTiOn\u201d... I can limit my exposure, but not by much. I guess I just have to wait until I move out? Anyway thank you. Confirmation goes a long way. Aww... thank you, but they would never listen. A child with a condition or something that they think would \u201cruin their reputation of a healthy family\u201d and they already search me and my room for drugs. Lmao my dad thought my tampons were vapes tho like \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnyway, it means a lot to have this community with me. Thank you. Good to know there is someone who cares &lt;3 thank you for your support! Very strange. I guess they just do not have any experience with sounds being a problem so they just throw it out? Thanks for the advice &lt;3 but I have already told them and they think I am using drugs, and it is not just my sibling, THEY make sounds just to make me anxious. I am starting to think there is something underlying my misophonia... I am sorry you are dealing with this. I remember crying tears of rage at the dinner table with my dad and stepmom while they either mocked me, and made their chewing noises louder, or eventually got pissed at me and sent me to my room. Little did they know that was a reward to me at that point. Maybe you can show them some articles about misophonia? When I was a kid, there was not even a name for it. Also no internet lol so I did not know there were other people like me. Best of luck, and feel free to vent here any time. Sometimes that helps, too. Ah yes... the articles... uh. They think it is just some weird internet stuff made up. And that if I show them one again they will take away my phone because \u201cit is fake things, you do not understand\u201d... I swear, if I did not have caring people like you or this sub to vent on... I am very sorry. Hang in there. I know that is basically the most useless advice ever. Nah, having someone else that understands is nice. Thanks, it really means a lot &lt;3 my heart breaks for you. i remember when i was your age and my dad did not believe me either. like another person commented, there was not even a name for this when i was growing up. hang in there and take deep breaths. try and relax your mind :\u2019) I am so sorry you are going through this, panic attacks suck and I get them too, but it is important to realise they cannot hurt you and just breathing and some music will calm you down. What is happening is your fight or flight mode is kicking in, but with a freeze reaction as you are not enacting fight or flight. So you hyperventilate because you are mentally and sometimes physically stuck with the sound, and you are instincts are raising your heartbeat/breathing/etc. \n\nSometimes I can feel one coming on and distracting myself before my hyperventilating escalates can stop a full panic attack (so mine normally last less than a minute nowadays)\n\nAlso, try changing you are environment if you cannot escape your panic, i.e go for a walk, have a shower, go to a loud room that might drown out the sounds (eg kitchens can be loud, with the fridge humming, the oven fan, any other appliances)\nMake yourself busy, engross yourself in things so that you are less likely to realise the sounds are occurring. \nWorst case scenario, blast some music, but try you are best to avoid doing that without earplugs or something to protect your ears (I learnt the hard way and now have tinnitus lol)\n\nAnyway hope this reassures you, and best of luck that one day your family will understand, even if not fully. Wow! This is really, really helpful. Hope your tinnitus is not too hard to handle for you, and that you are able to handle it well. It does reassure me. I appreciate it, thank you so much. Really though, I do not know what I would do without people like you on this sub &lt;3 thank you! what kind of tampon looks like a vape lmaooo\n\nalso you could try at least, having misophonia does not mean that you are not healthy. sorry that your parents have that mindset :( Lmao I did they thought I was on drugs :( my dad took a look at the Tampons again i am really really sorry that your parents are like that :( Aww thanks &lt;3 it means a lot and lmao the tampons are ok now \ud83d\ude02 hahaha that is good \n\nalso i am always here if you need someone to talk to\ud83e\udd7a Aww \ud83e\udd70 I think I will be ok, but thank u so much for the support, I feel so cared for \ud83e\udd70 yay! glad that you do :)", "Therapy Tomorrow ", "My sister refuses to listen My sister brought up the idea that I might have Misophonia and after she said that I looked into it and discovered I had it. As soon as I found out I told her and thanked her. Ever since then most of my family has been trying to help me (except for a few but for the most part they listen) Today while we were eating dinner she kept on scraping her teeth on her fork (my very first and worst trigger noise) and I said \u201cPlease Stop\u201d and then she did it again and I told her to please stop once again. She then started this whole argument about how I should stop feeling that way (which I cannot) and how I should get therapy (which I know will not really help because we know so little about Misophonia) and I explained that it would not work very well. Then she told me she was not going to stop no matter how many times I told her. I really cannot live like this. I cannot wait till she moves out. Out of all of the people in my house I would have expected her to understand the most because she said I might have it and she said she did research on it. She makes me so mad. I feel so hopeless and misunderstood. I want her to understand more than anyone else in the house because she is my sister and I love her and look up to her. I skipped dinner because she would not stop (which I never do because I love eating dinner with my family). And I have been really bitter for the rest of the day which I cannot help. I just wish she understood. How can I make her understand idk how I can survive 3 more years of this. Please does anyone have any advice. This is not really advice, but rather I am in the same boat. Sometimes my sister will tell me that I am overreacting or that if it were her, she just would not show her reactions to the sound. I guess it is hard for people who do not have misophonia to understand that you cannot really control how the sounds make you feel. If possible, I would try to sit down with her and show her other people's stories or articles on it. Thank you I will try this! Best advice I can give: invest in a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones. They are the only reason I am able to eat meals with others...they are the only reason I am able to do a lot more now than I have ever been able to do before. I just turn on light white noise with the tone and pitch I like and I can still hear conversations, but I do not have to hear my triggers. They get me through *so* much - honestly one of the best investments I have ever made. The only difficult part is making sure my voice volume stays normal while I have got them on. I have been using them for years now and my hearing has not declined at all (I am tested at least twice a year for my job) so they do not damage my ears, but they do help me significantly.\n\nI really hope that she eventually understands this condition better and comes around to support you! It is taken my family years and years, but they are pretty good, now. Do not give up hope! Which ones did you get? I have the Bose QuietComfort 35. Their noise-cancelling aspect is pretty good, and they are super soft on my head/very comfortable. I like them a lot, but I know a few other misophoniacs who prefer various Sony headphones, as the noise-cancelling aspect is reported to be better...I have not personally tried anything else, so I do not know the differences too well. Thank you kindly You are so welcome! Best of luck to you on your journey through a world full of triggers.", "Misophonia increases cognitive function?  I am not a person to listen to music when my triggers are present, it is as serious for some as that. For some, I do listen to music. Aside from that, when it gets shitty, I just listen to noise. I find that my brain is not focusing half on the music and I am more focused on what I am doing. People also cannot just say something to get my attention, because of how loud I have it (My friend is amazed I can deal with the volume.) As a programmer, I find myself often solving problems, and it is really hard to do that with music, as listening to the music gives me more of the instant dopamine than trying to fix a bug does, so I just listen to the music and get nowhere with it. From this I can say that having misophonia increases my cognitive function by forcing me to essentially disable one of my senses. By doing this it increases focus and IQ since your IQ stays around the same range, changing based on many outside things like focus and stress. Is this post me trying to be a doctor? Idk. Pretty cool shit. I wish I was this lucky. Usually, I have to pop headphones in but if I have to listen to music loudly to block out the noise, I just struggle to focus. It is like a snowball effect. I heard somewhere noise is harder for females to phase out or something, and I listen to noise I listen to music or noise with noise cancelling headphones at work, and people need to wave their hands in front of me to get my attention because I am so focused. I hate that shit :( I have the same (or incredibly similar) experience. I do not like to put labels on things like ADHD, OCD, Aspergers, etc. but rather pay attention to the symptoms. And with that, I wholeheartedly relate to the symptoms you are describing.\n\nOne exception: I do not care about IQ, and have no idea what mine is. IQ is *probably* a significantly more dominant subject in the tech industry, like programming. :)\n\nBut your post is relatable in that I feel better able to notice  and appreciate (or detest) the little things \u2014 way more than others. Like the birds chirping, and the wind blowing through the leaves and grass, and the basslines in the music, the background support guitar in the music, and the throat clearing from a long frisbee shot away.\n\nGood, rhythmic, harmonious, deep, \u201cinteresting\u201d music can give me a dopamine shot as well. However ..... for me, it actually helps *tons* because I am in the art &amp; design field, and certain preferred styles of music help inspire my art and designs. :P", "Summary of last week's Dr. Kumar research After reading Dr. Kumar\u2019s study from Friday, here is my attempt to explain it in simple terms: \n\nThey found in fMRI brain scans of people with misophonia:\n\nRather than the auditory part of the brain involved with hearing, it is the part of the brain responsible for moving parts of your face that gets activated upon hearing or seeing misophonia triggers. ie. controlling the muscles in your mouth, throat etc\u2026 This involuntary brain activity when you are not actually making the movement yourself may be causing a sensation of loss of control which manifests as anger. This could also help explain why mimicking the sound during a trigger helps many people feel better. I think this is a huge and fascinating new insight that is part of the puzzle.\n\nPlease share to benefit anyone wanting to better understand the result. Also, here is the link to the study.\n\n The link is not working for me. Could you post the paper details so we can look it up, please? Or at least the title. Weird try this  Thanks!

Brown noise is similar to white noise but people are saying listening to it 8 hours a day can really help misophonia\nIt does not matter if you are awake or asleep so it would not be hard to get 8 hours in and you can play it during anything so you should try it Bump. Pink/brown noise is the only reason I can be in society lmao It do be like that tho\ud83d\ude1e I play brown noise in the house from 8p-10a, and sometimes longer. It is magic. That is good I hope it helps you no one deserves to go through misophonia we both know that It is the only way I can exist right now. My misophonia seems to get worse and worse. I have two small children that I love with all my heart, but unfortunately, many sounds they make are trigger noises.\n\nI usually sit here with my headphones on. And music. Only a few tracks block their sounds completely, though (I think I listened to \"Spending all my Time\" from Perfume a couple thousand times now), but the when I am not in the mood for lyrics, I choose pink or brown noise. Also when I sleep.\n\nI had to get used to xyz noise. I do not think it is pleasant and I would rather get rid of my misophonia, but ya... Since that is not possible, I am glad that brown, pink and other types of noise exist. i wonder what is the science behind it? i am desperate for any remedy I would be afraid to crap my pants\n\n Brown noise is EVERYTHING. I like brown noise too. Sometimes white noise is too sharp. What is the difference between white noise and brown/pink noise? I am a little confused about the end result. Does the brown noise help DURING the noise triggers, or does just listening to the noise for 8 hours a day reduce your reaction to your triggers over time, like \"retraining\" your brain?", "Mum is taking me to the doctors! I am the happiest I have been this entire lockdown I cannot believe it. I told my mum I needed to go to the doctors for something regarding my acne and she agreed and said after while we are there we should mention your \u201c weird eating noise problem\u201d. I told her about misophonia before and she did not believe me but she is seen how I react to people and she finally realised I need help. She is booking a session with the GP and hopefully they will refer me to CAMHS thought the waiting list is apparently forever. ( sorry if your not British the GP Is a general practitioner and CAMHS is the children adolescents mental health service). Does anyone know what the GP will talk about? Will he know misophonia or treat it as OCD or something? First of all well done and long may your new found happiness continue...\n\nMy experience of a CAMHS approach is from the early 90\u2019s and scared the shit out of me as I had to go to Hospital near Vauxhall Bridge Road that also had in patients wondering around as I was sitting alone in the waiting area and this really set me up for how I dealt with my own mental health over the years...but thankfully things have very much moved on from then.\n\nYour GP may not even know why you have made the appointment, depends on what info was relayed to the receptionist when making the appointment, and also dependd on their age too as a GP they will have a general medical knowledge and half the time will signpost/refer you to other services, you might even get a and what would you lime me to do about it at the end, this is an over simplification and not trying to diminish the work of medical staff.\n\nYou could be fortunate and the GP has dealt with someone with misophonia before or they were involved in some form of case conferencing about someone who has mentioned it. I had an episode about 18 months ago which forced me into going to the GP and after a few appointment got onto me finally mentioning some of my misophonia triggers, and my GP was like \u2018oh like Ricky Gervais, in After Life\u2019, so I watched it to see if there were any similarities. (yoga scene - \n\nCBT/talking therapy will most likely be the go to in treating misophonia, unless you are having adverse/extreme reactions to triggers.\n\nApologies for the essay, and good luck, just know what you want to explain and what outcome you would like from the appointment - will your mum be accompanying you and will you be comfortable with that?", "Advice on management Hi all!\nI am pretty sure I have both misophonia and hyperacusis. I experience what I imagine are sounds of normal volume really loudly and it hurts and is very uncomfortable. I have tried to brave through it because I do not want to baby my ears and make it worse. But it is too much - I can hardly stand to be around my family most of the time and it is really overwhelming. \n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to handle this better than I am handling it right now?", "How does intoxication affect your triggers? Hey fellow Misophoniacs, \nI have noticed that some drugs and also being drunk can alter my experience with misophonia drastically (for better and for worse!). \nOne time I tried a drug and my triggers were completely gone. A friend of mine ate the loudest, crunchiest nuts possible in front of me and for the first time in what felt forever I could process the noise like a neurotypical person would. \nHave you ever felt something like that? Yep, started a rough little addiction for me Understandable. That is why I only refered to the stimulant as 'drug' and also why I no longer consume it (the temptation surely is there!)\nHope you are doing better now! For sure its been a few years since ive felt the need to use.", "Has anybody ever lost a friend over their misophonia? tw: sounds I am new in the community, so sorry if this comes from poor judgement, or I do the wrong flair, etc.I did not add this to the normal misophonia reddit because I am not really sure where it belonged.  \n\n\nHas anybody ever lost a friend because they make a certain noise or just trigger you? I am not diagnosed and I am definitely on the lighter side of misophonia but it has been getting worse over the years, and has gone from 1 to 5 triggers in a span of a couple years. I can tolerate a lot of my triggers, sometimes even block them out but I 9/10 of the time want to escape and I get really irritated.   \n\n\nMy one friend, she is nice, I really like her but I actually enjoy not being around her. She makes so many annoying noises. I hate sniffing the most, but she also cracks her knuckles and she does this thing where she rubs her nose and it makes a very certain noise. Spending more than one hour than her is so exhausting, I just want to block her out. I feel really bad because she is so nice and does not judge me over everything whereas I am very uptight and can come off as nitpicky because she makes a wide range of annoying noises. I have had to stop watching a lot of twitch streamers who I was friends with because they do not know how to blow their nose. I guess that is the closest example I have. i had a friend who claimed to have misophonia herself after i told her i had it/what it is, and then proceeded to trigger me on purpose (which she admitted, which is how i know) to see what i would do. cut her off real fast. I had to drop out of regular school last year, and lost all my friends at once. I have not seen any of them since. Man.  I would watch the shit out of any twitch streamer that does a \"Misophonia friendly\" stream. Some streamers mute and black themselves out when they eat and stuff, which I really like. I guess I wish the media I watch - streams, YouTube, etc - I wish there was some content that was relatively safe to watch. I watch a fitness youtuber that does a lot of eating videos and I love watching him but he always sniffs. The entire video. Like the obnoxious loud sniff. Why????????", "Advice on dealing With Misophonia in a classroom setting? So, I am a college student, and my misophonia is starting to interfere with my education. Classrooms are chock full of tapping, typing, and chewing noises,  not to mention the sights of feet/legs shaking, all of which are terrible triggers for me. \n\nThe other day someone sat directly next to me and starting eating their lunch. I got so emotionally distressed I had to leave and missed out on the rest of the lecture. \n\nI take online classes and no-tech/food allowed classes when possible but the more I get into my major the more impossible this is to do. I have started wearing ear plugs in class and sitting by the front but it gets me dirty looks, and I am afraid to try to explain myself to my professors, who probably have not even heard of the disorder. \n\nSo, to anyone else in college or school: how do you deal with these unavoidable triggers ? I am in the same boat with you. But I would have to say it could be dependent on you and how your body takes in triggers. \n\nSo it seems like we have similar triggers but I know as for the eating/chewing stuff, mine is actually worse when it is all behind me but better when I place them in front. It is something I learned a long time ago so ever since then I always try to get a back row corner seat (corner as to avoid being surrounded). However, this often makes the legs and stuff worse but I try to pinpoint who the worst offender is and try to block my view with my computer, another students body, or an empty chair (aka easy to move for my convenience). I also wear earplugs but I use the tannish closer-to-my-skin colored ones instead of bright neon colors and often times people do not even notice. As for dealing with professors, I have found many to be understanding about the disorder when I email them or meet with them about it. One professor last semester actually told me to try and talk with the universities disability/etc group to see if they would help any. I usually only approach a professor about it when I know that triggers within the class will continue to absolutely disrupt my learning (when most of my methods are ineffective or fail). When you tell them this, they seem more understanding as well since most of them want you to learn. If you email them, try to link multiple websites and studies about miso at the bottom. They will be less likely to search it on their own but more likely when a link is conveniently provided. Thank you for the comment, it is always nice to get advice from someone who is dealing with the same things as you. I will definitly be looking for skin colored earplugs. (Mine are orange.) My triggers actually get worse if I see the person doing it, which sucks because I get anxiety (and very self-conscious) when people are sitting behind me. One good thing about higher level courses though is that the classes are smaller, so I try to sit in a way that is mostly away from others. Moving the empty desk to block leg shaking is a good idea, I had not even thought to do that.\n\nI know there was one semester where I really should have emailed a professor about it but I did not want to appear rude. She had a strict no laptop policy in her syllabus that she also mentioned the first day of class but she was not actually enforcing it after a few weeks, which was super frustrating. I wanted to email her and ask her to remind students not to use them, but I was not sure how. Providing links is a pretty good idea. Absolutely! I hated feeling alone in dealing with everything. \n\nLaptops were such a saver in one of my classes last semester with the way the chairs had no set arrangement and they were those spinning desk chairs. It was super unpredictable if I was going to be seeing a leg-shaker or not but I just kept my laptop open all class and turned it as needed, even if I was not using it. Also, I do not do this often but in smaller classes that use tables instead of desks I would sometimes throw my backpack on the table and have it filled enough to block the sight of a leg and possibly prevent someone being in the seat next to me. This was only if the class was small enough and lots of room though. \n\nI also actually had a teacher try and save a back seat for me when I explained the situation when it was a class I could not help be late for (all the way across campus from the previous class in 15mins). Definitely do not be too afraid to approach them because some of them are really proactive in helping. I am glad I learned that early on. \n\nAs for the earplugs, if tan is what you are looking for I found some within the Target health/beauty/etc aisles where I am at so if you have one nearby I would check there. If not I have gotten plenty from Amazon before. Black ear plugs, black hairband I go to secondary school but I wear earplugs in my classes that are triggering me. In high schools you can ask the counselor/dean and wear noise-cancelling headphones in classes, but I am not sure if that is the case for college. If you wanted to, it would not hurt to ask but it may affect your learning.   \n\n\nI went straight to my dean and I was accepted to wear ear plugs during classes, and separate accommodation in my school exams, and they barely asked me why or asked me for a doctor's notice. So, I think it is worth asking! They may not understand, but most professors/etc will be supportive and try to help you. Fellow college student here. Straight up, class is a nightmare. Reach out to your school's disabled student's program. I did this in my sophomore year and it was a major help, I now have a private test setting where I take my test alone with a proctor. They also gave me a device intended for hard of hearing people where the prof's lecture is streamed directly to your headphones via the device. I use noise cancelling bose so I end up just hearing the prof. Bring it up to your professor, as I know I am biased when I taught intro biology as a graduate assistant, I made sure students felt comfortable talking to me and if there was *anything* interfering with their education they could confidentially talk to me and I would make changes. You might be able to get a waiver or something too, saying it impacts your learning from the University/college physician, or any physician.", "is this miso? &amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Marked NSFW for trigger warning purposes\\*\\*\\*\n\ni am 22f and ever since i was 2, I have had strong reactions of anxiety, overwhelming sadness, and guilt around stuff that sings/dances/plays noise. it is almost always children's toys, but it can be church hymns, or even christmas decorations.\n\nit almost always happens when the music is particularly simple, and/or high pitched, like a nursery rhyme or a simple hymn. i did not react to these things when i was a baby, and to my knowledge i have not had any sort of traumatic experience to trigger this.\n\ndoes this sound like misophonia to anyone? to clarify, i am not looking for a diagnosis, i am just frustrated because i cannot seem to find any answers through internet research...", "Gone insane, be back in 5 I am so exhausted.

I love my grandma a lot so I can try to go through it but I have to walk away from my grandpa because he will keep chewing when the food is past mushy so it makes even worse sounds! Sometimes he will scrape his fork on his plate or against his knife and I will flinch. I accidentally threw mashed potatoes all over the place after he did it once I feel you.

That way friends may ask about it,  and I will have a chance to explain it in my own words.\n\nI honestly wish Misophonia had some sort of symbol, colour, emblem, flag, or logo. Just something that lets me silently represent my people. Keep in mind that these types of decals and stickers are just as much for the person as they are for everyone else. Misophonia is such a big part of my identity, I would want to represent it for the same reasons I have a Futurama t-shirt - it is part of my identity.\n\nIf you know what countries you would ship to, might not be a bad idea to add that to the post as well. \n\n(Mod here, by the way.

I really want some sort of symbol for it now, I would really like to have a way to represent it. I tell people about this condition whenever I can, but only if it comes naturally. Would love to have something as a conversation starter, or a way to just know if there is someone else with it. I have never met someone with it except for online. Maybe just the word \"Misophonia\" in a nice font is a good place to start. Really would like to have a symbol of some sort, but I honestly have no idea where to even start. It would not even really need to be a symbol, I guess. Maybe a character or colour scheme that we can build to represent Misophonia would still be cool. \r\n\nEither way, DM me if you end up making something.

", "Your earbuds the second you need them to avoid a trigger.  This is the first time I have seen a meme on here and I am here for it. Hee hee Everyone, please get a pair of wireless earbuds. You can get a decent pair on amazon for like 50 dollars. Mine pair fast and charge in the case so they always have some juice. Then they decide to not connect that exact time you need them and you have to go to settings and wait 30 seconds  So true lol This is why I got wireless earbuds... They are easier to manage and the ones I got are noise-cancelling. Not to mention they are easier to use when doing chores, exercising, etc. oh my gosh this is amazing TOO REAL Once you get them untangled and in your ears, someone invariably needs something via phone, email or coming to your desk. I swear mine have some kind of built in radar. Just about  EVERYTIME !!!", "Am I being horrible or does he just not understand? Hi everyone. I have had misophonia for years and like most other people, not really sure where it stemmed from. I avoid eating all crunchy/sticky foods, I mute the TV when food adverts come on, I wear earphones most of the day at work, I avoid the cinema because of all the popcorn, I leave the room when I can and if I cannot do any of these things I start sweating and desperatley thinking of ways to escape.\n\nThe issue is, my boyfriend eats cereal and apples every single day. A few months ago he noticed that I left the room every time or would sit with my fingers in my ears so I finally plucked up the courage to explain how I feel and that I think I have misophonia. He is so understanding when it comes to mental health etc so I thought he would under this.. but no.\n\nHe basically said I am \"making him self conscious\" about his eating... Which I found quite upsetting because if anything, I am the one that is self conscious and I am the one with the 'issue'. I miss out on parts of films/TV shows because I have to leave the room for 15 minutes when he brings out a packet of crisps.\n\nAm I being rude leaving the room/putting in earphones everytime I am triggered? Is there a way I can make him understand more? Would it be unreasonable for me to ask him to stop buying certain foods just to benefit me? (There are times I honestly consider stamping on his crisps/apples before he gets a chance to eat them)\n\nThanks I have had this conversation a few times myself with both negative and positive outcomes. I think letting people know that it is nothing against them. They are doing nothing wrong and that what you feel in the moment has nothing to do with their actions or their value. I recommend simply being open and honest. But most importantly, please remember you are doing nothing wrong. You just have to do certain things differently than most, but that does not make you bad or wrong. It just makes you a little different, and that is beautiful in it of itself. I wish you the best and try to remember that in the moments you are feeling most alone, that there are others out there that feel the same and wish the best for you. Neither of you are really wrong or really right. It just sucks. Having relationships with misophonia can be really hard unless you find someone that is naturally predisposed to being very kind and understanding and not easily set on the defensive, which is not actually a ton of people in my experience. I wish you the best with this awful affliction. If it makes him feel self conscious, I would just reassure him that you know it is not his fault and that you only leave the room because that is the healthiest way for you to deal with it. It is not to get away from him, it is just that you cannot be there for the time being. I personally always just leave the room because that is the only way I can guarantee I will no longer be exposed and then I do not have to fight it with ear buds, which makes me more on edge. You are not being awful, I do the same thing and I understand. I would just make sure he knows that leaving is when you feel most at peace, and then he will not have to be self conscious either. I would not try to fight it and sit there in mental anguish while he is eating, I feel that this could just brew resentment even if it is not super intentional. Best of luck. You are not being rude at all, and please do not ever think you are. Maybe send him an article on Misophonia and/or show him one of the posts in this thread where the person describes how it makes them feel. You definitely are not being horrible, you are voicing your concerns and communicating. You are simply doing all you can to educate him in the process of coping with misophonia. Not everyone is quite as understand as we would like them to be, and that is simply because of a lack of experience with something such as misophonia. Try talking to him a bit more about it. Explain there is nothing against him, it is just something you are trying to deal with and removing yourself from the situation is one of the best ways to stop any discomfort. You are not being rude! You have to do what works for you to cope. When I first told my friends about my misophonia I gave supplied them with information about it which helped them understand. Another thing I could suggest is writing him a note explaining how you feel. I did this with my mum and I left it next to her bed. This allowed her to process what the note said and when she was ready to talk about it she approached me and we could have a better conversation cause we were on more of the same page. Hope this helps!", "My misophonia is making my life and future unbearable, any tips are appreciated My misophonia has gotten a lot worse in the past few years. A few examples are that I was not able to go to lectures anymore due to the typing sounds of other students in my class and that a voice of a coworker drove me so crazy I was not able to work on the same day anymore. But now due to the fact that all the classes are online, I have noticed the mumbling TV sound of the neighbor below me. They start every day around 17.00 until after midnight, and it is driving me insane. I am constantly listening to headphones and the whole day I have anxiety and am scared for the sound to come. My home should be a safe place and now I dread being here, it is truly horrible. The factor that makes it even worse is that my partner barely hears it, which makes me feel even more insane (Talking to the neighbor is no option)\n\nMisophonia has impacted my life in such a big and negative way, I know there is no cure and I try to think about positive things or 'cover' the sound but this is not the way to live. Does anyone have any tips to cover such sounds or to accept them? I am doing a computer-related education, which means typing sounds at my future jobs are unavoidable, but if it keeps being this bad, a job in that sector will be impossible. I have not tried them myself but have seen adds for headphones that filter sound. I think the idea is you can still hear like people speaking but your trigger sounds are covered. Sorry you are going through this, misophonia sucks Sorry you are going through that. That anticipation anxiety sucks, because you are on edge all the time just waiting for the noise to start again. \n\nMy go-to for neighbor sounds is white noise and earplugs. I basically keep a fan on all day that makes \"white noise\" that is just loud enough to drown out things like voices and TVs. The earplugs on top of that drown out any louder noises and ensure I do not get annoyed at the fan being too loud, lol. \n\nIt is exhausting sometimes. For instance, my heart will skip a beat if I go to grab my earplugs and I think I have lost them. And sometimes I just want to not have shit in my ears or hear the fan. But this system works for me 90% of the time. I also know when I am in a good mood and well-rested, my tolerance for noises is better. So make sure you are taking good care of yourself :) Dude I totally feel you. I am currently going through the same thing with my neighbor. Have you given any thought to trying CBD? it is actually really calming. I have tried earplugs, and they help, it is no life changer but it does help a lot You are not insane, I would feel the same in your situation.\n\nI have also been using earplugs and headphones whenever it gets bad. Leaving the noisy area, going for a walk (if possible) is also the best thing to do in those moments.\n\nHave you considered Cognitive Behavioral therapy? I think there you might find some tools to help you in those instances. I personally went through a lot of therapy and understood that my misophonia came from pent up anger from a young age which I never learnt how to express any other way than through misophonia. I find that knowing that and learning how to express my feelings has helped lessen some of the symptoms. It might be a whole different back story for you but maybe worth investigating. Can feel you totally...My mom and dad are my biggest trigger sound generator i.e constantly sniffing and dragging feet. Besides that my upstairs neighbour are continuously stomping. For coping I mostly stay in my lawn so by that means I avoid triggers till evening. On bad weather day I am wearing headphones 14 15 hrs. Still have not come up with solution for sleep time though", "Something you do not see every day My mom has known about my misophonia since the moment I discovered it was a thing. After a long time, I decided to have an open discussion with her about it. I talked to her about my feelings, my fears, how i cope with my triggers and it was generally very relieving to see that she was supportive and tried to understand me. \nSo, I thought I might spread some positivity in this thread :) I cannot be sure that everyone will find someone, but I think that opening up to people you truly trust can be helpful. Aww :) that is really sweet for your mum to understand, and you to feel confident enough to open up. My parents do not care, so I have got reddit, at least. This sub has really helped me Really hope you will find the person you can open up to :( Thanks :)", "Does anyone here use the AirPods Pro for noise cancelling? If so, are they worth the price? So, they are Apple and therefore pricey. I had the opportunity to try them on today though for a couple minutes and was quite impressed with the noise-cancelling setting. I am not a big headphones person, and currently I use Vibes Earplugs which are pretty much useless in terms of taming misophonia. Anyway, I was wondering whether anyone here uses them for this purpose? If so, how effective are they at blocking chewing and similar noise-level sounds? I have AirPods Pro and they have worked better than any other earbuds I have used (I do not like headphones so I cannot compare them to some nice noise cancelling headphones) they cancel noise very well and the sound is high quality as well. I never go on a car ride with my family without bringing them just in case.  If you just want some ear plugs these ( are apparently very helpful for misophonia. I have some, I have only tried them once and they completely blocked out a trigger sound for me \nNote* I was walking around the house passing the sound a few times, not sitting right by if for any long period of time; it is not my worst trigger sound so idk how well it would block out a sound I am more sensitive too. But there have been good reviews of it helping with misophonia so I would check it out if you are interested.\nSorry to get off topic with the earplugs. To keep it simple, for me my air pods have worked well for me, occasionally some sounds might slip through but it is still better than anything else I have tried. Do more research  if you would like bc perhaps there is something just as good if not better that is not as expensive. But that is my experience :) I do, joined with pinknoise airpods pro are great, just make sure to have backup earbuds for when they run out of battery. Thank you so much! Great to hear. I remember coming across those earplugs a while back, not sure what made me decide against. I am going to reconsider for sure. The ones I currently have (Vibes) are also \u2018no muffling, let sound in clearly\u2019 and turned out not to block things enough. Will check out reviews, and consider the AirPods :) Good point! How long does the battery last in your experience? I would say about 2-3 hours Ah shorter than I expected It depends on volume and noise canceling you can get 4 ish out of them if you are frugal, they are fast to charge though, about 30 minutes", "Tips on finding an apt complex with misophonia? When I was traveling working remotely, I would often switch hotel rooms to get a very quiet one. Now that I am back in my home country, living with parents is not an option (too loud), so I moved into an apt complex. On the first day, my next door neighbor is screaming into the phone and I can hear his kid late at night. Sucks because it is a minimum 2 month lease before I can break the contract. But I am thinking of just eating the cost and living somewhere else. Fucking sucks but why is it so hard to find a place where people can just shut the fuck up and let me work in peace. Look for units on the highest floor so you dont have foot traffic over head and try and be on the end of the building so you are not surrounded by other apartments and can get some relief. Also invest in white noise, head phones and ear plugs. The caveat with apartments and misophonia is you have very little control over the noise pollution. Good Luck and may the odds be ever in your favor! If you can, avoid family-friendly and pet-friendly complexes. A complex/building in a larger complex that is not family friendly will only have one bedroom or studio apartments.\n\nGet a top floor end unit, with as few shared walls as possible. If you can find a place where your bedroom does not share walls with anyone, that would be even more ideal. \n\nMake sure you have double pane windows to block out outside noises. \n\nCarpet in a rental is disgusting, but I would always prefer my neighbors to have carpet to muffle the noise of their footsteps. I second the top floor end unit comments. Also avoid apartments that are close to busy roads; bass and motors revving drive me nuts so I steer clear of those. \n\nWatch out for the structural composition of some apartments. Some older apartments were built to be indestructible with materials like block, which I have found is really helpful for sound insulation. Other older apartments seem to be made of twig and paint, so avoid those. Same goes for newer apartments -- some newer apartments have awesome insulation (made of concrete) whereas others really skimped out on quality material for the sake of building fast. \n\nGood luck, OP. I have had my share of shitty neighbors and equally shitty building quality so I know how painful it is. Try and live on the top floor. Another thing you can do is research local noise ordinance hours and ask the staff at leasing offices how familiar they are, whether they have had issues with noise complaints, and how they would handle it if there was an issue. Some apartments take noise violations seriously and actually evict tenants who repeatedly violate them, while others do not really give a shit. I hear my downstairs neighbors tv all day long. Just the bass-y sounds. It drives me INSANE. I have my Alexa devices playing brown noise or \u201cairplane sounds\u201d all day (the google home\u2019s airplane sounds are different than Alexa\u2019s.) and it helps drown those sounds out sooo well. Echo dots are only about $30 usd as well so not too bad.", "My sister keeps yawning on purpose to trigger me, and she knows it. I gulp continuously when she is around.

Please help.", "My misophonia is gone I was hospitalized a month and a half ago for extreme mental health reasons, and I was prescribed antidepressants. I work with kids full time, and I noticed a few days after I started the meds, during the kids snack time, I was not getting triggered by their chewing or repetitive jaw movements. In fact, I had not even noticed they started eating. Over the next few days I tested to see if it was really gone by having family eat in front of me and going to dinner for a friends birthday. Well, I can say with certainty it is gone. I have been struggling with misophonia for 10 years and I feel so free. These meds have been a miracle and life saver for me, and getting rid of my miso was the least of my expectations. It is truly a wonderful feeling. For all of you who continue to suffer with misophonia, I empathize with you and I am sorry. You are wonderful and you are worth it. I really just wanted to share this because it is been life changing. Thanks for reading. Holy cow! That is amazing. Wow! Can I ask what meds (understanding they will not work for everyone). As a nurse I am more curious about the possible mechanism of action (dopamine v. SSRI v. SNRI)\n\nThat is amazing. I know mine gets a lot better when stress and anxiety are managed, but never gone 100%. What a dream! \u2764\ufe0f Yeah! I started on 10 mg of lexapro and recently increased to 15 mg! Using them for recurring major depression and OCD\n\n\nAnd thanks! I am so happy for you!  So happy!  I take 10mg Lexapro for anxiety and depression. What I would say for me is that overall I feel better. I would not say at all that my misaphonia is gone but if I sleep well and stay healthy, it is less. But when I am fatigued, no. Which antidepressent is it? I ask because I have a script for Lexapro and want to try but have been so scared of side effects :( I will say that Zoloft takes the edge off mine. It could very well be serotonin since OP and I take two different SSRIs I take lexapro as well. Personally, the only side effects I experience are vivid dreams and occasional fatigue. My dreams are regular dreams, not nightmares. They are just very vivid and feel real so I confuse them with reality sometimes. Honestly the side effects are nothing compared to how much better I feel depression wise. (I might need another increase in my dosage to help with my ocd). Antidepressants have different effects for everyone. Lexapro may or may not work for you, but you never know until you try. If your side effects become difficult to handle then ask your doctor to decrease the dosage or switch meds and try something else. Personally I am very glad I chose to start meds, it is worth it. Best of luck to you! \u2764\ufe0f Thank you! And yeah good sleep definitely seems to make miso more bearable for many people. I am glad that it helps you just a bit at the very least There was a case study published a little while ago of an SSRI seeming to resolve misophonia. \n\nI have avoided SSRIs in favor of an SNRI, but maybe I will need to reconsider that. I really hate the idea risking the sexual dysfunction side effects though. :/ I have been on bupropion for years and I can attest that it has not resolved my misophonia, haha. Womp womp :( yeah, sertraline here. Certainly helped but did not get rid of. Maybe someday they will find a treatment/cure. Seems to be getting more attention than it used to. Omg! That is amazing. I can just imagine the tears coming when you realised. Lucky you. When I was on antidepressants, it only caused headaches, fatigue and blurry vision and I did have my misophonia back then too. I am glad it works for you, however not a *one size fits all* solution. No, of course it is not a solution for all. Just happened to solve something I was not expecting it to. I am very sorry for your experience with meds, that is unfortunate. I am very interested in how an SSRI could have that effect, and happy for you. \n\nI have been on a very wide variety of psychiatric meds over the past 23 years, for a variety of reasons, but I remember all the meds and what they did and did not do for me... I tried Lexapro/Celexa (cannot remember which, but they are almost the same molecule) but it essentially turned my sexual functions \u201coff\u201d, so it did not last long.\n\nSeroquel did zonk me out enough that I did not have the mental energy to care about noises, but it was not pleasant overall. I feel so good for u that u have recovered from it bro!! I just switched from an SNRI (venlafaxine) to an SSRI (fluoxetine) and it is still too soon to tell but I have high hopes! Lexapro was my next choice but since it is also an ssri, maybe I will be okay with this one too. I *just* started an antidepressant (but it is duloxetine) just 3 days ago and this is so refreshing to hear. I really hope the same happens for me. I cannot imagine the joy you must feel. Congratulations!", "How do I tell others that I do not like the noises they are making without them taking offense? Recently, my one sibling is trying to learn how to roll their tongue while my other sibling keeps singing the same song over and over again.\n\nOne of my triggers is repetitive sounds/noises, so I get triggered by both of them.\n\nIf I tell them to stop, and they ask why, do I just say it makes me uncomfortable?\n\nI once tried telling the older sibling to stop singing (this is weeks before) because it disturbs me, but they just looked at me weirdly and then they forgot the next day. Either they are forgetful or they just do not care. if they ask why, just be honest about it. you dont have to say \"oh, i have misophonia\" (unless you want to of course, but that would most likely lead to explanations and more questions), but you can simply say it bothers you, or say you get \"sensory overload\" which is the phrasing i always use. usually people get the point when i say that. the real key is just making sure that they dont feel like they did anything wrong. i thought about making a quick communication card with all the brief but important info on there. you do not ha7e to list your triggers, just explain that common noises cause an intense emotional reaction and so on :) i just ne7er had the time to do it but there is an idea for you and with family and friends, it is best to explain it to them when not triggered so as to not start an argument bc that is happened with me and it is not pretty :/ bring up all the official websites and research and explain it logically, if they are still not understanding then it will either take time or they are just major buttholes In my experience you cannot.  People will get mad at you if you do.\n\nThe only thing I can do is leave the room when people are making trigger noises.  Then they are the ones who have to complain about you. I use this metaphor: If someone has really strong cologne it can feel overwhelming if you cannot avoid breathing it in, for me it is the same with sounds that I cannot avoid hearing. Some sounds are \"strong\" and overwhelming in the same way.\n\nThough they are more like strong body odor.

Some people also manage to not trigger me but it is a very select few so I am not exactly sure why.\n\nI do have complete control over my reactions and I do not get angry but quite often especially in silent classes listening to someone making my trigger noises makes me cover my ears and I really want it to end so I do not have to listen anymore.

I sleep like 4-5 broken hours a night because the sound travels so much. There are neighbours upstairs that walk around on creaky floors between 3-4:30 am, a neighbour downstairs who chain smokes and coughs (it is a muffled quiet cough and quiet/muffled voices are one of my triggers), a third neighbour who is hard of hearing and lets his alarm go in the early mornings, and now there is a flat, dull, repetitive thumping noise coming from the walls that stops and starts without reason.\n\nI use a white noise machine and sometimes a white noise app on top of it. But I can still hear all those noises. I wear foam drugstore earplugs when I really have to but they are so uncomfortable that sometimes in my sleep I remove them. Also, they do not totally block out the noises, even with the white noise going. And when I can hear my own heartbeat and internal noises it can also keep me awake. \n\nI am seriously at a loss and feeling so hopeless. I cannot afford to move again and was lucky to find a place where I can afford to live alone. But I guess I do not feel like I actually live alone, with all this noise pollution. \n\nCan anyone recommend ear plugs that you can sleep in if you are a stomach and side sleeper? And that block out low frequency noises? I am willing to invest in something if they are really effective cuz I am feeling pretty stuck here for the time being (and know that wherever I end up, different triggers will get unlocked). Thanks so much. I highly recommend Mack's Ultra Soft Foam Earplugs\u2014 I have worn them pretty much every night since I moved into a noisy living situation in 2012. In fact I am still wearing them right now during my wake up Reddit scroll! Just be warned that they have been somewhat habit forming for me; I have trouble sleeping without them even though my bedroom is now much quieter. Also do not use the same pair for multiple nights. Ear infections are no fun. OP this is going to sound dumb and complicated but hear me out! It is saved my sanity, you might be able to adapt elements from it.\n\n\n\nI use a box fan, one of the small ones you can put on a bedside table. It needs to be either on an end table that is level with your bed, or on the floor next to you if the mattress is on the floor (this actually works better).\n\n\n\nA relatively firm pillow magnifies the effect. If you position your pillow so that it kind of picks up some of the vibration from the box fan (the vibration you can feel is more important than the sound of it) , you get this lovely low, constant drone that takes the edge off other sounds. \n\n\n\nIf you are on a bed you might need to position the pillow so a corner of it is in contact with the end table. Otherwise, it should travel through the floor. I pair this with silicone earplugs, as the foam ones cause me terrible pain. \n\n\nOf course this only works if you can tolerate low, constant droning sounds. I use it for traffic sounds, which while awful are not as sudden as thumping, footsteps or coughing. It *does* give your brain some background noise though, which could lessen the shock of at least some of those sounds. Thank you!! Thank you! Appreciate your creativity! I sleep in these earplugs called dBuds. I do not know if they are worth the cost compared to other earplugs, I bought them impulsively when I lived in a noisy apartment building and before trying cheaper options. But for what it is worth, they help me, and they are comfortable enough to sleep in. I used these plus a cheap but loud box fan. \n\nAnother game changer have been noise cancelling bluetooth ear buds. The brand I use is called Jabra. They are great at blocking out neighbor noises. I basically live in these, which probably is not great, but at least I am not having melt downs due to noise.\n\nA third thing I did when I lived in a noisy building was line my front door with sound-insulating material. This is the ( I got. This will only be useful if sound is coming though any doors, obviously. I had a front door right in front of a staircase so I could hear people going up and down all day and night. This helped a bit. They also make wall panels but those will not be useful unless you fully cover the walls, which would be ridiculously expensive (I considered this at one point lol). I use loop I do not remember the name, but I bought ones from the Home Depot for heave duty/loud tools and are comfortable as they are design for long hours, they completely block the sound.\n\nAlso, lately I have been sleeping in earphones, the JBL are really good, block the sound, the caps do not detach and you can put on some white noises from your phone or another device.\n\nGood luck, I hope things get better.", "Microsoft, please save us.

I am going insane, I felt so violently angry and upset and depressed all at once.\n\nI have tried about four times this year to explain that she is a bit loud on call, and to keep it down, and not once has she ever actually kept it down... she can be on call, like my other flatmate is frequently, and not disturb me so badly. \n\nI want to tell her how much distress I am in when she does that. But she is very much self centered when it  comes to everything (e.g loudness, always centering conversation around herself, crosses boundaries, gets weird if people do not do what she asks) so she does not usually understand the concept of being aware of other people and their boundaries. \n\nI just feel hopeless, and hate that I wish so much hate and harm on her. Life sucks when it comes to dealing with people. You can do everything right, be considerate and understanding, but you will always find someone who does not care about such values and will still have the same right to live in that flat just because she pays for it. This makes me mad too. It is true, I do not ask much, for something as simple as putting earphones on for calls longer than an hour, for the sake of my sanity. Not only that, shes previously complained about the neighbour being on call loudly, and even her housemate last year doing the same. A complete lack of awareness and hypocrisy :-(\n\nI agree though, the house we have is lovely and the other flatmates are fun, outgoing, etc but respectful about noise (without me ever asking). So it is sad that we have her as the sole cause of trouble in this nice house. I have a friend that is like an exact carbon copy of your flatmate, and the fun thing is, we are actually going to be flatmates starting with autumn. Thank god our rooms are really far apart though.

Just like the title says I am really considering gauging out my ear drums. I have been suffering misophonia since I was 16 and it is been getting worse. My trigger seems to be mouth noises. Lately whenever my parents eat it bother the absolute crap out of me and do not even get me started on when my pets lick themselves. My mom tries to understand and help me by reducing the sounds but it does not feel like it is helping. My dad just completely gaslights me on the subject and when I try to explain it to him it feels like I am talking to brick wall. I am really considering becoming deaf. I may just be overreacting like my dad says but I cannot take it any longer. Wow you sound really frustrated. I am sorry. \n\nThis whole deal sucks. I have had it a while, and honestly I just learned to live with it day by day. \n\nAre there any sounds that you enjoy? I think is pretty common for some of us to really love some sounds. I just love music. I collect music, and I DJ for myself. I could not live without music. My love of music to me is the other side of the same coin.\n\n I hope it gets better for you and that your parents learn to understand. Thank you for your concern. Like you said I will just have to learn to deal with it. It just sucks because I cannot move out and get my own place because of COVID so I have to suffer for a bit longer. As for sounds? I guess I could say I like listening to music quite a lot. As for my dad I doubt he will ever understand but thanks anyway. Have you got a big container of Mack's super soft ear plugs? I use those all the time. Then I have got little bluetooth  earbuds for listening to music and then some over-the-ear headphones for when I just need to completely blocked out everything.\n\nHang in there. People really do not understand this yet. But things are coming around. Would your dad be receptive to NPR? This article on the radio show was what finally made me understand that I was not crazy and I was not alone and led me right to this sub.\n\n I have noise canceling headphones that I begged for but when I am watching a movie or a tv show with my parents I cannot use them. My dad is so old fashioned in how he acts and thinks that even if I was to show this to him he would still deny it. It is so frustrating. I am sorry, misophonia is so frustrating. Mouth noises are my main trigger as well. Hang in there , sending love Thank you. Holy crap. You sound exactly like me. Those are my two worst trigger sounds as well, and my parents do the same thing. I often wish I was deaf as well.\n\nI am so sorry you are dealing with this as well. I hope you find something to help soon. I am glad I am not alone. Not I that I wish for someone else to suffer, just that I am not crazy. As far as I have researched about misophonia, there is no cure. But thanks for the optimism. I hope yours gets better too. It will never get better only worse I just do not eat with other people or leave the room.  Like I am helping my mom after she got out of hospital and she starts eating chips.. crunching away and I just leave the room till she is done. It''s the only way.. but FFS do not poke your ears out.. they are handy for a lot of things! Sadly. Well I am glad you are able to get away from your mom when she starts to eat. I live in a 2 bedroomed apartment so it is not as easy for me to get away unless I decide to lock myself in my room. As for my ears I was only considering doing it because I feel like I am going crazy from the noises. Pls look into noise reducing headphones, you will be able to use them while watching tv and stuff. I dont think you are over reacting at all. This is a constant disturbance to our 'energy' and its exhausting to deal with, especially with people who dont or wont understand. \n\nI had a similar thought the other day, then thought about how vulnerable I would be if that were actually the case. I even started looking into learning sign language. I have no easy answer, but please dont harm yourself further, hang in there until you can finally leave your parents home and set up a safe space for yourself. Thank you for your concern and for the advice. I really appreciate it. :) First of all I really resonate with you and I am so sorry you are struggling so much. My family thinks it is rude when I wear headphones around them so I understand about your dad. I know somebody already mentioned ear plugs, but the best solution I have found is wearing only one earplug (one of the clear soft ones) in one ear and leaving the other open. I can still hear people around me but it is so muffled that the noises that trigger me are significantly reduced. No one knows I wear it because it is clear and it has helped me SO MUCH. I absolutely agree and am envious of my boyfriend who has to wear hearing aids. He can not hear the barking of the neighbor's 3 dogs, their no stop loud music, my other neighbor who constantly screams and fights with his wife, and asks me to repeat everything I say.\n\nI am envious that he can shut the world out by turning his hearing up and down. Thank you for your concern. I really appreciate it. I would love to do the one earplug trick but sadly the frequency at which my animals like to lick themselves at makes it really hard to ignore no matter how loud whatever I am listening to is.

Any advice on how I can deal with it? It makes mealtimes and seeing family/friends stressful/ unpleasant for me. most likely, yes. it varies for a lot of people but in general if theres an urgent feeling to escape certain sounds then you probably have some level of misophonia. essentially, these noises you described trigger the \"fight or flight\" reaction in your brain when they are not supposed to. \n\nplease try to get your family and friends to understand as soon as possible. it sucks that it is not recognized as a real mental condition, as far as i know. fortunately, my family lets me put on music whenever we eat a meal with loud foods. i had been describing misophonia to them for years, but nobody actually understood the gravity of my condition until i had a violent outburst followed by a mental breakdown from hearing my brother eat a single chip. you will have to learn to control the terrible feelings and intrusive thoughts that misophonia carries, and i pray that it does not worsen for you like it has for me Yes you do. Try to avoid it so it does not become worse. You can try to explain misophonia to people, but in my experience those people who do such sounds are usually the most inconsiderate people I have ever seen. They do not care what bothers others and that is why they do those sounds. That is why I avoid them because trying to work with them is pointless. Most likely, especially if it is difficult for you to block out the sounds that affect you. It is fairly normal to be irritated by some sounds, but for most people it is easy to block out these sounds - if you cannot just ignore it, you likely have misophonia.\n\nI would advise getting some kind of earplugs if you can.", "How can I explain it to someone/ hoping for advice  Sorry, your post has been removed as your account is under 10 days old.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To give them the benefit of the doubt, they did not know, either, but I am always amazed when parents do not treat their kids like people who deserve respect, care, and love. For now, keep some ear plugs or headphones in your room for if/when your parents do this again. I also want to add that I am a parent now. I have one kid with sensory issues and one without. The kid with sensory issues (14-YO boy) cannot be in loud, crowded places. We adapt. It is who he is and we respect that. I honestly do not think I ever did anything that mean to any of my kids.

So it makes me think maybe I am just imagining it and that it does not really bother me '\\_' HOW DO I KNOW IF I ACTUALLY HAVE MISOPHONIA ? MY BREATHING SOMETIMES GETS HEAVY WHEN I HEAR THE TRIGGER SOUNDS AND I WANT TO KILL EVERYONE. BUT SOMETIMES I JUST THINK I AM FAKING IT BECAUSE SOMETIMES I LISTEN TO MY PARENTS MAKING THESE SOUNDS AND THOSE SOUNDS JUST FILL MY EAR BUT I DO NOT FEEL ANGRY OR THE NEED TO CRY. I think everyone has different trigger sounds. It might not be breathing for you but other sounds.", "Aside from sounds and visual triggers, do you have other sensitivities? I have misophonia and notice that not only do the sounds trigger and irritate me, wearing certain clothes and other small things like that will bother me. It is like it all comes together, the sounds, the feeling of clothes, and if it all happens at once it can lead to me having to leave or getting close to tears. I have always been an anxious and sensitive person in general, and I am wondering if anyone else has a similar experience. I would really appreciate any input on anger/frustration due to sensitivity of triggers other than sound, because I am curious if anyone else is in a similar situation as me. And if you are, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance! Yes!\n\nAnd it is a strange one.\n\nThe very dry paper napkins that are used to wrap cutlery in a diner. The feel of them. OMG I am triggering myself. So even the thought of them...\n\nI also understand that I am a very sensitive person, although 20 year old me would never have believed it. YES!  \n\n\nI absolutely DESPISE the feeling of pants like leggings, pyjama pants, etc on my calves. Like, when they ride up your legs and stay there... I especially hate it when I am in bed and trying to relax. I also hate the feeling of things digging into my feet (rocks in my shoes, anything between my toes).  \n\n\nMost of these are pretty normal for people to dislike I think but when I experience them I want to cry and I get SO angry and frustrated! Ah, I totally get that! Some textures can be triggering for me as well. When you say that you never would have believed it before, do you mean that you became more sensitive as you got older? Or just did not realize how sensitive you actually were at the time? That is exactly how I feel! While I have different things about clothes that bother me, it is the exact same emotion as you described. For me it is just wearing jeans or certain t shirts. I will wear them out and be okay, but as soon as I come home and try to relax I will immediately change my clothes into something more comfortable that does not trigger me. Tags on clothing. Having even the slightest bit of stickiness on my hands. Food mess. Yeah!! I absolutely cannot get comfortable or relax in 'casual' clothes, I have to be wearing pyjamas or something similar! Yup, which seems to come to the idea if miso is just a symptom of something bigger. Certain things touching me can be painful and something tickling my skin/hair gives me anxiety and anger. The head on my head is kept quite short and shaving the majority of my body hair seems to help(which i only discovered a few months ago) with the pain/tickling issue. YES I HATE THOSE I know this thread is pretty old but yeeeesss I get these so bad, and like the feeling toilet paper on my fingers, the feeling of wooden spoons, if i walk on concrete with bare feet and others I cannot remember right now hahaha. My family think I am mad when I start fully freaking out because I licked an ice lolly stick by accident. Does anyone else get the feeling that they can feel it in their teeth and mouth for a while after as well? its horrible.  Yeah, and for my sound triggers they will just echo in my head over and over again. And certain textures will drive me crazy sometimes", "story of my life  Now this is a mood.

What my aunt and stepmother work in medical coding and they both work at home. Problem is keyboards are one of my triggers. I have a silent keyboard at home but I would need to do some training in an office first an I am not sure how well I could do that. Thanks for responding. No worries. I guess if you had to go into an office I would look for somewhere busy and large, the busier the better. That way it is more likely that any trigger sounds will be drowned out by the general hubbub. Not ideal, and there will always be something that triggers you, but then you can find coping mechanisms for specific issues. \n\nI wish you luck with it! I am a paralegal in a office where all the sounds can be a trigger (copier, fax machine, squeeky hole punchers, staplers, typing sounds, one of my coworkers listening to Howard Stern ALL day EVERY day, the other one who constantly taps his pen on his desk and pops his gum, and my boss making gross sounds in his office like sucking his teeth or whatever the hell he is doing in there) to name a few! I just shove my earbuds as far into my brain as I can and try my best to get through the day. So I would say anything where you can wear ear buds, ear plugs or headphones might be doable. I hope you find something that works out for you!\u2764\ufe0f Thanks. I used to be a press operator in a dirty metal auto parts factory. the machines were so loud that we all wore ear plugs, so that covered my triggers up pretty nicely. Did not have to hear any spit sounds from my coworkers!!! Do not recommend being an mri tech. Just sayin. Everyone has given good suggestions. I do not have anything to add, but I wish you the best. I was constantly stressed out about where to work in order to minimize my triggers, so I feel for you. Not sure if you have a particular skill set or educational background, but if you work somewhere that is busy in terms of manufacturing, all the different sounds drown out any particular triggers much of the time. Many tradesmen (solderers, machinists, etc.) make good wages, and work through their whole shifts without having to say a word to anyone else. Some manufacturing floors require ear protection by default.\n\nI worked in labs and sterile manufacturing environments where there are HEPA filters running  24/7, so there is constant white noise, which was a blessing to say the least. After transitioning to desk jockey, it is much more difficult. Keyboards are a nightmare. People with long nails typing, especially acrylic, takes me to a very bad place. Neighbors snacking incessantly with open mouth chewing is unbearable. I make it a point to always be sure it is acceptable with my bosses that I can wear headphones.\n\nUnfortunately, working remotely has been the only ideal scenario. This past year has been the least stressful work experience of my life.\n\nGood luck! I am going to be starting a job cleaning a bank during the nighttime when no one is there- low-paying, but it is a start. Great for if you also deal with social anxiety and getting v overwhelmed No thanks. That is where most of my triggers are. I have found having a field based job really helpful. This means I am never in one spot or location for too long (meaning I can get away from triggers) \u263a\ufe0f", "Melted down at work today Just now actually. Someone was in the process of signing up for our club store. She was popping her gum repeatedly. I was working with different people nearby, and I kept losing my place and making mistakes. I could hear nothing but her popping and clipping and sucking that fucking gum. I was trying to take an emergency break but could not make my register open (something I do 1000 times a day). I completely broke down and started doing this panicky sob. Now I am hiding out in my car trying to get it together. But hey, at least my coworkers may believe me when I say it is more than annoying to me. So sorry to hear that, having it sneak up at you like that must have been difficult to prepare for. \n\nLooking back on it now (or later once you get your feet back under you), do you think that there might have been something you could have tried to do to get it (or her) under control before you broke down? I know that there is an enormous risk in asking her to stop, she could retaliate, but do you think that there is a way you could have asked while reducing that risk? Could / should you have walked off?\n\nJust curious what your thoughts are on building a strategy for these situations, I am trying to help a friend build theirs. Typically the strategy is 'just deal with it' because of so many failures in asking for help. You do not deserve that. Nobody does. But you made it through another one, and you are stronger than anyone you know. I hope that strength continues to support you. I am so sorry. I absolutely hate being in that position where you cannot just easily leave and avoid it. Since your coworkers are somewhat aware, do you think they would mind if next time it happens you just excuse yourself for a few minutes and use the restroom or something? Or find another task that does not involve being in that area? It is at least worth it to ask especially if they seem empathetic. I used to deal with a coworker that popped her gum repeatedly and I had to start bringing earplugs to work to avoid it because it was causing me so much distress that I would also make mistakes on my work because I was fixating on that gum. I feel for you and I hope your coworkers can be objective and understand that this issue is out of your control. Were you ever able to ask them to stop? There was a language barrier between us and at the time I also really felt a lot of anxiety about asking her to stop. I did not want to rock the boat so I suffered in silence for a long time unfortunately. :( This might help you craft the discussion in the future. I know many hesitate to ask for help because they have been laughed at or worse, but you can only get help if you ask for it...  \n\nLetter to Friends, Family, and Coworkers\n\n(\n\nI always say that you should not fear rocking the boat, but you do need a strategy to deal with when you sink the boat. You deal with pain all the time, pain that would kill a normal human being but you have developed super powers, and you are the bravest person you will ever meet. Rude people are Rats, and the Dog eats the Rat. Be the Dog! Eat the Rat! You have nothing to be ashamed of, even when they try to shame you.\n\nGood luck! What I want to know is what kind of person can pop their gum repeatedly like a machine gun? I have heard it and it drives me up a wall.", "My mom completely lost it on me over a \u201cglare\u201d I came downstairs to ask her a question and she was sitting on the couch with a bag of chips beside her... I guess I kind of stood in front of her putting two and two together but trying so hard not to say or do anything about it. Well that was not good enough because she completely lost it in me over my facial expression.\n\u201cI do not care if you have misophonia, I am allowed to eat in my own house and you just need to find a way to cope!\u201d Blah blah blah\nI am so exhausted with this, I spend most of my time at home in the bathroom on the floor with the fan on so I do not hear anything else. \nMy mom is so unsupportive, she only cares about herself and how it affects her when I get irritated, never about how maybe I hate being this way. I hate how people think they are so supportive of mental health issues but when there is actual serious problems that cannot be romanticized, people make fun of it or think that person is mean and controlling. Well she does have a point. I came to this conclusion that I also want to eat when I want. Sometimes it is in a situation where I would be uncomfortable if I was on the other end. So I decided to say screw that. Other people can eat when and what they want. And so will I.\n\nI notice that a lot of the problems of this sub can be resolved by moving out of the parents house. My mom used to smack her lips on purpose to drive me mad after I asked her while crying to please eat with her mouth closed. She did it on purpose and just laughed. I took my plate to my room and finished eating there. I moved out. I never have to hear her eating again. i am so sorry you are going through this. i do not know if you actually gave her a look or not, but i persoanally always give \u201cthe glare\u201d to my family members. i cannot even help it. my face just reflects how i am feeling. it feels to rude and passive aggressive to do but i cannot help it. do not get mad at yourself about it and always remember it is not your fault. she needs to learn not to take it so personally. you are struggling and deserve to be heard I am hoping to move out within a few months, I am turning 18 in February and cannot wait to finally leave. \n\nI agree that it is important for people to eat when they want. I just hate how she got mad at my facial expression when I was doing so well at holding back from saying or doing anything... I wish she could experience misophonia for just one day Thank you &lt;3 I appreciate this a lot. I need to work on keeping my face calm but in the moment I was trying so hard to not say or do anything. Just working on one thing at a time I wish she understood that. Ugh, I am sorry you have to put up with her. My dad is exactly the same. He holds my misophonia against me and gets extremely irritated at my smallest facial expressions. I leave my room when only absolutely necessary. \n\nA small piece of advice I can give you is to try to sit her down and explain how you are not angry at her, but at the sounds. How your reactions are not in your control. Try offering to watch a documentary with her on misophonia (\u201cQuiet Please\u201d). \n\nIf none of those work, just know that this is only a temporary living situation for you! Plan to move out as soon as virtually possible. And once you have a place of your own, you can make sure to tell her that she has to follow your rules in your house! Thank you!!! It is the worst when parents think that we can control this as if it is a choice. I would be a completely different person if I did not have misophonia!\nI have tried explaining it to her, she will understand but always turns it back to herself \u201cwell I understand it is painful for you but it is also painful for me to be treated badly just for eating!\u201d She truly believes that my misophonia affects her more than it affects me.\n\nI will definitely try watching that documentary with her though! Thanks! And I cannot wait to move out in a few month. I understand. Sometimes we cannot control our own reactions Celebrate that you have mastered your emotions so well that you can reduce a complete freakout to a simple glare. The Glare\u2122 Reading your story, I feel your mom instinctively pick this up as something \"unfair\", but it is just how you physically react to these frustrating sounds.\n\nI sounds like a dead cycle. Sometimes people understand it, but cannot deal with our frustrations. They are not obligated, but neither are we obligated to live with people who cannot support us.\n\nThe moment I moved out and found ways to build a quiet place, I really felt at peace. You deserve a quiet and comfortable place :)", "How do you not hate people? My situation is that I live with my husband's family, it is temporary just until school starts in the fall. But my husband's father eats and breathes and it causes me so much anxiety, and anger. \n\nI would like to think that I love my father in law, but it is hard to feel past my reaction to the way he eats and breathes. The man is letting us live with him for the summer and I am constantly removing myself from his presence. It is to the point where he thinks I do not like him. \n\nI like him, I just cannot be around him. If that makes sense. \n\nIf anyone has experience please help. I do not know how much longer I can keep it together. All my siblings and I are like this, we used to yell at each other at the dinner table to stop smacking lips. As a teen I once started crying in a restaurant because of a boy eating really gross at the next table. In my early 20s I was in a class with a girl who ate and drank so loudly that half the class would not hang out with her, myself included. \n\nSo I know I have had this sensitivity for a long time, I am in my 30s now, but I have never felt the need to do anything about it until now. I do not want it to affect my marriage that I can hardly stand to be around my father in law. I am in a really similar place and also will be reading the comments here. Unfortunately I do not have much advice, other than explaining the misophonia to your father-in-law if you have not already. Then you have taken control and can say to yourself that at least he knows what he is doing is causing you anxiety and maybe he will be a little more mindful of his own accord. I have not been brave enough to tell my boyfriends dad yet, but his mom knows and she helps to navigate the situation and they both know I dont hate them. I hope that is at least a little help. Good luck \ud83d\udc95 Not sure if it will help much, but the only way I stay sane around family is with noise cancelling headphones, typically accompanied by calm music, like piano music or spa music etc. If I ever have to eat dinner with them without my headphones, you can (apparently) tell just by looking at me that I am genuinely considering death (not literally of course). \n\nThe headphones block out enough external sounds, noise cancelling can somewhat make speech more pronounced, and the music gives me something to focus on or help keep calm. It does not help visual triggers within my peripheral vision, but every little bit counts. \n\nNot really sure if these help you, or if you are already doing them, but it helps me a lot. Wear earplugs. I guess I do not even know how to go about explaining that to someone. I cannot exactly just outright tell him that the sounds he makes while eating make me want to break stuff and scream, ya know. Also he is a very loud person in general, very A type personality, and I am a more quiet, and reserved person. \n\nHe is also hard of hearing so talking to him involves saying everything at least twice, and yelling it. I guess the thing that makes it the hardest is how he argues with everyone about everything, so I do not know if I could ever get through to him.\n\nBut thanks for the support and advice.

I usually experience more common triggers like &gt;!eating sounds, sniffing, smacking lips,!&lt; etc, but for some reason I get the same reaction to something unusual-- certain instruments, songs, or styles of music, especially when it is played in a public place. I get these strong urges to get away, or block it out, and when I cannot, I start getting urges to &gt;!self-harm!&lt;. I am a music lover but for some reason my misophonia extends to certain music and I do not understand it. anyone have a similar experience? Yes, rap sends me crazy! Especially the repetitive background beat they use. Certain singers' voices too.

I also have a reaction to banda but that is probably because my neighbors play it live, amplified in the backyard... seriously who needs to amp tuba in a backyard? Yes!!! Thumping bass is the worst. I hate all of drakes songs because of a certain clicking noise it has in it. It fills me with rage One of my main triggers is an acoustic guitar and an unplugged electric guitar.

I was going to add this to the original post, but I thought this might be better for anyone waiting for an update. If I need to change something, please let me know!\n\nSo here is my update!\n\nThese things HELP. I bought the mini and night versions, and was able to mostly comfortably sleep with the night ones in. You do need to wear them for long periods of time to notice sound quality differences, but as far as triggers it is pretty instant. Wearing them at night helped me with my fiance's snoring, and wearing the mini's was instant relief from a triggering engine whine. \n\nMostly due to my own idiocy, I have not used them a lot recently. I forgot them in my purse and forgot about them. But I am going out into the wild, and intend to have them in while I do my grocery shopping tonight! \n\nI do find that my ears ache after a while of having them in, but I have very small ear canals, even small headphones hurt after a while, so that is normal for me. \n\nI think I may need to consider purchasing a few more pairs of mini, they are the most comfortable for me. This way I can keep them strategically placed around the house and will be able to pop them in at a moment's notice.\n\nOther non miso related things I noticed; shipping was faster than I expected! And tracking was provided very quickly. \n\nThe packaging is also mostly paper! This was wonderful to see, instead of more plastic clogging up our oceans! \n\nEach pair of calmer came with a mesh bag for storage, which is super handy. They do offer metal keyrings for storage as well, if you want something sturdier.\n\nThe mini's are actually a little hard to see in your ears! I tried to show my mom, and it took her a second to realize there was something in there. \n\nI would highly recommend that anyone who is able try these. It does not remove triggers, at least not for me, but it takes the edge off of them so that rather than going right to rage, I am able to tune out the sound or just treat it with mild annoyance. \n\nNext thing I want to try is called Loop, they deaden sound more than the Calmer does I think, and are intended for sensory issues. If anyone has heard of/tried them, please let me know! Thanks for the review! I keep seeing people recommend it, maybe it is a good investment after all.\n\nDo you have chewing triggers? If so, what is your experience while eating with them? Eating with them is a little uncomfortable, but once their seated properly they are very secure and will not fall out. I have not had opportunity to really test them with chewing triggers as yet, because I am a silly goose and forgot about them in my purse. We will see what tonight brings! \n\nHere you go!! This one is much more comprehensive than mine.\n\nIn all honesty I had seen them in ads previously, but had not heard from anyone about misophonia with them.

If not I get myself through in a series of small mental sprints, \"you can get through the next 30 seconds!!!\". You can always excuse yourself to the restroom, play music, etc. I have the same problem. I think it helps to try and kind of \"exit yourself\". To see the situation from the other persons perspective. They have no idea there is a problem, theyre eating because theyre hungry etc. Really focusing on realities outside of your head might help deal with the delusions that theyre doing this out of spite.\n\nThis probably wont make the sounds easier to handle though (doesnt for me) so leaving or chancing the situation would be a good idea.", "It do be like this   Words cannot express how much I feel this. with each one i find... i feel like the world's just playing a joke on me at this point and seeing how far i can manage I feel that.

I have had some form of misophonia from a few triggers since I was maybe 10 or 11. It caused me stress and annoyance for many years but recently (past year or two) it is gotten much worse, with the genital arousal symptom showing up. \n\nI get triggered by my family, especially parents. I believe it has something to do with some relationship issues with my parents that have gotten worse. The triggers make me extremely angry (combining with the repressed anger from other issues), annoyed, etc. It is not as bad around friends/strangers, as I do not have any bad experiences with them. I do not know why that happens, but that is how it is.\n\nSo back on the unwanted arousal, I think it is been around for several months, getting worse and worse. I realized what it was a few weeks ago (although I would not accept it at first). This symptom is absolutely horrible since it makes me feel extremely violated. I do not know how much I can ever get rid of it because mentally, it will stick to me. Even thinking about the triggers is bad for me.\n\nI have scratched myself as a way to cope. I have had bad eczema forever, so it is something I took up naturally. Nothing really bad in terms of physical harm, just scabs on my legs (I get worse from eczema). I have mostly stopped this past month, and I can control myself. Always tempted though.\n\nOf course, I want to find some way to get over this, even a bit. I have seen posts on how to overcome misophonia, but I do not know if they can help this, since it is not just anxiety and anger.\n\nIs there anything that has helped you all?", "But, are these sounds in every household? Or is it really something abnormal in my surroundings? Lately I have been trying to tell myself that with being mindful and a little patience I can gain control over my reaction my reaction to trigger sounds. But then I have a thought that maybe these sounds are exclusive to my surroundings, which makes it harder to gain control over my reaction. \n\nIt makes me feel I am in the wrong place and others are not cooperating. \n\nDoes everyone have people around who shut the door a little too loud? People who chew loudly? Who stomp the stairs like they will crack them open? Or who have very loud footsteps somehow? Sounds of utensils in the kitchen? Sounds when someone is doing the dishes? Sounds of cars starting? \n\nIs it possible in every other household to literally tell what someone is doing in the kitchen while you are just sitting in your room? \n\nI hate it. I absolutely hate this controlling me and not the other way. And I want to tell myself this is normal, as much as I understand this is hard, I really want to grow out of it. It is terrible and it makes each day harder. I cry a lot and my family is not really on the same page about it with me. We have to all work together on this, and I hope one day through unity we will all find a solution.\n\nI am not sure of your finances but depending on your living situation, dimensions, etc... You could sound proof your room for about 500-2000 USD.\n\nEdit: there is several ways to sound proof a room. In my experience there is a spray foam insulation that works really well. Only downside is dry wall needs to be removed. Yeah, I recognize almost all of these. I am the person who stomps really loud though, and I always feel bad about it but it is hard not to because I am so used to stomping around.

The only way to get rid of it is living alone in your own house, not apartment because you will have people stomping all the time I feel you. That is my house too.

It is me and 2 others  working close by in cubicles. The woman behind me constantly snacks, loudly, at her desk and talks with her mouth full. She will do this for hours. The man who sits behind her constantly coughs and clears his throat loudly, though it is because of health conditions. I try to remind myself of this but it is still extremely irritating. \n\nI deal with these issues at home too with my family but it is easier to avoid and escape. My anxiety has been so bad because I constantly deal with these issues at work and at home. I can wear headphones at work but I feel bad constantly having them in, in case my coworkers are trying to ask a question.

She was better about it that day but it has obviously returned to normal. \n\nI am brand new at this job, while her, the other man, and my boss have been here at least 10+ years each so I feel very anxious and scared to bring it up and overstep my boundaries but I am literally so angry at work every day because of this. My first day of work my boss said to be mindful of others since we work in a close space, and I have been, so it is frustrating to me that everyone else is not. I am looking for advice on how to approach this situation so I am not being rude but also fully addressing the situation and my feelings. I am scared to mention misphonia because people do not take it seriously. Sadly, have you considered quitting and getting a new job?  It sounds like things will not change there.  Since you have not been at this job, you could just leave this job off your resume in the future.", "My hearing aids for Misophonia. They are Bluetooth starkey techology hearing aids meant to heighten you hearing but they can be used to feed in sound without blocking your ear canal.

Right I am sorry I will call back in a bit.\" \n\nAnd well, that was nice.

He wasting all kinds of loud crucnhy stuff and somehow muching up burger and fries to make it sound wet, mouth wide open. I am gunna die I know this will not help immediately, but my daughter is triggered by similar noises. At mealtimes, she listens to brown noise on noise-canceling headphones. She says that drowns out the noises better than music or white noise. *theirs\n\nBring headphones? Does not brown noise make you involuntarily evacuate your bowels? I might try that. If I may ask what is brown noise? And hecc white noise for that matter.

You have pointe out the one thing I did not do wrong lol\n\nAnd I could try, but if someone tries to speak to me I cannot hear, and I usually get called over somewhere There are different types of noises, I guess at different frequencies. Sorry I do not understand the differences too well myself. W\n\nWhite noise is sounds like static, or maybe a fan or air conditioner.\n\nBrown is different but I cannot describe it.

Omggg I was going to make this post yesterday because something similar happened to me. Was just working on my computer, quietly, someone comes to eat soup at the same table. Not even to talk to me. JUST to slurp on soup apparently. I was like really? Of all the places??! Does your family know about your misophonia? It is possible they think you would like company or something without realizing you are by yourself for a reason. Maybe try bringing it up, emphasizing that it is not their fault but that because of your condition you find it really hard to tolerate eating sounds. Explain that it is not personal at all, you do love them, etc. but you would really appreciate if they do not eat near you and that if you leave the room while they are eating please do not follow I have not had any good experience with explaining misophonia to anyone close to me. Nobody has ever said anything positive. I am always the problem and the one who is wrong and who has to learn to deal with it and nobody should change anything around me. I am the one that has to change. It is very hard. I think I gave up in trying to explain to people. About 2 weeks ago someone told me \u201cyou do not even try\u201d like I have not try my whole life to do not feel so upset every time a sounds triggers me. That is so frustrating, I am really sorry they have not been supportive of you. I do not know what it is about this condition that tends to make people so unkind. I am lucky in that my mum has come round to being understanding and explained it to my dad, but for a while my dad always got so annoyed at me whenever I was bothered by chewing, like I was somehow feeling that way on purpose or something. Since your family is being so uncaring, I suggest you look into getting earplugs or headphones if you have not already. ( they are very discreet, comfortable to wear, and block out chewing quite well. If they know about your triggers being eating sounds, but, for example but do not think misophonia is real,  they are intentionally triggering you, and should be dealt with accordingly,  as you would with someone being a jerk in a similar situation.\n\nIf they do not know you have the condition,  they are just being ignorant. Inform them politely of your misophonia, and triggers.", "Does this count as misophonia? Or- what is happening? I feel like crying or chopping my ears off whenever I hear people talk. I tried researching this, but het no results other than misophonia.. but, chewing sounds do not bother me, breathing occasionally triggers me just a bit, but nothing makes me as anxious then hearing people sing and talk. I just want pure silence. I would like to add, it is not all the time I feel this way. It is more when the environment is mainly quiet besides the exception of a person talking. i cannot tell you if it is or not misophonia, but it seems like it. independent of what it is, if you are suffering a visit to a psychiatrist/psychologist can really help. good luck! Okay, thank you for your response! Everyone will have different triggers! I do not get bothered by the sound of cutlery scraping on teeth for example, but certain people\u2019s voices or hearing one person talk when it is quiet in the street or room - ouch. \n\nIf it is seriously affecting your quality of life though, do go and seek help. I guess it is an okay time to share that my major most sound trigger is southern accents. This is even more debilitating for me considering that I live in the south (I would move out, but it would be far too costly to move out of this region and I do not know anyone on a personal level that lives outside of it for me to use for any emergencies if I do experience one). I do not know why my aversion to those accents has gotten this bad. I have always lived in this region, but living here any longer could be damaging to my mental health. I have to wear both ear plugs and over ear construction head phones virtually every public place I go to. Meeting new people, making friends, and forming relationships (both platonic and romantic) is almost impossible here because of how harsh my aversion to these accents are.\n\nIt is difficult to communicate to people on a voice speaking level and even then, it is sometimes the only way I can contact certain people (some people just do not do emails or text chats because they do not want to or because they cannot). I normally get too afraid to tell anyone that this is my sound trigger, because it normally leads to people getting angry or upset at me. My misophonia has been getting so bad lately, that I get on the verge of hurting myself by wanting to bang my head on a hard surface, bite myself, or smack my thighs (I know the latter does not sound that bad, but it is still something that should not be happening). I think it probably is misophonia, as other sounds usually distract you from the trigger, I recommend going to a therapist or some other form of help, and wearing headphones with music until then. You should really do this as soon as possible because not doing so will lead to lots of problems, it only gets worse. Okay, I will do my best to prevent triggers. I have heard stories of people causing/almost harming someone. Thank you for commenting! This made me feel relieved. Thank you for commenting! I feel empathy for your situation. I really hope there is a way to overcome it. If this helps at all: In my case, it only triggers when I realize and focus that it is a sound coming from a human. If I ignore the fact that a PERSON is talking, I can calm down and it will not trigger. Yeah, you will almost always want to murder the person who is making the noise, just go to a quiet place and punch something, or if you cant get away just think about something else, this is crucial, since if that person triggers you often, your relationship will break and it can lead to hate If you hate the sound it is misophonia Everyone is triggers are different. Believing that a specific sound is rude or wrong makes it much more likely to become a trigger, so maybe that is the case here. I once had Tucker Carlson's voice as a trigger because my dad was constantly listening to him, so it is definitely possible that voices can be triggers.", "I am Triggered by my Thoughts. What to do when I am Not Safe in my Own Head? I am reaching out because I do not know what to do. Some of my triggers are common words\u2014 so common, that you cannot speak without them. So this is a problem when talking to people, reading, watching TV, and stupidest of all, thinking inside my head. \n\nI can \u201chear\u201d the words I think in my head. I am careful to avoid \u201cthinking\u201d these words, but thinking is different from talking; you cannot actually stop yourself from thinking. It is just so natural. \n\nSo, I drown my thoughts in loud noise, pleasant sounds, and music. Unfortunately, this is not helping enough.\n\nI would appreciate *any* kind of advice *at all.* \n\nYes, I am seeking help. An audiologist who specializes in Misophonia, among other things. \n\n\n\n*(Please do not reply with your triggers! I am one of the ones who develops triggers just by reading them. Thanks.)* I am not an expert, but I went through something similar. I have both misophonia and an obsessive-compulsive disorder. From what I can tell, this *could* be the result of obsessive cognitive behaviour. Thankfully, it is something you can overcome. Stay strong and do not give up! I do have OCD, which gets all mixed up with Misophonia quite a lot. So frustrating! It can be a tough and painful battle at times, but one worth fighting. I can assure you it gets a lot better. I have OCD as well and I used to be extremely bothered by certain words. I thought I was the only one who had this issue! How did you stop being bothered by those specific words? Exposure/response prevention really helped me. Plus, it seemed to go away as I got older. Another person with OCD here, seems fairly common from looking at the other replies. I get bothered by certain words as well, the sounds of them upset me and it works like that in my head too.\n\nI am not sure what can be done to help, as I only started working on mine more recently, but it seems like you are taking a step in the right direction by seeking help from an audiologist.", "I am a hypocrite Loud breathing is one of my worst triggers, so much so that I cant go to bed if it is too quiet because of MY OWN breathing. If I am breathing too loudly, I will sniffle. Now I have related stiffling to a feeling of having a stuffed nose that I cant get rid of. I constantly feel like I am breathing loudly even if I cant hear it, so I am always sniffling.  I know most people with misophonia would want to strangle me 10 minutes in a conversation. Even any other person would be annoyed. I hate how I am making an even more annoying noise to try and combat an only slightly annoying noise(to other people). Me too. I have acid reflux that goes up into my throat and sinuses and causes mucus buildup and so I am always having to clear my throat or else I lose my voice. When I am at work around coworkers I hate when anyone coughs or clears their throat (its my #1 trigger) yet I am too afraid to clear mine in public, I just cannot do it. I will clear it as quietly as possible or drink water.\n\nThen when I get home the real me comes out and I am honking and making dolphin noises. I am thankful I am single because I imagine if I lived with somebody they would tie me up and throw me off the balcony already.\n\nOh, and my nose whistles a lot at night from sinus stuffiness/deviated septum and it makes me want to go deaf. Hey do you happen to use white noise at night? I cannot sleep if I can hear myself breathing either so I always have white noise going. There is apps for it as well on phones/devices if you do not have a fan/machine for it. It truly helps a lot. I am glad ( yet not at all because as you know, its basically 24/7 triggers) that I am not the only one at least. Part of me never wants to be in a relationship because of it. Oh well, guess I will figure that out when it comes along My ears hurt when I put on earbuds or headphones to sleep but a fan is a really good idea! I am definitely going to try that tonight, thank you! No prob! White noise machines are awesome too if you can take a look at them some time. I have a sound machine/alarm clock and it is a life saver! Hope the fan helps :) Yes me too. I desperately want a relationship but I also know with it will come triggers and idk how ready and mature I am to handle it properly", "I think my sibling is trying to trigger my misophonia on purpose As if it was not horrible before having to handle being triggered by chewing noises, breathing, repetitive noises, misokinesia, now I am certain that certain ways of speaking can be triggering. It has always been a trigger now that I think about it but nobody really spoke that triggering way before so I never truly noticed it.\n\nMy brother however has started speaking that way specifically after seeing how triggering it is to me. He never really spoke that way, but somehow, after discovering that it bothers me the way he talks, he started using that accent more and more and now it is truly how he speaks.\n\nI think he is trying to trigger me on purpose especially because he sometimes exaggerates that accent when I am around and somehow this is only making me feel angrier and angrier. I do not know what to do, I am having so many violent thoughts and the only way I can handle it is by being violent towards myself. TW: suicidal thoughts: &gt;!I am already depressed as hell, but misophonia and my sensitivity towards sounds only makes living even more difficult. I really cannot take it anymore, I really really cannot take it anymore.!&lt; Let your brother know how irritating his forced accent is. Try relating it to something he hates being done to him. It should put things in perspective. If he does not stop doing the accent, you can do something in turn that annoys them, and keep doing it until they stop. You can limit your interaction with them, be icy. If that does not work, stick with limiting your interaction with them.\n\nAs for your suicidal thoughts, I do not know what to say. Mostly because I too am feeling the same way about wanting it to end. Yep, my siblings did this to me growing up. Siblings like to get on each other's nerves. My mom triggered me on purpose. I had to walk away each time. The thing is, his accent now has truly turned into his natural speech pattern. I am afraid he cannot speak differently anymore, so I think that the only way to I could go on living is by limiting my interaction with him. Huh... the problem is that we are both grown ass adults. His reasons are malicious, but I do not know why he has this malice towards me. Gosh, this is just horrible. Yes. The person I now live with is considerate. We have a TV running in the background while we eat (chewing noises are my triggers) and he does not complain when I pop in an ear plug. I do not know how old you are but once you are your own king of your castle it will 100% be better. I promise You think it ends when you grow up? I have seen my aunts and uncles purposefully taunt each other at holiday gatherings, they are in their 60's and 70s. Also, if you are a grown ass adult, then get your own place already. My advice is to move rural and try to land a job you can do from home. Apartment complexes are a nightmare. You can usually rent a bigger place or even a house for the same price out in the country. It is quitter and you can control who comes and goes. I am assuming you both live at home now, right? if he can change his accent to be annoying, he can change it back. do not worry about that :) This must be terrible for you. My brother sometimes speaks in a deeper accent and it is annoying but it never triggered me. I cannot imagine what it would be like to be triggered just by him speaking. TBH siblings can be little shits sometimes. My brother does the same thing to me but I do not think to the same degree. He will make an annoying noise, notice I am triggered, do it slightly more aggressively, and then laugh that it triggers me. He can be a real ass but he knows that it truly does cause me to have breakdowns sometimes with how stressful it can be to have the 'world against you'. We have talked about it. My parents have talked to him about it. I have talked (ranting and raving more like) to my parents about it. It helps. When I do have serious breakdowns where I just become a hysterical, sobbing mess, he backs off and just sort of stares at me unsure how to help, but he does try to keep his noise level to a min when this happens. \n\nIdk what your relationship with your brother is like, but try talking to him about it or - if you can - get your parent or sibling to take him down a few pegs and see reason. I think all brothers like to press buttons (especially when ours are giant red buttons the size of a monster truck wheel). We pick on them, they pick on us. They know us, so it does not help, but I know that it is my brother's way of teasing me (he is in that phase where he is testing how far he can push jokes/sarcasm).\n\nOn the topic of the TW. Hang in there. You have got this. Life can suck ass and it may always feel like your swimming in puddle of shit, but it does get better. Try to count the positives. You will not have to live with your brother all your life. You will have your own place one day. Life does get better. Whilst I have never had severe depression, my sister does struggle with it. She is doing better now damn was it scary and I have had my own dark pits of despair in my life. You have got this. Life. Gets. Better.\n\n\n*DISCLAIMER: Not a trainer psychologist, just a concerned Reddit user So actually, he understands the gravity of the situation, which is why I only noticed now that he seems to be doing it on purpose....this is just so malicious. Thank you... Obviously does not fully grasp the situation if he does not understand the consequences of his actions and how much pain he is putting you in. If does grasp all of this, fuck him. He does not deserve you. Sometimes you cannot pick family but you can choose whether to take their shit or not. Still advocating for the peaceful route of the situation, but... Aggressive negotiations are sometimes a must. Leave the home.", "Is this a trigger or not? I have misophonia since i was 9 or 10, idk. I have many triggers, but lately I have been noticing a weird beep noise that comes from the street once every half an hour, more or less. I have no idea if that is from a bird, from a police car, a pipe or anything. Every time I hear it, I think about it for a minute or so, but I do not feel anxious or irritated, like any other trigger. Is this a trigger, does it have anything to do with misophonia? I think it kind of is a form of misophonia, I am glad it does not bother you too much though.\n\nMany people with misophonia may fixate on this noise and try and solve the problem by working out what it was and fixing it or just going more and more mad as they hear it.\n\nI think it will be somebody is alarm that has run out of battery or some kind of outside item like a shed alarm, it will be something like that.\n\nLike when a fire alarm runs out of battery and it beeps every hour until you change the battery.\n\nThere is also that same beep in my street too and I have never been able to find out what it is. \u2018Many people with misophonia may fixate\u2019... And everything following that little paragraph. Yes. True. I relate. Misophonia pretty much always induces the fight or flight response. Does it make you angry or feel like you desperately need to get away from the sound? That is a key symptom of Misophonia and is needed for a diagnosis. Not liking one or two sounds does not mean you have Misophonia (most people hate nails on a chalkboard for example). Just from the little that you describe, it does not sound like Misophonia to me honestly. There are not really \"types\" of Misophonia like someone said, apart from Misokinesia and another with vibrations, but they all induce the same response. It is the reaction that is important for diagnosis. People with ASD can fixate on certain sounds too but it is not the same response.

She co-founded the Duke Misophonia Research center, and is co-director of  and the International Misophonia Research Network. She has written a number articles about misophonia over the years and books, including her latest: Regulate, Reason, Reassure: A Parent's Guide to Understanding and Managing Misophonia.

He is sweet and kind and we get on so well together. Everything is perfect, BUT. His mother. She triggers me about 30 times a day and I am going insane. EVERY meal, she unashamedly eats with her mouth wide open making slimy and sticky sounds with her food. She smacks her lips with every chew and it is just so UNNECESSARY. I have to leave the table early and make the excuse that I do not feel well. But that gets less and less believable every time I do it. I cannot take it anymore I will refuse to eat meals with her. I absolutely know she will not understand nor care so I am not even going to bother broaching the subject with her. I just do not know what to do. I love my partner but I cannot stand being around his family when they trigger me so much. Have you talked to her at all? Just letting her know sounds of people eating cause severe panic and that is why you have to leave? Does your husband know about your miso? Maybe he could help you talk to her I would just accept that you and her are not going to have a good relationship and that is that.\n\n*But* it sounds like you are all living together so how close might you be to moving out of that situation? I know you said she would not care if you brought it up, but it would cover your bases in the future and put the ball in her court. I would explain that eating sounds put you on edge and that she is a noisy eater so it is hard to say around her (if she is ignorant, do not bother giving it a name or using the terminology, it will just give her a reason to ilegitamize you as having a \"made up condition\"). Whether she wants to change for you is up to her and you did what you can. I guarantee throughout her life someone has committed on her lack of table manners especially if no one else in the family does it. \n\nAll you can do is be honest and discrete and respectful and hope she cares enough to accommodate you. And if she does not, that is not your problem, it is hers. Bam, now you have as legitimate reason to skip dinner with her. My partner lives with his brother and mother, whereas I live on my own. I have to spend a lot of time at his place if we want to be together because my place is out of the city and he has no way of getting to me. We are not in a position to move in together anytime soon, for financial and health reasons. I get on with her perfectly well 99% of the time, I think she is a nice person, it is just this one issue I have. Yeah this does sound reasonable, I just worry that she will view me with contempt, a sensitive snow flake that gets \u2018triggered\u2019 if you know what I mean. I should just grow up and have the conversation I guess. No I totally get it, and I definitely know those types. Even my boyfriend, who is extremely cool-headed and reasonable, was pretty put off when I mentioned it. I will admit I was a bit harsh bc I blew up while it was happening and I was so irritated. I think he was embarrassed more than mad at me though so it would have been better for me to mention it when I was more calm. \n\nIt is a hard thing to bring up and it does require some tact, I do not blame you at all for being hesitant. But I think maybe if you talk to your partner about how you should approach it and come up with a plan, it will not be as horrible. Still stressful though. \n\nGood luck, OP thank you, this is probably the most solid advice I have gotten about misophonia so thank you. I related to your feelings so much, I just hope it goes okay. Just weighing in to say that it is similar with me and It is a real mindfuck. My FIL is one of my worst triggering people to eat. I have discussed it with my partner and I have basically let her know that it ruins dinner for me (my partner gets it in the sense that it is a thing for me  but does not, and really cannot, understand how awful it is). The long and short of it is that at the very least I try not to sit across from him, and this is something I have instructed my partner that she has to help me with. And when that happens, I can kind of cheat and scoot far away which helps a little.\n\nBut yeah, sorry. Understand you are not alone in this and this is easily the worst part of this thing we have. I am very fortunate that, from what I gather, I am a milder case, probably a 6/10. So I have just decided to suck it up and never bring it up. This has helped me a lot and just understanding that it is on me, not on them, has helped a lot.

My biggest triggers are : TRIGGER WARNING!!! \n\nWhispering, especially exaggerated whispering and he does it ALL THE FUCKING TIME. HE KEEPS DRAMATICLY WHISPERING THINGS TO ADD DRAMATIC FLAIR TO THINGS AND I WANT TO KAMXNDKZKZKSKSJSHDJDJSLANXN\n\nMy other biggest trigger is MUMBLE SPEAKING AND HE DOES IT ALL THE FUCKING TIME. BLOODY FUCK HE JUST TALKS IN BASS LINED MUMBLES. ON THE PHONE ESPECIALLY. I FUCKING.......\n\nAnd all other basic triggers such as wet chewing sounds, that liquid sound some peoples mouth makes when they take a sip from a cup of tea, lip smaking, lip popping, everything. \n\nIve talked to him many times and asked him to stop amd he has stopped some but he gets SO defensive. Its nearly impossible to have that conversation w/o getting in a fight. And now that its winters and fans are off and things arw silent......God help me \n\n\n\nDoes anyone else have these specific triggers ? How do you calm yourself down when triggered at least 10 times a day? Oh and Im 23 but Im from Pakistan so its not a possibility for me to move out on my own unless jts cuz of marriage or moving abroad, which im trying to do. But still. Ugh I want to cry. I hate feeling like this. my family (especially my father) trigger me near-constantly. i wish i had advice to offer or decent coping strategies. i mostly just make sure my earbuds are in Every Single Time i leave my room and i also just Avoid leaving my room lole. but these are two obviously not great coping mechanisms. i mean, the earbuds are fine and spare me from the noises for,, the most part, but i find my ears to be quite sore some weeks. :L anyways, my heart goes out to you! it seems this is a common issue, especially with fathers,,, very unfortunate, ughhh. good luck. ): i am sorry you are dealing with this. Same. Love my fam. We had fights about this topic. He was not understanding to say the least. Now I stay in my room (that is cool with me) I eat in my room by myself (which I prefer) and I do not spend time with them more than I feel comfortable doing (all acceptable compromises). It is ok for them now. It is a matter of conflict and time. Keep defending your perspective and stand by what you need. It will pave a way sooner or later for you guys. There is no easy solution for peops like us with the not so ordinary problems. But good thing is people can adjust to anything. The world\u2018s situation as of 2020 is the best example. This is me. \n\nI think that my Misophonia is STEMMED from my dad's sounds. \n\nRoad trips he always had a bag of chips or pretzels and I would be stuck. Tortured. For 3.5 hours. Headphones did not work because I could SEE it and knew it was happening. \n\nLuckily I do not live with him anymore. \n\nI would recommend you lookup some research articles and print them out. If you feel he will get defensive put them in an envelope with a note explaining to him what your reaction will be, whether it is putting on sound cancelling headphones, eating meals in another area or at another time, or excusing yourself. Tell him that this Misophonia tortures you and if you could have it any other way you would. Ask him to please respect that this will be your reaction and that you are merely doing this to avoid future conflict with him and to preserve your relationship. \n\nGood luck, it is sure not easy. \n\nI also recommend downloading the box breathing app Breatheair (free) and doing box breathing with headphones on when you get triggered, to call. You down. I know exactly what you mean, my Dad triggers me constantly too with the sounds he makes. My parents do not know this, but it is actually one of the big reasons why I am moving out next week. Hopefully this will make being with them a lot nicer since it will only be in short bursts, and I will not still be feeling angry about the last time I saw them. Do your dads a favor. Leave. You just cause them emotional pain. Huh? interesting, i see im not the only one, and alot of people with misophonia has their dad as their most noise triggering person, why is it the dad for so many people?", "What most of us want to say to people in the room.  Yesss! Exactly", "Teaching with Misophonia A while back, I made a post about seeing someone say that people with misophonia should not enter my career field (teaching). I was pretty discouraged about it and extremely worried about my future.\n\nI have just finished my first week of student teaching. I have not had so few triggers happen in my life since before my misophonia developed. I am not sure exactly why, though I have theories. It could be the proximity between myself and the students (they are further away and I am not caught in the middle of a big group like I was as a student), the greater control I feel in a teaching position, or because my mind is too worried about teaching to be bothered by anything else (I am still getting my feet wet in all of this, haha). But I feel so calm compared to how I usually am. In my seminar class where I am a student again, I was ready to lose my mind over someone is throat clearing (seriously, every 30 seconds??). But when I am in front of the classroom, it is completely different.\n\nJust wanted to share a positive, hopeful experience, because I know full well that they are far and few when it comes to this disorder. I cannot say how this will go in the future, especially as more research starts to come out about misophonia. But for now, I think all will be okay. To any future teachers out there afraid to come back to one of the settings where their disorder hit them the worst, you might just have nothing to worry about after all. :)", "This is ruining my life I cannot stand my grandmother\u2019s voice. She is so fucking annoying, her fucking voice it just will not stop reverberating in my head. I do not eat with my family anymore because she cannot shut the fuck up for 10 seconds. Her and her mumble grumble noises, we already heard you you said it 3 times you wrinkly fucking pear. You cannot think of anything else to say? Just \u201cmmm mmm\u201d all fucking day that is it that is her fucking catchphrase. I constantly blast my ears with music just so I can avoid her voice. I cannot say it out loud what is bothering me so I take it out on myself. I just finished punching my head, ribs and stomach, it hurts so bad but it is the only thing that can calm me down. I just want it to fucking end please god. One of these days I am seriously going to have it. I cannot even focus on the piles of work I have to do. What do I do please. I am scared I might get brain damage from hitting my head all day. I feel dizzy. I know it is not her fault, im sorry grandma. I just cannot control it, I literally had no problem with her until this year, I just hyperfixate on one thing about a person and decide I hate it for no reason. You need to see a doctor and get on some anti anxiety medication. It may help curb the tension. You should not be hitting your head all day. That is  not healthy. Please seek help. You do not deserve to live this way. Please talk to your parents about seeing a doc. I mean this with all my heart. I was once in your shoes and it is not good. I feel you. When you are able to move out, everything will get better. In the meantime, all you can do (other than or in addition to medication, which I personally am not a fan of) is mitigate stress and take care of your body the best you can - eat whole foods, drink 1/2 your body weight in ounces of water a day, prioritize peace and quality sleep. Easier said than done, I know, but it helps manage stress and your reactions to stressful triggers. I also have found using high DB blocking foam ear plugs under isolation headphones is a life saver. Not ideal to feel like you live in a bubble sometimes but it is better than self harm.\n\nIt will get better. I am sorry you are suffering.", "Does anyone have any good coping mechanisms for after getting away for a trigger? Being exposed to a trigger and not being able to react makes me build up so much anger that I have to let it out. Does anyone have any quiet ways for me to calm down that do not involve screaming and crying breakdowns? I try to watch a show or movie, or if I am at work put on an audiobook. Getting immersed in a story helps me forget about my thoughts, my existence, and thus, whatever sound was triggering my anger.", "a sound that doesnt stop my triggers are a multitude of things, but the main way i describe them is as \"sounds that are out of place\" aka not sounds that dont fit the atmosphere (like chewing during a test or breathing when its completely silent)\n\nconsidering that, there is this strange reoccurring sound in my room. it sounds like its coming from the floor and at first i thought it was the wood floor creaking but if i walk over where it is, it does not change or stop if i move. it sounds more like a hard tap on wood. \n\nit also sometimes sounds like it moves: i stand where i think its coming from and then it makes the sound again but from a different place. sometimes i cant hear it but most times i can. also its not consistent and the time between taps varies and it drives me crazy. i cant sleep at night and i usually end up falling asleep due to exhaustion.\n\nthe only time i can wear headphones or earplugs is on weekends since i have school and i will most definitely oversleep my alarms. when i try to show the sound to anyone else, the sound stops and they deem it as nothing. whenever i try to record it, the microphone cant pick it up. i also noticed that i can hear it only at night (very convenient).\n\ni am starting to think its just a figment of my imagination or some tool to haunt me. i get nervous before bed and i pray i cant hear the sounds.\n\ni dont think anyone can give me a solution, just wanted to share in case anyone else might have something similar. Can we get some more info - like what is below your room? - is there a ceiling fan or something attached to the ceiling below it? - Do you have central forced air, and if you do, do you know where the ductwork and fan unit is located?  Is it an old house (they do pop and creak all the time, especially if it is windy or if there is extreme temperature changes)? What is the weather like there? - are there any big factories, warehouses, a dam or large machinery near your house? \n\nI do not have misophonia, but I do have extremely sensitive hearing, and little things constantly wake me up, so I find them and eliminate what I can - like the ice maker, got to make sure it is off before bed - the central fan coming on and off all night, set the fan to \"ON\" instead of \"AUTO\" and it will just stay on all night instead of waking you up every time it starts and stops.  Finding an appliance with a \"hum\" or vibration to it and do what you can to muffle it.  Vents rattle sometimes, and just a teeny push on the adjustment can stop it. \n\nI live between two dams (about a mile in each direction) and can hear when they are opening and closing the gates, and I can \"feel\" the hum of the generators (it is more of a feeling than a sound, that is the only way I can describe it, but it is in my ears- not a whole body feeling) and there is nothing I can do about them, but some white noise can muffle it enough to tune out. I have got a whirring noise that the wall beside me makes. It is beside my desk at work and only one of my co-workers actually hears it too. I just give the wall a kick and it goes away for a bit.\n\nCan you describe the noise a bit more? its sounds like a hard tap on wood that is hollow...its hard to describe it as more than that. if you have a wooden desk or some wooden surface try hitting it hard with your fingertips and that is what it probably sounds like. there is a small living room under my room and there is no ceiling fan. theres an air vent near where the sound usually comes from but it doesnt sound like its anything from the vent (though at one point i thought there was some animal in the wall but its not plausible.) i dont know anything about central forced air but i do have vents??? if that is any indication.\n\ni live in quiet suburbs and my house is fairly new (i believe it was built in the 2000s). i also sometimes open my windows during the winter because i dont think theres any heat coming into my room and it gets stuffy in my room. it gets kind of windy sometimes but the sound persists even with windows closed and a peaceful night. \n\nill try out the white noise but the sound kind of scares me. If you have vents then there is ductwork somewhere - newer ductwork does not have as much metal as older ductwork - so older metal ductwork can pop and creak in different places as the cool or warm air goes through it, changing the temp expands or contracts the metal, and it will happen in different spots as the ductwork changes temperature differently in different sections - that can make a pop, creak, or bang sometimes.  \n\nIf you have old style radiators for heat, there is pipes of hot water running all through the walls and floors to get to the radiators - they can make the same sounds as they change temp, and can sometimes make more of a tapping sound than ductwork. \n\nEither can make tapping sounds if the blower or pump has a vibration to it that is irregular - or even bubbles of air trapped in a central system's coils can make tapping sound - and the \"shimmy\" of the vibration can make itself be heard in different spots if the vibration is in any way irregular - Fan could be off balance, filter might need changing, or it could just be old.\n\nWhen I just HAVE to find the source of a sound that bothers me, I usually wait 'til it is quiet outside and nobody's home to make noise and turn off everything I can - then turn one thing on at a time to see if it is making the offending noise.  \n\nWe just leave the central system's fan in the \"ON\" position so it runs all the time, that is a pretty good white noise generator by itself - when we have to cut it off for some reason, or if the power goes out, it is almost scary how quiet it seems - but the last time it happened, it got quite enough for me to tell what was making the squeaking noise in the house. it was a vent on the roof moving in the wind, just needed some oil.  \n\nMy S.O. uses an app called \"Sleepo\" that lets him play all sorts of white noise sounds in the background while he sleeps - it has all sorts of sounds, and if you only want to play a few (i think less than 7) at a time, it is free. \n\nHope this helps. - I know what it is like to not be able to pinpoint the source of a noise that is driving me crazy.", "Are you less triggered when you are also eating? When someone is crunching, eating noisily or smacking their lips, I become very anxious, tension wells up and I have physical and vocal tics and get irritable and sometimes angry\u2014especially if I am trying to concentrate on something. I had a coworker that would eat crunchy stuff throughout the day and I just wanted to strangle her (she was too nice, so I did not lol). Anytime a family member is eating noisily while I am doing something else, I become progressively more anxious and irritated, tension builds and I release it with the tics and that cycle repeats until they stop eating.\n\nBut if I am also eating, unless the person is outrageously annoying with their eating noises, I am either much less triggered and do not have the tics or I am not triggered at all.", "Triggered by self? Just curious, does anyone get triggered by sounds that you make yourself? I have always known misophonia is very psychological, and we tend to be annoyed more by people we either dislike or that make triggers often (even if someone else is making the exact same sound it will not annoy you as much) but one of my biggest fears has always been that I start to get triggered by myself, because there is no way to escape from my own sounds. Loud and unnecessary noises by myself definitely trigger my misophonia. I am not triggered by my own noises. Additionally, I am ashamed to admit this but when I am driving by myself I smack and pop my gum in a way that would make me want to murder someone else lol  I cannot stand listening to myself chew, but other than that, no. I always have to have a show or music or something on when I eat. I know right? When I am alone I always chew my gum in a way that I know would drive me completely insane if someone else did it, but thankfully it does not trigger me. I always catch myself doing it and I am like \"wtf am i doing\" What happens when you hear yourself chew? do you get mad at yourself or just annoyed in general? The only time I am aware of my own noises is of there are other people around. Because I do not want them to hear me. I will eat chips in the other room so my bf cannot hear me even though he is told me numerous times it does not bother him. It is more just uncomfortable and all I can focus on if I can hear it. Definitely not. Mimicking trigger sounds help soften the blow, actually. I do not know why but I have always done that. (ie someone sniffs and I sniff back etc) It depends on what it is and if I am tired or frustrated at the moment. Like in the rare occasion that I am chewing gum I am 100% likely to be triggered by it. If I am super tired I get triggered easier so things like my breathing and heartbeat to trigger me.  YES.  \n\n it is either the best or worst self-loathing. YES.\n\nIts absolutely the worst part of having misophonia for me, because like you said, I cannot escape it. It completely rules my life. I get scared and wound up from my triggers and there is nowhere I can go to calm down again. The only times I am not worried about hearing a trigger are when there is a loud sound in a similar frequency to cover it, like a shower. \n\nI did not used to get triggered by my own sounds, but as my miso gradually got worse in my late teens, it just suddenly started happening. It is definitely a whole different thing, coping wise, from normal miso. :( \n\nThanks for asking this. I wish there was more discussion about it, especially in professional and research spaces. I know many people with miso, but I thought I was alone in suffering this part of it for a really long time\u2026  This reddit is actually the only place I\u2018ve heard of other people who have misophonia in this way, and I have looked EVERYWHERE. \n\nI am happy to answer any questions about it if you have them! \n\nAlso if you also get triggered by your own sounds, I want to give you a big hug over the internet for making it. It is hard. Yes, I am only triggered by my own breathing tho.

I basically just copued the comment and edited it a bit\n\nMaybe 4 or 5 months ago my old headphones broke so I started looking for new wireless ones with noise cancelling. After actual hours of searching for cheap but good quality headphones I came across ( for $70 at the time. \n\nIn the 4 to 5 months Ive had them I havent noticed any wear and tear on them, the battery life is somewhere around 20 hours or so at this point and charges in 5 to 10 minutes, the bluetooth works over a large distance, the passive noise cancellation is good and the active noise cancellation is slightly better (kind of unimpressed with active noise cancellation but very impressed with passive oddly enough), they are one of the most comfortable pair of headphones Ive owned, and they are pretty easily some of the highest sound quality headphones Ive ever owned (heavy on the bass which I enjoy but you might not).\n\nI basically never leave my room without them, because the passive noise cancellation is good enough to block out a lot of eating noises. I have literally used them everyday almost all day for almost 5 months and I have had very few problems with them so far. Only issues Ive had so far are that the ears are a little small and the battery life doesnt seem to be as long as it was when I first got them.\n\nOverall I absolutely recommend them, especially at their current price point.

I am currently hiding in the bathroom with noise canceling headphones because my dad is eating popcorn and it makes me want to rage and cry. Everyone is always chewing crunchy things and I really cannot bear it. Also now my dad is working from home I am really struggling because he breathes so loudly and is always snuffling and sniffing and clearing his throat. I read that exposure to misophonia triggers makes the condition worse, and I am worried that it is going to continue to spiral out of control and I just cannot take it\nAnyone relate? You will be okay, you will not spiral. Everything gets better. Just imagine when you can have a small apartment to yourself with bad noises to bother you. Just push through and imagine a better tomorrow. Maybe consider going for a walk in the mean time? Take your headphones with just incase Thanks I am 100% with you on this, it is gotten so much worse. Triggers more regularly, less bearable, and I have managed to pick up new triggers along the way, mostly due to being stuck inside with incessant chewing throughout the day. My coping strategy is to repeatedly remind myself that it will end, hopefully soon, and things will return to baseline eventually.

They are eating their lunch as I write this (multiple people). Like does it really kill you to wait 50 something minutes for lunch. At least at lunch I can drown it out with music but not during class. I hate them so much because this is a daily thing. I hate it, I hate it, I HATE IT URGGGGGG So they are eating during class? What the hell? In surprised your teacher allows that. That is rude I know how you feel. I remember being in Geometry in 10th grade and there were these losers in the back of the class loudly eating chips every so often. Ratting bags and loud crunching. Uhg! It was so infuriating. I think you should definitely talk to your teacher and try to get them to do something about those disrespectful people. That is awful and I hope it stops!", "Me when the person sitting next to me starts chewing gum  Oh good, I am not the only one who wants to go apeshit when the person next to me starts chewing gum. It takes everything in me not to react violently. Sometimes you just have to let people think you are insane when it comes to misophonia. Or even worse- when they start talking to you, you cannot actively ignore them.... I had this happen to me. I had to plug my ear in front of him. I could not plug both because he was talking to me. I love the fact that there is another jojo fan with misophonia out there \n\nAnd this is also me in class while the teacher is talking and I am clenching up my entire body as the rest of the class wonders what the hell is wrong with me Mikitaka is our misophoniac king", "Hearing the sounds my mother makes is affecting my relationship with my body and with food (TW for disordered eating) I have no clue how to talk about this without coming off like an insane asshole, but this has been bothering me for months now. My mother is a nice person, but she is the biggest source of trigger sounds in my life. I am at the point now where it is sometimes difficult for me to listen to her speak. She is always been quite overweight, and for some reason I have begun to associate that with the sounds she makes. Now whenever I hear her clearing her throat I find myself thinking, alongside the usual emotional response, \"she sounds like that because she is fat, I never want to be like that, I cannot eat, I have to lose weight\". I am already insecure about my body and get anxious about how much I eat (I am very much a healthy weight but I am quite scared of gaining weight, which I imagine is partle due to the sometimes crippling health anxiety that permeates my life), so this just adds to it. I do not have an eating disorder or anything (although my eating is probably a little disordered) and I do not hate fat people. I do not know why my brain works this way. It really bothers me and I feel like such a nasty person for thinking these sorts of things. Sorry if this post upsets anyone but I just had to get this off my chest. Hey, I think this is normal thing for everyone, even those without misophonia. \n\nYou know why people hate other people who have unnatural hair colors, are tattooed, wear piercings, have different sexual orientation etc etc? Because they have encountered one or two bad apples from the bunch and so they associated that trait with being obnoxious. \n\nMaybe acknowledging the fact above will make you aware of that you probably just associate her being fat with your trigger sounds. \n\nAnother thing thag comes to my mind is that your brain is trying to explain why you hate your trigger sounds. \n\nAlso I do not think you are an asshole or insane, I think this is very common to think such things. You may feel ashamed of yourself for thinking such stuff, but that is just your prehistoric brain that tells you to avoid being something you yourself hate. Thank you! That last paragraph in particular is really helpful. I will try not to feel too guilty about it. I can relate to making these sort of connections. At the moment I am visiting my mom and she is great but her accent and the way she talks has been triggering me because I associate it with her less positive qualities, difficult to fully enjoy the time with her and be present", "Struggles with Misophonia/Misokinesia and relationships Does anyone else have a hard time making and/or maintaining friendships because simply being around others in general is a straight up struggle? Everything the people around me do just makes me have feelings of extreme dread or rage. When people speak, eat, drink, move a certain way or have tics of any sort it sets me off. I try so hard to tolerate it and I feel so ashamed that I am not able to. Once somebody does something that triggers my misophonia or misokinesia I shut down completely and have to leave the situation. This is getting worse with age and it is seriously getting in the way of my daily life. I can barely sleep or eat in the same room as my partner anymore. They do not understand it at all and assume it is just me being a moody bit** when I get upset or antsy because of their chewing, breathing or subtle twitching.

I have not but thinking of dorms and apartments, I feel like bringing a bird would be incredibly difficult and could possibly bother neighbors/roommates way more than a dog. Not sure of your plans on where to live though.", "I wish I was strong enough to deal with this I do not know if what I am going through is really misophonia, it sounds like it from what I have read but if it is not I apologize for posting here. I do not know how common it is where you live, but in my small European country there is a church in every village, and they all have churchbells that ring extremely loudly at any time of day. Some time ago I moved to a village across the street from a church. It is churchbells ring every 15 minutes, and they keep going for longer every full hour. And several times a day, sometimes three times, sometimes more (today it was at 7am, 12, 16, 18 and will ring again at 20) it will go on for five to fifteen minutes straight. I live across the street from it.\n\nAt first it did not seem to bother me, sometimes it was annoying but I could tune it out. And then I got an ear infection, which made my ears hurt horribly. What made it worse was any at all loud noise. And there is a loud noise around me that I literally cannot shut off or escape or drown out, every fifteen minutes. I was in so much pain almost constantly for around two weeks, it felt like the worst migraine possible with my brain being sawed in half. \n\nI moved away from home for some time last year, but this year I am back and it is quarantine so I am almost always at home, and this sound makes me feel awful. I have so much anxiety. I can sit through it when it is going on for a couple of seconds, but when it is going on for five or more minutes multiple times a day I have to stop what I am doing and I just feel terrible.\n\nI sleep with earplugs in, and this helps me not wake up because of it at seven in the morning. I do not know what I can do during the day though. I bought noise cancelling headphones yesterday, but it was a faulty pair, and they really are not much help with high-frequency noises anyway. I have to turn the volume way up to not hear it, and if I keep doing it literally every day it is going to be damaging to my ears and that is the last thing I want. Today I could not finish cooking, I had to stop and run to my room to get headphones cause I did not have them on me, and wait it out. And then I cried because I cannot even cook properly with this going on. I wish I could get over it because it is been years, and just live my life normally. I do not want to blast music at dangerous volumes cause I cannot otherwise get through the day. I am so sad and angry with myself because I cannot get over it. I am so weak and I wish I could handle this better. I am so sorry you are going through this. I cannot offer much advice, other than headphones, and maybe seeing if there are any local therapists that might help even if its only for anxiety/panic attacks, and not misophonia (rare &amp; hard to find those specialised in misophonia) \n\nTry to find the quietest spot in your house for when you need a desperate retreat or recharge. E g my bathroom has a loud fan, and since that can drown out quite a bit, I often hide in there for 10mins whilst I calm down from a bad trigger. Even if it is only temporary, it is good to have a \"rescue spot.\"\n\n\nThat said, you are not weak. It takes so much mental effort to get through the day with misophonia, especially with such a frequent trigger as yours. Its draining to hear you triggers, and the increasing fatigue often causes a vicious cycle in which your reaction to triggers get increasingly worse as a result of the fatigue and vice versa.\n\nThe best solution is to move obviously, but just know you are not alone, and your not weak, everyone has their troubles and we are sadly the unlucky ones to have got such an unrecognised disorder. Wish you so much luck, and hope this helps a bit.\n\nEdit: Also, it is helpful to compare misophonia to any other disorder. You would not expect a depressed person to solve their own depression without professional help, so do not expect that of yourself!! We do not have enough resources or research for most of us to have professional help, so unfortunately we can only learn to cope with little tricks for now. Do not beat yourself down about being unable to cope, it is an incredibly difficult disorder to live with. Thank you for saying this! I hope I can get by with a good pair of headphones (will probably need to replace the ones I have now) and meditation. I cannot really afford a therapist, and I think it would be better for me right now to move, and not have to experience this sound again, so most of my money needs to go towards that.\n\nI was really doubting whether I have misophonia, because I only experience this with one sound which is a very unusual trigger (at least I have not heard anyone talking about it), and I feel completely fine with all other everyday sounds. I also was not sure if misophonia could happen after a traumatic event, but I just read this: \u201cTo develop the reflex, you have to have a state of distress and hear some repeating sounds. One way this happens is to experience distress where there is also an irritating sound that increases the distress.\u201d And this is exactly what happened to me. I was in distress, and heard a sound that increases the distress repeatedly.\n\nThanks again for writing all this! It really made me feel better after today \ud83d\udc95 It really helps to write it down and have somebody listen \ud83e\udd17 You are not weak at at. I honestly wished I could help you. I have misophonia too and today I just woke up to the sound of my sister chewing her stupid gum next to me ( one of my biggest triggers) I told her to stop but she just ignored me, so I had to flee downstairs...\n\nEveryone with misophonia is strong believe me. I hope you are doing well now. Unfortunately for now, headphones and running are out only options.", "Why did not my parents help me? I have literally just come across the concept of Misophonia and I feel like it is changed my life. I have never felt so vindicated!\n\nMy triggers started when I was young, about 8 or 9 years old and I am now 26 years old. My family made me feel like I was such a bad person and I honestly believed it. Does anyone on here feel resentment towards their families? I cannot help but question why my parents did not look into things when clearly my reactions were extreme. Instead, I have had to suffer with this for 17 years on my own, living in a constant state of anxiety. I feel really sad for the little girl in me that had to cope with this all on my own. \n\nAnyone out there go through any similar feelings? How did you broach the subject with your family once you would learned what misophonia is and how did they react? I have autism spectrum disorder (Asperger's specifically), so my mom and I had already been doing a lot of work over the years. I learned about misophonia after almost being stuck on a plane with a screaming child sent me into a quiet rage that had me saying things that shocked my mom. Honestly, it was only my aversion to being judged by people that kept me in my seat. So I brought it up to her, and she said it explained so much: the extreme reactions I had to kids making certain sounds in middle school just to piss me off, having a meltdown because a neighbor decided he wanted to be out chopping firewood at night when I was trying to sleep, screaming bloody murder at the dogs when they would start barking incessantly, etc. I think we were both relieved to have an answer. ASD already made my senses work on overdrive. Did not help to have this stacked on top of it increasing the chances of a meltdown. But at least we know the reason now, so in a way it is like a load off our shoulders. Well you are definitely not alone, most kids with miso are told they are being dramatic or bossy or too sensitive. Once It was actually a diagnosable disorder things got a lot better with my family. I send them articles and info on it. Our brains are wired differently, that is just a fact. It is hard to argue with a brain scan. \n\nThat said I am sorry you had to deal with this all on your own for so long. You did not deserve ridicule or criticism just because you were staying your needs! It is such a hard thing to explain, that a sound can be physically painful. But maybe if they read up on it more they will at least begin to understand. I feel you! I am 32! And found out about misophonia when I was 26. And I have memories from when I was a little kid struggling with triggers and having problems eating at the table all the time with my family and my whole life I felt like a bad person like there was something wrong with me. Like I was just a very hard person to be around and deal with. Delicate and intolerant. It is so hard. I still struggle with misophonia and I still do not have support from anyone because nobody around me understand it and nobody takes it seriously. Somebody just told me this week. \u201cI do not think you are even trying\u201d like I have not tried my whole life to do not be so upset and bother by those specific sounds. It is very sad. You are definitely not alone.", "Hello  Hi, my trigger sounds are when people smack/talk with their mouth full and when I ask a family member to stop they either smack louder or talk with their mouth full and when I say \u201cplease swallow your food\u201d they keep on ridiculing me. How do I deal with this until I can move out?", "My job is making me miserable and need advice I work a office type job at a retail store where I sit in a room with one other person and two others working in front of the store. I used to have to the office area all to myself and it was pure heaven. Now I have to hear my trigger sounds more often now and in closer proximity. Two people have chronic coughs and it is making it hard for me to feel comfortable there.\n\nMy mom had lung cancer when I was 21 and one person's cough sounds almost just like hers, and  they have these really loud fits and have to drink water every few minutes. It is jarring and I can hear it all the way from where I am. The person who sits near me has allergies and coughs for hours after eating and sniffs hard. It has been making me feel mega depressed because I feel trapped and do not know what to do. I do not have health insurance and my Klonopin ran out a month ago and there is no legal way of getting the prescription refilled. I have been binge drinking chamomile tea and it helps just a little. I try to deep breathe and tell myself positive self-talk and remind myself they are not coughing to make me angry, etc. it does not always help but I try. \n\nIt is been legit making me dread my job and my days off are spent in absolute fear of when I have to go back and subject myself to the extreme stress all over again. The severe anxiety makes me stutter when I answer the phone and my muscles are so tense they burn with pain. I cannot live with this constant state of fight or flight forever. Can someone please help me? I cannot just up and quit my job because I support myself and live alone. I do not know what what other job would be better suited for me. Are you allowed to wear earbuds in your office? It is been a lifesaver for me. Like earbuds that play music? No but I have foam ones I wear secrely Wax swimmers earbuds are a million times better than foam really?? Yes Is there anywhere you can be relocated? Talk to your boss and mention how you know it is not your coworkers' fault, but that it is bringing you distress because of the experience with your mom. Hot dang I will have to try them then I wish but its a small retail store so no where else to move me. :( Damn. I am sorry, man, coughing is my main triggering sound. Sending you good thoughts regardless. \u2764\ufe0f Can you tell me how you cope? Its such a rare trigger and I cannot seem to find anyone to talk to. I have found lots of benefit from talking therapies to help me understand the causes of my triggers. There is probably some use in exploring the links between coughing as your trigger and the trauma that you experienced around your mums illness. Is there any way you can access some counselling or psychotherapy? I wish I had a surefire method, but I do not. :/ I am in college right now, and when I cannot wear bluetooth earbuds under my beanie hat or need to listen to a lecture, I struggle very similarly to you. \n\nI have noticed that the longer I have been awake before a class starts, the better I am able to mentally prepare myself for the day. So, I have started waking up around 5 AM or so (when my insomnia has not kept me up all night) to spend a few minutes meditating, contemplating my agenda for the day, maybe reading one of the more inspirational subreddits, and reminding myself that I have been through this exact same scenario hundreds of times before. So, I put myself in the moment and say that I am capable of getting through it again today. \n\nIt is not a complete fix, but I would say I get about 30% relief on my best days. When I get to class, I also notice engaging in some light conversation (if possible) tends to mitigate my suffering. Usually I ask someone for a pencil or whatever before class starts, and somehow the act of successfully socializing provides a quick shot of euphoria down my nerves. So maybe try talking to the cougher some? Even if it is like one or two words and about something stupid, it might help. :)\n\nBut again, I am sorry you have to go through this, and I am sorry about your mom too. Cancer killed both of my grandparents a few years back. :( No I do not have health insurance \ud83d\ude13", "I thought I was saved, but of course not So, uh... This is going to be long.\n\nI have been living with my bf in our own flat for almost 7 years. At the start, I just did not like chewing noises, like a lot of people (and I did not know misophonia exists). For 3 years, it was just a bit of my upstairs neighbor walking like an elephant on the wooden floor, so I was annoyed but not much else.\n\nFast forward to 3 years, a new downstairs neighbor appears (Yeah, I am in some kind of noise sandwich between two noisy neighbors). She started partying last summer, outside, so it was pretty much impossible to sleep because her friends just talk SO LOUDLY and shout. (A guy ACROSS the street told them to shut up, so... Yeah. Pretty loud.)\n\nI, of course, asked my landlord if there is something that can be done to shut that neighbor up. The HOA gets involved and sends her two letters (one in September, another one in October because she started being noisy again).\n\nSo, from the start of summer last year to last night, it was pure hell. I discovered misophonia, and that my trigger is (among other things) muffled voices. Guess who had stopped partying but started just talking loudly? Downstairs neighbor. Of course. At around 11pm, or even midnight. Sometimes 1am. I started getting anxious just thinking of getting to bed. Still anxious now. For the whole day.\n\nBUT. Everything could have been just... Idk. Fixed, or something, last night. Because I finally had enough and went to confront her. Turns out she is a nice lady, just oblivious (and not sober when her... Fbw I guess, come). We talked for an hour, exchanged numbers, and decided that if she is being too noisy, I can just tell her. No problem. I am a bit shy and hate confrontation, but I can do it.\n\nSo, after the talk, I go back to sleep (I think I just kind of passed out, I was so tired and stressed, my brain just shut down)! For two hours. Another friend of her is here (she asked me if I could \"save\" her from him by coming to hers, but I was asleep) and they are loud again. I am obviously still kind of stressed because of the fact that I actually dared talk to her plus the fact that I am trying to overcome my misophonia, so I try to sleep. I could finally fall asleep again when her friend left and no noise was heard.\n\nI am sick of this shit. I am sick of being scared to go to sleep. I am sick of my rage against a very nice lady, but at the same time I am sick of her bullshit. I am sick of her shit music. I am sick of having a super light sleep, where my nights are filled with only 10% of deep sleep. I am exhausted.\n\nWhat happens when I finally get a job and will have to wake up way before noon? I cannot sleep for only 3-4 hours. It is going to kill me, ffs. I just want to be deaf (well, I love music way too much so that is never going to happen). I just want to move to an isolated island, with just the noise of the waves and seagulls. Even white noise does not help. My stomach is feeling like shit all the time, I just cannot continue like that. I thought I had won.\n\nI hope my doctor will be able to help me when I see him on Monday (though I am not sure misophonia is well known in France). But shit, I should not have to take pills to be able to sleep. I do not want to take pills, I do not want to take the habit of being able to sleep thanks to some pills. The worst is that my bf is not really affected by all that (he was when there was the very loud partying, but now... Just voices, nah.) and I feel so lonely when it comes to my misophonia. He knows about it, but does not really get it (I will not blame him for that, tbh). Plus, he can fall asleep super fast.\n\nAnyway... Sorry for the long rant. I just needed to talk about it with people who actually get it. Sorry, so frustrating. Anxiety makes it worse and others do not care because they do not understand. I hated taking sleeping pills and stopped a few years ago but I do not have such annoyance at night. Does a fan in your room at night help at all? I use earbuds during the day along with anti anxiety meds, but still end up with jaw clenching issues. Good luck. The fan we have is... Well, let us say it is like having a plane next to you, so it will not really help... I hope just talking to my neighbor again and again (one day she will have to understand she can meet her Tinder friends at *their* home) will shut her up, even if it is just because I bother her too much with my \"you are making too much noise\".\n\nPerhaps therapy could help, too? Who knows.\n\nBut I will try the fan noise with an app. Let us hope it will work!\n\nAlso, I am sorry you had to go through taking sleeping pills. It is not something we should have to do just to be able to meet a basic need: sleep. Ok so you have to come to terms with the fact your neighbour is not \u2018nice\u2019, you think she is but if she was you would not have heard another word from her that night.\n\nI would be absolutely mortified if my neighbour knocked on my door about any loud noise after 10pm, I would feel like such an arsehole.\n\nYou have to TELL her, NO NOISE after 11pm, ever!\n\nIt is just common sense to be quiet when people are in bed.\n\nFor the sake of your mental health you have to know that you will be able to have no disruptions after 11.\n\nI do not think that is too early for her either, most people who have jobs are not partying after then and have to get up early so she can shut the hell up.\n\nGood luck Also try brown noise! I had to google brown noise, it sounds rather soothing! Thanks Sounds like you have patience and a sense of humor when dealing with your social media active internet harlot.  Until I found others with noise sensitivity like yours i thought i was just a little weird! Not thankful for this affliction but thankful to find out that I am not a solo monomania! It is quite easy to ignore is not it? While also covering the offending noise! &gt; Sounds like you have patience and a sense of humor when dealing with your social media active internet harlot\n\nWell, I may think that having two dudes visit you in one night is a lot, but... It is not my life, not my body. So I just let her do her thing without judging too much. So yeah, just trying to laugh a bit at the situation! We talked for a whole hour, and she was apologizing during the whole thing. I seriously think she was too drunk (kept drinking wine when I was talking with her). Maybe she is a manipulating bitch, maybe not. I really hope she was just *really* drunk...\n\nFor once, I try to see the good side of humans, and it bites me in the ass. Great.\n\n&gt; You have to TELL her, NO NOISE after 11pm, ever!\n\nWhere I live, it is 10PM. One more hour of pure silence I could have! A WHOLE HOUR. I have three nights before I see my doctor. If she ever is noisy during those nights, I will have more ammo against her. Something like \"We talked about this, and you probably *know* that after 10PM you are supposed to shut up, girl.\"\n\nWhat kills me is that she is 10 years older than me. Like... Fucking grow up. It is not that hard. I have had a similar problem for the last few months - though not as bad as you - so I can definitely sympathise with how much stress this causes.\n\nThis is long - sorry!\n\nI live in the UK in an semi-detached old house that is converted into flats, I am on the ground floor. Upstairs are OK and the noise of people just walking about does not seem to bother me. It is next door that is the problem. I think its a house share and they are all in the 20s with a group of \"lads\". Their house through my wall sounds like a cave so I do not think they have any carpets. In my living room I can hear them talking, I can hear them putting plates away and turning on sockets. Sometimes they play loud music. I have to turn my TV right up to cover their talking, louder than I would really like it.\n\nThe worse thing though is about 6 months ago a new person moved into the room that shares a wall with my bedroom. I can hear EVERYTHING he does in there. Practically hear conversations, when he has his girlfriend around... I swear I even could hear him wrapping christmas presents. He does have a penchant for EXTREMELY loud music (somebody gave him a new speaker for Christmas) and its the type of music I have which is extremely bassy and vibrates my flat (I hate this music, it makes me feel like I am going to have a heart attack). If it is a unreasonable time or way too loud  I knock on the wall he will turn it off, thankfully.\n\nThe worst thing is I do not classify 90% of this noise as \"unreasonable\" it is just the normal noise of people living in a house but I reckon its a just all shitty landlord hard flooring in high ceiling open plan room with no carpets or decent furninute to stop the sound all just coming through my wall. I do not feel I can go around and ask them to not talk in their own home! I also rent so I cannot do much on my side either (I do have carpets!). I am trying to save to buy my own house where I can line party walls with book cases!\n\nI bet a lot of people would not be so bothered by it but voices will wake me up 100% of the time. Often I get to sleep only to be woken up later by him talking or having sex with his girlfriend (or watching porn, somtimes hard to tell)! This lead to a lot of anxiety about being able to sleep through the night and I felt like total shit for about 3 months hoping my body would adjust and let me sleep. And being tired and more stressed also made me even more irritated by my very noisy loud eating colleague in the office!\n\nI now also get anxiety at the weekend over whether I can have a nice quite time in or if I will have to suffer hearing those idiots messing about next door and playing music all day (music I cannot stand too!). I feel so trapped by it.\n\nSorry for jumping on your rant with my own - a long way of saying, I know how horrible this is! You are not alone.\n\nAnyway - I ended up with ear plugs for times when I can tell he has somebody over when I go to bed and I now always go to sleep with some soothing music on set to play for 2-3 hours. I tried white noise or fans but it actually stresses me out more! The ambience sounds from the Skyrim soundtrack do the trick for me. If I cannot drop off then I will also have one of the Headspace app Sleepcasts on as I find those voices more soothing to focus on. &gt; I hate this music\n\nLooks like a lot of noisy neighbors have shitty music tastes, haha! Well, to us, I mean.\n\n&gt; The worst thing is I do not classify 90% of this noise as \"unreasonable\" it is just the normal noise of people living in a house\n\nExactly. When my neighbor upstairs just walks and play the bass during the day, it is the kind of noise that will make me hate him (Even though he is a really nice man. He even told me I could ask him to talk to the downstairs lady if I felt like I needed a bit of support.), but... It is just normal noise. Normal noise that make me feel I cannot watch a series on the TV because all I will hear is his bass. Ugh.\n\n&gt; This lead to a lot of anxiety about being able to sleep through the night\n\nMy two last nights have been cut like two or three times. I do not know why, maybe anxiety. I am sleeping like a baby, and suddenly, without any reason I wake up. Last night, my neighbor did not make any noise - a miracle - so I should be able to sleep through the whole night without waking up. The app I have to let me know if I sleep \"well\" (the Xiaomi app, Mi Fit or something like this) tells me I slept for 10h, but with only 30min of deep sleep. That is like 5% of my night. Now, I do not need to wonder why I am always tired, I guess...\n\n&gt; The ambience sounds from the Skyrim soundtrack do the trick for me.\n\nI am not surprised! The game's music is absolutely perfect to relax or focus. My favorite is probably \"Atmospheres\". I will give it a try when I go to bed.\n\n&gt; Sorry for jumping on your rant with my own\n\nNo need to be sorry! I completely agree with you, I have a 60 year old neighbour who has HUGE parties and has people over all the time with music blasting and screaming \u2018woo\u2019 etc.\n\nWhen i complain about it people always say oh but she just likes to have fun... yeah but they do not have to listen to that when they are trying to sleep.\n\nI just think houses are for relaxing in, especially if you have immediate neighbours.\n\nIf they want to party so bad maybe buy a detached house in the middle of nowhere!\n\nHopefully you can talk to her again when she is sober, it is not fair you have to pollute your body with medication because that old slapper cannot be quiet! &gt; 60 year old neighbour who has HUGE parties\n\nWell, here is something I never thought I would read in my life.\n\n&gt;I just think houses are for relaxing in, especially if you have immediate neighbours. If they want to party so bad maybe buy a detached house in the middle of nowhere!\n\nBINGO!! Good luck! Please update us \u2764\ufe0f I did not say before but well one for going to talk to you neighbours!\n\nI have never properly met my neighbours but I have decided they are all dicks and I hate them! If they played music I liked I would not mind quite so much... there used to be a girl who lived there who sang show tunes. I did not mind that - except when it was \"All That Jazz\" for 30 minutes straight.\n\nI think because I know the Skyrim \"sounds\" its quite comforting. I found a 'podcast' on Spotify that loops them so there are no breaks between the tracks. I just pop some of those onto a playlist for the night. If you have a subscription search for Skyrim ambience it should come up. There is a night sounds version and a towns one. I think they are 1-2 hours each.\n\nIf when I go to bed they are talking (or other stuff) I have to have ear plugs and the music.\n\nI feel more settled now with sleeping since I have a plan to manage it I get less psyched up - and I got enough sleep again to feel I can manage the gym which also helps be more tired at night. It took a few months of misery though - even if its quiet at night your body/brain its probably stuck on high alert for anything that would wake you up. \n\nIts so hard when you do not get sleep :(\n\nI really hope you can find something that helps! What the freak? Sounds like she is crossed the fine line between \u201centertaining some casual friends\u201d to \u201cguess how I pay my rent \u201c.  Maybe when you cross paths from now on, be pleasant and say things like, \u201cwow, sounded like you were having a great time last night We could hear everything. Thanks for the entertainment! \nSo sorry you need to deal with idiots like that. Well, I only hear her when she laughs. She must be silent during the deed. And I am way too shy to say this, haha! It took me months to finally be able to talk to her. Before this, the HOA sent her warnings, and she showed she did not like that (I am not ashamed of telling on her though. I am not the one blaring music and inviting noisy friends, after all. And I only did what my landlord told me to do. No guilt whatsoever!)\n\nI am sure I will find a way too sleep well, I am not that worried. It is just my brain being an ass and making me panic. Seeing that people manage is pretty inspiring! And maybe when I move out one day, I will have nice and calm neighbors! :D Thanks! Good luck with Party Grandma! Are you me? \n\nI also get anxiety on weekends now until about 9pm when I am sure there will not be any parties.\n\nThe thing is we should ALWAYS be able to relax in our own homes.\n\nIt is the same with me also, it is just the usual noises of people talking and living, watching tv etc, it does not bother anyone else so I feel like a freak. Its a horrible feeling is not it :( I live alone so it also actually makes me feel more isolated too... And like I might actually just be going mad! \n\nThe dream is to live in a detached house but I do not think I will ever be able to afford that in the UK! I think we are twins seriously, we think so much alike.\nI also live in the UK.\n\nA few posts back I said the exact same thing.\n\nIt is my dream to have a detached, only 15% of homes in the UK are detached... why?! \n\nWhy does everyone want to live on top of each other? I will never understand it.\n\nI think I am going mad too, I sometimes think I hear it but it cannot be, it is just my brain giving me anxiety.\n\nIf you ever feel alone, you can always message me.\nI know exactly how you are feeling so you should not feel alone. The UK is too small and too densely populated for us all to be detached! I grew up on a farm in the countryside in the pitch black and silence, moving to towns with street lights and neighbours took adjusting... I sleep soooo well when I visit my parents!\n\nLast night next door was making a weird sporadic and not too loud knock/scratch on my bedroom wall and I could not work out what he was doing - that was making me feel crazy! ... Had to get the ear plugs out to get to sleep.\n\nI do not think next door have any idea how much noise I get from them.\n\nWe just all need soundproofed party walls, floors and ceilings... \n\nThank you, the same to you! Saaaaaame!!! My bf is basically half deaf n i have supersonic hearing. I swear the only time i get awesome sleep is when im absolutely exhausted from all the noise stress of this job i started a month ago. I have a job interview with a library on monday n i really hope its going to be as quiet as i expect it \ud83d\ude01\nKeep us posted about the dr. Appt Oooh, I hope you get that job, and that the library is quiet!\n\nThe doctor gave me pills that help sleep, BUT we cannot get addicted. It is just stuff that helps you relax a bit (it is pills filled with herbs, and it tastes like grass. Bleh).\nEven the dr said I do not need the real stuff.\n\nThe best part is that (well, as far as I know) the neighbor downstairs has not made any noise for like two weeks!", "Has anyone ever had a dream where they heard a trigger? A few days ago, I had a dream where I was eating super with my folks as a teenager.  This used to be hell for me for various reasons.  My folks would be bitching about my grades, while my little sister smacked her lips loudly and eating like a slop.  The dream was really realistic in that I did feel triggered.  I was curious if anyone else has had a similar experience. I feel like I have before, but i cant think of the exact situation. It probably led to me feeling panicked and then waking up pissed off. If that wasnt the case, I might have just had a few instances of dream triggers that lasted 10 seconds and were immediately forgotten afterwards. But either way, it sucks that you had to take all that in when your body was supposedly resting. Have you had any incidents with your triggers lately? That might be part of what caused it. Or if you have just had your mind on them a lot lately that could be another reason for it. I think my family is on my mind.  My mom is in the hospital at the moment.  She is doing well, she just a bad fall a week ago.  My dad also has some health issues.  My sister is no longer with us and I have always regretted being shitty to her when she triggered me.  Oh wow, that is really tough... that is probably what caused the stress that appeared in your dream. I want you to know that it is okay to feel bad for lashing out at someone after being triggered, but you should never hold a grudge against yourself for it. It is something you can barely control. Your sister would love you anyways, I can assure you of that. When you find yourself feeling guilty, try thinking of that and remember that it was only a small part of your past with her. May she rest in peace, and I hope your parents get well soon", "This is actually getting so hard to cope with\u2026 I do not know if I can do this anymore. Like, no one takes it seriously, everyone does not give a crap about me or this stupid thing I have going on. Even my friends just eat and chew gum next to me. They would be like \u201coh sorry\u201d and then continue eAtiNg. ???? Then why tf- huh?? I cannot even study in my room because I share it and I always have to wait till at least midnight to start studying cuz then everyone is asleep. Uhhh I wish I had real friends or people who could remotely try their best to understand me\u2026 Hey, take a breath. I am really sorry you are dealing with this. I do not have misophonia, but my daughter has developed it over the last few months, so we are learning as we go.\n\nThe first thing I would advise is to get some noise-cancelling headphones. My daughter is also triggered by eating sounds, and she wears her headphones and listens to brown noise at mealtimes. She says that drowns out the eating sounds better than other types of noise, plus we can still have a regular conversation, we just need to speak a little louder.\n\nI do not know if night time or sleeping noises bother you, but if so, then I would also suggest getting sleepphones. These are headbands with flat speakers in them, made to be worn while you sleep. I use them every night to listen to a podcast to go to sleep. They are not noise cancelling, but they still might help.\n\nMy daughter uses ( \n\nI use ( \n\nMy son uses ( when we go to concerts.\n\nI do not know if you have researched misophonia, but ( that might have some helpful information, and you can always check the list of resources in the right-hand column on this page.\n\nAnother thing we have found is that misophonia seems to be tied to anxiety and stress. I do not know if you have any of those issues, but if so, perhaps you can speak to a nurse or other health care provider. At least, maybe you could look into trying some mediation or other calming techniques.\n\nGood luck. I wish my mom (assuming you are so) was half as understanding about misophonia as you are. People like you are what keep many of us going, thank you :)", "Help please Hey all can someone please message me..  I need a distraction from my surroundings at the moment.. (my father's eating cereal in the same room as mead I cannot leave and I do not have my ear buds.)\n\nPlease help Humm or tap on your ears over and over I plug my ears tight by pushing the tragus part in, and make a sort of white noise by swishing spit tightly in the corner of my mouth. Sorry this is 2 days late. That sounds like torture :(", "Are you alright with the noises you make but hate it when other people do the same? Hello,\n\nI was wondering if anybody has this. I HATE when other people make certain noises. Examples are my dad when he is sitting and shuffling with his feet. I cannot stand it. Or when my mom is rubbing her hands or eating yoghurt. But when I eat myself or do those hand rubbing things myself I do not have any problems. Do you guys have the same thing. For example when you hate people clicking a pen but you can do it and it does not bother you at all? I find that a bit weird and I cannot explain why it is does not bother me when I do it myself. This happens to me too and I do not know why :( Kind of makes me feel guilty because I had feeling mad at my family members Yep Yep I immediately have to eat something if I am unable to escape chewing noises. It depends on whether or not I can control it. For example, I hate the sound of peoples noses whistling. When my own nose whistles, I get just as upset since it came out of nowhere. However, I also hate the sound of snapping and chewing, but when I do either of those things, I am actively making the choice to, so it does not bother me I find that very interesting. If you actively make the choice. I am going to see if I do that. For sure, though I think a factor for some sounds (eg chewing) is that the sound of yourself doing it is fundamentally different. An interesting experience I had: I was taking a video of something, and was chewing gum at the same time. No issues so far. But when I replayed the video, I could not stand the sound, yet it was me. Deleted it as a result. I cannot stand people who eats and I cannot stand myself eating. Just the noise make me cringe, so I usually eat while watching something with earphones. I make myself angry when I do to much noise, like sneezing or coughing. YES! i am personally sensitive to breathing, snoring, things of the like but sometimes to relax me i mimic those noises. Depends on the noise, and how it relates to chewing or eating. If I can control it, I am absolutely disgusted with myself if I accidentally smack or slurp. If I cannot--a belch or episode of flatus--I am not bothered.\n\nThe other poster nailed it with their reference to control. If I can stop it or escape it, I do not flip out, but if I cannot, a cortisol storm and meltdown ensue. And I am within earshot, I will not be pleased. Who chooses to chew loudly or snap anything with their mouth? I hate my own noises too I became a ninja I am so quiet I am so sorry In most cases my own noises do not bother me much because I am the one controlling them, but sometimes I will make some various noise that irks me. A lot of times I am already in a bad mood though. Same for me, loud footsteps are one of my biggest triggers and when i hear my footsteps when walking, plus if i have earplugs or headphones i have to walk on my tippy toes to not get angrier I hate it when I make the noise as well. I end up triggering myself. Omg my own footsteps get to me too! I always hates the sound of flip flops, or bare feet smacking a hard surface floor. When I hear myself do it I get some triggers I usually have to turn something on while I eat as well. But, when I have to eat with headphones it can actually make it worse because it sounds louder in my head as opposed to getting drowned out when watching something on a TV/phone.", "I guess I am cured?!??  \u201cIgnore it\u201d, alrighty then!

Let me explain- i first noticed this at a sleepover in 2004 back when we had old-school, clicky-style buttons and texting took 10x longer. I woke up to the sound of the girl next to me, everyone else asleep, texting someone on her loud-a$$ phone and I remember being filled with rage. I felt it was so disrespectful in a quiet room filled with people sleeping to be what sounded like clacking on a keyboard. \n\nFlash forward a few years later when everyone was getting ringtones of ACTUAL SONGS (mild miso ptsd from this era), the compressed quality plus peaking through such terrible speakers would make my heart race and if the person did not answer their phone quickly I would want to grab it and throw it as far as possible. So glad that socially we have moved to an era of silent/vibrate/ringing thru earbuds so we do not have to hear that shit as much.\n\nHOWEVER \n\nNow we are in an era of scrolling and short videos/clips and changing sounds and energies quickly. It seems the new normal to have something playing on TV and scrolling thru videos on a phone in the same room. I have a rule in my home that if something is on the television or music is playing, no extra device sounds over that. I will. Go. Nuts. I have noticed that my wife will watch a video (even with her airpods in) and the tinny sound comes seeping thru and pierces my brain. \n\nHelp! I dont want to control my household due to being 'picky about sounds' but the sound of other people's devices makes me go insane. \n\nPublic transportation is where this used to be the absolute worst til i got noise canceling headphones ;)  Sounds like some sort of dickhead imo agreed! seriously, how rude and inconsiderate...you would think someone would give a damn about their SPOUSE of all people my mom watches judge judy facebook videos every morning while getting ready...drives me fucking nuts. the sounds of those people yelling at each other and arguing pierce my soul. i also hate the sounds of people clicking their keyboard. my parents type really slow, it is painful. for some reason fast typing does not bother me as much, but still bothers me I have a co-worker whose very loud ringtone is  achmed the terrorist \"I kill you\" every call and text. I fucking haaaaate Jeff Dunham and especially that character. I have to leave the office everytime his phone goes off...makes my skin just crawl I have the same issue (among others lol). For me, I try to ask my sibs or family member if theyind putting head phones in or pausing it while they enter another room/plop down and start something in background. I hate it when my sis starts a \"Let us Play\" video in the kitchen with the no ear buds. I mean... Come on! It is a public room! \n\nI have found that the foam earplugs work. They DO NOT cancel ALL the noise but it blocks out all the small things or the TV from another room. I also use it during dinner, sometimes with only one in and on the side of the noisiest eater. Oh man to start your day with all that bickering...rough stuff. So sorry! And totally agree about the slow typing- its so much worse Omg has anyone at work been like...stfu?

There is a group of teenagers who like to walk around the block, always speaking really loud. There is one in special who is really, really annoying. His voice is annoying, he speaks very loud, almost always laughing and screaming, and he speaks nonstop, rarely stopping for breathing. It triggers my misophonia in so many ways...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always tried to calm down and ignore it, I have been living here for 5 years or so and could handle it just fine. Due to the pandemic, I am home 24/7, which means I have to hear his voice frequently (and yes, he is disrespecting the quarantine). This means that recently my misophonia only got worse. I become really stressed and anxious because of his voice.   \n\n\nI found him on Facebook one day, and I decided to ask him via Messenger to stop screaming so much. He got me really wrong and responded in a very stupid manner, then blocked me.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe continues walking around, speaking really loud, screaming... I am too anxious to ask him to stop in person, but I am panicking. Hopefully, I have Bose headphones, they are great, but they do not cancel voices. Even if I keep it on noise-canceling mode, I still hear the guy. I even emailed the administration, but they ignored me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is bad that people do not understand what we go through. I do not want to be the kind of stupid neighbor who harasses people for making noises, but he is frequently very loud and has no consideration for other people. My neighbour is the same, talking outside my house all the time. \nIt is so loud and I hate her voice, she was out there for 9 hours the other day.\n\nAll I can hear from inside my house with the windows shut is that horrible voice!\n\nThere is really nothing we can do about it, they are not doing anything \u2018wrong\u2019, annoying but true. Exactly. I am handling this by putting on my phones and going to my bedroom (which is opposite to the street). &gt;I found him on Facebook one day, and I decided to ask him via Messenger to stop screaming so much. He got me really wrong and responded in a very stupid manner, then blocked me.\n\nI am constantly surprised that people think this sort of thing is going to work for a) someone who is disrespecting quarantine and b) runs around screaming a lot.   They never will turn around and go \"oh, ok, I will stop\"....   He is not acting reasonably in the first place, asking nicely is not going to change that he is an asshole. \n\nAnd if he acted nastily in messages then why would you want to confront this person in person? They are not going to react well and likely will just result in them finding ways to do it more, if not a larger incident in person that could include physical harm. \n\nI would try to find out if this person lives in the block and ask management to talk to them about it (citing many people complaining, not just you) but ultimately you cannot force people to act differently.   Also checking condo rules if they do live there for anti social behaviour or noise out of hours (if it is) rules would be a good idea as it would give the management/board more reason to ask for better behaviour or consider appropriate responses as the whole condo, not just one person. He lives in the block, I tried emailing the administration but they did not answer me. But anyways, you are right. He was an asshole and will continue to be, he does not care, confronting him will be like playing chess with a pigeon. I think other neighbors might be annoyed as well, but they never react.", "Is apartment living hell on earth for people who suffer from misophonia?

Unfortunately, there is a member that is eating/chewing cum.  Thankfully, she is not a godawful lip smacker.  However, just watching her chew up close is annoying as fuck. That is one heck of a typo... But yeah, that is painful. Certainly not appropriate \"social skills\" either. Could you talk a bit about your experience with Toastmasters? I have been very curious about it as I have always struggled with social skills I feel you. I am the co-leader of my schools book club and there is been several times someone has been eating on call.

(12 AM) My sister &amp; I share a room. Around 10 mins ago, I heard a loud-as-hell fly buzzing sound and it caused me to gasp in fear. I asked my sister if she heard anything and she said no, outside of the noise I would made, but she offered to turn on the lights &amp; I accepted.\n\n'Been sitting here in a chair that is shitty for my back because I and I am too paranoid to go back to bed (where I initially heard the sound) for fear the sound will occur again.\n\nUghhh. I do not know whether the potential fly was outside (bc my bed is right up against the window) or if the sound was *in, or right above my bed.*\n\nA few weeks ago, a similar scenario happened n I figured I was just imagining the fly sound because I looked EVERYWHERE for the damn source of the noise, but then it turned out there *was* a sneaky bastard fly in the room all along (smh) so I am impossibly conflicted about whether or not the sound this time is real.\n\n-My sister didnt hear the sound\n-The sound hasnt been made again\n-There are no visible bugs in the area (&amp; I searched everywhere I could.)\n\nim going nuts.\n\nI was supposed to be up early tommorrow but I couldnt fall sleep by a decent hour, and now, on top of this, I dont know if I will even sleep at all.\n\nAnd Ive been so tired today, I dont know if I am going to be able to stay up another 8 hours... damn itttt..\n\nWhy am i like this?\n\nI cant even go outside to watch the dog while shes outside because the bees out there trigger the hell out of me.\n\nMisophonia is making me so fucking useless. Cant be a decent member of the household and watch the family dog. Cant get sleep because of paranoia over a bug that *might not even exist.* Cant eat at the dinner table with my family on many nights.\n\nFor *3 nights straight* I thought there was a beehive behind my damn window and when my mom checked, there was *nothing.*\n\n*It was the neighbor's electricity (presumably their heating) humming that was triggering me all night.* It since hasnt been botherig me but jesus CHRIST that was a fucked up week.\n\nFuckkk\n Im just done. I do not want to stay up all night and have to cancel my morning plans because Im too tired to function. Im sick of cancelling things. Its always one problem or another, from me or from them, and the constant cancellations on *everything* (even LONG before the pandemic) is making me miserable.\n\nIm going to risk going back to bed but I swear to god Im going to go ballistic if I hear that sound again.\n\nlights: on all night I hear ya on the whole not sleeping thing. It is been a hot minute since I have fallen asleep naturally. Maybe try investing in some comfortable ear plugs. Maybe even try playing music softly on a speaker. You could even try watching a really boring show. Or even asmr (got to find a trigger that is not a trigger). Personally I try exercising and tiring myself a couple hours before I go to sleep. That works as long as I do not grab my phone or start having a quarter-life crisis\ud83d\ude02.What is worked the most for me lately is watching Neil deGrasse Tyson\u2019s podcast. It is great because you learn something and fall asleep. Best wishes and hopefully sweet dreams! I am the same way. I live in two houses, and I share a room at each house. It is hell.\n\nSometimes I will think I hear loud heavy breathing and I do not.\n\nGod...breathing....\n\nAnd then I found out.\n\nIt was my fan, the thing that was supposed to help me sleep at night. Before I knew, I thought I was losing my mind. I thought was hallucinating it. I can hear it right now, and I have a new fan.\n\nI know exactly what you mean. I wear my headphones when I eat, but I feel so embarrassed to wear them out in public. I am not allowed to eat somewhere else. It sucks.\n\nI used to cry literally all night from being pissed at the trigger sounds I was hearing, and I could not sleep either.\n\nYou are not alone on this. I hear auditory hallucinations too, almost every night. I always think I can hear my neighbor playing music through the wall over the 3 fans we have running. Because way, way, WAY too often I actually DO hear her music through the wall, like the one time you actually found a fly. And I do not want to turn off the fans to see if I actually am hearing music because then I definitely will not be able to sleep. So I just lie there not knowing and read a book on my phone until I pass out. Drives me absolutely crazy. I have auditory hallucinations too &amp; it is difficult at times to determine if there is actually a noise or just a hallucination :/ Breathing.. At my grandparent's house I share room with my sister, she breathes really loud and her nose begins to whistle. \nUgh, just describing it makes me feel horrible. Sometimes it happens to me too, I think there is a mosquito and there is nothing and it does not let me sleep or if I share rooms with somebody like my sister who breathes really loud I will not be able to sleep. Sometimes I will begin crying and wake my sister up who just gets mad at me for waking her an goes back to sleep. Those days I probably just slept for an hour because of it. I am sorry if this question is weird, but does killing a fly that triggered you give some kind of satisfaction? Not sure. I try to avoid going near flies at all costs, so ever since my misphonia got super bad, Ive been asking others (mom, sisters) to kill them for me. :,)\n\nEdit: btw, that is not a weird question at all! Dont worry about it. Im sure it is satisfying though- it sure sounds like it would be. ^^", "I am changing my eating habits My own chewing sounds started to trigger me lately. It is so weird. Usually I tried to eat when others did, because it helped to be less triggered, but now my own noises are making me lose my nerves.\n It happens when I am PMSing, or when there is lots of stress at work. I started to change the way I eat - lots of liquids, tiny bites.  It is so weird. Annoying. \n\nAny tips? I also get triggered by my own chewing and I always have the tv on or some music or something to help me focus on that instead of my chewing. I have this too! For eating, I think what helps me most is a balance of distraction and masking the sound. Sometimes I will listen to shower or rain sounds in the background, and also a youtube video or podcast, something that kind of grabs my attention. \n\nAlso, I do not know exactly how gaining these kinds of triggers works, but if it is coming on because of stress, maybe there is a way to regress it back to not bothering you if you are able to kind of nip it in the bud and avoid some of these stressors? I also gained this trigger at a pretty stressful time in my life, and now for me it seems to be permanent. Or maybe it is just genetic and predetermined, I do not know. Either way, I really hope it gets better for you!", "Nobody understands how much of an impact misophonia has on my life. I have very severe misophonia despite having a small array of trigger sounds. My main trigger sounds are chewing, lip smacking, and throat clearing, although I have a few others that are not as severe. Most of my family and friends know about it, but they do not take it seriously. They think that I am just annoyed by the sounds and they always say something along the lines of \"it happens; deal with it\". Trigger sounds make my skin, eyes, and worst of all, my teeth itch. And what is even worse is that I will often break down in tears. It robs me of my ability to focus. It is as though all I car hear is the trigger sound. Everything else gets quieter and quieter while the trigger sound gets louder and louder. I have immense difficulty recovering from it - my only way to rationalize it is to say that my brain \"records\" the trigger sound and plays it incessantly for hours to days on end. It makes my life so much harder and nobody understands or takes it seriously. I have spent hours desperately trying to recover from a fit, all the while being a sobbing mess. I have just pulled myself together from a 4 hour fit and everyone around me is scrutinizing me for it. I just cannot take it anymore. Same! My friend once said \"I will make sounds and u tell me what else bothers u\"    and I was like seriously?!?\nThen she goes \"I am just trying to help u not literally die when u hear sounds\" this made me a bit upset but she did not know I do not want to get angry at people for not understanding, but I cannot help it. Whenever I am eating with my family, I will start crying or anxiously clawing at my my arms and everyone will say something akin to \"fuck off\" or the more mild-mannered and polite people will just tell me to \"get over it\". It is so upsetting and it makes something that is already terrible even worse. My dad and brother do not understand either. They tell me to get over it to. I started seeing a therapist to talk about it. Is that an option u can try? I have tried seeing multiple therapists. Unfortunately I live in the land of the world's most awful therapists. I have been harassed by a few, albeit for non-misoponia related reasons that I have discussed elsewhere before. Even the better ones were of no help to me and what they said only made me feel worse or more guilty about how I handle trigger sounds. I know it sounds like I am trying to shirk off your suggestion, but I am not. I really appreciate that you are trying to help. &gt;brain \"records\" the trigger sound and plays it incessantly \n\nThis part sounds a lot like what people with PTSD go through. Even though it is a little like PTSD I would never tell this to anyone around you that are as ignorant and abusive as those you describe. Unwanted thoughts or( are a bear to fight. Your family makes it 10x harder to recover because part of misophonia is related to the emotions involved. If they add more bad emotional content then the episodes will be that much more strong. \n\nMaybe look up what people with PTSD do to get through the episodes? That is very interesting... I will look into that. Thank you. &gt; I have immense difficulty recovering from it  \n\nThis is very familiar to me.  Even once the trigger sound goes away, it takes me quite awhile to \"get back to normal\", which is the most debilitating part of it, as it is like the period after some upset or accident, I am sort of accident prone and off-balance, easily perturbed.  I have been working with doing the same self-care and soothing things I would do for upsets or accident kinds of situations.  For instance, listening to music, crocheting for awhile, reading something enjoyable. Exactly! Sometimes it takes days for the trigger sound to go away, but even when it does go away I am a nervous wreck for a while. And most of the time I just have to hold back the tears and put up with it. I hope you can find a bit of private space and be kind to yourself when these things occur.  Over time folks around you might notice when you \"take a break\" and start to realize the impacts on you. I am not so sure I understand what you mean about that last bit, but thank you. I had to read it a couple of times myself.  I meant that when they notice you taking breaks, it will clue them in to the impacts of misophonia that you feel, because that is how often and long you \"take a break\".  It is hard to say in one sentence.  Giving yourself the space to take care of your feelings in private if you need to may help them understand \"hey, something going on.\"  (I am probably projecting my own difficulties stuffing down tears onto you:  I do it best in private.) ya, my family thinks it is funny. My dad has it too and when he gets annoyed at the neighbors dogs, and yells, they ignore him. If I politely ask my brother to stop singing, I get yelled at and made fun of by my mom and brother. Especially my brother, he knows I cannot make him stop so he does it even louder and he will knock on my door and chew in my ear. But can I get mad at him without immediately getting yelled at by my mom ? Absolutely not.

I am 27 and have had bad misophonia for as long as I can remember. I have a newish job now that could really turn into a career for me, but it is in a small, open office space where I am constantly facing trigger sounds all day every day and even developing new ones due to prolonged exposure. I am in desperate need of good noise canceling headphones, but am so overwhelmed by all my options. Does anyone else here use noise canceling headphones to specifically help them with their misophonia? What did you choose and why did you choose it? Did it live up to your expectations? Was it worth your money? I am hoping to buy some for black Friday / cyber Monday and hopefully get an okay deal.\n\n Here is what I am thinking so far, if it helps guide your recommendations/advice for me...\n\u25aa\ufe0eI know I want over-the-ear headphones so that ppl can always see when I have them on and do not just think I am ignoring them. \n\u25aa\ufe0eAll day uninterrupted comfort is HIGHLY important.\n\u25aa\ufe0eI do not care if they are wireless or wired. Whichever one will last longer during the work day. (I am at work for 9 hours and DO NEED to be using them basically the whole time) \n\u25aa\ufe0eObviously the cheaper the better, so long as the quality is still there, but I understand that this can get expensive and am prepared to spend at least a couple hundred dollars, but nothing insane. Like, I am really not wanting to go over $300, absolutely $400 max. I am desperate, but I am cannot afford, like, $700 desperate. \n\u25aa\ufe0eIdk if any even do this, but if they have the ability to link with or plug into my office desk phone, that would be a cool bonus, but it is definitely not a necessity. Even if I cannot hear the phone ring, I can see it light up when it rings, so none of that is a true concern. \n\nAny advice, reviews, or recommendations would be so much appreciated. Thank you for your time \ud83e\udd70 I suuggest Bose QC35\n\nGreat noise cancellation and best comfort for all day wear.\nI wear them all day in the office.\n\nThis model is getting cheaper now as there is a newer version (QC45) out, I heard noise cancellation is on par with new and old. So you are likely to get very good deals on black friday for the QC35. I think Sony WH Series has better noise cancellation AND quality. I have had several of the QC series and they are NOT built well. I had 3 of the 4 sets I owned break. They all have this issue with one particular wire coming loose and Bose has done nothing to fix it, though I have not owned the 45s TBH. My daughter (13yo) ( She takes them to school and uses them occasionally without actually putting any sound through them. She also uses brown noise to drown out her trigger noises (&gt;!eating sounds!&lt;). She says it works better than white noise.\n\nI have also seen people on this subreddit discuss (\n\nI do not know if these would help, but my son uses ( or similar ones, when we go to concerts.\n\nGood luck, I hope you find something. And congratulations on your job! I second this Whatever you do decide to use I like using foam or airplane earplugs inside my over the ear headphones for extra protection, I would suggest trying that especially on bad trigger days :) I agree but it makes ears hot after one hour. I do that! People think I am strange. so be it Same. The QCs do not? They are definitely cooler on the ears and overall more comfortable. On the other aspects WH is better as you pointed", "My coworkers allergies are killing me  I started school recently and named the guy who sits next to me \"Sniffles\" for the same reason. We were taking a test and literally every 5 seconds. *sniff*. Everyone gives him shit for it tho so that makes me feel better. \n\nThis is one of those thing that is extremely obnoxious to the average person and I think in this case, you are going to have to be upfront and say that it is distracting and aggravating. I get allergies suck and sniffing probably itches her nose and makes it easier to breathe, but its not a long term solution and she would probably be a lot happier getting it taken care of than just living with it. \n\nIf it were me, I would ask if a humidifier would or anything else I am the office would help but regardless, you need to give her shit about it because she is probably does not even realize she does it that much so you are going to make it equally annoying so she has a reason to do something about it. Okay the thought of everyone in class getting mad at the dude doing the same thing cracks me up ngl, I wish we worked next to all my coworkers so they can also get annoyed at her and point it out so she realizes\n\nI know I really should talk to her about it, I am not very confrontational and since I am her boss I do not want it to seem like I am bullying her \n\nHopefully your guy stops sniffing too lol, thank you for the reply I am happy someone else can relate", "My misophonia has made me absolutely HATE being around my family. First of all, it is important for me (16M) to mention that I have never been formally diagnosed with misophonia by a doctor however I did bring it up to my therapist once, she did not really offer a solution nor did she provide helpful advice. I am not even certain I have misophonia but I think I do. Let me know what you guys think.\n\nI am so tired of eating dinner next to my father, who (and I cannot stress this enough) eats like a fucking COW. Like I literally cannot be around this man for more than 5 minutes without literally wanting to hurt someone. I have literally gone into fits of rage where I needed to leave the room because someone (90% of the time my father) made my trigger noise. He loudly sneezes, yawns obnoxiously, sniffles constantly, and also loudly scratches his ass. Classy, right? I love my dad but every time I feel uncontrollable anger and violence. Sorry if I sound violent (I am really not a  violent person) but I am so angry right now.\n\nDo not even get me started with my mom- who literally cannot do anything quietly. She does not walk, she STOMPS LIKE A FUCKING ELEPHANT. I literally have to wear earplugs when I go to sleep because my mom likes to wake up bright and early every morning to stomp around the house, literally scream into her phone, and slam the fucking door with all her might. They are utterly fucking unbearable. \n\nWant To hear the best part? They all think it is bullshit. I am out of my fucking mind apparently. I am thinking that I need to start eating separately from them, and I just need to try and keep out of the kitchen entirely. I am tired of having my day ruined because my dad wants to eat chips. I am tired of going into fits of murderous fucking rage whenever he sneezes or yawns or sniffles. I am literally going crazy and it is just a matter of time before I seriously hurt myself or someone else.\n\nPLEASE tell me someone can relate to this. I am sorry if I sound super angry right now but I cannot describe the sheer amounts of fucking fury this brings to me. Please give me some advice/ just tell me you can relate to what I am saying. Man that sounds just like my family, although mine is not quite as bad.  The main issue I have is when they eat.  They eat so loud.  And I can tell they know it upsets me, but they eat loudly anyway.  I have to get up and leave the room multiple times at each meal. \n\nYes, we can definitely relate.  It sounds like you have a really bad case of it, worse than mine.  I am sorry. The only remedy is to avoid the noises. There is no getting used to it.  I have tried everything.  All you can do is avoid them when they are making noises, and try to compensate by spending time with them when they are not making noises. It really sucks so bad because none of them take it seriously. I also mentioned it to my therapist but she did not really have too much to say to me which kind of disappointed me so I have just kept it to myself for a while. They just think I am overreacting and they literally laugh and smile at me when I bring up how it effects me, which in turn just makes me more mad lol. Anyway thanks for relating Oh yes. Sounds perfectly normal to me.\n\n\n\nEarplugs, headphones, background music/tv, physical separation.....one day at a time it is manageable.\n\nGood luck! I relate to this so so much. I am sorry you have to go through this. I am so sorry. \n\nAnd it is okay to be angry and let it out here, because these people are all we have and they are a very nice lot. The whole purpose of this sub is to provide support and you should not think about whether you sound violent or angry, everyone here just understands. \n\nMy family drives me nuts everyday too. Thankfully I am allowed to sit in another room while eating. But they constantly forget and come around chomping loudly making me absolutely want to break everything. My father makes me the most insane, with the most terrible chewing, throat cleaning, burping ever. My mother is horribly obnoxious and just like yours, I swear to god she cannot do a single thing quietly.  She has to scream while talking on the phone(she is doing this right now as I am typing ugh), laugh in the most irritating way and talk while chewing loudly. I love them a lot too but sometimes I am nearly on the verge of throwing something on them. It is very scary thinking of all the scenarios I imagine of hurting them. My sibling is the worst, making noises that irritate me PURPOSELY thought out the day. I lose my mind everyday and there is no escape at all. \n\nI feel you my friend. I hope you get through this. Avoiding the kitchen might work for you at the moment. I really do not have any other advice since nothing seems to work for me right now. My folks thought it was bullshit for a long time too, until I had a terrible breakdown and they were a bit willing to listen and I sent them articles informing about the disorder. Unfortunately that did not result in anything much except being allowed to eat differently, which was soon forgotten too.\n\nI am here if you need to vent anytime. Sending strength and hugs\u2665\ufe0f Yes bro I feel u. I feel a lot of people on this sub have it in a more anxious way but I just get rage. I do not know what the fuck to do either. I do not for the life of me know why people think we are crazy or sum maybe it will be different when we can actually get diagnosed. I was never formally diagnosed, but anyone who knows me can see I have had all the symptoms since childhood. I think it finally clicked for my mom when I came to her with hours and hours of research, begging her to read it because I \"was not alone.\" I think she realized if I had put that much effort into it, she should at least read it. My papa is still infuriating, but he is never been one to care about other people's feelings. My mental health improved greatly when I moved out. \n\nI actually did not hear of Misaphonia until a few years ago, so I dealt with the rage as a teenager by eating in my room so I could \"watch television.\" Or saying I was not hungry when they ate dinner and getting a plate to eat alone later. I would sometimes run to the kitchen and eat a huge \"after school snack\" so I did not have to eat later, and horded food in my room. I know it sucks right now. It is easy to forget how much being 16 sucks when you finally have your own life and get to choose when and who you eat with. \n\nMaybe work on convincing the most emotionally intelligent person in your family? I was crying when I went to my mom, and she really listened. If you have at least one ally, they will be more aware of their own noises and hopefully defend you against the other parent if they do not belive you. Aldo, try to forgive people as they trigger you. Sometimes you cannot control the rage, but try to redirect it to the food and not the people. I have to remind myself that I am the abnormal one, especially if I eat at a restaurant. (But I really fucking wish Mexican places did not serve chips and salsa.) This is a good article! I am more on the anxiety/disgust side of things but I try not to let my negative reaction to noises change how I feel about the person. It is not always easy though and I realize looking back some of my issues with my dad were alcoholism related but some were misophonia. \n\nIt would be nice if people were more accommodating but I try to remember that the noises they make constantly are done without thought, and not necessarily with ill intention. They may even be making some noises to satisfy their own anxiety/OCD issues and so in a worst nightmare you may encounter someone compelled to do these things while you recoil in anger. I cannot stand when my dog eats his food I get so very. angry. He has to wait to eat til I go to work and when my husband drinks anything that noise he makes with his mouth I just want to slap it out of his hands so annoying. Thank you!! First of all, thank you for responding!! I actually have to wear ear plugs at dinner (I have been doing this for a few months now), but it is ridiculous and I can still slightly hear them eating. I would like to go to another room but I would have to go to either my bedroom or the basement, as the dining room is right next to the kitchen and I can still hear my dad chewing from there (he is THAT loud). I remember a few days ago I was upstairs in my room and my father was downstairs and I could literally hear him chewing....when I am literally an entire floor above him. There is part of me that tells me he does this on purpose because I feel like it is literally impossible for someone to be so inconsiderate, impolite, and quite frankly disgusting lol. Thank you for responding and relating to me- best of luck! I hope they can come out with a way to treat it too I can also remember showing signs of misophonia from a young age, I can remember yelling at my sister and hitting her whenever she would start singing (which she did a lot). Misophonia has effected me negatively in many other ways - I am really irritable sometimes and I have a fiery temper and I think it has something to do with that. I am excited to one day live on my own lol. Whenever my parents leave and I am home alone it is literally paradise. Thank you for responding and relating!! Hey man, I relate. I cannot stand being around them, and my therapist offered nothing helpful for me. I am trying to move out asap - I am in and out of college and I am going to move out while I am figuring out what I will be doing during COVID. I relate. Holy fuck, you have no idea how much I relate to this. You really need to leave the home. It will not get better", "Thank you for this place. Who knows how long I have had misaphonia. Probably forever. I have also become sensitive to noise in general since working from home for over a year. Right now I have my very loud (adult) step son at my house for the next month. He blares sounds from his cell phone and when he is working, he has the volume up so loud on his computer that the vibrations from the wall make me crazy. He never stops giggling, laughing, taking, singing and making noise. \n\nAnd god dammit when he eats. He complains that normal foods are \u201cdry\u201d (this is cultural), drowns his food in sauces and slurps and smacks his lips when he eats. I internally rage. \n\nThen by the end of the day, I am shushing and cranky then tolerate nothing. I just hate it. I avoid avoiding with headphones because it only makes me more sensitive afterwards. I just hate it all and want my life back. I cannot imagine going back in to the office to work! Being able to mute people eating and drinking on Teams is the best thing that has happened in a long time. \n\nAnd I am thankfully that there are a group of people out there that will not think I am just a bitch. For years and years I had no idea this was a thing.. .. like a real thing.  I just thought i was strange or nuts.  I feel you.  Somehow I stumbled into this reddit and then did some research and holy crap .. IT IS NOT JUST ME!\n\nHang in there.. at least you know For years and years I had no idea this was a thing.. .. like a real thing.  I just thought i was strange or nuts.  I feel you.  Somehow I stumbled into this reddit and then did some research and holy crap .. IT IS NOT JUST ME!\n\nHang in there.. at least you know  My daughter seems to have developed misophonia over the last few months. I think the foundations were always there, so to speak, but being at home all the time in the pandemic probably did not help. She is found some relief by wearing headphones at mealtimes and listening to brown noise, and other times she just leaves the room. She is bothered by some of the same sounds you are, &gt;!namely chewing, but also metal on metal and metal on ceramic -- sounds when using utensils!&lt;.\n\nMy SIL foud this link, and I thought it had some good information: (\n\nThere is a link at the top to come coping tips, maybe something would help you. \n\nI do not know if you have access, but perhaps you could see an audiologist to get started on diagnosis and treatment, and the treatment will likely be some kind of therapy. I know this is difficult, so I hope you can gain some control over it. I would think feeling a loss of control is as troubling as the trigger sounds.\n\nAlso, and obviously, if you can, talk to your stepson. He probably cannot eliminate all his noise but misophonia aside, he sounds pretty noisy, and that is rude. If he is an adult, he should be able to handle requests like turning music down, etc. It is the kind of request you would get from any roommate. You do not have to mention the misophonia (I have read enough posts to know sometimes that just drives people to make the trigger noises on purpose), but you can tell him you cannot have that kind of noise when you are working from home. And I hope your spouse will back you up on it.\n\nGood luck. I am glad you are a parent who looks to understand and educate others. As someone who is now an adult, but definitely identifies with your daughter, one of the hardest things is the feeling of panic with the fight or flight response. I would yell at my family because I did not know how else to react to how I was feeling, and then they would usually try and quietly not disturb me or they would nervously look in my direction if they noticed they just made a potential trigger sound. There is so much guilt in exploding, and embarrassment in that these seem like such trivial things to be triggered by. To this day, I wish I could take back the times I lashed out as a child and instead let my family know it was not their fault, that something was/is wrong in my brain and we can work together to navigate this.", "Blatant disrespect\u2026. AGAIN. So right now my family and I are in an awkward living position as we wait for our house to built. We live in a 2 bedroom townhome, my dad and mother each with a room and me in the downstairs living room area that is right next to the kitchen. This irritates me to begin with because everyone knows how triggered I get hearing eating, so why put me of all people down there? I asked very kindly in the beginning please do not eat in the kitchen. Please. I do not have a door so I cannot shut myself out, please respect this one boundary and understand I would never ask if I had a door to close. \n\nMy dad initially tried in the beginning but over the past few months I have had to ask several times, \u201cdo you mind eating that upstairs?\u201d And each time he claims he forgot which is a *damn* lie. My entire family has known for 10+ years how triggered I feel around it. I feel deep down he does not like me telling him what to do so eating downstairs is his way of saying, \u201cI do what I want\u201d. It is really upsetting because I have asked so many times very nicely and he continues to do it. He tried to hide it but I always know when he is doing it and it is just upsetting he cannot wait 30 seconds to walk up the stairs to eat when he knows it triggers me. I understand it is my issue that it triggers me but seriously it is the only thing I have asked for and he does it anyway at least once a day. I am close to tears because it is just so disrespectful to me. Am I overreacting? \n\nI have already made arrangements to move out November 8th for both unrelated and related reasons but I needed to vent. My dad and I already have a strained relationship because of unrelated reasons, but this just proves to me how he does not care about my feelings. \n\nI cried to my mom about it because she asked what is wrong and she was like ohhh I am sorry and I get it, she is not the one who is doing it, but it sorta irritates me that she does not stand up for me. I am just feeling very unloved. I feel you soo much\u2026my dad straight up denied that I walk with my headphones in 24/7. Like wth? And yeah, unfortunately I do not think he cares about your feelings and thinks you are overreacting, but you are absolutely NOT. It is not our fault that we have this and although I can perfectly understand that people do not get it and that they dont have to change their life for us, they could at least do the bare minimum? Like, first of all, not put you there. And if they do not want to change your location, then they should accept the consequences and eat upstairs. I am almost sure that your father loves eating upstairs more anyway, he is just doing it out of spite at this point. \n\nIm sorry you are going through this, I know that feeling of wanting to poke the living hell out of your ears with a fork when hearing the sounds, and even the anxiety that comes with it is horrendous. I almost get anxiety attacks sometimes when I have to go to school cuz I know people eat in class and I cannot put in my headphones. I hope it has not gotten this bad for you. And I am so so glad that you are moving out, enjoy it! I am sure they love you, but they do not understand en just do not want to understand for some reason. It is always like that \u201coh we want the best for our child\u201d yet they do not listen to us when it comes down to stuff like this. How ironic Right? Literally the only thing I have asked of him. It is just really upsetting that something that simple cannot be followed. I know they do not empathize but they can at least try to accommodate. I feel like that is just something you do for someone you love. \n\nYep! I have been told the whole \u201cI just want you to be happy\u201d thing &amp; it is funny how it does not apply if my happiness can be improved by a simple 30 second wait to eat his food. \n\nThanks for this comment. It made me feel less alone. Sending you good vibes, I am sorry you are dealing with this too. It is such a frustrating disorder because it seems like 99% of people do not take it seriously. Literally. I feel like that is real love. You will always see people\u2019s true colours in difficult situations like this. Love is not just saying \u201cI love you\u201d. It is respecting and trying to understand that person. I feel like the word love is tossed around a bit too much, way too many people will disappoint you who you thought would not have a problem with that. I told my best friend that and the only thing she said was \u201cwow are not you overreacting?\u201d Cool, thanks. Or friends literally chewing gum next to me whil I am sitting there with one finger in my ear and they do not take the hint? \n\nYou know, the positive thing of this is that we can see people\u2019s true colours almost immediately, hiding behind that mask that they portray to everyone. \n\nThanks a lot! I am so happy that I found this subreddit, I really thought I was going crazy haha. And yeah, unfortunately, 99% will not even get it, and will even mock you for it. It is what it iss, at the end I am glad that I am not like those people", "This pretty sums up my life in a duplex  same with my duplex neighbor constantly playing super high pitched songs on his violin all day every day! I can really relate to this! What do you experience? Mine is footsteps! :/ Let us see here: footsteps, door slamming, cabinet door slamming, chairs/furniture being dragged on the floor, random thuds on the wall, stuff getting dropped on the floor. At least, I do not have to deal with dogs barking at every passerby or muffler-less Subarus this time on top of everything else.", "My mom took it personally I would often wear AirPods and listen to music or a YouTube video while eating to try to drown out the sound of my family members chewing my mother is an especially loud chewer and she sits right next to me. She told me to stop using devices while eating and took my AirPods away from me. That breakfast felt disgusting. Not because of the food itself but because of the sound of everyone else chewing it felt like the sounds were churning in my ears.\nAfter the meal my dad asks why I had my AirPods while eating and I explained it was because I was disgusted by chewing noises. He tried to understand how I felt and explain to my mom, asking if I had ever mentioned a disgust towards chewing before (I did once before). My mom then freaks out telling me that is no excuse to wear AirPods at the table, that she has a crappy boss but she deals with it, that I need to suck it up, that it does not make sense because I chew my food, that I should not have said that I was uncomfortable with chewing noises, that I am abusing my freedom of speech and that the world does not revolve around me (which I obviously know). At this point she is screaming all of this at me so I get overwhelmed and cry. I\u2019be only learnt that this is an actual condition - misophonia, today.\nLater at lunch she loudly and sarcastically tells my dad, \u201cI will eat later so that someone can enjoy their meal.\u201d \nI hate it so much because I did not even specify her chewing as the one disturbing me I just said \u201cchewing noises\u201d. I would probably talk to your dad about how you feel and that it is a disease if i was you, he sounds more understanding He definitely is more understanding, especially considering that my mom has now refused to eat meals with me, thank you Well, maybe you could ask your mom if there is something that bothers her but does not seem to affect anyone else, and try to liken it to your miso. If she can relate to it in some way, then maybe she will feel less attacked (though it still does not really make sense). I hope I can do that soon, my mom is ignoring me right now, and thank you. I do not understand why she personally felt so attacked it makes me feel like I should not talk to her about how I feel. \"that she has a crappy boss but she deals with it, that I need to suck it up\"\n\nMy mom does something similar, always saying how it is no disorder that I am suffering from and that it is just my \"bratty\" behavior (She was DEFINITELY not prepared for a kid who suffer from a disorder) I am tired of people comparing Misophonia to their problems, acting like we all react the same way. It is called a disorder for A REASON! EXACTLY and it is horrible when they do not even want to empathize with how it feels :( Yeah she has some things going on in her life that she feels is way out of her control, I doubt this is all about how she feels about just you. This is just one more stupid thing that she has to deal with, and you are the only one that she can unload all the rest on. She has a lot of shit to deal with. So take that for what is is worth.\n\nBut that being said, she has the ability to respond with help when you ask for help. It is her \"responsibility\" to help, simply because she can. Helping you may help her get some feeling of control in her life.\n\n\"Is there something else going on in your life besides me that is bothering you? I am hoping that the help that I am asking you for is something that you can provide to me. I know it may seem like a lot to ask, but really it is just that we need to find a way for me to handle my response to chewing sounds, any and all chewing sounds. I think from my reaction that you should see that this is a serious problem for me. I need your help.\"\n\nShe will not understand it like anyone else will not, \"just deal with it\" is typical. But if it disables you, you have a disability, and they would not ask someone in a wheelchair to take the stairs, would they?\n\nI have shared this before, I am not sure if it has actually helped anyone, but give it a read.\n\n( My thoughts go out to you my friend.\n\nThat truly sucks.\n\nI believe you did the right thing in talking about it. I tried many times over many, many years to do the same. I am now almost 50 and had my first actual adult, level, even, mockery-free, no-raised-voices conversation about it with my mum a couple of months ago.\n\nReading between the lines, i am going to guess that your mum has got other shit going on in her life right now that is stressing her out. It sounds like your dad is going to be your way forward in getting both of your parents to understand or at least find out a little bit more about miso.\n\nI explain it similarly to dyslexia i.e. it has only been identified and taken seriously as a condition relatively recently (late 1960's/ early 1970's which probably sounds more recent to your parents than to you!) until then people with dyslexia were often ridiculed, called nasty names etc. Now that dyslexia is understood, many allowances are made to accommodate dyslexia sufferers into society - regardless that there is still no known cure.\n\nMisophonia is only recently being medically recognised as a condition; not every country yet. Because it is so 'new' more research is needed. \n\nStudies, lots of studies... serious, medical studies are being carried out to find out more about it. These studies have shown an increased stress response in sufferers compared to 'normies'. There are theories popping out from everywhere to try and explain it. Nobody really has any answers yet.\n\nI work in a hospital in the UK, which is why I have access to the following info. I have copy/pasted the first page from ONE medical publisher (there are hundreds if not thousands of medical publishing houses). I do not know if the links will work but it will normally cost \u00a330 to \u00a390 to get access to each link which gets very expensive, very quickly! I am only showing you this so that maybe if your dad can see it, it may help your parents realise that there may be a little bit more to this than they originally realised.\n\nI will do the titles in a separate comment... too much info for one Reddit comment... Anyway, here is some titles. Hopefully this will help start some conversations so that you may be understood a little bit better:\n\n1. **MEDLINE\u00ae**  \n(  \nPloS one.  \nJager, Inge; de Koning, Pelle; Bost, Tim\u2026 Show all.

I was having another breakdown because I walked in on my brother eating and my mother just referred to my misophonia as \"incestual trauma.\"???? What the fuck??? That does not help the fact that I am disgusted by myself when I get unwanted sexual arousal. I just cant do this shit anymore. Like what the fuck. Yo wtf. Your mom's fucking mental.

I sleep with one every night, I get the pillow support without the side of my head being crushed by the headphones :) Not very helpful for me cause I cannot put pressure on my abdomen for other medical reasons, but okay.  Also for whatever reason anything I put on my head comes off in the middle of the night, presumably due to me tossing and turning.", "I feel bad for only have trigger sounds for my family Hey there. I just wanted to check if this is normal because I feel really bad about it. \n\nSo when I am with my family, literally everything triggers me: crunching, my sister talking, whispering, eating, smacking, breathing... you name it. \n\nBut when I am with my friends, I can hold my anger and anxiety in. It is far less serious basically. \n\nIs this normal? I am the same way. I believe it is normal Pretty normal, I do not know why it happens but it just gives my family more reasons to think it is made up Exactly, they will say something like \u201csee, it is all in your head, you just WANT to believe it\u201d like?? Dude I TOTALLY understand this. I usually do not have a singing trigger, I love music and I usually like listening to people sing, but when my roommate sings it sets me off like crazy. I do not know if it is because of the specific music she sings (it is most commonly songs from musicals) or the fact that she sings with a lot of effort and emphasis, but it drives me up the wall.\n\nSame thing with baby talk. Baby talk does not often bother me but when my mom does it I cannot stand it. I have not said anything to her cuz I know she will spin it as me acting ridiculous and trying to single her out. I feel you. I am currently at my grandmas because every other Sunday we have family dinners and normally I can handle my triggers for about 30 mins but the MINUTE my dad bit into a chip I started crying. It is completely normal. I hate it. It does not help that I never bring it up to my grandparents because I know what they are going to say. They are going to tell me it is fake and I never bring it up because of that. I think it is because we do not have other people's specific \"sounds\" memorized. I can manage through new sounds just fine even if they are similar. It is the ones I hear over and over again that get the PTSD feeling going. I have seen a lot of stuff saying that misophonia gets worse with exposure, not better. So it would make sense that your triggers are worse with family since you are around them all the time. I am the same way Yeah I am basically the same way and I feel like a bad person or like I am making it up sometimes even though I KNOW I am not. It is pretty much the exact same with me, man. Do not sweat it :) That is typical miso and the most insidious aspect of it because it causes family separation.", "Parents with bad hearing Did anyone here grow up around a family member with bad hearing? \nMy mom has terrible hearing and sometimes would not wear her hearing aids, she would not hear the sounds she would make and get really mad if i pointed it out.", "Boyfriend habit triggers my Misophonia - Help please?! TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI have been with my boyfriend for over 3 years and we live together. I have noticed since moving in 2 years ago that he subconsciously has a picking habit. He is constantly picking his fingernails, biting his fingernails (he even bites them OFF and chews on them sometimes), picking his feet/toenails, picking any bits of skin he can find... the list goes on. I am *pretty* sure it is not an anxious thing btw, I think he is just fidgety. It mostly seems to be when we are watching movies but he has been known to do it in bed, whilst sitting at his computer, driving.. everywhere!\n\nAnyway, the picking of nails/skin makes a HORRIBLE \"clicking\" noise that drives me absolutely insane. I try SO hard to be reasonable and calm and I try to ignore it. However, the longer it goes on the more irrationally angry I seem to feel. There have been a couple of occasions I have snapped \"Will you please stop that?!\" at him. He will stop for all of 5 minutes, but then before I know it, he is doing it again... argh! I have told him about Misophonia and he seems to not take it seriously.\n\nI am trying to help him, for both my sanity and the sake of his skin/fingers/toes, but I am not sure what to do. Anyone else get triggered by the sound of nail biting etc. or is it just me? How would you go about dealing with it?\n\n**TL;DR: Boyfriend picks/bites/chews on his nails/feet/skin ALL THE TIME and the noise drives me crazy. How can I cope with this or help him stop?** Oh buddy I have this but with my whole family, I feel you... I will not be MUCH of a help because I usually just scratch myself or punch things, BUT! Try binural therapy. Listen with headphones, anything that has the word \u201ccalming\u201d in it. Or honestly anything else just works too. Maybe avoid the affirmation ones since they resemble ASMR a little (thankfully that does not trigger me and they work the best for me). Also I find that clenching me teeth releases a bit of the anger.\n\nHope this will help!  Thanks for posting, I feel really sorry for you! At least now I know that maybe I should not pick my ears/nose/etc... or chew my fingernails/toenails when I get my first girlfriend. Ew.

Stuck in my home with the 5 worst eaters on this planet. My mom is now, for some STUPID reason, making us all sit at the table. I am not allowed to play music or leave until everyone is done, and I am always the first one done. I am pretty sure no one in my family even believes in misophonia so I cannot tell them about how I feel or else I am afraid I will offend them. How can I deal with my family at dinner without ending up in tears? I feel the pain! I have to wear earbuds during dinner and have music coming from a bluetooth speaker. Maybe play music that your family likes? It is better than nothing. The other thing I do is just nap or say I am doing homework during dinner. Good luck, I know it is hard. I usually \"forget\" to come to the table, so everyone has eaten half their food already. And then I keep saying to my father \"eat with your mouth shut\" until he actually do this. But yeah, I am the \"annoying\" at the table I have a couple of tips that could help maybe excuse yourself to use the bathroom so you can get like a minute of peace or you could ask to get a drink I know this probably is not a lot of help but I wish you the best of luck honestly it sucks in the moment, but i figured out that if i burst out crying in front of \u201cnonbelievers\u201d they start to figure out that it is an actual thing. also sending them articles on it helped.  for the table thing, i say make a big scene so they do not WANT you there. it is really childish but you have to use what works Can you claim you need to get back to your homework or some other thing? Maybe you could find a way to sneak headphones by wearing a hoodie with the hood pulled up? I feel your pain too.

But whenever you are think of taking a shower could you tell me first so I can quickly grab a pair of headphones or go outside so that I will not hear the sound? This will help to control my emotions and become less likely to react negatively. I know its a little meticulous but even just shouting 'hey about to take a shower' as you enter would really help me.\" \nIt might help with the situation. I had a simular talk like this with my own family. Since then they purposefully avoided making my trigger sound around me. You probably cannot. I am not saying you should try, but you should psychologically prepare yourself to be dismissed. You will probably have to leave and create your own quiet space. Send them some articles about misophonia to help them understand that it is real. \n\nAs for the trigger, maybe try white noise? It is similar to the sound of showering and would probably make it difficult to pick out, although that might mean that you will also trigger to white noise.", "baby yoda understands us  I gave up on movie theaters. I used to request the assisted hearing devices and bring my own headphones but the sound quality is so shitty and cuts out. Haha I love this! Honestly, this is mostly a problem with quiet, story -filled movies for me. I can still go see Marvel Super DC action 1000 Kill the Bad Guy part 27 if I want to. Smart dude. Haha this is why I have not been to a movie theater since 2016 I learned this lesson a while ago. If you are to go to the cinema, you go alone and when it is certain that the theater will be almost empty, and your seat previously chosen. Only then you will have a real cinema experience. Fuck social tradition of going with people. I will see my movies in peace. Ohhh I always sit in the back to make sure there is no one behind me, My solution for movie theaters is to go to the late night showings and right before the movie is not going to  show anymore.

I am tired of having to put on my headphones quickly at least 3 times a day every day. I do not want to do this for the rest of my life. I wish I would wake up one day finding out that there was finally a cure for Misophonia, meaning I will not have to deal with this anymore. Sadly it will be awhile until they invent a cure. Every day I always wish that I was deaf, dead, or \"normal\". It is even worse since I have severe Misophonia. One moment I would be happy and the next moment I would be so mad I would be having an emotional breakdown/meltdown. I wish I could enjoy the things that non-misophonics can enjoy without having to worry about getting triggered. I wish I have never ever developed Misophonia. I do not even know how I got it in the first place, though I do know it has gotten worse and worse. At first it was just my brother, now I am triggered by my entire family (especially my mother). I do not know if I will be able to deal with this any longer without going insane.

We were driving in the car and he cleared his throat and for some reason smacked his lips several times after while looking at me in the rear view mirror. It was honestly so enraging but I said nothing. I could not help but make a disgusted face. I feel like such a bad daughter when I get so mad but I cannot help it. I really think he did it on purpose and it hurts so bad because I know they do not understand how much it triggers me. There is just no reason why he would need to do that it was so fucking gross and I cannot stop thinking about it. It replays in my head for like an hour after I see shit like that. I feel like such an ungrateful bitch for looking at him with disgust after those things but I cannot help it. Nah, fuck that. Sounds like your fathers a poor excuse of a father. He does not need to understand misophonia to respect it/you. I am sorry you are going through this. Please try to find coping mechanisms that work for you, and if/when you do, dont tell him about them. \n\nPetty me also wants you to find out what irks him and do it, but this is just a bad idea, especially as men tend to be emotional and have a low level of anger control. Hold on a sec; We do not know what this person's life is like. While there is certainly a possibility he was being an ass, Miso does mess with peoples' emotions a little and can make them feel targeted. While I absolutely will not try to invalidate how OP feels, we should consider that *maybe* he did not do it on purpose, though not entirely dismiss that thought.\n\nSecond, Op, you are not a bitch or a bad daughter for feeling this way. It is not your fault how your brain is wired. As long as you acknowledge how you feel and take what you do into consideration rather than acting purely on emotion, you are doing a pretty good job (and it is ok if you do not sometimes, we are all human).\n\nFinally, I am a stranger on the internet, so you should take what I say with a grain of salt. I could be wrong, and for all you guys know I could be lying. So neither I nor u/Spiritualtraveller77 is necessarily right. Just remember that we are here, we understand, and while we do not know you, we still care. I topsy turvy it on these MFers that make sounds on purpose.

The last sentence hits hard.", "Do you have any of these along with your misophonia? \n\n(", "I feel like I cannot breathe. Please bear with my venting here; I do not know who to talk to, and I have exhausted/angered my family enough. \n\nI cannot stand shared living noises, like the ones that come with apartments, condos, and townhomes. I used to live in a private home with my parents, and they live in the quietest neighborhood I have ever encountered, which might contribute to my sensitivity to sound. Since moving out for college, I have lived in dorms and apartments. My dorm was generally okay, minus my one neighbor screaming in the middle of the night a few nights a week when playing video games.\n\nThen once I moved into apartments, it just went downhill. I had this very bizarre neighbor in my first apartment that paced back and forth next to our shared wall, causing everything on my side to rumble. On the other side, I had a neighbor who had very enthusiastic sex and left her garbage out in the hall to rot.\n\nMy next apartment was close to the Greek houses near campus, so bad overall. Loud music, heavy-footed upstairs neighbor before I moved to the top floor, crazy parties, etc. I started feeling intense anxiety every time I heard anything in that apartment complex, and management would not help at all.\n\nNow I am in a condo (not exactly by choice), and I do admit it is much better. It is an older community, so there is a lot of retired people and working professionals. The one neighbor I have met is very sweet, and told me that she never hears anyone. That put my mind at ease, but I am still boxed in on three sides, so I have three common walls. \n\nThe noise is significantly reduced from my apartments, absolutely. My AC is loud and makes white noise when it is idle so I love it. BUT, any incidental boom? Someone shuts their cabinets too hard, someone lets their front door slam, etc? My heart races. I get so hot, I lose track of whatever I was in the middle of, and I cannot think anymore. I live with two cats who are also easy to startle who love to be within my line of sight, so if they heard something and jump, but I did not? I start looking for the source of noise as I start to panic and my heart races again. As I am typing this, one of my cats flinched like she heard something and now I am back to my panic.\n\nI do not know how to relax. I do not really have the option to go see a doctor about getting any medicine prescribed (I am on my parents' insurance). I recognize that this new place is pretty great in terms of noise-proofing, but I am still so frequently triggered. It is not unreasonable noise like I was living with before, but my past has basically ruined my present. Does anyone have any suggestions? Breathing or mindfulness exercises? Loud fans that I can keep on? (Moving is not an option, for a while) Meditation may help :)\n\nSorry you are going through that\n\nDeep breath I am basically in the same situation. A loud fan definitely helps, and I also like to have either music or a TV show on in the background if the neighbors are being extra noisy. I find that bass and voices help mask thuds a bit better than constant white noise. And if you just want silence to focus on something, foam earplugs are excellent at dampening vibrations. White noise plus earplugs plus frieq earmuffs. Earplugs cut down high freq sound, the muffs cut down low freq sound. The white noise drowns out what might get through. What would be cool is a small implantable device that could stop ear nerve impulses to create total deafness on command. Run a white noise app through a good Bluetooth speaker. Rain sounds, or pink noise, is particularly good. I would upvote you, but gum is anathema to misophones. That would be seriously cool. Thank you for the recommendations!! Do you have any fan recommendations? I keep my TV on all the time for background noise too! I end up muting the TV and stopping the AC whenever I hear something to investigate the noise, but I need to learn how to stop doing that I really do not understand why you cannot see a doctor... Why does being on your parents insurance mean you cannot see a doctor? \n\nCBT and medicating my anxiety and ADHD has reduced my misophonia significantly. Your issue does not even sound like traditional misophonia, it sounds like you are triggering anxiety and panic attacks with starting /sudden noises. That is not the actual noise that is causing fight or flight (like someone chewing)- this is you being excessively jumpy and startling very easy. I would definitely think addressing your anxiety would be significantly helpful in reducing that, almost learned, response. \n\nIf your parents literally will not let you see a doctor... Why are you on their insurance at all? \n\nWhen I was 14, despite being on my family's insurance, I called and made an appointment, walked my ass to the office, and had an appointment to get on birth control. I was both sick of dealing with horrific cramps, and had a boyfriend, so I wanted to be prepared. My parents may have gotten notification that I went - but I paid the copay and the doctors office is not allowed to tell them what you were there for or give them any information. \n\nTell them you have an ear infection or a sore throat if they do not believe in mental health care. You do not need them or their permission to see a doctor. \n\nIf this is not going to work- go to your on-campus medical clinic, tell them you need to see someone to address some mental health issues and they should have resources to direct you to someone. Unfortunately if you want any kind of standing prescription, especially for a medication that might be a controlled substance (as many for anxiety are)- you cannot get that from a walk-in / urgent care, you need to actually establish a relationship with your physician and have regular (some are monthly, some are every 90 days, etc). \n\nYou may also want to get your vitamin D checked. Most people are low, but anxiety conditions tend to be exacerbated when vitamin D is very low, so it could not help. Vitamin D is not going to solve anxiety but it may help you feel better over all, to sleep better and the more you take care of yourself, the less anxiety tends to creep into your conscious. \n\nMy brother was having panic attacks for the last year, getting worse and worse- as it turns out, his high blood pressure was doing damage to his heart. He only stopped ignoring his health problems because of the intense anxiety. He was finally seeing doctors- and then had a sudden heart attack and died without warning one morning- I have known multiple people who have had anxiety, and it is gotten significantly worse when they also had coexisting health problems- low thyroid, low vit D, high blood pressure, diabetes that was yet to be diagnosed, anemia, etc- once addressed, they all seemed to see their anxiety decrease substantially- so it is worth an over-all health check to see if your body is trying to tell you something. \n\nBest of luck. Living in a communal space sucks for many reasons. Sorry, I do not know why I did not see your reply until now. Honestly the only fans I have had are either super cheap no-name ones and an overpriced Dyson that I expensed from my company. If you are also looking for a purifier and heater in one then the Dyson Hot + Cool might be worth it? If you just want it for the noise then it definitely is not haha\n\nBtw, I got a portable AC unit a few days ago and it is definitely the way to go if it is super hot and you want white noise. I have to keep the window open for the exhaust and it even covers construction noise almost completely!", "I am scared there will eventually be a day I snap. I am not even an adult. Allow me to explain. I got my miso maybe 2 years ago. Now, I am nearly 13. And let me tell you, I swear it is not teenage hormones or something... my mind thinks something, I want to say it. It is all good. But my mouth says another thing, probably ruder than what I was thinking. It is like my brain and body are not connected! I think it is because... my parents and brother do not believe I have miso, they do not care, and they are super duper loud. So it makes me basically always... different, since I got it. Everything. I can hear... everything. That car over there, the faint sound of a lawnmower, my mum literally shuffling her feet as she walks and tells my brother something, my brother complaining, shifting in his chair, my dad typing in the living room, WHILE EATING, and children playing outside... I can hear it all at once, from the comfort of my room. Not so nice... and i just always feel like I am on sensory overload. Like... like I can never, ever let my guard down. Never smile, never listen. It sounds overdramatized, but this is how I am feeling. And I cannot do anything about it. It is so distant. My brain is in one place, it is mainly in the future or the past. Unfortunately, my body is in the present, listening to fucking everything, loud and clear. Will I snap one day? Will I just stop? Please... I just need... some sympathy, perhaps? I do not even know what I want anymore. I cannot quite concentrate. So much noise. It took me almost half an hour to write a short post. Hey, I know how you feel! When I started to notice my miso (like age 10 or 11) my family made fun of me and would purposely trigger me. It lead to a lot of mental issues over the years, but what I found that really helped was showing my family that there is a whole community and I showed them it is real. It is really tough because it feels like we are separated from the people we love and sometimes we say the wrong things to them but nothing bad is going to come out of communication. Tell them how it is and how hard it is for you and hopefully they will make accommodations for you. My mom helped me by validating me and I used to spend all my time in my room but she bought me noise cancelling earbuds and big ear mufflers so I can sit with the family too. Show them it hurts, trust me I know it hurts. It is been 6 years of this for me but you find a way through it. You may have a big outburst, I still get those a lot from pent up energy that I didnt express at the time, but I promise you as the years go on more and more people start to understand what you are going through and will try to make the world a better place for you. Remember that they just do not understand so educate them and also it is very important to vent and let it all out sometimes. Some tips that have helped me are music in ears at most times, ear mufflers over music, explaining to the ones I live with the toll it takes on me, and venting. Feel free to contact me if you ever feel you are going to snap. It is tough but it is going to be okay. I also understand, though mine started a little later. Oh man. Seriously, I was not expecting such a kind response... I really appreciate your thoughts. And you know, I will take your advice, by showing them. Really though. Thank you, so, so much! It is nice to have someone to understand. Hey man, it sounds like you are having a really rough time. It sucks having family members that do not understand or even want to understand. You sound like you got a pretty bad case of it unfortunately, but do not let that scare you about what the future holds. You can begin to manage it. I would recommend getting noise cancelling earphones/headphones as soon as you can. Whether that means asking for them for your birthday or asking your parents if you can help around the house for money, you just need to find a way to get them. It would also be in your best interest to go to your parents start it off by letting them know it is going to be a serious conversation (i.e. \u201ci really need to talk to you guys, can we go to yalls room?\u201d Or something like that) and then ask them to either listen to a professional talk about miso or read papers from respectable universities/research facilities about what miso is. I am sorry you have to fight this condition but I urge you to give it your all sooner rather than later so you can begin to live life. Good luck bud, let me know if you need anything. I am glad to help! :) Thank you! I do not even know where to begin on how much I appreciate this sub, much less this comment... it is really helpful. Just, thank you is all I have to say :) Hey! In a way, I relate to what you are saying. It sounds like you have quite a few trigger sounds, which I cannot even imagine what that must be like for you. I only have one real trigger, which are mouth sounds that my dad makes, and one in particular drives me up a freaking wall. I am the type of person who does not like to start conflict, so I have never even told my dad about my misophonia and how badly it affects me. I just break down and cry sometimes. My biggest problem though is that my brain seems like it wants to constantly replay that sound in my mind, despite how much it drives me to insanity. But you cannot escape your own mind! So in that sense, I know exactly what you are talking about when you say you cannot ever escape the sound. I feel the same way as you, where it feels like I will eventually just snap but do not know what to do about it. I suppose the only advice I can give is to just put some headphones in whenever you can and try your hardest to get those sounds out of your mind. Misophonia sucks, there is no two ways about it. Whenever you need to vent about something, just come on over to this sub - there is plenty of people here to offer encouragement and advice. Happy trails! :) Aww thanks :) Happy cake day!", "Wish I could change this about me. I have not been medically diagnosed I honestly did not even know I could see a doctor for this.  There has been times when I want to scream. At work I have what I call \u201csnackers\u201d co workers who love to snack...which is fine with me but although I am fine with the snacking I am not okay with the noises these snacks cause. It is like I zone in on particular sounds. My job requires constant communication and although I do have down time where I could pop in headphones and blast music there is times where I cannot quite do that. It is the crunching, the chewing, the sucking sound. One particular co worker makes weird sucking sounds when she eats candy. I  Need advice on what I could do, this is a constant thing. Eating all day making sounds all day. One of them pops gum loudly part me feels like that is so rude but then the other part of me feels like well what if I am the only being bothered by it. You need to ask them to help. Even if you are the only one bothered by it, their behavior is rude, and they need to be made aware of it. Plan on them thinking that you are crazy and they will pop more. But also plan on them being understanding and helpful. You never know. This might help.\n\n ( I am afraid of them thinking I am crazy or offending them. I do not want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings but maybe you are right I should just bring it up. They might think I am crazy but maybe they also become aware. Thank you for replying! You will find that it takes a lot of nerve to simply ask someone for simple help.\n\nYou will find the true nature of those who you ask, you will find that people are generally assholes. They will be offended, they will be 'hurt', they will laugh at you, mock you, chew louder because it is so funny. So you have to prepare for that, you have to be ready to not let that bother you, that is THEIR problem created by them, not by you. It will take practice to ask and to deal with it. You will find that you have to decide which is worse, dealing with the noise, or dealing with an asshole. Quite often you will deal with the noise.\n\nBut you cannot let that get in the way. There are people who will genuinely want to help. And you will only get that help if you ask for help. So you are stuck with the burden in your life of asking for help. If you have the courage to deal with the noise, then you have the courage to ask for help. You have more courage than them.\n\nYou are the dog, they are the rat. The dog is not afraid of the rat. The dog EATS the rat.\n\nGo eat your rat. This is awesome I am  this and keeping it forever.... this message alone has had so much impact thank you! You are welcome! My coworker chews like a rabbit or something, just so freaking fast, I am like are you even tasting your food right now or just trying to get it into your stomach as quickly as possible? But then again it takes her like 30 mins to eat something. She has a morning snack, lunch, and afternoon snack, and all make noise. She eats her lunch at her desk probably 80-90% of days. How can you continue to sit in the same spot for the one hour you get a break when you are forced to be there for the other 8 hours of your day? I really do not understand some people. Anyway, I would take her chewing any day over my other coworker's ear-shattering cough.", "Does Misophonia have a scale? I have never been \u201cdiagnosed\u201d with misophonia, but I definitely have the symptoms. For me, it is definitely the smacking, gulping, crunching, slurping, among others. What is interesting to me is that they do not always effect me the same way. I have anxiety, and I have definitely noticed a difference in my misophonia symptoms when my anxiety is high - I am basically way more sensitive to sounds. Putting that aside, sometimes I just do not notice, for reasons I cannot say... one person\u2019s chewing does not bother me but another does. Or crunching wont bother me one day as much as slurping...it can vary. \n\nSo I am curious, has anyone else experienced some type of \u201csliding scale\u201d or spectrum for misophonia? Is there such thing?  \n\nAlso, can anyone pinpoint the moment or time that changed them, or triggered them misophonia in them? I remember that when I was in middle school or high school my mom would sit behind me while I watched tv, eating her popcorn. After a few times of that, I just snapped - like it was the catalyst for my misophonia...at first it was just her but now that I am an adult, it could be anyone or anything. There *has* to be because earlier someone posted that they started punching a woman who was slurping from her McDonald\u2019s cup and that is a no no.\n\nSo if 1 is being able to, without flinching, have a conversation with someone who is cracking their gum in your face, and 10 is beating the shit out of McDonald\u2019s cup lady on the bus then I am about a 6.8 Oh shit, really? Damn, I am glad it is not that bad for me. \n\nI think that is a good scale - I would say I range from a 3-4 with low anxiety, and about a 5-6 with high anxiety. This fits more alongside my experiences. On the misophonia site there is a self-test with a scale of severity from 1 to 10. I am at an 8. From everything I have personally gathered from the community here on Reddit and elsewhere on the internet, people almost universally report that their Misophonia is worse when they are more anxious or irritable. \n\nI certainly do not think you are alone with how you are feeling. \n\nI think that it has a lot to do with what you are focusing on as well. If you pay close attention to one of your triggers, it is going to bother you more. Source?  I am the same way. You would *think* that one person might bother you less than another because you simply like them better, but in my experience that is not necessarily true. While my wife\u2019s sounds have thankfully never bothered me in the slightest, my mother used to drive me absolutely insane growing up, and I love her dearly. One of my coworkers enjoys crunchy food and I can completely tune it out, meanwhile another one makes me so upset I have come close to considering a new job because of it. I wish we had more research and insight into these things! It is such a relief to hear I am not the only one! It is interesting, and I also wish there was more research. Hopefully more people get into it in the near future  ", "I must look like I am insane lol Wondering what other people see when you react to a sound. You are curled up, smashing your ears shut, tapping/making a different sound, rocking back and forth, digging fingernails into your skin, anything to distract yourself, breathing heavily and trying not to become violent, closing your eyes and trying so hard to make the sound go away (even if it already has). \n\nOr even just suddenly leaving the room, teary eyed and fists clenched. Blocking out the world because all you can hear is that sound.\n\nThey laugh, look at you funny? Make you feel worse? My reaction is to get up suddenly and leave even if it is not appropriate to do so. It is a fight or flight response, so I always prefer to take flight. If I feel the need to give an excuse for my sudden departures, I blame it on irritable bowel disorder, which I actually do have as well as a few other anxiety-related physical ailments. Lol yeah took me a while to figure out better ways to cope/react, but it is always just as painful, and people are always confused. And idk much about the fight or flight thing, but I guess I always go straight to anger and wanting to lash out, so all that effort is going towards keeping myself from doing that. Sometimes it takes me a few minutes to even be able to get up and walk away lol I freeze. I do not know what to do, because if someone knows and intentionally does it, it feels like encountering a sadist. They know no one will believe you because the way you experience pain goes unseen. So yes, it feels like navigating having been taken hostage.\n\nI have CPTSD because of this. From years of having to worry about covering my ears at loud sounds, as people see that as unreasonable. I have had my sound sensitivity used as a reason to overprotect me to where I became terrified of showing any reaction, as that was a reason I needed to be protected.\n\nThere are times I feel alien in comparison to others. If my pain cannot be seen it is not real. I seek help, I am put in mental health support groups with people who cannot help making loud sounds. \n\nBecause someone decided it was better to make those with mental illnesses convenient, instead of doing something intelligent like diagnosing them based on their sensitivities. Not putting people who out of nowhere yell, on the same spectrum as people with sound sensitivity. And when I speak of this I risk being emotionally abused as not being caring towards those who cannot help being loud.\n\nI have been shamed for being unable to tolerate mentally ill people who cannot help making loud sounds. I cannot help experiencing pain when around them. Why is it acceptable to shame me for that which I cannot help?\n\nI am trying my best to become independent. To make myself understand I will not be forced back into a world where I must possess complete self control to not be attacked. That is why I freeze. I have lived a life where people see my distress and have done things to me instead of help me. ^ this.", "Stickers!

And we are listening to music and my brother like to him along with the music, he is not a bad singer but it just like do you fucking have to?! Not to mention has the most ear peircings \"s\" and it sounds like he is whistling and I just.... I do not want to hurt their feeling and I feel like an asshole because I just want to ask them to stop but I know they will get defensive. On top of that my dad drink so fucking loud like it sounds like those cartoon gulping sounds when someone is nervous but Everytime he takes a drink of something. After he eats he burps for like almost acouple minutes afterwards and like just can you fucking not I am going to fucking lose my god damn mind That is not only triggering, that is just straightout rude to  eat with open mouths and burp. I am sorry you need to pass through that. He eats with his mouth closed.. it is like tiny little burps but still Yeah... I also do not understand how people think \u201caH iT wAS nOt lOuD sO iT wOnT bOthER\u201d. At the smallest trigger noise i get anxious and irritated. Neither do I honestly. I feel the same Also pretty much everyone in my family chews like that so its not like I can escape it You should talk with them about it, even being allowed to eat somewhere else or eating later helps I usually eat at the table because we watch stuff while we eat and they sit on the couches. Also I feel like I say anything about it they are response would be like \"It is not that big of a deal I do not know why you are getting angry at it\" that is my brothers response is to a lot of those things I suggest you to throw facts, an article, or anything that shows what misophonia is, so they can see what it really is. Maybe it is just how I was raised but I feel like if I bring it up everyone is going to be like \"What the crap?!\" *Can you please stop doing that?\n\nCan you NOT?\n\nI can hear that. \n\nWe all can hear that. \n\nDo you do that at work?\n\nPlease do not make those sounds. \n\nCan you please so that somewhere else?\n\nCan you please do that without making those sounds?\n*\n\nI encourage you to just keep trying new scripts, new ways to ask. Keep adjusting it to what works or not depending on the situation. Be prepared for a lot of asshole abuse. Be thankful for help you do get. But keep trying, keep asking, you are worth it. For me, it is usually the less loud noises that trigger idk I feel the same about people that burp/eat on voice chat. Like... WTF. It is not okay to eat loudly and burp outside of a voice chat, why would it be okay DURING IT?\n\nEven better when someone just says \"It is appreciated in some cultures to make noise while eating, you know?\"\n\nYeah. And I do not freaking care. I would like to keep my sanity, period. i read a post on AITA a long while back about a guy who was in a chinese restaurant (not in china or any asian country i do not think) slurping and smacking to indicate that he enjoyed the meal. he was asked to stop by a family but said he should not have to and they should not have been there if they did not like the noise. I understand that if it is someone is culture and all, they would not want to let people tell them what to do. But people do not get that even if it is okay to make noise while eating where they live, in a lot of countries it is seen as disrespectful.", "Am I going nuts! I am not sure if this may be what I am dealing with? but it seems to be the only thing that came up when I googled.\n\nI get in moods. Not all the time, occasionally sounds just annoy the crap out of me. Mainly when there is more than one sound at the same time. \n\nExample- whilst cooking dinner. The exhaust fan above the oven was on at full speed, my partner had music going on in the background and my daughter had a \u2018bop it\u2019 toy she was playing with, plus my partner was trying to talk to me over all of this and I just felt like my brain was going to explode. I roughly turn the fan off which the partner put it back on and said that whilst your cooking etc etc . So I went and pulled the plug out of the powerpoint for the music because I just could not handle it. I did not even feel I had the patience to just press stop or pause on it. Just the quicker it was gone the better.\n\nAnother example- in the car, partner has his window down, daughter behind me has window down. The radio is playing some rough sounding song. Daughter is singing her own little song and my head is building up, teeth clenching and I am trying to just focus on one thing, my daughters calm lullaby song because I am about to lose it. It does not help and I end up turning the music off and telling them to put the windows up. Because my head is starting to throb. \n\nIt seems to happen more around the time of my period, if that means anything. But I feel like I am losing my mind.  I could go weeks where I do not seem to notice the sounds but then it will regularly happen for a few days and my family will think I have lost it. \n\nAm I ok?  Is this something I can see a doctor for? Maybe I need to try to meditate? Sensory overload or hyperacusis if everything sounds too loud It sounds like you are getting overstimulated. I get this way too. My husband will watch one show on the tv, one on his phone, and my son will have one on the laptop, it makes me feel crazy. Turn things off. Get everyone headphones. It is too much for you because it is too much period. My family has been trying to stop the extra noise lately too. It most likely bothers your child too, but they do not show their irritation in the same ways. Hey, I get the exact same thing too. And it is especially more around the time of my period. Several sounds at the same time, and I am sure I am losing my mind. For example, two family members talking to each other loudly, while the tv is on, as well as the music is running. Totally feel like my brain will explode. And honestly, some days I will not even notice stuff like that while some days I will be totally losing my mind. \nI am sorry I am not of much help with regards to your question, I just felt kind of relieved that I am not the only one going through this. \nPlease take care, I hope it gets better soon. Hugs!! ", "I have been struggling hard this week with miso and went on to /r/misophonia for help and ended up getting banned I have been a member of that community for over 4 years. I posted some things a LONG time ago that were probably silly and some thoughts about different things (like movie theaters, etc..)\n\nI was a casual reader most of those years, mainly on mobile. I had NO idea how restrictive it became, since none of my old posts were ever removed.\n\nI posted something today, a rant but ultimately a question because I needed everyone is advice. It got removed, I asked why (nicely), got some vague explanation followed by \"you broke the rules,\" and that was it. I posted again to get someone is attention to try and figure out what the heck was going on, and they basically said I cannot follow rules and cannot read.\n\nSo now, somewhere I thought was safe, is not at all and I am banned because I chose to question the moderators. \n\nMy question in my previous post was basically \"I cannot stand my living situation with my downstairs neighbor and I have the option to move to somewhere more quiet, but it is much more expensive. Is it worth it?\" Not sure why that happened, its a shame, but looking at their rules, none of them seem to apply to your question. Plus i have seen loads of those being broken daily on that subreddit anyway!\n\nI have found generally this subreddit is more positive and helpful compared to just r/misophonia !! Although many people likely feel the same way you do, r/misophoniasupport stands as a resource for support, venting, and discussion. It is not, and never will be, the place to complain about r/misophonia. \n\nI am sorry, but we will not allow this \"get out your pitchforks and torches\" type of post. It is not really what this sub is meant for. That is fine, I just wanted to vent about what happened because I thought that sub was originally meant for support. Being treated the way I was was unacceptable on all accounts and I thought this sub could be a place to vent my frustrations on top of what I am experiencing in my personal life because of miso.\n\nI will not apologize for what I posted, and I do not care if you take it down, I just needed to vent about it. You can vent about anything Misophonia related on r/misophoniasupport. But venting about moderators on another sub is not really about Misophonia. We do not specifically have a rule about off-topic posts because it is implied. The sub is mainly for talking about Misophonia, life with Misophonia, venting about having Misophonia, etc. We do not do vents about anything else. That is what something like r/rant is for; it is for general venting about anything.  \n\nI am not asking you to apologize for anything. I am only asking that you use r/misophoniasupport as a support outlet for Misophonia only. If you want to vent or get help about living with Misophonia, this is the place. \n\nI hope that makes sense, and I hope this did not piss you off more. Maybe take some time to look through old posts on r/misophoniasupport \\- you will see that the posts are directly about living with Misophonia.\n\nIf you have any more comments/questions, feel free to let me know. First, I would just like to say THANK you for explaining your reasoning to me. That was all I was asking for from the mods over at /r/misophonia. I understand your point, and I will keep that in mind the next time I post. I will listen if I am given something to listen to.\n\nI have no problem following the guidelines posted here, as the community is very important to me and my goal was definitely not to be a problem. \n\nYou are right in that the other posts are directly about living with misophonia, however I saw one post about /u/sillyrob (i think) and the state of /r/misophonia. I guess I thought it would be OK to post what I posted. \n\nI appreciate you attempting to have civil discourse with me instead of treating me like a bug that needs to be squashed. That is it.", "My dad will not shut the hell up My worst trigger is not eating or chewing, it is when people's articulation (how they say their D's, T's, S's, Sh's, Ch's, J's, etc) come out loud or coarse or, good god, in a whistle. Believe it or not, it is more common in people than you might think. \n\nAnyway, my dad is definitely one of my worst triggers when it comes to this. He always speaks really loudly like he just needs to assert his dominance in the room or some shit, but holy crap, he really brings out his consonants too. They are loud, they whistle, and it makes me want to scream in his face. But that is not all. My dad is the kind of person who will talk at someone for hours. Like seriously. When I was little, all I had to do was mention something I noticed or ask a small question out of curiosity, and next thing I knew he would be lecturing me for god knows how long over his point of view on the matter. That is why I can barely even talk to him nowadays. When I think of something I want to say around him, or something funny I noticed about something, I just have to force myself not to say it, because if I do, he will elaborate on whatever I said for the next 30 minutes. And I cant deal with that now. When I was little, I did not have misophonia. But now I do. \n\nOne thing I will say is that he does know about my misophonia and he does try to be supportive of it most of the time. I feel bad for not mentioning that yet, because I think it is something that most people dont have. I am so incredibly thankful for it. But still, it does not mean I can just change the way he talks. He has even tried to do that by talking quieter, but that just brings out his consonance sounds even more. So now whenever I am around him I just have to wear headphones with white noise blaring into my ears. This is why I usually stay in my room all day. It is safe. But it is also getting real cramped, especially with this self isolation stuff going on. \n\nTo top it all off, right now, hes in the living room, probably 15 feet away from my door, talking at my grandma with his loud ass voice about whatever. Hes been doing it ever since I woke up about an hour ago. Its 9:24am. I just want to have a nice, peaceful start to the morning without hearing him or having to wrap headphones around my head while I lay on my pillow. Yesterday I was having a meltdown in the morning so I didnt have any motivation to tackle my schoolwork, which I now need to make up for today. At the very least, I want to be motivated to do it. But no. I am getting angrier every minute. I cant just ask him to stop, because he will tell me to put my headphones on. Is it really worth me stopping his conversation so I can sleep easily? Is that realistic? I do not know. I am pissed off right now. I just hope he shuts up soon. Switch to loud upbeat music. My dad is the same way with his long soliloquies, except he is a legit narcissist and thinks misophonia is a mental illness (that is personally directed at him and he is the real victim.) As a result, I almost never complain to him.\n\nAll I can say is the loud upbeat music drowns out voices. Go for walks for anything to get out of the house. I also have expensive Bose noise cancelling headphones-- they are a life saver if you can splurge.\n\nEdit: and no, from his point of view, talking at (his idea of) a normal volume at 9:30am is reasonable. It is reasonable to be awake by 9:30am. If it were 6:30am, that would be a different story. I am sorry you have to deal with this. Be strong and hang in there! Eventually you will be able to move out and it will be all worth it!!", "Watching a movie Hi, I have been subscribed to r/misophonia for a long time and did not know this support group existed but I found you tonight and I am hoping I can vent to people who understand.  I do not get bothered as much as I used to (in my 40's now) and I notice that if I consume a lot of sugar, especially in the evening, I am more sensitive.  I am undiagnosed, but I have been experiencing symptoms for decades.  My poor sister thought I hated her when we were kids because I would run screaming into my bedroom at dinner time because she was \"eating too loud\".  My parents just called me a selfish brat. Hence, no diagnosis as a youth.  Now, the healthcare I have is not exactly setup for disorders so much as injury or acute illnesses.  I digress.  \n\nHere is my vent:  Tonight I was watching a movie after eating a couple pieces of a cookie pizza thing and got triggered pretty hard.  I hate that word but it is the best one.  Anyway, it is the movie \"On the Basis of Sex\" at about 45-50 min in and it involves eating during an important part of the dialogue.  Usually I keep captions on and just hit mute when I am starting to get annoyed but I am using an app I do not use often and unsure how to turn on CC so I just stopped the movie because I wanted to throw my remote at the guy on the screen. That is all.  Thanks. I am glad you found this little subreddit, it is definitely a good place to feel less alone.\n\nI hate that TV shows and movies always emphasize chewing noises. It is disgusting. And even when they do not emphasize them it is still horrific. I wish I could help you but since I cannot, I just want to let you know you are not alone. Thank you, it means a lot.  Thankfully, it was more of an annoyance than anything since now as an adult I can just make it stop.  It helps that I live alone too, so no one is going to be mad that I turned off a great movie halfway through and never turned it back on again. Haha :) That is so great, I am still quite young and live with my family and I love them but there are lots of triggers around so that gives me a bit of hope. :)", "I just exploded in rage at my neighbors over their music, and now I am scared they will retaliate They were playing loud music for hours, and muffled bass through a wall is one of my biggest triggers. There was not a room in my house I could go to escape, and I could feel the bass reverberating in my body and house even with earplugs in. I finally exploded and banged a broom against the ceiling while screaming as loud as I could to \u201cturn the fucking music down.\u201d \n\nIt worked because they immediately turned it off, but now I am terrified of leaving my apartment for fear of running into them. I have complained about these people so many times, and the leasing office keeps talking to them about keeping noise down, but they never stay quiet for long. My lease is not up for another 9 months and I do not know what to do anymore, but I cannot stop crying and thinking about killing myself.

At the very least you shocked them. \n\n\n\nI dunno, OP the shame after a meltdown is a heavy thing to bear, but they are doing something that non-misophones also dislike. It is not one of our triggers that people just cannot understand.  \n\n\n\nPlease feel better! If anything you could say to them that you have a mental disorder and you get violent outbursts from loud noises, it might scare them quiet haha. yeah, cookies make up for it. You should forgive yourself. Everyone makes mistakes when they are angry, and it was not even your fault. If it happens again, I know there is quarantine, but maybe you can find a small park corner or something where it is quiet and you can just feel at peace with yourself. Do not let yourself feel too bad. It sounds like they have had it coming for awhile. If they are really that loud and inconsiderate, it could have been anyone that could have lost their cool at them. But it happened to be you, and now hopefully they can be more considerate. \n\nMost people call the cops on their neighbors for being loud. I say that a broomstick and yelling is a better alternative. \n\nThey are adults. They will likely understand your frustration and I doubt they will retaliate. If anything they are probably embarrassed to see you. \n\nI once had a similar experience. Downstairs neighbors playing loud trap music late at night on like a fucking Tuesday. I knocked on the door and asked them to turn it down (I had work at 6 that morning) and they were drunk and told me I was being an asshole. So I told them they were being inconsiderate cunts and went back into my apartment. They turned the music off. The man living there would later mad dog me whenever our paths crossed but fuck it. I was not in the wrong, he was. \n\nAnd you are not in the wrong here either. This seems to be downvoted whenever I suggest it, but I cannot stop it. Seriously consider moving rural. If you live in or around any city in the US, there is absolutely a small town within 20 or 30 minute drive that you can relocate to. You will find much more peace in a small town, plus for the same rent you are paying now for an apt, you can likely get an entire house or cabin on it is own property. I know this first hand. I rented a house in the outskirts of San Antonio years ago for the exact same rent I ended up paying for a cabin on an acre outside of the city. \n\nSure, your commute to work will be longer, but it is worth every penny to me. This is my plan! I am done with the city and living packed next to strangers who do not give a shit about others when it comes to the noise they make. I guess people might downvote because not everyone can just pack up and move to a rural area, especially if they have work or family commitments. \n\nI just have to figure out where to move. I am visibly queer and a POC so I need to live somewhere I will not have to worry about lack of acceptance or potential harassment. Maybe a rural area not too far from a city or a little hippy town, haha. I do not buy the family or work argument for not moving outside of the city. A 20-30 minute drive to work or family is not going to change much of anything.

She tends to chew wildly (like to where she opens her mouth while chewing). I cannot hear it from a distance but even seeing it can be painful.\n\nI have self-soothing techniques that I practice but I guess I was looking for some empathy. I come from a generally apathetic/misunderstanding family so I do not really get a lot of support.\n\nKind regards I feel this to my core! Gum chewing is one of those things that I do not even have to hear it, seeing it triggers me as much or more than hearing it. I just cannot. \n\nThis is one of the few things that I have no coping mechanisms for other than leaving the area. Your workplace needs masks. One wonderful side effect of the pandemic is not having to see what is being wildly chewed. Maybe talk to your boss? Misokinesia is often coupled with misophonia.\n\nI am all too familiar with your pain. I have an obese coworker with a lisp that has to have something in her mouth at all times. She always open mouth chews gum in meetings.

I have told him I have misophonia, but he is too much of a dickhead to care. My mom does not even care, she just takes his side. The moment I move out and become financially stable, I am cutting them out of my life.", "First post - Trying to escape misophonia.. When I get triggered I often find myself coping by putting myself into a daydream. Even if i already have earbuds in. I think i developed this habit in middle school, since earbuds were not allowed, I tried to find other ways to cope. \nRunning to my dream world does not work that well though. It may have kept my sanity in check but I still wanted to get the heck outta there. \n\nI dunno why im posting this,\nI suppose I just wanted to share. Ask for tips maybe? Like how do you guys cope?

I have similar issues, and the way I deal with it is by running a white noise machine constantly, and using noise canceling headphones while listening to white noise. Both of these combined help me deal with the trigger noises. Cannot wait to get out of s***h*** of a neighborhood. seconded! i do these both as well and they keep me sane as someone who just finished their senior year of high school: i feel you. \n\nsummers are the hardest but heres some things that might help in the meantime:\n\nget foam earplugs!!!!! i CANNOT recommend these enough. they are what gets me through life, i cannot function without them\n\ntry white noise! get a machine or an air purifier or anything that makes gentle background noise. it doesnt have to necessarily cover the trigger noises, just be enough to distract from them\n\ngo for walks/drives: idk if you drive yet, but getting my license has been wonderful for me as being in the car alone gives me a way to totally control my environment and to be out of my room without worrying about triggers. if you dont drive, try going for walks with gentle background music to help you get away from your neighbors and family\n\ntry a summer job: again, idk if youre old enough to get a job but bc of the labor shortage, just about anywhere is hiring. a job could replace school in terms of being a safe space away from triggers at home, and you can make money while youre at it\n\ni hope this helps! also, you seem like you have a great support system with your parents as they are looking for a home that can accommodate you. try brainstorming some ideas with them that can fit your family specifically looking at the bright side, you are one of the few that has parents that respect you! i am pretty sure you will find a good house soon", "Does anyone else find it extremely irritating hearing people cough? It seems like everywhere I go people are coughing and I am not sure why but it drives me nuts. A big part of this is knowing that there is a 75% chance they are coughing directly into their hands, and I think the other half of it is the fact that so many people are going out in public sick. I realize plenty just have irritations or are smokers, but it still irritates me.  yes, chronic coughers are the worst.

When it is quiet at home (something I treasure wholeheartedly), she will break the silence mercilessly with that earth shattering cough (I wish I was exaggerating). It scares and disturbs me, especially when it catches me off guard. And I agree, so many people are coughing in public spaces as of late. I book it in the other direction every time.  Sending you strength! not so much coughing for me but when ppl clear their throats\u2026 god\u2026 In my country the government made a god awful advertisement about whooping cough which is about 20 seconds straight of someone hacking their lungs out with words about whooping cough.

My dad has something like pneumonia and coughs all day everyday and it is the worst because he knows it bothers me but he cannot help it. Yeah, and i especially hate it when they make extra unneeded sound effects after it I do not think it is unreasonable to expect people to be discussing their specific triggers in a support group. I am not saying it is. I am asking that they say if there is going to be a trigger, then the people who do not want to/cannot read that will scroll away, without having to add a sound to the growing list of triggers. yes ive even beat myself because of it. that is my top trigger sound as a diagnosed person with misophonia", "So my brother recently got misophonia  Im going to treat him like he and everyone else has treated me for the longest amount of time.

I really need some help here, I have two nieces (12 &amp; 13) who regularly stay over as they are both within 6 months of age of my daughter (12), they hang out &amp; get along very well together, so having them here is an absolute pleasure. The problem is one of them, when she says her s\u2019s kind of elongates the s &amp; it actually makes a high pitched whistle/squeal sound...if you know, you know. I sometimes I hear on the radio with female radio presenters the exact same thing &amp; I honestly have to either turn the radio off or change channel...it physically hurts my ears. My niece does the same thing &amp; it is killing me, as I love them both so very much. But I find myself getting inwardly very irritated with her, I believe I do not show it outwardly. She is such a sweet girl, but it really is driving me nuts. What can I say to help her understand without upsetting her..if indeed it is right to say anything at all? At that age I do not think she would understand or either change the way she is speaking in my opinion, but I hope you will be able to find the solution. I hate that sound too and I just have to deal with it You should not be having people you do not live with in your home right now, including your nieces\u2014 it puts you, your daughter, and every person in your and your neice\u2019s home at greater risk. Tell your daughter to wear headphones while they group video chat, and enjoy the peace and quiet of your home while not aiding in the spread of a pandemic. That is what I thought too, I just have to deal with it. I thought there might be someone out there with magical advice that would allow me to say something &amp; have her understand without me feeling like a bad Aunty...I will just suck it up. DUDE, I HAVE THE EXACT SAME TRIGGER. This one is definitely less common, so it sounds really really weird when you try to explain it to someone, and it is a bit harder to avoid. But theres still a few ways around it. \n\nFor your own sake, you have to try to limit how much you are around her. Not too much, but definitely as much as you can to lessen your stress. When I say that, i mean you can ask not to have anyone over on days where you feel particularly stressed, but when she is over, you can still just stay in a different room than where she is. However, theres still the possibility that if you might be able to hear her through the walls. If that is the case, just wear some headphones with white noise. If you have a nice, good, comfortable pair, then definitely use them whenever you start to feel agitated. It should help calm you down. But dont use them too much, as you might start to rely on them, and that could make you more sensitive. \n\nWhen you are in the same room as her, you can still wear headphones. You do not have to tell the girls why. Just tell them it is a sensory thing, and I am sure they will understand. But if you are in a situation where you need to be paying attention to her in some way, theres something else you can try too. Instead of wearing headphones, wear earbuds with the same white noise playing through them. If you adjust the volume just right, or position the earbuds a certain way in your ears, theres a possibility that you will be able to hear her voice and everything else going on in the room without hearing the S sounds. This is something you will have to experiment with, and there is a certain type of earbuds I would recommend for it, but I have found it to work against the high pitched whistles pretty well, especially if the white noise you are listening to has high treble. \n\nOf course, you can always try to tough through it without white noise too. This is something you should do once in a while for limited periods of time, but I would not recommend doing it a whole bunch. Toughing through the situation usually works best when you are in a good mood, but even then, you should not try to do it for too long, as stress can still build up very easily. Misophonia sucks, and it is a lot worse than people might think. Toughing through it can be very difficult, and therefore should not be done all that frequently. \n\nAnyways, I hope this helps, I have been dealing with this very trigger for over 2 years now, it really sucks, and theres still a lot I am trying to figure out with it, but I have done what I can. If you have any questions, please ask. \n\nHere is the white noise that I normally listen to in order to drown out the S's:\n\n\nAnd here are some pictures of the type of earbuds I would recommend. Basically, they just have to be the type that will actually go into your ear rather than fit over the top of the canal. The ones I have are rather small, which makes them more comfortable. If they are too big or too wide, it will be more difficult to fit them into your ear or position them differently, and it might even give you a headache after a while. \n\n\n\n\n\n Sigh. I am 12 (have to lie low and say I am 13 on Reddit), and it might just be the fact I have had to mature and grow up because I have nobody to talk to about my misophonia, nobody believes me, nobody cares.... but actually people on reddit mistake me for an adult... and my mindset is a lot more mature than the year before, or the year before that... so, I know you might not want to hurt her feelings, but maybe see how she reacts to something else and based off her feelings of the smallest criticism, maybe a month later decide whether to tell her or not? I do not really know how to help you here, but let me just say I know my mindset is fine with some criticism. It is different for everyone at this age, however. For example, I am a nerd that skipped a grade and is currently teaching myself German- others, however, can be extremely different- especially if she is on her period. Tread lightly, though, because this could be something she can hold against you for MONTHS. What about later? I can relate", "Somewhat Good News So I have been struggling with Misophonia for many many years, only what, four/ three years ago I found out the name of it? \n\nI have this GREAT AMAZING friend that helps me a lot with this, and to this, I thank her so much. I am a person who hates others period. I do not enjoy socializing, mostly because of the risks of being triggered. She shows me bunny photos, lets me squeeze her hands, and honestly deals with my yelling and bad mood. \n\nThe other day we went to see ROCKETMAN, and let me tell you, great movie. But, freaking old people eating like cows and making me want to kill myself. But, what I did was stepped out before anything started on the screen ( I still heard the sounds outside ) and debated whether or not to go back to my friend. My phone died so my music that usually  helped me was out of question. My friend came back and we argued about it, and how bringing me to a movie was a terrible idea. But, because she was tired and the seats in our theater were fancy ASF I decided to just deal with it. I slapped on my headphones and slumped in my chair. \n\nI ended up taking my headphones off about a half hour later and the sound of the movie and music was so loud it was amazing. I did not hear the old women chew ( she could not help it, I know ) and I enjoyed it! My friend and I were singing adn I was so thankful that she was there and she talked me into seeing the movie and honestly I always feel bad for doing this to her, she is amazing and I am a crummy friend most times. \n\nThings like this makes me was to start scratching my wrists until they bleed. It is been what, a year? Roughly almost since I have last broke a pencil and started to do my type of cutting so I could calm down. I promised her that I would not do it.  I promised my ex that I would not do it. I promised the few people in my life that cares about my Misophonia that I would not do it. \n\nSO, to all of you who are crying to sleep, or want to give up, do not. It is not worth it. Find a friend that will be what my friend is to me. And if you cannot, then message me. I would love to be that friend to you. \n\nI am going into my third year of high school.

I find if I am triggered by a sound I get an overwhelming wave of feeling sick, my whole body tenses up. I struggle really badly with trigger noises when I am trying to concentrate - and it is been kind of of ruining my life. I will be trying to do any task (texting, a test, reading, playing a game, watch a movie) high or low stress, and just anything that is an unexpected or hated noise drives something sharp right into my brain and I just want to yell and cry and do anything to make it stop. I have only had these symptoms with my misophonia crop up in the last 2 years and and currently awaiting to see a phycologist because it is starting to really affect my life. I used to be an otherwise happy person with a few noises I knew would annoy me but I found them manageable, now it just feels like any noise except talking and music (though even some voices are triggering, like deep or high pitched.) This makes my job hard as I work with tech and walk in customer support so I have to listen to noise and chatter all day - I mostly just suck it up and have a midday cry in the bathroom.\n\nI would really like any advice from others in this community, about management, about medication, about anything.

I absolutely hate loud noises, I have always been triggered by them since I was a kid. It seems to get worse and worse for me as I get older though. The main things that bother me our leaf blowers, lawn mowers, police and emergency vehicle sirens, trains, and obnoxious loud dogs. I physically get mad and upset whenever I hear these noises.\n\nI live in a townhouse and there is a homeowners association. Each week this company comes by and uses their leaf blowers and lawnmowers for hours. They are right outside my window and wakes me up every week. It is been 30- 40 degrees lately here and they still do it. It is the most nerve wrecking loud obnoxious noise I have ever heard in my life. I get angry and start to shake. You just want the loud noises to end but they do not. It is nonstop in my area with sirens and trains and who knows what else.\n\nPeople think I am crazy or something because loud noises trigger me. I do not understand how they are not fazed by them. Any recommendations on dealing with these noises? I bought some foam earplugs and they do not work at all. Have you tried noise isolating headphones/earphones? I use these for my anxiety and miso, they have been a huge help for me! :) I get very irritated with loud noises. In my apartment complex, the garbage truck comes what seems like 3 times a week, I swear! And the sounds of it banging around are just SO loud and so annoying. Even closing doors and cabinets loudly or putting dishes away loudly irritates me. I feel like my hearing is just really sensitive, it is definitely a negative thing sometimes.", "Do I have Misophonia? Hello, I am new here and just wanted tell you a little about my experiences with what might be Misophonia. I am 40 years old and it never dawned on me that my noise sensitivity could be a disorder, that is not until I had my second child and became a single mother. When you are a parent, you do a lot of self-repairing, so after becoming the monster mom I am now, I decided to look into it. I do not know much about it yet, but maybe you can see some familiarity in my experiences. \n\nMy biggest trigger is over multiple sounds at once. For instance, I have a hard time talking to multiple people who are trying to talk over each other. This gives me a lot of anxiety. Now that I have two children, I have children that try to talk over me or the adults I am having conversations with, or they will just be making sounds in the background. This used to drive me crazy when I did not have children, but had friends who had children. The conversations we would have were constantly interrupted with the voices of children and it would just put me in a really bad mindset. Other moms always want to do playdates. I have tried it and it is hell, I do not know how other moms do it, how they can just have a normal and calm conversation with another parent while children are running around them. And sure, who would not think that was annoying, but for me, I go into a deep state of anxiety, and when it is just me and the kids, I turn into a demon.\n\nMy youngest is the worst for me right now, he is always screeching or whining about something, and I just lost it tonight (again) when it came to reading time, he just would not stop whining and wanting things his way and if he is not doing that, he is randomly screeching. There are other times too when I am trying to teach my oldest something and I cannot even get a word in, his voice overpowers mine and I just end up screaming and yelling. Tonight, I screamed for him to 'shut up'. I hate it. What child wants to hear that? But, the reaction is so impulsive, I do not even have time to think before it happens and when it does happen, I feel like the worst person in the world. \n\nWell, here is a little history about me, my mother was a screamer and a loud speaker, and she has noise sensitivity as well, especially while she sleeps. Since my second son was born, I have been screaming too and I am now noticing that my oldest son has a noise sensitivity as well. He even refuses to flush the toilet because it is too loud and gets easily agitated at his little brother's noises, like I do. There is definitely a legacy there.\n\nWhen I think back, I have had fights with people over sounds. My best friend of 25 years and I got into our first and only dispute over him being loud. I just thought he caught me on a bad day, which he did, but it did not dawn on me that it was me, that I was the problem, I just that he was overall loud and annoying sometimes. \n\nWith relationships, I cannot sleep next to anyone. If they make any sounds, I lose it, I cannot sleep and I get angry if it is the middle of the night. I had three long term relationships with people who had really bad sleep apnea, they ended up couching it until we split. I mean, would not anyone go nuts over loud snoring?\n\nI also cannot stand it when people play their own music. I am really particular about what music I can handle at certain times. Even if we like the same bands, if I do not want to hear it at that moment, the sound agitates me, it really sounds like noise to me. I always thought that was because I was self-absorbed or something. In childhood, I had a sibling who was a musician and had band practice in the garage almost daily and he loved blasting music. If he could not blast music during the day, he would play music while he slept at night and keep the bass on, so the volume would be turned down, but my room next to his still vibrated. \n\nWhen I hear a car door outside, I get anxiety. It reminds me of when my mom would come home from work as a kid. She would come in and yell at me for whatever she was angry about that day. When I hear any sudden sound like a car door slamming, someone honking their horn, something falling on the floor or kids banging against something, I jump and am filled with anxiety and adrenaline. Now I am temperamental and anything can set me off. \n\nLoud dishes drive me crazy. My mother is the loudest dishwasher, she will throw the dishes into the next sink for rinsing, then throw them onto the rack. She will throw flatware into ceramic bowls, and this makes my ear ring and my teeth hurt, my body grows extremely tense and I become temperamental. \n\nAdults having loud conversations drives me NUTS. People trying to be heard with volume is really agitating. \n\nPretty much my whole life has been noisy and I often wish I was deaf or even dead. I am not suicidal, I would never ever take a life of any kind, not even a bug, but death just seems so peaceful. That is not going to happen anytime soon because my work here is not finished yet, so I just wear headphones or earplugs and it is very peaceful there. I just need to remind myself to wear them before I start yelling at my kids again. There are situations where I just cannot wear them though, like while I am teaching my oldest about something, but I decided to wear them during reading time from now on. You probably do and possibly PTSD. Did you go through something highly traumatic? I am not a doctor but someone afflicted with both of these things. Thank you for expressing your insight. Yes, I do suffer from PTSD. My childhood was traumatic and so was my adulthood. I hit rock bottom last year after enduring one of the most traumatic events of my life. I am in a safe space now, it is not perfect, because I live with others, I would rather be living alone (of course with the kids), but I do a lot of inner work that helps me handle things by transforming old ways of thinking and behaving. But, I still have a lot of work to do and sounds are a big challenge and have always been there. The thought of running away and becoming a hermit is a fantasy of mine and I plan to spend the rest of my life that way once the children become older and capable. But for now, I wear earplugs and try to meditate as much as I can. I do understand you. I doubt people understand me. So I think I understand. This is shit. It is fucked. How about we find a way to talk to each other? I am terrified to find someone like me. But also so happy. Would you like to be my friend? You can say no I would live by myself forever it it was up to me. I cannot. Do you find noises offensive? Like can you recognize the difference between swallowing and gulping? Does it bother you sounds of foot shaking? Can you feel it?? I sent you a pm :)", "\"Jest tell me if I am ever making a noise that bothers you and I will stop.\" Some people will tell you this whenever you try to explain misophonia to them. Do not listen to this. They do not actually mean it. They will end up getting mad at you. Even if they can tell that you are in physical pain. The amount of times my dads girlfriend says \"You can talk to me, I want to help you! If I make a sound you do not like, tell me to stop!\" She still continues to grab a handful of crunchy candies (M&amp;Ms, jaffas, etc) and smack her lips while I am in the room, and asks me what is wrong when I storm out almost in tears. I understand people can forget you have certain triggers, but when you do the same thing daily and every single time someone storms out of the room in anger, how do you just continue doing it after weeks? I feel for you, it is especially bad when they turn around and get mad at you and tell you that you are the problem when you try your hardest to tell them in them is the most polite way possible. The amount of times we all have explained just how hard and serious it is, only to be told to put it in the back of our minds or to just 'meditate' or something is heartbreaking. To hear the people I trusted most tell me to just get over it when I ask for some quiet and relief is just gut wrenching. No one needs to deal with this. I completely agree, I would not wish this condition on anyone. By the way, who is telling you that? That is ridiculous. Do they seriously have no comprehension of the condition?! Sadly enough, it is my dad telling me that. No matter how much I say I literally cannot stop focusing on it, he continues to say well tryyyyyyy... ugh. I have been trying for YEARS to not focus on it. That jest is not how it works. I wish there was something to compare it to to help others understand. I feel like people genuinely do want to help when they say those things, but they do not realize just how many sounds they make in a short period of time or how many different sounds they make can be triggering. They get irritated when they have to adjust themselves multiple times or for multiple reasons over a short while. I can understand their perspective, but it really can feel like a let down when they react with annoyance or anger after they told you they were willing to help. I still try to be grateful they offered though, because it shows that (most times) they are taking the condition seriously, even if they do not quite know how to help. Like my uncle, he said that some days ago, but still eats like a pig and makes an humanly impossible thin pitched voice all the time. If only they understood the scope of what is bothersome. I have had people tell me this then tell at me. \"IM JUST LIVING LIFE, YOU CANT BE MAD AT SOMEONE FOR LIVING THEIR LIFE, YOU CANT REALLY LIVE LIKE THAT\" Well, I do live like that, and I am mad at every noise you make just living your life, and I am just trying to live mine. I do not think I have ever read a more relatable post. This is totally true. One of these things usually happen after the \u201cjust tell me and I will stop\u201d line :\n\n- They do it again on purpose and laugh \u201coh just kidding.\u201d Like ok I am going to electrocute you but it is ok because I am \u201c jUsT kIdDiNg\u201d.\n\n- They get defensive and deny making the sound even though I HAVE EYES AND EARS AND CAN WATCH THEM DO IT. \n\n- They accuse you of having \u201csuper hearing\u201d, despite years of trying to purposely damage your hearing in your teens before discovering Misophonia is a thing.\n\n- \u201cOh I just did it once. Do not listen then if it bothers you so much.\u201d\n\n\n..... or am I just surrounded by ASSHOLES?? I do not think I have ever read a more relatable comment. It is not like it is a choice. Nobody wants to live there life like this. Just about every person I have spoken to who also has this condition already feels a lot of guilt for it. And that goes both ways, right? They do not choose to make noises, they are a part of life. I do not choose to react to them, it is just a part of my life. I choose to try to control the rage as much as I can, but then my coping mechanisms piss them off too, so it is a lose lose lose. And so isolating. I think you put it very nicely. That is exactly why we feel so much guilt. people have said this to me and when I explain it they say they understand. Then the next day they are chewing extremely loudly and when I remind them they say stuff like, \"my chewing is not the problem it is you that is the problem,\" or, \"I cannot help it! You need to take a deep breath and stop being so sensitive.\" I wish people would either follow their promises or not make any at all. When they make promises they cannot keep it just gives me false hope.", "Children + Popcorn How in the actual hell do children make something as small as popcorn sound like a damn firecracker?

What is some advice you would give someone like me? Thanks! well first of all definitely do not do any exposure therapy kind of stuff, for misophonia it makes it worse!! tbh i think do not completely block it out and ignore it because that could be worse when hearing it again, but do not be afraid to put on some earplugs or headphones (with music or white/brown/pink/whatever noise) to help when it gets bad.\n\nalso quick note, do not put triggers in the title, it affects all those with that trigger too. reading it, for majority of us, has the same effect as hearing the trigger. just so you know for next time", "Is it normal for Misophonia to work similar to OCD?

It is like the equivalent of a migraine headache behind my eardrum and it continues to ache for hours. \n\nAnd it is usually a billion times worse if the noise is sudden, high-pitched, indefinite, or right next to my ear. \n\nDoes anyone else experience something similar? Or is this a different condition entirely? For the record, I have other sensory issues (visuals like strobe lights and tactilities like something sticky make my skin crawl) but sound it the worst by far. I feel very similarly in the examples you give. I do not think you are alone with these feelings. I kind of get the strobe light thing too. Thank you for your input, I was not sure whether I was alone on this. Yes. Haunted houses are not my friend. I love Halloween but it is so stressful. Jump scares, forget it. I think it coincides with my anxiety more than anything though. I never even considered if anxiety played a factor, but that may explain it as well! Tbh I do not like haunted houses because 1: too crowded and 2: I want to look cool in front of others I do not think it is misophonia related.  I used to be intensely afraid of sudden loud noises when I was a kid.  For instance, if there were balloons around I had my hands close to my ears ready to plug them at the slightest notion that one might pop.  I was afraid of guns solely because of how loud they were.  It was bad.  I grew out of it, though, by my teens.  My misophonia on the other hand remains. That makes sense, thank you for your input. Maybe it is just a sensory or anxiety related thing. Anyway, I hope you are doing well despite your misophonia &lt;3 Thanks.  My triggers are pretty avoidable for the most part.  \n\nYou are loud noise issue mIght be anxiety.  I was an anxious kid (thankfully I grew out of that, too).  Just the thought of a loud noise being possible would set me on edge.

I have no advice, only internet hugs \u2764\ufe0f I thought I was the only one. My ears literally hurt. Who expects someone to be in constant pain?

But these two trolls from this 4chan game server I used to play on years ago, the same one that when I said \"Happy Easter!\" one time when it first became Easter and they told me \"Please  please.

Thank you!", "I am going crazy, and getting worse I am sorry if I am doing this wrong, I do not usually go on reddit and have never made a post before. \n\nWith that being said, I am in highschool and I can say that I am 100 percent sure that I have misophonia. My triggers are: chewing, tounge movement, swallowing, breathing, and anything else people do. I did not use to be this way and know that as a kid sounds did not bother me. My parents understand that something is wrong with me, but they are not the best and dealing with it. They will usually tell me to go to my room if they start eating any time other than dinner time. And my brothers voice is actually another trigger for me in a weird way. \n\nBut that is fine, it is like he will being with them but I could have dealt with that. But then I think I started to get worse. I do not know if anyone else has this happen to them or even if it is normal. But around a month to three months ago I started to hear myself when I was eating and drinking, or when my stomach made noises. And I started to trigger myself. I am worried where this might take me and if it will affect my eating. Slowly I have started to drive myself insane and it is hell. \n\nThere is not much I do to calm down and I get into a lot of fights because of noise. But one thing that does seem to work to calm me down are strangely enough certain noises. I have found out that noises that are random and inconsistent become triggers and noises that constant calm me down. When I get angry I try to stick my watch in my ear to hear the second hand tick, and that sometimes does the trick. And when it rains I just listen to it and I do not even notice chewing even if someone is next to me. Things like that give me hope that some day someone will figure out what to do next with this strange issue, because right now no one cares about misophonia.\n\nIf you have any tips please tell me, or if you have anti-triggers. Is this normal for everyone with misophonia? I trigger myself too sometimes, not often though fortunately. I find that the more personal or 1 to 1 an eating situation is the worse I get. More ambient noise works well to cancel out any trigger noises. I often use headphones nowadays playing ambient noise, I listen to rain a lot and the sea.  Unfortunately my worst trigger person is my 7 year old son, my own little boy. I am currently sat typing this in another room while he eats strawberries. Reading this made me realize how much this affects people. The same thing happens to me where the closer they are to me the worse it is. I do not have supper good headphones but I wear them anyways during dinner. If you do not mind me asking, when did it start and has it gotten better at all over the years? Better in a sense that I know now that it is a problem with me, when I was young I would lash out and blame the person making the noise. It is not anybodies fault, nobody is doing anything wrong so I will not let myself attack anybody. But then there is no release from the rage so I end up twitching. I have had it since I was probably 10 ish. Welcome to Reddit, and welcome to the humble r/misophoniasupport. \n\nWhat you describe is absolutely Misophonia in my opinion; it is similar, if not the same, as many people here. It sounds like you are fighting the same battle we are. \n\nHere is some of the things I thought about after reading your post.\n\n* I strongly believe that Misophonia has to do with focus. It hurts more when you focus on triggers. I have read a lot stories of people where their Misophonia has gotten worse after they find out it has a name, or after they have started going to some sort of therapy for it. The common thing here is that people end up focusing on their Misophonia triggers more than they would have before. \n* I would recommend some meditation. If you can learn how to control what you focus on, it helps to distract yourself. It also helps to learn how to move on. I have a bad habit of dwelling on triggers and the people that make those sounds for hours after the sound is over, meditation can help you let go of that. I know it is not the best advice, but it really helps me. \n* I recommend an investment into good headphones. Some people think that wearing headphones makes their Misophonia worse because you get too used to it, but I do not find that. It is definitely worth trying out. I have Bose QC II headphones and they are great; with sound through them I do not even hear people talking right beside me. Being in highschool, you might not have that kind of money, so check out some Taotronics headphones, they are a fraction of the price but very competitive in the active noise cancellation market. \n* If not headphones, look at earplugs. You can get \"invisible\" earplugs that reduce the volume of sound. These are great in social situations where you need to be able to hear somewhat and not appear \"rude\" by wearing headphones. They do not remove all sound, but they remove a lot of the higher pitched noises that usually bother people with Misophonia, and simply reduce the volume of everything else. \n* It might not hurt to learn more about Misophonia. There is a lot of stuff you can read about ( It can sometimes help to know what might be going on in your head. Misophonia is not as researched as other things, but ***it is researched somewhat****.* It is good to learn what has worked for people (and what has not worked) from legitimate and scholarly sources. **Do not fall victim to scams** \\- there is an ocean of people claiming that they have a treatment that \"cures\" Misophonia. They do not and it is just a scam, and they get away with it because Misophonia is not a globally recognized disorder. If there is ever a cure for Misophonia it will be pinned at the top of r/misophonia and r/misophoniasupport forever. \n* Do not forget about your health. Misophonia causes anger, depression, and probably other hard to handle emotions. It is no secret that exercise and eating healthy can help your mental health. Misophonia is not any different. I think that if you keep healthy, you are giving yourself the tools to fight this and have a better life. In my experience, if I spend days sitting at my desk playing video games only eating coffee and cereal I feel like shit and my Misophonia is much worse. Simply going for a run and drinking enough water makes me feel better, and it makes it easier to handle triggers. \n\nI hope I help even a little bit, but either way we know how hard this is to deal with and I hope you find something that can help you. If you want our collective insight on anything else, let us know!\n\nSorry if this seems like a rant, here is my TLDR;\n\n* Do not focus on your triggers. Meditation can help you do this.\n* Get headphones or earplugs.\n* Learn about Misphonia from reputable sources.\n* Exercise and eat healthy. I had a teacher who also taught meditation to us, so I have done that before and if you say it helps I\u2019lol be going back to it now. \n\nThe headphones do help, but I cannot really afford anything because my parents do not want me to get a job and to focus on school. And even if I did get headphones they would not help in the worst place (school) as it is against the rules to have earbuds or headphones of any kind. \n\nI go for runs every morning and night so I think I am fine for exercising. \n\nThank you for your tips, they are really appreciated. :) No problem. I recommend the invisible earplugs because they are really hard to see. Although it might depend on your community, I had no problems bringing these earplugs into final exams and regular class rooms. Sometimes I had to speak to the school counselor to get them cleared for the classroom.", "Powerbeat Pros vs AirPod Pros: which to buy?

But anyways, that gave me the encouragement to just start it off right and talk to the neighbors when they moved in. The new neighbors are just very nice, I just told them I have trouble dealing with sound so if I am being irrational they can brush me off and I will try not to message them a bunch.

His excessive yawning really irritates me... it can even drive me crazy sometimes and makes me not want to be around him at all. For as long as I could remember, I have always hated yawning. I hate the sound of it, whether it is silent or not. I have always thought that something was wrong with me for hating a particular sound (and a couple of others) until I noticed that there is a condition for it. Anyway, I am just convinced that he is either always tired or something is going on with his health. Either way, his yawning literally every other 10-30 seconds can ruin my mood and I end up getting angry with him. I know that yawning is inevitable and involuntary but it is just so annoying to me, no matter who it is or why. I wish I was not like this :/ My dad yawns all day every day and I just do not get it; on the other hand, my dad did not get me. To him it just looked like I did not want to be around him. I think there was some unspoken resentment growing between us.   Eventually we had a talk and I explained how the sounds made me feel. He cannot change his body functions but it definitely released some of the tension being around him, because I know he cares and he tries his best to make it comfortable for me. Stay strong my friend. One can train themselves to do it with some good manners, example when you carefully sneeze or yawn. He should consider this by doing it as a habbit. I see as a part of investing in a relationship. Luckily my wife is very aware of my misophonia and tries to stay alert and not trigger me, that is why I think he should do the same! Some medications cause yawning. Could that be happening with him? My husband was yawning like crazy tonight drove me nuts. When I yawn I inhale when he yawns he exhales really hard. It is more of a germ thing than a sound thing (I think?) so I asked him to cover his mouth. Of course we kiss and whatnot so why am I so concerned about germs? Is covering his mouth enough you think?", "lisp.. posted this on the wrong subreddit earlier oops.\ni just started college last month as a vocal music major and am in choir. my director is super sweet but she has an awful lisp. i have never reacted this way to a lisp before but whenever she pronounces an s or a t sound i tense up or twitch and literally stand there anticipating the next time it happens. sometimes i cannot understand anything she is saying because all i can hear is her lisp and she speaks into am microphone which is definitely not helping. i dread going to choir every day. i am changing majors next semester (mostly unrelated to her lisp lmao) but i am not sure how i am going to deal with this until then. i really love choir and would hate to quit just because of a silly lisp but it really ruins my whole day. it is obviously not her fault or something i can fix or even really block out so i am not sure what to do.

I have dealt with it for 24 years. First it was his mother's voice, then his sister and brother. Then we married and within 2 years it was my voice. I have tried to be very supportive in trying completely change myself to accommodate his feelings but in doing so I feel as though I am not important,\u00a0 that what I feel or think does not matter.

I do not talk on the phone when he is around, I virtually say nothing unless absolutely necessary and even then it causes heartache. I avoid having friends around as not to upset him, My children from previous marriage refuse to have anything to do with him. I am at a point where I cannot deal with it anymore. Sufferer here.\n\nIve been with my partner 3 years now, and she is been great in helping me cope with my misophonia and has been really understanding after alot of explanation regarding my triggers, and how it makes me feel.\n\nHowever, understanding is not a substitute for treatment. Although I am not aware of many avenues that you can take to treat misophonia, I would suggest encouraging your SO to explore any possible avenues.\n\nCbd oil could help, as some say it helps their general levels of anxiety and depression.  A quick Google search reveals that CBT and tinnitus retraining therapy could help. Counselling may also be an option. \n\nI know as a sufferer how difficult. It is to deal with triggers, and I realise how incredibly difficult it must be for the loved ones of misophonia sufferers also! I hope you can encourage your SO to get help with this! No disrespect, but I am really curious what you see in him that is caused you to stay? It sounds like he is been abusing you mentally for the past 24 years, but I do not know if there are any extenuating circumstances preventing you from divorcing him. \n\n\nEither way, having misophonia is not an excuse to be an asshole. It is a hard thing to deal with, but the burden of that should fall on him and not on you. I appreciate your willingness to support him, but he should be returning the favor by contributing to a healthy relationship. As someone with misophonia I find his behavior absolutely unacceptable and very abusive. I suggest you seek help and I hope you find happiness. You should not have to suffer to make someone else happy. Does he know he has misophonia? Regardless, he is an asshole and you have wasted enough of your life on him. Not that this would help OP here, but for anyone in a situation where communication is a problem,  there are a few good points here in ( beginning with\n\n*Stop thinking about the person with misophonia as the problem and start thinking about the misophonia as the problem.*\n\nand ending with\n\n*Ask for help.* I suggest counseling.", "anyone else feel really hopeless this sub has been really great to me, as we know there are not many people with miso and it is really comforting to hear other people\u2019s support, stories, and even read other people\u2019s rants. \n\nhowever, as a younger person, seeing so many people struggle throughout their life makes me feel really scared and hopeless. there is no cure, and no treatment that does not just involve avoiding sounds. my reactions have been a lot worse recently and i am constantly gaining new trigger sounds. \n\ni cannot help but feel suicidal. i find myself contemplating suicide everyday. not only because of my misophonia, i am also rather depressed and have some anxiety. but the whole thing about suicide being a \u201cpermanent solution to a temporary problem\u201d does not help me when misophonia is not temporary. i struggled with these thoughts a few months ago when i was on a new anti depressant but have since stopped. after i stopped the lexapro, it was not a problem again until i kept having intrusive thoughts about killing myself with the rigid ice cream scoopers at my new place of work (dunkin\u2019 donuts). \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

I also have new triggers that I didnt a few months ago and I usually cannot even be in the living room with my family without headphones on now. It will not get better until I find a very good therapist with good coping mechanisms or something \n\nBut I keep getting time where the sounds are not assaulting me, because there are none, and I can be happy. On the days I dont work I stay awake until the early morning because that is when theres no noises other than me. At work I sometimes am forced to be around noises I hate but not for too long, maybe 10 minutes at most.\n\nTherapy for depression or anxiety could lessen the feelings from misophonia, instead of just avoiding triggers. At least that is what I hope for myself. You are not alone I feel this way a lot too. I am also fairly young and find myself gaining new triggers pretty often. For me, it feels like my \"bubble\" of comfort keeps getting smaller and smaller, and one day it will just disappear. I do not really have any advice, but just wanted to let you know you are not alone in feeling this way. While misophonia is a permanent thing, I try to remember that the feeling it brings is just temporary. Triggers are just temporary. I know it is hard, but I really try to retain hope that I (we) can get through this. thank you for your response. i have been lucky enough to find a therapist i really connect with. i am the first he is treated with misophonia and is still learning about it himself. he is mostly concerned with the root of my problem, but at the next session i have i am going to make it very clear i want to investigate different coping strategies. you are right, triggers are always temporary. hopefully someday we can manage them better so actual painful moments are less frequent. i will try to remember that. thank you for your support, keep fighting my friend \u2763\ufe0f I think the hardest part about misophonia when I was younger was the embarrassment and shame I felt. My family was very dismissive and antagonistic (but in fairness we did not know \u201cmisophonia\u201d was a thing) and even after I moved out I suffered alone and distanced myself from people for my own sanity. Eventually I was able to gain enough distance to reflect on my childhood, discover/learn about misophonia. Even then it took me a couple years to shed the shame but now I feel like I am in the prime of my life in my early 30s. If someone is annoying - I ask them to stop. If they are a dick or try mocking me - I tell them off and I leave. \n\nAnyway what I am trying to say is, while I never specifically contemplated suicide, I thought that I would rather be dead for about 100% of my teenage years and probably 50% of the time in my early 20s. Now shits awesome. There is a real important thing you got to know. ok. listen. The people who experience decrease of triggers, or even lose triggers altogether are out there. They are not as visible in the internet as the people who keep on learning new triggers and getting worse over time - it is partly due to how the algorithms work, partly what people (moderators) let through in forums. I have struggled with these thoughts daily since I was a kid, I feel your pain. I am not going to tell you it gets better because anyone who says that does not really understand what this is like, but the longer you struggle the better you get at struggling. What I mean by this is that you learn ways to cope and deal with existing as well as discovering which mental/physical states exacerbate/abate triggers and or responses. that is very encouraging. thank you yeah, i could totally see that. i think some people out grow misophonia. since i am only 17 i hope that is me Most people experience decrease of triggers when they move out of their childhood home (and when they enter new relationships, or have a new baby)! I understand your pain. I felt a lot like that before I was able to move out of my parents\u2019 house. I still have triggers, but I find that they are a lot more manageable when it is not my family causing them. you will get there, I promise. when I was at my lowest points with my triggers, I just kept reminding myself to take it one day at a time, one minute at a time if it is really bad. you can get through this. there is no secret, we are all just taking things one step at a time. We are all rooting for you!! :) Hey, I am about 10 years older than you. All I can say is when you are an adult this thing will be WAY easier to deal with. It is hard to fully imagine as a teenager, but you will have a lot more control over your life after graduation. You can mostly decide who you live with, who you eat with, who your friends are, what you do with your day, etc. You also have a lot more freedom in terms of coping methods; there is nobody making you leave your room to eat with the family or taking away your headphones. \n\nYeah, the triggers themselves do not get better. But honestly, avoidance is a way better strategy than you might think. It is not hard to build your life in a way that minimizes your exposure to them. I currently live with a terrible eater and I can still go weeks between triggers. It only gets easier from here, I promise. that is hopeful. i look forward to gaining some more freedom soon. i only have another year here till i move out. thank you \u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f  This is very true. Your own place makes a whole lotta difference. So that is something to look forward to \ud83d\ude0a \n\nAlso CONFIRMED: I had way worse triggers when I was younger, I am 25 now, so it definetly can get easier. Never lose hope\u2764 You are not alone. The triggers will not magically go away as you get older, but you do gain more control over your environment as you get older (where you live, work, etc...), and that is a major positive factor.\n\nSuicidal thoughts do come up in conversations on the podcast so if you are interested in hearing people like you talk candidly about it in a conversation, this is good one with Matt: \n\n(\n\nOr I am happy to make an intro if you would like to reach out yourself. As you probably know, the vast majority of us misophones are just happy to help each other, it is actually a pretty good coping mechanism in itself. Hey, I feel this so much. I am a young person too and I cannot help but feel so damn hopeless. My reactions have been worse recently too and I am getting new trigger sounds as well. Its really scary to think about the future. \nIs this how I am going to be forever? It just feels so dark thinking of it. I often think about how I might never be able to enjoy things or how I might never be able to maintain relationships. \nYou are not alone. I am so sorry you feel that way. Reading these comments under your post gives me some hope though so we just got to hope for the best, I guess. Lots of love. we got this \u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f i have never heard that podcast before. listening now. thank you\u2763\ufe0f", "My upstairs neighbors are driving me crazy Hello everyone, I need some advice. I live in a college dorm and I am losing my mind over my upstairs neighbors. Every single night, I can hear the thumping of their footsteps and the screeching of their chair through my ceiling. I am just so tired of wearing headphones every night. I cannot sleep with them on and they hurt after a few hours. I also cannot move at this point (I am an RA and doing so would likely cost me my job). Someone please provide advice. Should I try talking to them to see if they can just settle down a bit? Is there some kind of coping mechanism I can use for this? Please help me, I am typing this out of desperation as they are currently frustrating me. Thank you! Does the floor above you have an RA as well? When I lived in dorms, each floor had an RA in charge that you could speak to about noise complaints. You could talk to their RA and have a little more leverage as an RA yourself. Or you could go talk to your neighbors yourself and make it so that you are approaching them as an RA addressing a complaint, very professionally. Dorm living can be hell -- it was for me -- so I definitely empathize.\n\nOtherwise, maybe you could invest in a white noise machine/loud fan and some ear plugs. Sorry to hear you are suffering, OP. Shared living sucks! I have big ears and I also cannot wear headphones for a long time so I would definitely recommend some good foam earplugs (tried wax and they did nothing). Rain sounds are great at masking thumping noises, too.\n\nHonestly if they are not being particularly disrespectful (like hammering or playing super loud music late at night) I would not complain to them, at least not directly. They might get offended and make more noise out of spite. Try the earplugs first and see if it gets better.\n\nSorry you have to deal with this, my neighbors are the same but these are typical noises for apartment/dorm living and sadly most people consider them normal. I feel you, I had neighbors upstairs for years that just refused to parent their damn kids, at all. Running running running all day, all evening, every day. I tried talking to them and they are like \"I tell them to stop they will not stop what can I do? \u00af\\\\\\_\\(\u30c4\\)\\_/\u00af\". He SHRUGGED. Literally ruining my life with the noise all day every day and he SHRUGS. How about uhh do not have 3 kids if you do not plan on parenting them? How about that? Maybe learn to parent them since you have them? Morons. I called the cops when it went on past midnight complained to the landlord.. it was such a relief when they left. First, I am sorry. This must be so frustrating.\n\nSecond, they are not entitled to make noise like that and annoy people and you do not have to put up with it. I agree that a dorm is its own little set up, not exactly like an apartment building, but it is not too far off either.\n\nI would first try talking directly to the people in the room (unless you feel that is somehow unsafe). When you are in a shared living arrangement, even a dorm. you should be polite and respectful. There is no reason for them to be making noise at all hours of the night, and while it might fly in a dorm, it will not everywhere. It would be good for them to start understanding that.\n\nIf that does not work, or you feel that speaking to them directly is not a good idea, and that floor has an RA, talk to that person.\n\nIf that does not work, go to your supervisor. I am assuming you must have one, and I am sure this is a problem that has come up before. Also, find out if there are quiet hours for your dorm. I bet you are not the only one bothered by the noise.\n\nIn the mean time, perhaps you should look into sleep phones -- headbands with flat speakers in them, made for sleeping. I have a pair and they are pretty comfy. There is a Sleepphones brand which is kind of pricey, but there are similar sets for $20-30. (Aside: I first heard of Sleepphones from the Sleep with Me podcast, which I also recommend.) Just being really nice works on most people. I have found that most people like to help and I think if you explained, they would attempt to help you. Be honest, yet kind with them. Do not go to them while you are upset. Go when your having a good day. Maybe bring a peace offering like a box of Ramen? If that does not work, make it profitable for them to help you out in some way. Like maybe you have notes or textbooks from previous classes they could use. I feel this so much rn Update on this situation: I ended up talking to one of the other RAs who agreed to talk to them (did not feel comfortable handling my own noise complaint, especially when it is so emotionally-charged). Ever since, the problem has been so much better. I hear some things on occasion, but it is much easier to deal with now. Thank you for your advice, everyone. I will definitely be using plenty of these in the future.", "Dad\u2019s girlfriend is a misophonia nightmare I found this sub not too long ago, and OH BOI am I glad I did, cause I am about to vent my ass off!\n\nOkay, so I have known my dad\u2019s gf for about 2-3 years now. The first thing I learned about her was that she had the most ear-piercing voice I had ever heard. She is one of those people with the super airy voices, and it drives me insane. Every time she ends a sentence, she sighs. \n\nEVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\nLike, why?! From what I know, you do not have trouble breathing and are a healthy adult, so why?!?\n\nShe also drags out her s\u2019s and z\u2019s, and holy shit, it makes her sound like a damn snake!\n\nNo matter where I go in the house, I can still hear her voice. Even putting on my sound-cancelling headphones and playing music does not work sometimes. It is especially annoying when my dad is calling her and he turns his phone\u2019s volume to the max.\n\nDad, I love you, but WHY?!? Man, I need to tell him to stop that!\n\nAnyway, that is not the only thing that is annoying about her. She also modified her car muffler to be LOUD AF! It sounds like a mofo Honda Civic for crying out loud. It makes her look like an arrogant asshole. Even my dad does not like it. Nobody likes it but her!\n\nEven worse, I usually see her every other weekend, and it is nearly impossible to avoid her. \n\nI need some help. My only coping skills for this kind of stuff are tensioning every muscle in my body, cringing, and mocking the triggering noise. None of them help in this case.\n\nAnyone have any advice? I hear ya. I have a similar intolerance to high pitched, usually female voices, vocal fry, vocal affectations. I also cannot stand \"breathy talk\", male, or female. I used to know someone who actually sighed at every. single. exhale. I mean... just what?\n\nI would say arm yourself with some research material and sit down with your dad to explain what is going on. You will still need your noise-cancelling headphones, but at least he will know how much distress this is causing you. That is a good plan! He has not noticed my signs, so I am definitely going to have to tell him directly. In the past, conversations like that would be kind of mixed; hopefully, that will not be the case.\n\nThanks for your support, fam!", "I got ya homie! ", "How mild can your symptoms be? I think I have misophonia, but I do not want to diagnose myself and belittle what you all go through. I am hoping that if I list my triggers and my reaction to them, you could offer insight on whether or not it aligns with typical symptoms. My trigger sounds are the sound of piano practicing and high pitched laughing/shouting.  My bedroom is directly above the room my family keeps the piano in, and hearing their songs start and abruptly stop over and over again fills me with dread. I get angry at them for practicing and then angry at myself because I know they have to (two people in my family are in performing arts schools.) Sometimes I have to go outside because I feel like ripping my brain out and slamming it against the ground. It feels like the scene in Clockwork Orange where Alex is in the room above the speaker. Sounds like miso and these symptoms are not actually very mild if you feel like you need to stand outside and feel like ripping your head apart", "Best coping skills for parents with children who have Misophonia My DD9 has this and makes the other people in the house miserable.  What are some good coping skills for her when all the other people in the house simply want to have a meal? Her triggers right now are eating only. There should be a set place for eating if possible. A dining room, really.\n\nHere is how I feel about being in a room that someone introduces food to.\n\nI am sitting there, doing something, enjoying the space. I might be reading a book, or watching something, or making something. It is a choice to introduce food to this environment. There are other spaces and other times for eating, eating around me is in no way necessary. And you understand that eating around me inflicts suffering as surely as if you would decided to start shouting at me. Is your need to snack really that important? Is it actually suffering to have to eat a meal in a different space? Exercise some self-control!\n\nNegotiate the use of space. It is very important. There are several things you can try but they all boil down to one thing - keep the noise and the kid apart \n\nFirst, everyone chews with their mouth closed every time. No exceptions and no excuses. But they will slip up because that is what people do. So make it a game - if she catches someone chewing with their mouth open, she gets a point. Anyone who makes it through the whole meal without being busted gets a point. At the end of the week, whoever has the most points gets some reward (e.g., they pick what movie to watch one night, they pick desert, they get $5 - whatever). If that does not work for your crew, find some other way to enforce the rule. \n\nSecond, separated meal times. They eat at 5:00 and she eats at 6:00. Or she is allowed to eat in her room while everyone else is in the kitchen. I would not use this as a long term strategy as it is pretty isolating. If there is one other person that does not set her off, have that person eat with her too. Again, this would be an \u201coccasionally\u201d thing when it just gets to be too much. \n\nThird - other ambient noises. Have the TV on during dinner. Trust me that is it is a lot better to give up a little family bonding time than it is to have daily meltdowns and one family member contemplating murder. You can also turn on some classical music in the background. Or even just the radio. I would not recommend things like fountains or clocks as they can often exacerbate it. \n\nFourth - maybe she has headphones in at the dinner table. Get her an MP3 player (or use her phone if she already has one) and let her pick some music. That shields her without making everyone else have to accept the \u201ccover sounds\u201d if they find that bothersome. \n\nFifth - etiquette classes. Seriously. No soup slurping, no chewing with your mouth open, no scraping your fork agains the plate. All of those can be (and often are) miso triggers. But they are also etiquette rules. Have the whole family sign up. Make it a whole bonding experience. You could even go crazy and start dressing for dinner and pretending you live at Downton Abbey if you want to really roll with it. \n\nBut most importantly - listen to her when she tells you something bothers her. Above all else, believe her when she says something is wrong. If a child believes their parents do not care, those kids are more likely to end up in horrible situations later in life. If you blow off her concerns now about something that is so very important to her, why would she ever come to you with anything ever again? A teacher touching her inappropriately, being pressured into sex with her first boyfriend, or even just some other girls being mean to her at school - you run the risk (not certainty) that she will be hesitant to confide in you because you let her \u201csuffer\u201d for so long at dinner. Asking this question shows you are on the right track and doing the right things but please do not waver. Right now we are doing remote school.  And her school space is in the dining room.  She cant go to another room cause she has ADD and will literally just stop doing work unless supervised.  She has to be watch or under an eye the whole time school is in.  Our house is kind of small but should we have to go in our rooms, or out on the patio to eat? My son started showing signs of misophonia at the same age. He is now 12 and instead of only triggers with eating it is breathing, tapping and more. We got him into therapy this past year and it is helped a bit. He feels like it is helping and we are going to continue to hopefully give him some peace in his life. It is so hard to see him struggle with this and I hate that he seems to distance himself from the rest of the family because of the noises. Thank you! Yes. You are forcing her to remain under supervision in the space that is most likely to cause her suffering. How much of this is really about her needs and how much is about your convenience?\n\nThere is something else going on if you cannot negotiate meal time. I would hardly call it suffering.  When we are eating 150 dollar crab meals everything is hunky dory.  Or Cake, or at a restaurant.  No suffering then!!!! Shes not crawling under the table or even noticing our eating. So ya........\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc Part of this thing is that, for many, it is not a problem when a meal is shared between everyone. For others, they cannot even bear to hear themselves eat. Which makes me think, you invade a space that you have designated as an office to satisfy your base needs. You are not there to share an experience, but to self-satisfy. Pathetic. Do it somewhere else.\n\n\nWhat your language tells me is that you do not value your daughters perspective or trust them. You do not need coping skills, you need to open up to your daughter and her condition and have some humility.\n\n\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\n\nAnd yes, it is suffering. Do you know what it is like to feel involuntary fight or flight responses, anger, and hatred for the people you love? Have you ever been in a fight? Do you remember the feeling? The cortisol and adrenaline, and what it did to you? By all means, chew like a cow, unconscious of their place in the world and their effect on others. The Giant Panda is seen as so valuable that the Chinese government has used them as gifts to other countries! Bro.  She does not have an extreme case.  She picks and chooses her irritation.  If her case was really bad I would never eat with her but that is not the case. We eat together all the time.  Every single day.  And its not an issue.  We sit. We eat.  We talk.  Were done.  Does that sound like Im making her suffer.  Not here to argue.  Thx for your input.  \u270c\ud83c\udffc You are such a fake person. Your daughter deserves better. ", "Sample Misophonia Accommodation Letter (By Dr. Brout) This is a sample letter of accommodations for Misophonia.\n\nDr. Jennifer Jo-Brout has generously allowed for a sample letter for disability accommodations. Please note that this was written for a university student. Since Misophonia has no cure or official diagnosis this letter can be brought to your doctor to help formulate an accommodation plan based on your own person needs. Please feel free to print. A PDF version is available here: \n\nTHIS LETTER IS FOR A SAMPLE ONLY. IT CANNOT BE USED ON ITS OWN, WITHOUT A DOCTOR RE-WRITING.\n\nIf you are unsure if your doctor will provide a letter, and would like advice, please contact Jennifer.\n\nExplanation of Disorder\nThe term Misophonia literally means \u201chatred of sound. Rather, they have highly aversive reactions to specific patterned-based sounds, and some are also over-responsive to visual stimuli.\nIndividuals with these kinds of auditory and visual over-responsivity (similar to what has been known as Sensory Processing Disorder, subtype, SOR) have demonstrated autonomic arousal and decreased habituation in neuroscience and physiologic studies since 1999. What does this mean for ?\nWhen  encounters everyday auditory (and visual stimuli) that most people would not notice, her brain misperceives, or processes this stimuli as though it were dangerous. As a result, she experiences physiological arousal up to and including what we all know of as the flight/flight reaction. This is not something that is within \u2019s control, and is part of an involuntary autonomic nervous system response. This happens in milliseconds without conscious mediation.\nAs such, sufferers, feel bombarded by both noise and visual stimuli. Once this bombardment occurs  may feel a variety of physical discomforts such as nausea, dizziness, as well as what one might describe as increasing mental and physical tension and a more subjective need to \u201cflee\u201d (or more simply stated) leave the place in which offending stimuli exists. Again, this is a fight/flight reaction that is beyond \u2019 control. If she is unable to \u201cflee\u201d or leave the environment in order to get away from the aversive stimuli, her adrenaline level continues to elevate, and other hormonal and physiological changes related to the fight/flight response occur, culminating in what many people describe as experience, \u201ca severe anxiety attack\u201d, \u201crage\u201d, or \u201cpanic\u201d.\nIn addition, 15 years of research on individuals with Sensory Over-Responsivity has also shown a deficit in habituation. That is, once the fight/flight system is set off, the part of the nervous system that is normally activated in order to put the \u201cbrakes\u201d on fight/flight does not act efficiently. Thus, for , normal everyday sensory stimuli is overloading and causes her to become severely dysregulated, but also the way her particular nervous system works disables her ability to calm down.\nUnfortunately, it is impossible to predict what auditory or other sensory stimuli might cause reactivity. Often the stimuli vary, and change over time. In addition, levels of reactivity may vary from day to day and in association with stress, rest and other daily living factors. To date, there is no cure for this condition. Occupational Therapy has helped in regard to some elements of Sensory Processing Disorder. However, there is as of yet no treatment for auditory of visual over-responsivity, or most certainly not for the condition now described as Misophonia.\nAs such, it is extraordinarily difficult for people with this condition to lead functional lives. The problem is not simply one of dealing with the continually overloaded and dysregulated system. The problem extends to the toll this takes on one\u2019s body. Individuals with this problem often become extremely tired, or conversely develop sleep difficulty. They may also suffer from depression because this is a difficult condition with which to live, with no treatment and little understanding within even the medical community as of yet.\nThere are times that exposing oneself to an environment full of sensory stimuli is both physically and psychologically overwhelming to the extent that recent research describes many sufferers living very isolated lives, and others often feeling the need to stay at home where they can control the sounds and light levels (for example).\nBoth SPD/SOR research and the new Misophonia research both suggest that severity of the disorder runs on a continuum, with some people experiencing it as much more severe than others and with possible variations throughout the lifespan.\nAt this point in time there are no validated severity measures from which a doctor can determine an individuals\u2019 level of life impairment or functioning, and most sufferers (as well as psychologists) are using practical daily living skills and management plans to try to assist until further research on the etiology and treatment of this disorder is developed.\n\nRecommendations\n  should to take quizzes and tests in a room separate from others. This will allow her to minimize sensory stimuli to which she may react.\n  should be allowed to leave the classroom for small breaks when needed. Sensory stimuli is cumulative and therefore frequent breaks can be helpful\nHowever, she should also be given the following options whenever\npossible:\n  should also be allowed to digitally record her classes. This would ensure that she would benefit from all class lecture if she is unable to attend class, needs to leave class frequently and/or misses educational opportunity during class due to the distraction often caused by her condition\nConsidering the sensory and misophonia issues coupled with her history of anxiety and depression (and the ways in which these disorders interact and overlap)   is going to need advocacy from within the school in regard to explaining her condition to her professors. Given the physical and mentally impairing effects of this condition and related anxiety and depression, considerations should be given to   if she is unable to attend class.\nFollowing are suggestions for this:\nIn the event that   misses class her note-taker should give her class note and ideally that same person would be responsible for also recording the class so that   can keep up with class discussions\n\nDr. Jennifer Jo-Brout, IMRN\n", "I do not know how to tell my grandpa that he triggers me and I do not want to go back home Ok. This title is long and weird, but I will try to explain it.\n\nI am not good at articulating words, and english is not my native language, so forgive me for any mistakes.\n \nFor some context, I am a 14 year old boy and I am on the end of my vacation, where I am staying in my grandparents\u2019 home (winter vacation is only one month long where I live).\n\nSo. In the end of June I came to my grandparents\u2019 home for many reasons, the main of which are that I love being around my grandparents (your average retired grandpa and grandma who lives in the kitchen), and that I hate even thinking about my stepfather (he is the font of most of my triggers).\n\nI spent the whole month of July here, and even though I knew my grandpa would trigger me, I prefer having 2 or 3 triggers instead of 20 or so at home. I am more of an introvert so I am really uncomfortable looking at someone is face and talking about what I feel, so I opted for walking away when he started with his triggering noises (drinking, eating and cleaning teeth)\nThankfully he noticed it and was kind of understanding about it, but he did not notice the teeth cleaning trigger, and still does it. I feel like he will not notice it, and I want to tell him about it but cannot find a not awkward way to do it.\n\nSecond thing is: my mom wants me to return home when my classes start (online classes of course), and I refused (especially because of my stepfather), but she keeps acting up and making drama about it, and saying she \u201cis going to pick me up no matter what\u201d. Yesterday she called me on FaceTime and tried to convince me to return, but I cut her off and told her that she would not convince me with her lame excuses, and dragged her to end the conversation. Just before I hung up I saw tears in her face. I immediately regretted being rude and still feel really sad remembering but do not think she would understand that I want to stay here otherwise.\n\nShe knows about my misophonia (my grandparents do not) and even allowed me to not have meals with them but other than that, she usually blamed ME for being \u201crude\u201d to my stepfather.\n\nI really do not know what to do in both situations.", "Does anyone else feel suddenly hungry/dehydrated after hearing their trigger sound?

I also struggled with explaining how I was feeling to my mum verbally as she too tended to shut me down before I could properly explain.

So...what is wrong with being neurodivergent? If your brain processes sounds differently, that is a sort of neurodivergence. It is not an assumption.

Hi,\n\nI am new here and never realized how many people suffer from misophonia. I feel a bit better that I am not alone.\n\nI suffer from many of the same triggers as others have described. The ones which fill me with absolute rage are babies crying, water dripping, chewing and when anyone who is speaking punches their P\u2019s or T\u2019s. If said person is whispering the P\u2019s and T\u2019s, I must leave a room immediately. Wet talking (a person who seems to talk with too much saliva), well, I have to flee right away and throw on a pair of boxing gloves. I have recently purchased a punching bag which has helped as an outlet to vent my frustration and anger.\n\nI have also had visual triggers which I am not sure classify as misophonia. I have had these most of my life which I cannot stand. I dare not speak to anyone about them but I have yet to find a term that describes this.\n\nIf I see pictures of babies crying or laughing, I experience the same rage as I would if it were an auditory trigger. Symmetrical holes (like dried lotus) or pea pods, well, again, terrible rage.\n\nDoes anyone know if there is a term like \u201cmisophonia\u201d but for visual, non-audible triggers? I feel really lucky I do not have the visual condition. Thank you (and others) who furnished the term. I was always under the impression \u201cmisokinesia\u201d was the hatred of movement. But, I am glad that I have a term I can refer to should I ever want to speak to a doctor or to others who suffer the same. Thank you! Omg I have been thinking about this too I thought it was a side affect of misophonia for me it is excessive hand movements, picking or biting nails and tapping anything I have only in recent years developed a visual aversion to seeing someone eating. This includes biting fingernails. I always assumed it was because my miso has gotten so bad I barely go out any more, and when I do, my main focus is usually avoiding miso triggers.\n\nWhile seeing someone is not AS bad as hearing them, it does invoke a strong negative reaction. I want to stop seeing them eat so badly that it disrupts anything else I am trying to do. I just assume it is because of the constant reminder that the sounds exists, causing me discomfort through nervousness. Not sure if just nervous or actually affected by the visuals.\n\nThe thing you mention about holes, could it be \"trypophobia\"? Careful googling it, the main results show wikipedia image with holes that would trigger this.", "Office Mate Hell I am losing my mind.  My office mate spends his entire day clicking away on a mouse, which is my most hated sound... he types insanely heavy... he just started a NEW habit of smacking gum all day, as well.

Okay seriously.  Why do people chew gum as obnoxiously as possible?  Do they believe it accentuates their presence on the planet? Why are headphones not permitted? That is outrageous!

Now I tried to show the lovely resources provided to me by u/Schmicarus and u/aikoaiko (thank you) to my dad who I thought we be more understanding. He proceeded to tell me that he knows its called misophonia but went on to say that **mental disorders are not real**. He told me that doctors name a bunch of symptoms and tell people they have illnesses **all for the sake of money**. That people who have disorders or phobias just need to expose themselves to their triggers more. He then told me about how when I was three the sound of plastic rustling would make me cry, it is a noise that makes me uncomfortable to this day. This concerns me as it shows that I exhibited symptoms similar to that of misophonia when I was a baby. He then told me that poor people with \"mental disorders\" just deal with it because they cannot afford the healthcare, and then later they are find. I am very sad to have heard all of this from my dad as I hoped he would have been understanding. Then again at one point he had sent me a facebook post about how vaccines cause cancer, asking me to genuinely consider it. My mom still will not speak to me. I do not understand why she has taken it so personally, I told her that it was chewing noises in general. I feel like I am going crazy, I wish I had a safe place. I am sorry your mom is reacting like that.  I think your dad is just basing his perspective on how he was raised.  It is true more mental disorders \"exist\" now because we are aware of them, and it is true that poor people cannot often get help for these things. Hes probably also writing you off because your mom is so upset.  I am sorry they are interpreting the situation like this. Thank you for caring about the situation it really helps that someone, though a stranger, can empathize with how it feels. I genuinely do not know how I am supposed to move forward from this situation considering I literally cannot leave, but hopefully things will eventually turn up for the better. Again, thank you. Again, that sucks. \n\nIt does not sound like there is much you can do if neither of them will listen. \n\nI would not mention it to your dad but there are better places than facebook to get your medical information. \n\nWish I could offer some helpful advice. I used to be in a similar situation for years, all I could do was plan to move out. I have a similar situation at home. I feel that is their perspective and they are trying hard to believe but they are not trying to understand all perspectives. they know the problem, but not able to understand a solution because they do not know what it feels to go through such things. and therapy is expensive and my parents do not let me go because of that reason. do not worry, you are not alone &lt;3 Thank you so much in reminding me that I am not alone in this feeling, and I hope your situation gets better too! &lt;3 Regardless of how helpless my current situation is, thank you for all of the resources you have provided me. \n\nOn the note of the fact that my dad was convinced by Facebook for medical information, I explained that if vaccines did cause cancer there would be greater uproar and more medical information proving they were bad which he seemed to believe at the time. However, I am having doubts considering his views now. \n\nI been riding on the idea of moving out for a while, I have started creating and selling items with the skills I do have. I do know that it is unlikely that creating and selling little trinkets will turn a large profit, and so I am still focusing heavily on my education. However, it does feel truly gratifying to be paid for work you have done though.\n\nIt is unfortunate that I am really left with the choice of \u201csucking it up\u201d but at least I know I tried everything I could. Again, thank you for all of your help with this. You dad probably does not know that causes of misophonia are different from that plastic rustlin he talked about. You were little kid and you cried probably because you were scared of it. Phobias are absolutely treatable with gradual exposure, however misophonia is not a phobia and here is the difference. If you exposed yourself even more, you would only go insane and depressed. \n\nNo matter how rude this may seem, but fuck them and I am not sorry. If they are refusing to try to understand what you are going through, then you got to protect yourself. If your dad is going to keep believing that people just have to get over it, then he can suffer through his life however the fuck he wants. You cannot do much by changing him, so you have to avoid the sounds yourself. He does not know, he will probably never know, but you do know. Do what you got to do. Could you get a job or do an activity that happens to occur around dinner time?  That could be away to avoid them.  Sadly it sounds like you will not be able to change their minds. I have been where you are. It hurts really really badly. I also know that fighting it or trying to get them to understand is most likely not productive. The fact that you tried to open up to them says really good things about you--you are brave, and you are focused on trying to make relationships better. Also, in case you need this validation, your dad is **wrong**. \n\nIf I could give myself any advice back in the beginning of the unraveling of my living situation at home, it would be to start planting the idea in friends and relative's heads that things are bad at home and I need somewhere to stay. Think of it as a preventative measure to keep things from getting worse for your mental health and whatever you may salvage  relationship-wise with your parents. \n\nI would also tell my past self to start working on getting a job/financial independence while seeking out support from family/friends.\n\nYou do not have to do this alone. Find support so that you can eventually support yourself. Remember, you are brave!\n\nBest of luck to you.", "From r/TIHI  There are fetishes for that.

So as the title says, I have created /r/hatredofsound after a discussion theorizing (and in all likelihood) that the mod of this sub is likely an alt account for one of the main sub's mods. Obviously, for people trying to escape the self admitted increasing dictatorial nature of the main sub this is troublesome.\n\nAs I explain in the creation post over at the new sub, I named it the 'hatred of sound' because I did not want the sub to have a name that made it feel secondary to the larger sub. \n\nAll cards on the table, I have created the sub, am currently the owner/moderator or whatever and also am one of two subscribers. Great sales pitch, right? I also have no moderating experience. As such, while I am doing some research on the matter if the sub gains even a little traction I will want to either hand over the sub or take on a fellow moderator or two.\n\nSo, there is a new sub for people who want the post-able content to be more varied. What now?\nWell, really, I just hope it gains subscribers and begins to act in a way similar to how the larger sub did, perhaps 6 months ago. \n\nAdditionally, it is entirely possible that the mod team of /r/misophonia comes around and reverses in the least the latest changes to the sub. This would be ideal even if it meant sticking around with the same moderators because then there would be no splitting of the userbase, although this seems unlikely. \n\nThat will about do it, I think. If you have any concerns, criticisms or anything else feel free to leave it here or on the sub linked. \n\nHere is a link to the post containing the discussion I referenced.

I get so embarrassed when I jump and shake when someone coughs or clears their throat. It makes me feel like a freak, or like I am crazy. I know people notice it but no one has ever asked me about it. And I hope no one ever does. I am so tense at work when I have to share the office because there is no wall between me and the other person. I constantly tense myself in an attempt to not jump but it wears me out so much, for 9 hours all day long I am just anticipating the next cough and how I will hunker down to prevent my startle reaction. How can I find confidence and get my self-esteem back in spite of this crap? I do not know anything about self-esteem or confidence building, but I have pretty intense startle reactions too...followed by a seething anger towards the person who made the noise. It takes everything I have to hide the anger and there is nothing I can do about the jumping or shaking. I guess all I have to offer here is to let you know you are not alone. What sounds make you startle? Weirdly it is not my typical triggers (which are mostly mouth noises) but any loud or unexpected noise\u2014like a glass breaking or a person clapping in a quiet room\u2014 makes me feel like my heart is exploding and leads to the instantaneous rage that I get from my trigger sounds. I feel ya.\ud83d\ude16 I hear you. Miso is draining. Regarding the self-esteem issue, I do not know if you like to read, but I have found great solace in Albert Ellis's books, especially ( The idea is to learn to stop rating your \"self\" based on your behavior and instead rate only the behavior itself. \n\nIn the case of misophonia, our immediate reactions (like being startled) are nearly involuntary. So it seems especially pointless to rate ourselves based on such behavior. It is not even your fault. Thanks Absolutely the same deal with me. Thank you for sharing your experience", "Coping During Lockdown with a Loud Roommate (advice/rant) I just learned about misophonia through Reddit a couple of weeks ago and it is comforting to know that are fellow sufferers. I have always been overly sensitive to repetitive noises (car alarms, smoke alarms, clocks ticking etc.) to the point that they sometimes give me a physiological reaction. I will tense up or my heart will race, along with an emotional response where I just get distressed and upset. However, since the pandemic started and I have been confined to my home most of the time with my roommate, my sensitivity has expanded to include noises that people make.\n\nMy roommate is objectively a noisier person than normal person. She chews with her mouth open and smacks her lips, slurps her tea/coffee and makes sighing sounds after, makes exaggerated long \"chooos\"  after she sneezes, stomps really loudly, blows her nose frequently with a loud vibrating technique that eludes me to how she achieves it, makes this weird long nasally sucking/spitting sound I have never heard before (sometimes while I am eating), talks on the phone with her friends really loudly and just makes weird laughs/snorts/sing songy voices. You get the point.\n\nWe have been living together for over two years and generally have a pretty good relationship aside from the spring (during first lockdown) we got pretty testy with each other. In addition to her initial reluctance to take covid seriously and us having different cleanliness standards, I think the core issue was that her noises and habits were starting to trigger frustration and eventually resentment in me. Normally I am the type of person who likes to be straight forward and upfront with people when there is conflict, but how do you tell someone that you generally respect and get along with that their seemingly innocuous mannerisms in their own home are causing you serious mental anguish.\n\nWith winter approaching and a second lockdown just announced in my area, I am starting to lose it again. Living on my own is not an option as I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world and am trying to save for my own new home while paying off my student debt. Aside from her noisy habits this is generally an ideal living situation.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or advice with how to approach this issue with someone you are close to without upsetting them? Or should I just work on ways to cope with it on my own since I am overly sensitive?\n\nThank you in advance i had a roommate like yours once in college. she did everything super loudly. we made some compromises, but the rest of it was hell. \n\ni think there are some things, like talking loudly on the phone where you are absolutely in your right to set some boundaries. it is a shared space, and she has no right to infringe on your quality of life. other things, like with eating and drinking, it is a no. she is probably been doing that shit for years anyway. \n\ni have an idea for you. i have been doing this with my mom, because i am quarantined with her. -- i change my appraisal.\n\nthroat clearing is one of my biggest triggers. whenever my mom does it, i just try to imagine the phlegm in her throat with little googly eyes sliding around like lava in a volcano and it makes me feel less resentful.

Maybe tell her that you have this issue and ask her to allow you to have a signal- like if you raise your hand and ask to go to the water fountain, even if he tells you know and that you can go later in class- that could be the key for her to look around and ask your classmates to spit out their gum. \n\nthat way you do not have to call the student out in front of the class and your teacher can hopefully help you out One of the important things to remember- is that a lot of people especially those with ADHD- arguing this just as unconsciously as if you are being enraged by it. \n\nI know that there are assholes who will do it on purpose- but there are also a lot of people who tap and click and shake their leg as a nervous habit that they completely forget and 10 seconds later they are right back to doing it. \n\nIt did not become clear to me just how unconsciously onsciously even when I try to mentally stop myself- the second that I stopped focusing on it- I i am aware of people having adhd; i have it. but this dude is doing it on purpose Yeah that is really miserable. So what about talking to your instructor? I do not think that will help because my teacher is not super understanding and she is honestly too busy during class to be able micromanage his ass every time he does something annoying. He is one of the worst students in class and constantly makes trouble in the first place. It possible to ask for a seating assignment change? Or to speak to someone who is over your teacher, that may be able to get you accommodations?", "One more click and sucking of the teeth And im leaving my girl i cannot  take it in getting so angry i have PTSD and ik constantly triggered", "HELP My boyfriend eating drives me insane  I have the same issue with my boyfriend. However, he was not always as loud of an eater as he is now. I have not brought it up because I do not want to offend him (and I also know I am way more sensitive to sounds when I am stressed out and I have a lot of personal stuff going on right now), but I have to wonder if he is either more comfortable around me now after 2 years of dating, or he is having some breathing troubles (he has a deviated septum and allergies). \n\nHas your boyfriend always been a loud eater? Do you think you might have some unrelated stress in your life that could be making your tolerance to sounds way lower? The way that I have gotten out of eating at the table with my boyfriend is how I told him I think it is morally wrong to ask him to change so I have to eat in the next room, which I do daily. Sometimes he wants me to eat with him and promises to be extra careful and sensitive. I keep my earbuds nearby and sometimes I have to leave the table early. But if he tries to be careful, I think it is a good idea to do my best to get through a meal as well.   That definitely makes sense. I think being around someone more causes you to pick up on their habits that you normally did not see/hear before. \n\nMy best advice would be to focus on your breathing and try to focus on something else. Keep the tv or radio on while you eat dinner - just something to drown out the mouth noises. That definitely seems to help me a bit. \n\nIt is a struggle when they get defensive about it... you want to explain why it bothers you, but it is such a hard thing for some people to understand.", "Fall, Winter, and Spring Make Me Want to Die So far I have not come across anyone else with my same trigger noise (sniffing).\n\nI am going fuckin' crazy, man. I honestly do not think my mom knows what a tissue is... She is so fucking loud when she sniffs, and Istg it is abnormal. I do not believe my misophonia is exaggerating that. I could hear her from the farthest part of the house. It makes my blood fucking boil. And then my dad, who is *a lot* quieter (thanks for not being a pain in the ass, Dad), does it like 10 times in a row within a couple seconds. Ya know what I mean? So it is fuckin torture because I have to hear it about 10 times and each time I want to break my cereal bowl.\n\nBut oddly enough, my misophonia is very selective. Ex. people at work do not bother me. Certain family members do not bother me. I think I have to be around the person a lot for it to actually kick in. It is really weird...\n\nAlthough, when I was in school, I seriously wanted to punch that girl who seemed to have mfkin allergies year-round. God, she was such a nice person but just because of my misophonia, I thought she was a damn bitch.\n\nAnd, of course, in school, I mimicked the sound to relieve stress and anger. And, of course, everyone was like \"What the fuck is wrong with you\" I had no idea what was going on in my brain. I just thought I was an abomination or something. I used to hurt myself for it and even considered taking my life just for the sole issue. I felt like such a burden, and I honestly still do.\n\nI gave my parents all the details about this disorder (is it a disorder? I am not sure, there is not a lot of info I can find on it and I do not want to be offensive) and they still do not get it. They wonder why I am in my room 99% of the time I am home. They think I have a problem with them, or that I hate them. I am tired of reiterating, so I just make up some random bullshit now.\n\nI have to get up and just go to my room if things get unbearable. I remember I was watching a movie with my mom and she would not stfu so I just said I am going upstairs and she could not understand why, even though I would explained it enough.\n\nI feel so alone... This is the first place I have found where I can actually post. There is online groups and stuff but I cannot figure out how to post anything, so I just gave up. Hopefully being here will make me feel a little better.\n\nSorry that this was so long. I have never actually explained the full extent of my trigger to anyone.", "Person who does triggering noise on purpose hey there, i really wanted to hear if some pepole had the same exprience as me and if so, what did they do in this situation. so the situation is that i have a person that knows about my misoponia, and litreally every single day for 5 monthes. every time i go near them (we live in the same place) litreally cough so loud, does vomiting noises without any reason just to make me triggered. litreally only if the person see my feet from their door the  person will cough their head off and its really makes me feel bad, especially when i eat and have to hear this.. did anyone was on the same place as me? what did you do? thank you so much! :) Start buying the household milk, but get only skim milk. I would start getting really petty, people who pull that kind of crap deserve to be inconvenienced at every step of their daily routine. Made me smile, i really not sure i am keeping up with all of that, i am not really, i more like get back into my room and try not to punch the wall lol, this person do need to stop doing this crap, but they have the power of a horse to do for 5 whole months even more without any stop,, thank you so much for commenting! Yea, sorry I do not have any meaningful advice to give, people like that suck good luck OP. Thank you! staying strong is the key :) hope you have the best day! have a serious talk to them, if that does not work, maybe consider completely isolating yourself from them until they give in and ask why are you ignoring them (that worked wonders with me) Oh I WISH that would have worked, they know what the problem is, and they truly do not care if i ignore them, the person just ignores back! lol! i really start to think there is no many choices but to walk around the place with headphones! that sucks but if person is being unable to talk to about this so someone needs to be the mature one and i will take it on myself! i am so happy it worked for you! i wish the best for you and me! thank you so much for answering! You also! i have been thru this; i have a chewing trigger and my younger sister when i told her to stop would do it longer, louder, and in my face. it was just torture and rly made me insecure like i was being made fun of/my condition was not valid. this was probably 3 years ago. she now respects me and my triggers so much and i am so grateful. so sorry i do not have any help for now, my situation was just that person maturing. i did send my family (including her) a couple youtube videos explaining misophonia and i feel like they had more compassion after that. glad someone else has been thru this too. WE ALL ARE SO STRONG. i am so thankful i found this community i feel seen This person is a scumbag. I usually do not say things that are this judgey, but someone that intentionally stomps on a trigger is hot garbage. They are doing it because they view as something to be used for their entertainment. Do not start doing things to annoy them, because that will make them do what they are doing even worse. Cut off all communication with them. If you have been allowing them to do things like share your food, TP, laundry soap, whatever, stop. Lock it all on your room. Erase their existence as best you can. \n\nHumans are highly-social beings. Even if someone does not like a person who shares their space, a complete shunning like this is disquieting. They may ask you why you are doing it. If they do, just tell them 'You are making my living situation uncomfortable, so my healthy boundary is limiting the chances you have to do that. When you are willing to stop the behavior, we can have another discussion.' Keep it without emotion. No expression, unwavering eye contact. If they respond by being a jerkass again, go into your room and close the door.\n\nI use a lot of white noise and other similar background noise. My go-to is cosmic radio noise. There is variation, but not where you consciously notice it and it seems to compensate better for covering the trigger sounds.\n\nGods bless and stay safe! First of all thank you so much for taking your time to comment! \n\nI really do not do anything back at them to annoy them, if i could show you, you would see that all of the time in day i am or outside the place learning or inside the place, learning haha! its usually happens when i just comes out and they can see me so the person startes doing it, if its happen when i eat its the wrost! they dont really truly dotn care if i talk to them or not, they are just a person like this which is the biggest problem because they are like \"i am not giving up on making this noises, sucks that you have the problem, i dont need you to talk to me\" kind of mind! BUT the white noise and backround noise are a very good idea!!! very very goodd! maybe a rain noise or another noise that can make the noise go away! i will try it asap!! thank you so much again! bless your heart! Thank you so much for commnenting! i really am glad that your sister stopped, you deserve the quiet and peace, only one person in the house are understanding the problem we all have here, and some videos do help! even helped me to understand that i have misophonia! i am so glad to hear someone went trough it and it stopped! gives me happiness and hope! i am also very thankful for this community! amazing pepole and i never got out of here sad! thank you so much again! Any sound that has almost layers, like cosmic noise, rain or even something like the sound you would hear from an engine aboard a ship, might help. The best sleep I ever had was when I served in the United States Navy. And that constant, steady thrum also made trigger sounds way less bothersome.   \n\n\nI do hope you can get some relief, or the nitwit giving you this problem finds something else to do!! Thank you so much for helping me! i appriacte it! i tried the rain noise and white noise and it was heaven for me to learn in :)  the person saw that i am putting white noises and litreally now opened their room door so i will have to hear them cough even with closed door and WHITE NOISES AND A FAN!! AAAAAA i swear this things can make mee go crazy they didnt stop cough for more than 8 hours straight now with litreally a hour break  ksjdfssdfds Is there anyone you can tell or report this to? Because this now becomes an intentional attack on you. No, the other pepole on the house are just saying to ignore, i think i will just put my earbuds on charge and put the noise in there! with the fan i have always on it should be something!! thank you so much again for the white noise!! it does really help!! If you feel comfortable enough at some future point, another thing you may try would be to print out some material on misophonia and give it to whoever ins in charge of the house and say 'This is a neuropsychological condition and s/he is making it intentionally hard for me to cope. Is there anything you can do?' I will try that! sadly in my language and country this is not a very famous problem and thing, so maybe i will try to translate some!! it is a good idea! maybe to show i am not making this up can help so much more! thank you again, seeing that there are pepole who understand me makes me feel so much better and stronger! you cant even understand how much i appreciate it It is a struggle. It is a terrible thing to have to live with, and when people intentionally trigger, that makes it all so much worse. I am glad that I have made a bit of difference for you! Makes my fight with this easier. I keep studying with white noises! it helped a lot i hear it now with earbuds! yesterday all day i was with earbuds learning!  i appriacte it all so much! its warms my heart and gives me strength! i will tell you how is it going! :) because i really do owe you alot for you  keep helping me! really made me more calm to understand that this problem is not my fault! My brother used to do this. It was heartbreaking to see someone enjoy provoking mental anguish for me. The only thing I can say is to explain to them that this is NOT just an annoyance or a personal preference, it is a neurological disorder. Try to educate them as much as you can and explain that it is out of your control. I would try to make it as clear as possible that unless they are intentionally inflicting pain on you, then they must not understand what they are doing. &gt; out of your control. I would try to make it as clear as possible that unless they are intentionally inflicting pain on you, then they must not understand what they are doing\n\ni think the wrost thing that a person can do is to block themself for learning how to respect others problem, i really think with this person its a lost case, they dont understand how bad is it, and they keep doing it because like: FUCK OP HAHAHAHA its annoys op! ill keep doing it!. i learned that pepole like this i should just ignore, you dont even understand how much i tried to make it clear its an actual problem and i am not making things up! but luckily summer came which means i can put loud fan on, with white noises on earbuds and just ignore.. i am not going to make myself go crazy over them being so numb! \n\nthank you so uch for commenting! i appricate it a lot! i hope your brother stopped after you explained it to him! no one deserves it, misophonia is hell, and pepole need to open their heads more to this problem.. bless your heart!", "Misophonia ruins my life I just want to be normal. I want to be able to sleep inside. I want to be able to be around people who are eating. I want to be able to play my games at night when people are snoring without having to go sleep in the car. I want to be able to go out to parties. I want to be able to be around people I like. I want to be able to fall in love without hating them for certain things they do. I want to not have to yell at my dog to stop when she starts licking herself. I want to not feel like I cannot deal with it anymore. I want it to go away so I can be happy. I just want everything to go away..  I try to use earplugs but I always run out of them so quickly cus in order to sleep I have to have them in and they fall out in my sleep and I cannot find them.. then I wake up in panic because I hear someone snoring .. and I run around the room trying to find another one.. My heart cannot take anymore this hurts. I dealt with this ever since I was little and I just want it to go away .. I feel like I am going to break Hey, I know it is exhausting and frustrating, and painful, and torturous.. I wish I had the 'solution' or 'cure' to misophonia, but sadly I do not. I get triggered mostly by sounds made by women and it developed into this huge hatred towards women and people in general.\n\nA thing I am doing right now - I went to a psychiatrist (have actually tried many psychiatrists, have taken way too many pills, but to no avail) and they recommended I get checked out for any deficiencies, turns out I have low lithium, low vitamin D, low folate levels, high cortisol, etc. I am currently taking food supplements in order to fix all that.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? This current psychiatrist told me they had a patient similar to me, who suffered when listening to certain noises. They claim they got cured by fixing their deficiencies. Now, I am sceptical AF, but I prefer some hope over absolutely no hope at all. Maybe look into that? \n\nSorry for not being able to do much. You can get through this, I believe in you. I know how you feel. It sucks. All my life I just wanted to be normal too.\n\nI do not know if this is helpful but these have helped me:\n\n1. **Live alone**: Life used to be unbearable when I lived at home because there were so many triggers. I was tense 24/7. I do not think my misophonia got better significantly over the years but going away for college and living alone has made things so much better.\n2. **Work accommodations**: I am a designer working in tech and have always worked in companies where I am not required to sit at my desk. As long as I get my work done, no one cares where I work from. Before covid, I would work from home 1-2 times a week. When I went in the office, I always worked with my headphones on and I would either work from the cafeteria (where the loud music drowns out any person's sounds) or work from an empty meeting room with the door closed. You can ask for accommodations at work to make it more comfortable.\n3. **Try different types of ear plugs:** Not all ear plugs have worked well for me. Some are too thin and do not expand enough. ( are the ones I stick with now because they fill up my ear and do not fall out. \n4. **Headphones &amp; earphones:** I only buy earphones with soft earbuds so I can wear them for a long period of time without hurting my ears, I even wear them to sleep sometimes. My partner bought me bose noise cancelling headphones, which work great for work, public transportation, etc.\n5. **Medication**: When I first started looking for a psychiatrist 10+ years ago, no one had any experience with misophonia. It felt so discouraging to hear them say they have never heard of anyone with my condition. It made me feel like a freak. My family settled on a psychiatrist who at least seemed genuinely interested to help, rather than be dismissive like the other ones. I was prescribed benzos and it did not cure my misophonia but it definitely helped a little. It at least made me feel a little less tense from worrying when I will hear my next trigger and lose control. \n6. **Therapy:** I have tried many therapy methods. Exposure therapy did not work. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was not the most effective but it did not hurt. Talk therapy is helpful in that it helps me at least offload my thoughts somehow. I felt like although no therapy has cured my misophonia, it is completely worth it. Before, I felt like life was not worth living if it is so difficult to even do basic things (eat dinner with family, go to movie theater, etc.) that normal people can do easily. The combination of meds and therapy at the very least have gotten rid of my suicidal thoughts.\n7. **Routines:** I have developed certain routines that have made life more livible. For example, always bringing ear plugs, earphones or headphones with me. That way if I lose one I still have a backup. I avoid taking public transportation with people I know so I can wear my headphones and blast music. I avoid watching movies in theaters and only going once a year for super important movies (for me it was my annual star wars movie trip with my friends). \n8. **Captions:** If I am in a meeting and someone makes one of my trigger sounds, I turn off audio and turn on auto-captions. It is not perfect but at least I can follow along. I do this fo movies/shows too.\n9. **Sign language:** I am currently learning ASL so that I can hopefully get to a point where I can wear headphones more and communicate via sign language instead of taking off headphones to hear and talk.", "Any advice on coping in shared lunch spaces at work? Omg the gross noises of other people around me right now! I guess it did not use to bother me as much but after working from home for so long I must have been resensitised.

The acoustics of this place exacerbate the outside sounds. The outside sounds are cars honking constantly. Every honk makes me want to tear my hair off and punch a wall and throw rotten eggs on cars. \n\nWhat is funnier even is that once i have been let known that I have to vacate the apt (after only 1 month of living in this shthole), the triggers have become a lot more unbearable and bothering  than when i thought i was going to stay long term). \n\nThe mind works in mysterious ways I guess...\n\nNot much advice that can be given, but I would like to hear about your own experiences with the hell that excessive, irresponsible honking creates? honking is annoying as fuck but it is not even triggering for me. Especially because it is not the worst.\n\nThere is absolutely no regulation in my area, so there are crackheads that blast their shitty country and brazilian funk music in their cars, it is also not really triggering because i kind of get it that they are mentally impaired. \n\nBut what fucking gets me is car advertising. \n\nEvery. Holy. Fucking. Day.\n\nMy local supermarket brings their cheap truck equipped with a speaker to advertise their worthless crap. I never liked ads, but always understood that you get something as a reward - youtube ads let you watch videos; tv ads let you watch tv; internet ads let you read an article - but this, THIS not only does not give me anything back, it violates my ears, I cannot turn it down, and it is all for COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. It makes me want to stop their car and slit their throats. It makes me want to commit arson to the supermarket.\n\nAnd it is all legal. Fuck this shithole of a country, I am leaving the sooner i can. Are you living in a Portuguese speaking country by chance ? Me too.. There is no car advertising here, just the useless contant honking, with no reason. Just honking for the sake of honking. Makes me hate the whole human kind.\n\n Days where there are football matches are making me want to do a mass shooting, and that comes from a very pacifist person.\n\nThe struggle is real. yes, i live in brazil, the most hostile place to misophonia Me i am across the ocean, but..same. Do you live in one of the countries where you use the horn instead of the brake pedal if something is in front of you? I completely agree with you! Car sounds in general drive me insane. I hate the fact that people use our narrow residential street as a shortcut to dodge traffic. It makes me want to block the road or yell at them to stop rat-running. AH I HATE CARS HONKING!! espeically the dumbass pepole who litreally put their hand on the honk for long time!! litreally okay we understood STOP!! i feel you and sends you blessing! To be fair, they tend to be quite respectful in general. Never have I had this problem until now .\n\nBut there is something about this place where i moved now (many cars, not enough parking spaces and a horrible acoustic distortion that makes them to appear louder than they really are). Reminds me of that scene in the TV show 'Girls' where Ray goes outside screaming at every car to stop honking, and has a meltdown in the middle of a sea of screaming cars.\n\n That is pretty much how my brain reacts everytime. I feel ya. i think i may have shared similar experiences. I moved into a house in the UK that was between two arterial roads into the city, large volumes of traffic, sirens honking and beeping. I got used to it in a couple of months.\n\nLived in India for a bit in Delhi.... that place is something else. I think i worked out that the average road user honks their horn something crazy like 27,000 times a day - whatever the number is A LOT and there is tonnes of traffic in Delhi, just tonnes. I got used to it pretty quick.\n\nThen moved to Jordan in the Middle East for a bit and for some reason, i do not know why, the horn honking over there used to make me go insane... i never got used to it. Used to piss me off something chronic. Plus when it gets really hot there the country kind of turns nocturnal so beeping your car horn at three in the morning to let your mate know that you have praked up outside his house is fine... even though you are on the phone telling him you have arrived you still need to beep yer frickin horn do you?!?!?!?!\n\nI am going to go and calm down- i feel your pain buddy Oh dear this is very similar to what I am going through myself. \n\n I find it awesome that you traveled so much and I hope you are now in a peaceful place. \ud83e\udd0d", "My misophonia has worsened So, I used to have only a couple of sounds as kid that would make me feel angry and anxious. Like for example soneone pouring any type of liquid to a glass. I still gringe every time I hear it. But now that I am older It looks like my misophonia has worsened and there are more sounds that trigger me. I cannot stand if someone is whispering or is talking fast and loud, I absolutely hate if someone is eating loudly or making loud gulping noises while drinking something. my mother eats very loudly and every time I visit her and my father and she starts to eat something I have to go to a different room and stay there until she has finished. If I hear her eat I have to put my hands to my ears and I feel this rage and panic. I have not told her about that since I fear that I would hurt her feelings. For some reason I do not mind when my father is eating even though he also can be a loud eater. I get very angry if someone is tapping a table or something with their fingers. In my previous apartment my neighbour would do this constantly for long periods of times (the walls were very thin) and I would get panic attacks because of it and I had to wear ear plugs for most of the days (this was one of the reasons why I could live there only for 8 months) is there any reason why my misophonia has suddenly worsened? Does it get worse when you get older or something? Does there exist any sort of medication for misophonia that would help? (sorry if there are granmatical errors, English is not my mother language) Unfortunately, misophonia is known to get worse as you get older. You are not the only one this has happen to. Now I am not an exbert but personally what helped me to lessen my triggers was regular exercise and eating CBD gummies. CBD helps with depression, anxiety, and made me personaly less prone to anger. \n\nI cannot say it will work for everyone but this is what helped me. Thank you, I Will try those \ud83d\udc4d No problem, but if you try CBD gummies make sure to look for or try finding ones that have 0% THC in the product. It does normally get worse as you get older, but I have also noticed that I go through phases of really bad misophonia and phases of not so bad misophonia. So maybe you are in a bad phase right now, which may be helped with a good diet, a full sleep schedule, and exercise. But it seems like misophonia is drastically affecting your life, so I might recommend that you talk to a doctor about getting a prescription for an SSRI or SNRI. These are antidepressants that others have had real success with in terms of their misophonia. This! Even if it does not eliminate the trigger, it can increase the recovery time speed/calm down for me. Nothing is worse than after even a brief trigger that you did not get to prepare for and you are left wanting to gouge yourself.\nAnd I agree, mine fluctuates and seems to do so with stress (though now I am not sure which comes first lol). I really do think there could be a very close tie to ocd as well.", "Losing my mind in my apartment. Hearing my neighbors stomp and do whatever else they fucking do above me is making me lose my mind. It just gets worse and worse everyday and I go from extreme anger to breaking down into tears. I want to destroy everything when hearing it and I just cannot tone it out. \n\nI like watching TV but no matter how high the volume is I can still hear it because it is like I can *feel* the noise, like it shakes my apartment or something. The only thing I can do is play music at the loudest volume with music on but I do not want to do that all day. I just want to relax and watch TV and not be on edge all day dealing with this.\n\nIt is really starting to drive me more insane than ever and I just do not know what to do. Please give advice :( I swear I could have written this post myself! It suck so much, it is gotten to the point now that I am staying with my mom and I will not enter my own home because I get panic attacks. \n\nThe only advice I have sadly, is to find a place with no upstairs neighbors if you can. It is absolutely horrible to not feel safe in your own home. Please try to get out before you end up like me (depressed and suicidal) Sorry to hear about this. I rent also but I rent the master bedroom in a single family residence with no shared walls with the other people living there. \n\ni decided to do this after experiencing a similar situation to you. Between work and living in an apartment I was not going to make it. There is only one apartment complex within driving distance to my job that does not allow dogs. Looking for a corner top floor apartment with no neighbors that have dogs was extremely difficult, and I would be paying substantially more than I do now.\n\nGood luck, you are not alone bro/sis I used to be in the same situation, I am so sorry, it sucks. I found that singing, humming, or even subvocalizing would help me tune it out. Something about the way our ears work makes it harder to hear external noise when we make noise ourselves. I know exactly how you feel and I am really sorry. The only thing that worked for me is wearing noise canceling headphones basically all the time :( seriously, I feel like I wrote this myself. I live in one of those old 1900s house-turned-apartments and am on the ground floor, with multiple efficiencies above our 2br unit. multiple upstairs neighbors, and I FEEL every movement they make. absolutely grueling. I would contact the property manager first and ask them to address it. Before my husband and I purchased a house we lived in a 1st floor apartment, normally it would not have even been an option but I was VERY pregnant and didnt want to lug stuff up the stairs. For months our upstairs neighbor was away as a missionary, she was a single geriatric dutch woman, who I named lady lead boots after her return. \n\nYou guys, I have no idea what she was doing up there but holy mother of god she was so loud. I once got an invite up just so I could see what was going on up there. Sometimes Id try and figure out what was happening based on sound and where she was going. She ran to her kitchen a lot, as if she forgot she was cooking. My misophonia only got worse when it was coupled with my anxiety of my baby being woken. I am sorry you are dealing with this too. It is so so difficult to deal with and i never even expected it. I regret not choosing the top story so bad. How long do you have left at your place if you are leasing? My last complex was super small and I was on the second floor (top) so it never even crossed my mind that it would be an issue since I could not ever hear anyone. I regret not choosing the top floor at this one so badly. The ones above me have a dog so I can always hear him running around along with the barking, which drives me and my cats both insane lol. I have definitely learned my lesson, but honestly I think a townhouse or single family home will be my next move because even the outside noises of people at the pool or on the balcony below me drives me insane. \n\nThanks for your comment- it always helps to know I am not the only one. Feeling the movement is soooooo awful because literally no matter how hard you try to tone it out you still know that it is happening by feeling it. It is like when my cats lick themselves beside me and if I do not hear it, I can still feel them moving\u2026.so I know that it is happening and it makes me want to rip my hair out. \ud83d\ude43 What do you think they could do? I feel like they will just say that noises are inevitable and there is nothing they can do. I have thought about leaving a nice note for them at their door but I hate confrontation \ud83d\ude05 Completely agree! If I am moving around like cleaning or something or if I am on the phone talking to someone it does not bother me - but if I am quiet myself and just sitting around then that is when it is the worst Which ones do you have? I tried looking and some are crazy expensive, but I also do not want to get cheap ones for them to not work at all! Lady lead boots- love it. I have thought about leaving a note for the people above me because it literally sounds like they wear heavy boots 24/7 while speed walking all across their apartment. Hearing every time they flush the toilet or run their washer machine is one thing but the footsteps\u2026..I cannot do it. \n\nI cannot even imagine how hard it must have been for you combined with the baby. I started babysitting an infant recently and I am literally terrified of making the smallest noises to wake her. My cats already jump up with the upstairs noises so I know that that must have been super hard to deal with. \nI got a pair of Bose QC25's on sale one year and wore them just for the noise canceling around my townhouse. I could still carry on a conversation with my boyfriend but they did a good job blocking out bassy neighbour noises. My bf still lives in the apartment, so we will keep it until we have found a house. So there is quite a while until I never have to return to that place again.\n\nThe worst part is that we rent from an association that is pretty reputable but they will not help us, I have asked about soundproofing the ceiling but then they would have to increase the rent so we got a no for that, and they will not help us by talking to the neighbors either. We have tried talking to them ourselves, and I tried writing them a letter explaining that I get anxiety when they slam their doors and cabinets and when they stomp around for hours (in a nice way of course), and then we got a letter back from them saying too bad that is our problem and they are not going to change or have this conversation again. And then they started wearing shoes when they stomp around. So now it just feels like they are literally doing it on purpose, and they can hear me having breakdowns and screaming and crying and my bf trying to calm me down. They will stop for a while and then when they can hear I have calmed down they start again. It is torture. And there is no help. \n\nSadly the world is not build for sensitive people, we are just told to go live on a farm if we cannot stand the noise.", "Just some random thoughts from daily life with misophonia \n\u2022 Do not sit next to me do not sit next to me oh god oh please do not come sit next to me\n\n\u2022 JUST FINISH YOUR GODDAMN CHIPS ALREADY \n\n\u2022 I would rather listen to nails on chalkboard for 10 minutes than one of my trigger noises for 10 seconds \n\n\u2022 WEAR HEADPHONES, YOU INCONSIDERATE JERK (*and no, turning down the volume is not a helpful compromise at all*)\n\n\u2022 *Why are you whispering?* You can talk to me in a quieter normal voice instead of this weird, demonic hissing, you freak \n\n\u2022  MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP\n\n\u2022 \u2018S\u2019 is the absolute worst letter in the whole alphabet and that is a fact\n\n\u2022 Tissue for your issue?

I think you are spot on with the headphones. It is better if they are the ear buds that form inside your ear, not apple.\n\nOne technique I have been trying is every time a trigger comes, I try to push aside the instinct to run away and just breathe. If I am still annoyed afterward, at least I have tried. Might be something for you to consider, just to alleviate the fight-flight adrenaline.

I am currently having a panic attack because my roommate likes to sing. It is not that she has a bad voice, she actually has quite a lovely voice, but she does it *so often* that it is become a misophonia trigger for me. Especially when I am already stressed out, her singing causes me to freak out, my breath to quicken, and to cry and want to scream and hit or punch things. Singing is such a lovely part of life, and she is a big musical fan, so I do not want to quell it, but it is so hard to tune out unless I am blasting music through my headphones and giving myself a headache. I cannot bring myself to talk to her about it because even know I know she will understand even that will give me a panic attack. Any advice? Its okay for that to be straight up annoying, right? I have a bad habit of reciting the dialog from shows and movies and everyone tells me to stop because its obnoxious and I know they are right. \n\nLike humming and whistling. Its fucking annoying when someone does it all the time, misophonia or not. I would come at it like that. I have the same problem but it is with my dad &amp; a work colleague. My dad basically sings every single day, constantly for my entire life. I used to cover my ears with my hands, rock back and forth, then cry in my room cause I could not stand it. He is not a bad singer but I find it incredibly distressing and he has no idea. Even my Mum has to say 'stop singing!' as he does it so much.\n\nMy work colleague is a hummer, singer and a whistler and may be one of the most annoying human beings I have ever met. He is also technically higher up than me so I would not feel comfortable saying anything anyway. He is getting up to print something? Oh he *must* sing a song about going to the printer! *Da da da da da going to the printer da da da.* Absolutely infuriating! \ud83d\ude23\n\nI usually end up having to put earphones in and block it out. I love music but just people singing in front of me or singing over songs triggers it for me. It is more the fact that you are being *forced* to listen to it and cannot stop it or get away is the problem. I am sorry you have had to deal with this but honestly it is so relieving to know that I am not the only one. Any time I looked up misophonia triggers there would be humming and whistling but never just singing. I do not have the courage to bring it up to her so I feel your pain. I have been using earbuds when it really bothers me and I feel like that is the best option for sure. I think those are just the most common triggers rather than anything more specific, otherwise there would probably be an endless list of noises that could be a cause! It is only recently that I have developed a trigger for plate and cutlery scratching because my mother does an ungodly amount of it. I do not remember this being a problem before but somehow it is almost become worse than eating/mouth noises. You are definitely not alone and someone will likely feel the same way no matter the noise. Thank you, that makes me really relieved to hear. \ud83d\udc96 Yes. yes. thank you so much.

(side note, i get just as angry when i SEE someone biting their nails. it is like my brain still connects it with the sound even if i cannot hear it, but it is my biggest trigger of all time. anyone else??) \n\ni am across from the pool. at first i was like \"wow! this is great, almost like i am at a hotel! wonderful view!\".....wrong. the sound of kid's screaming at the top of their lungs 24/7 was awful, so i had to have my tv on at all times to keep myself sane. \n\npool's closed now, amazing time to be alive, BUT its still warm out. so my very musical-outdoorsy downstairs neighbors are still enjoying every evening of their life on their balcony SINGINGGGG their favorite songs at the top of their lungs!!!! like please buy a fucking house. i cannot wait for 30 degree weather so everyone goes tf inside \n\nbut the absolute worst....the footsteps upstairs. the first couple months here i do not think anyone lived there, so i remember thinking \"fuck yeah this is so awesome! peace and quiet!\" bc it was one of my concerns (but i did not want to carry my shit up an extra floor so i opted out, lesson learned-just hire movers to maintain sanity) now there are the heaviest fucking footed people living above me. i hear them when they wake up at the ass crack of dawn and their loud ass dog running around, i hear their fucking laundry machine, i hear the constant hulk stops all afternoon, i hear their shower, i hear it ALL. \n\nit has never been this extreme before, but i have also never been in this living environment before..pretty much 24/7. i think any sort of \"outside\" noise (basically noises that are not coming from my apartment) is what makes me fucking lose it. i am so irritable now and i cannot escape it. i have started keeping my headphones in all day but i also enjoy watching tv and the tv does not block out big foot unfortunately. i went from hating mouth noises to every single possible noise. if i am out in public or whatever these things do not bother me and then its usually just the mouth/fidgeting noises. but if i am home, whe everything has changed. anyone else in the same boat?\n\nok, rant over. it is really exhausting though and i really hate having to deal with this. it blows my mind that so many people are just completely unbothered by things like this. anyways, i have not been through many of the posts in here so this is prob asked a ton - but does anyone have any suggestions on how to minimize this? my airpods (older gen) are good, but i have to turn them up a lot to block everything out. aside from that, it is the hardest when watching tv and still having to hear the background noise, i am not sure if there is any possible way to help that.  \n\n\nany advice or \"i know how you feel\"'s are much appreciated. i am really glad to know i am not crazy :) Ugh, I feel you so hard on all if this.

For the past year and half I have been in online schooling and it has been super easy to avoid trigger noises but now that I am getting back into my normal life it has become 10x harder to cope when presented with a trigger. Whenever I heard something bothering me over these last few years I would normally just go to my room or put on headphones but now I cannot always do that when I am out and about. Now I just have to simply sit through it which I had done before this whole pandemic thing but it no longer feels the same it brings a new unbearable amount of stress. Like when I sit for dinner I cannot hardly even make eye contact with those around me eating because the thought of them chewing just fires me up. Was wondering if anyone else has felt the same way because I do not want to go back to sitting in my room but also I do not know how to deal with the stress. I wear a beanie that I can pull down and acts as a pair of blinders. My daughter is exhibiting signs of misophonia, and while certain noises always bothered her, I think it got worse partly due to the pandemic. She is 13, which apparently is when misophonia often manifests, and did virtual school last year. So she is adjusting to the new school year as well, including attending school in-person.\n\nFor meals, she is found a couple of things that work. One, of course, is that she goes into another room. Another is she wears noise-cancelling bluetooth headphones and listens to brown noise at the table. She says this drowns out the sounds &gt;!of chewing!&lt; that bother her, and we can still have a conversation, we just need to raise our voices a little.\n\nI learned there is a color spectrum of noise, including white, brown, pink, and purple. One of those might be better for you, so you could experiment.\n\nIs it possible for you to see a therapist/counselor? When I first took this to our pediatrician, they recommended seeing an ENT (who gave us a diagnosis of hyperacusis), who then recommended cognitive behavioral therapy. \n\nIt sounds like you still live at home, so I would say the first step is to talk to your parents, who I hope are understanding and can help you get to the doctor(s). If they are not helpful, I would suggest talking to a school nurse or counselor as the next step, or another adult that you trust will support you.\n\nGood luck. solid advice I am planning on getting therapy even though I am a bit skeptic I understand that, but do try to keep an open mind. Misophonia is tough -- it is not a fear, it is an involuntary reaction. But you know about it, and you know what triggers it, which I hope means you can start to exert some control over it. I do not know what the therapist might suggest for our daughter, but I am hoping they will give her some tips and tools.\n\nThere was a recent post on here about someone who had misophonia, and had seen a doctor about anxiety and/or depression. The doctor prescribed something like Dolazepam (sp?), and the poster said after a while they realized the misophonia had faded as well. It does seem to have some relation to anxiety. I do not know if you have anxiety or other issues, but if you do, perhaps you can mention them to a therapist and maybe whatever tools they give you for that would help with the misophonia.\n\nI know it is tough because there is so little out there.\n\nHere are a couple of links I found from a place called Misophonia International. Maybe they will help or at least provide more info for you.\n\n(\n\n( you have been very helpful thank you and best wishes to ur daughter", "does anyone else absolutely hate the sound of screaming and crying? like especially high pitched girly screams and squealing \ud83d\ude23 i absolutely hate it so so much but i feel like a hypocrite because i have made those sounds in the past.

One of the many reasons not to have kids i definitely get you. crowded buses with babies are my worst nightmare, catch me crying my eyes on one of them when babies cry i absolutely lose my mind omg. i also feel you with the hypocrite thing. one of my triggers is yelling and whenever i get triggered i yell too so my family does not take it seriously. as for concerts, if you have earplugs combined with the music the screaming is not really bad. if i was around that screaming in any other environment i would lose my mind but i have not had an issue with concerts. you could get nosebleed seats so that if you need to you could step out! i think it would be worth it to try at least once I feel you, I hate the sound of my own screaming and crying when I get frustrated. \n\nI am also a kpop fan and tend to avoid concerts in general because of the crowds/noise, but the constant screaming at kpop concerts specifically seems like a nightmare. I feel bad for the performers when I watch stages without an audience bc of COVID, but I prefer not hearing cheering/screaming drown out the song tbh same, sometimes watching fancams can be scary because its like russian roulette if i might here a scream thank you!! i am Autistic and i have had meltdowns in the....not so distant past which i am certainly not proud of absolutely i feel that, i have adhd (i suspect i might be on the spectrum but that is something to figure out later lol) and i have breakdowns over little things all the time and it is really frustrating. just remember it is not anything to be ashamed of even though it feels embarrassing. we are wired a little bit differently and sometimes it does not make sense but that is ok! we can still find ways to have just as good of a time as anyone else :) &lt;3", "A girl can dream, cannot she?

For some reason, at the nail salon, maybe because I am prepared and I understand the reasoning, and it seems \"clean\" there, it does not bother me as much- but it is pretty much banned in my house (I clip my nails, my husband's and my son's by request.)\n\nSo last night, I am at the BOWLING ALLEY of all places, and this guy, two lanes over (it is pretty empty- no one was between our lanes)- just whips out nail clippers and starts clipping his nails STANDING AT THE BALL RETURN- letting them just fly and land wherever- I was INSANELY enraged. \n\nNormally, I try to pretend that I am normal. If someone is whistling - I sure as hell do not flip out on them, and if I cannot help but react, Ill attribute it to a \"migraine coming on\" or something someone might relate to and understand. \n\nBut there was no pretending on this one- my hands FLEW to cover my ears,my husband looked at me funny, my eyes darted with panic towards the cause, and he immediately saw it too. \n\nHe was just standing there; -Noise - NOISE-  noise-\n\nAnd I could not help it; out loud (plenty loud enough to be heard over the ball returns and music) I shouted \"Ew! Who the FUCK does that in public- what are they- animals?!\" \n\nAnd while he continued to laugh with his wife and clip his nails, standing right there, I got more and more irate (and louder). I am practically shouting at this point, and I am like \"WHO THE FUCK THINKS THAT IS OKAY? WHO FUCKING CLIPS THIER NAILS IN A PUBLIC PLACE?! WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH HIM?!\"\n\nWell, apparently he finally heard me. Because he QUICKLY stopped, gathered his wife and teenager daughter - and they left.\n\n And I celebrated. \n\nI am sorry...I know this sound thing is my problem; but grooming yourself IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DO IN A PUBLIC SPACE. \n\nI really do not care that I clearly freaked them out. People need to be called out on thier disgusting behavior; period!!! \n\nMaybe if more of us made our problems known by shaming these gross people, we could shame the nasty open-mouthed chewing, talking-while-eating, clipping-nails-on-a-plane kind of foul people into STOPPING! I applaud you. Oh man. I wish I had that sort of guts. I would love to tell my coworkers how nasty they are. Good for you. You are the Dog, they are the Rat, the Dog does not need courage to eat the Rat. You do not need courage to call rude people out, you have the courage already. \n\nBut you should practice this to keep your anger in check. You do not always need to shame them, quite often a stern and polite reminder should be enough. Quite often it will not be. But it will be a much more pleasant experience for you.\n\nBe strong! Ask for help! Hugs. For real. It is a blessing and a curse to never be afraid to speak your mind. It apparently came as default setting with my red hair.... \n\nHave not figured out how to shut it off. ;-) Honestly, even if misophonia was not a thing, clipping your toenails in a bowling alley is just *FUCKING DISGUSTING*. People clipping their nails in public anywhere is just absolutely horrid! Cannot even begin to agree enough!", "Dreading being around family during the holidays... I have a young relative who has picked up a throat clearing/cough tic and it is very frequent. Like she will do a little cough noise in between sentences or she clears her throat loudly before talking then does it every two seconds, all day long. When it is quiet she does it too and it is all I can focus on. Apparently she has had tics before and it is a nervous habit done out of anxiety. No one else seems to have a problem with it and I know she cannot help it so I do not say anything, of course. But it really really triggers my misophonia to the point I do not even want to be around her. \n\nI am going be at their house twice for Christmas next week and I am dreading having to listen to her cough all day. It is so frequent it makes me want to crawl out of my skin. She always wants to play with me and follows me around the house and I do not think I will be able to handle it. I feel horrible for feeling this way. I hate this condition and what it has done to me. I would cut off my arm if I could be freed from this so I can be with my family and not feel panic and annoyance just because they cough. \n\nNot really looking for advice as I will be donning my earplugs and headphones as always, but just needed to vent. I have no one who I can talk to about this without being judged and misunderstood.", "So... I just found out i have misophonia and have no idea of how to tell this to my parents Warning: I am going to give lots of details in this story (some are in respect of me, some in respect of the condition). And English is not my first language, so sorry if I misspelled something or said something that did not make much sense.\n\nA few days ago i was searching about \u201cwhy do people eat with their mouth open\u201d since i live with my mom and stepdad (which I am used to call \u201cuncle\u201d for no real reason, so if i say uncle here you know who I am talking about) and he makes lots of annoying (aka hell-made) noises when eating. In the first article it was talking about misophonia, I read it, and went searching for it. I saw the characteristics of the condition, which matched exact with what i have. I also took a test which gave the results I expected.\n\nSome minutes later i told some friends in my discord group (which I am not promoting here) about it, but they did not help much (except the fact that I am very insecure of everything and everything I want to say is kept locked inside me until I find an opportunity to let it out, so I feel very well when venting). I told my cousin (I was traveling by car, so when we stopped to eat i told him), but it was the same thing: it did not help much.\n\nNow let us get to the real point - even though I told my friends and cousin about it, I could not have the chance of asking for this kind of help because it would feel kind of weird. So I preferred asking it on Reddit because i feel less weird about it. So. How can i talk to my parents about this? I feel like they will not react well to this, since every time i told my uncle to shut up (from \u201cplease stop making so much noise, I do not like it\u201d to \u201cshut the **** up, I cannot even eat in peace\u201d) they both (mom and uncle) did not react well. \n\nThey are also not very tolerant people (they are a bit homophobic, and sometimes even racist) (and they act like depression, phobias and this kind of stuff is just stupidity) (thanks god I am not like this), so that makes me feel like they will not handle with it the way they should. (Btw they are also a bit close-minded and they are to a certain level karens) (and I am not that old to feel safe confronting them )\n\nSo... Can you help me finding a way to tell them this? Hi... I am going to think about this and come back, but I wanted to tell you I am proud of you. You seem like an intelligent, well-spoken, level-headed person, and although I could tell you were young I was suprised at the end to see you are only 13. This is a big deal, and by coming to others first to gather feedback on the best approach before you make a move, you are showing remarkable maturity. \ud83d\udc9c This might help the discussion, good luck!\n\nLetter to Friends, Family, and Co-workers:\n\n Thanks! This might help a lot.  Sorry, your post has been removed as your account is under 10 days old.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/misophoniasupport) if you have any questions or concerns.*  Thanks! So... I am going to put this the way I wish I would done it when I was 13 (a million years ago!).   \n  \nOnly you can know what they will respond well to, but this is how I think I would do it if I could go back in time.  \n  \nLet them know you need to talk to them about something important and ask them when would be a good time for them to sit and talk. Be ready in case they say \"now\", but also be ok with it if they ask to wait a bit. You want to have their full attention, so if they are busy with something else it will not be a good time.   \n   \nDo not be afraid to write everything down in advance and just read it to them when it is time - it would help you to make sure you say everything the way you want to.  \n  \nThen I would say something like this:  \n\nMom and uncle, I want to tell you about something that I have been going through. It is been really hard on me and I have been dealing with it by myself, so I want to ask you to just listen to all of this first and then we can talk and ask questions after. Please take me seriously.   \n  \nSo, I have discovered that there is a neurological disorder that makes a person very sensitive to certain sounds. It is called misophonia. I have read all about it, and everything I have read sounds very much like what I have been experiencing and struggling with for a long time.  \n  \nIt causes certain sounds to trigger a very anxious and even sometimes painful response in the person. You know how sometimes when you   I will start saying . Well, that is because the wiring in my brain is actually causing a really awful experience for me when I hear that sound , and I honestly cannot help my reaction. \n\n**** **At this point you can use some of the paragraphs from the \"Letter to friends\" that someone else linked to, to help explain what misophonia is.**\n\nThen...  \n  \nI know you may not believe me or you may think I just read something stupid online, but let me ask you this... you know how much I struggle with certain sounds. I am telling you straight out that it causes me emotional and physical pain, and now I am showing you research that shows it is a real neurological disorder and other people suffer from it - I am not the only one. Do you really think I would be making up something like this or asking  you to stop your noises all the time just to be annoying? I promise you I am not. I am in pain. I know it is been hard on you too and that it must have always seemed like I was just being so annoying and picky, but in reality I am suffering and I am asking you for help.  \n  \nThis disorder was only identified about 15 or 20 years ago and they have come a long way but there still are not many doctors that are familiar with it. I have read other people's experiences where they have had to search for a while to find the right kind of help.  \n  \nBut mostly it seems to be something you just have to learn how to cope with. Some people wear earplugs all the time, some people have to remove themselves from the situations that trigger them, and that sort of thing. But the biggest and most important piece that helps bring some relief is if the people they are closest to believe them and try to understand.  \n   \nIt is been really hard for me to talk to you about this and I was really scared that you might not believe me. All I want is for you to understand and to be on my side while we try to figure this out together. I love you. Will you help me?  \n  \n(Your parents may be crying by this point so go give them a big hug!) \n  \nGood luck and please let me know how it goes. \ud83d\udc9c\n   \n  \nEdit: words Whoa. I have no words to describe what I am feeling (i simply stared at this for some 15 minutes trying to understand what I am feeling )\nI will try to tell them the fastest I can (considering everything it is probably going to take some time), but I will sure let you know.\nSeriously, if i had that reddit money (I am noob on Reddit so l do not know the name lol) i would give you a golden award right now.\n\nThanks so much! It is my pleasure. When I was your age Misophonia was not a recognized thing yet. Google was not even a thing yet. I had no idea why I reacted this way, and it caused a lot of problems with my parents. As I got older and finally understood it (in my 30s), I had to have these conversations with my parents. Eventually they understood, and they felt horrible for not understanding or helping me when I was young (not their fault). My dad is full of guilt because he used to do the noises *even more* because he would get so annolyed with me. I do not want you to go through what I did. I hope this helps. You are not alone.  \n   \nAnd really, I think printing it out and reading it to them (with your own edits) is a good idea... it will help you get through it.   \n   \nYou can do this. It may not go perfectly, and that is ok. Unless they are really assholes, talking is better than not talking and things will start to get better.  \n   \nAnd do not rush it... whether it takes a day or a week or a month. You will know when the time is right.   \n  \nI will be thinking of you and wishing you luck.", "Misophonia mockery Know what I almost hate more than the sounds themselves? The *reactions* other people have to misophonia. \n\nToday I had dinner with my family, was not in possession of earplugs or noise-cancelling gadgetry. The meal was *soup*. For me, one of the absolute worst meals from an audio point of view. I tried to play it cool, but could not last more than 30 seconds. So I semi-dramatically went to get my regular earphones, came back to the table, put them on, hit on some white noise -- *bliss*.\n\nBut then what ensued really reminded me that the troubles of this neurological condition are not restricted to the triggers, but also this moronic attitude people take when you are trying to show/explain what you are going through.\n\nImmediately, it was:\n\n\"Ooh my god check this out, *earphones?* How are you in your twenties yet still this childish?\". I tell them (for the billionth time) this is a legitimate problem. Answer \"oh well there is a problem for *everything* these days\". I say there are literally *support groups* for people with misophonia precisely because of *your* attitudes. \"Anyone can create a support group for any reason, grow up. What will your *partner* think when you find one??\". \n\nAnd then just a series of them saying my name and pretending to talk about me as an \"ha- ha- ha- you cannot hear us\" reel. Wanted to explode. That sounds torturous! The ridicule &amp; gaslighting, if not straight up bullying is exacerbated by misophonia not being officially recognised as a disorder. It would make it so much more bearable if otherwise, it would shut SOME loud mouths too (no bun intended). I am angry just imagining this. I am so sorry you have to go through that crap. Mocking/invalidating someone is quite possibly the worst way to react when they show some sort of mental health problem, holy shit. My rule is \"Even if you do not understand what they are going through, at least try to show sympathy\". \n\nI do agree that the attitude some people give you when trying to explain why you cannot stand to listen to certain sounds can be *very* frustrating - while my family is mostly of the more accidentally insensitive variety, they do not often try too hard to control the noises they make that are seriously troublesome for me. They have occasionally tried to use it against me before, unfortunately - I remember mentioning I hated the sound of gum-chewing once, only for one of my family members to start making exaggerated chewing noises. \n\nPeople like that are the reason I really try hard to hold it together whenever I come across those sounds. I have become a target of mockery for having averse reactions to things people have done to me before, and I do not want it happening again... unfortunately, I nearly lost it this past Friday, when someone sitting right behind me in class was chewing gum at the loudest possible volume for pretty much the whole period. Just leaving a bucket of empathy and support here for you.... \ud83d\udc9c I feel for you, thankfully my family is supportive of my condition. I empathize and feel the anger you were feeling though, many of my friends have said very similar things. I am not completely sure how Reddit works and I have never talked to anyone else with misophonia, but if you ever need to talk with someone about it, I would love to. I agree so much. Exactly!! And it is why I initially thought, come on, I can do this, I can survive this dinner without the help of plugs or buds, because otherwise I am just going to get attacked\u2026 and sometimes, you just cannot regardless of how hard you try. \ud83d\udc9a Thank you :) Thanks :) will let you know I would just say I had a headache and retire to the sanctuary of my room. This is why I would keep snacks in my room when I was younger. Clearly these people do not care to understand what you are going through. Do what you have to do to take care of you, no apologies. Sorry you have to deal with unsympathetic people. Man, it really seems like a lot of people's families are really antagonistic about miso.  And for this to be your *family* doing this to you... wow... I would have hoped that they, of all people, would try to understand...", "Thanksgiving? :( I am really stressing out about Thursday. I am not doing a big thing, but getting together with my immediate family and grandparents. \n\nMy grandparents are horrible chewers. They talk with food in their mouth, chew sooo loudly, and then they always scrape their silverware and it is just... ugh. I feel horrible for even thinking this, but there is a possibility my Grandpa might have to go to the hospital and be there during Thanksgiving, and part of me is almost wishing for that so I do not have to deal with this? Which is absolutely horrible and self-centered, I know, and I do not actually want him to be sick at all - I just do not want to have to listen to the noises. \n\nAnyways. How do you all cope with Thanksgiving? It is not really something I can avoid and I would feel extremely guilty about it, but my relatives are not always the most understanding when it comes to this stuff. Thank you! :) Headphones and lots of trips to the \u201cbathroom\u201d and \u201cwalks\u201d with my sisters \ud83d\ude02 Unfortunately headphones are not an option bc they would be considered rude. \n\nBut yeah, I will probably be taking a lot of \"bathroom\" trips too \ud83d\ude05 I wear foam earplugs and my family uses paper plates with wooden utensils Paper plates is a great idea! Im not sure if I could get by with the plastic utensils but I could definitely get my mom to come up with a good excuse for the plates since I know they have some already. \n\nThank you :) I meditate before any big holiday meal like that to calm myself down. I also sit by the person I like the most and try to stay engaged in conversation to distract myself. It is not a perfect system but it can make a tough situation better. And if all else fail, lots of trips to the \u201cbathroom\u201d it is. I know where you are coming from and it is hard. My grandmother\u2019s teeth used to squeak when she ate. But now all these years later without her, I would give anything to have another meal with her. \n\nGive yourself a good talking to before. Get up and fiddle in the kitchen when needed. Stay engaged in conversation to distract yourself. And try as hard as you can to remain grateful that you have your family.   \n\nI have 10 open mouth chewers coming for Thanksgiving. They are my husband\u2019s family so my mental focus will be how happy he is to be with his family for Thanksgiving while giving myself breaks as needed. Thank you! Those are good suggestions - I have never thought about meditating before so I may try that out. Thank you for being so understanding and not shaming me &lt;3\n\nI am always grateful that I have my family, even when these things stress me out. I am going to try my best to appreciate the time that I have left with my grandparents for sure. It will be hard but I know that it means a lot to them :) \n\nYikes - Sending you positive vibes as well! And sending those positive vibes right back at you! Gratitude and kindness will always help you to overcome anything that comes your way. trips to the bathroom I wish you lots of luck with this. I hope your Grandfather does not have to go to the hospital, too. \n\nIf headphones are rude, could you try something like bluetooth earbuds? My daughter has misophonia and at meals, either eats in another room or puts on noise-canceling headphones and listens to brown noise, which she says drowns out the noises she hates. I wonder if you might get similar relief with earbuds -- they would be smaller and not as obvious, and so long as we speak up, we can still have pretty normal conversations at the table.\n\nShe is bothered by similar sounds as you, and one thing I did was buy wheat straw plates, bowls, cups and utensils. You probably do not have time to get them before the holiday, so I' definitely encourage the use of paper plates and plastic utensils -- emphasize the easy cleanup aspect! When we have had Thanksgiving with my SIL, she usually does just this.\n\nGood luck.\n\nAlso, ( I thought it might help. I have seen other people on the subreddit suggest meditation, and it seems like a good idea.\n\nAnd this might be a long shot, but can you tell/have you told your grandparents about this? Not to say, hey, your eating bothers me, but to be more general: \"These sounds bother me, and I have found that X helps, so if I do not respond right away, it does not mean I am not hearing you., etc.\" That sort of thing. But if you think it would be received poorly, do not set yourself up for a fall. I just had a full on break down because I am pre stressed about Thanksgiving and having to eat with my family. I do not think it is selfish to not want to have to feel the way we do when we are triggered, and like you said it is not that you actually want anything bad to happen to anyone else, just a reprieve. \nI unfortunately do not have any advice but hopefully you know you are not alone in this and are supported. Eat at a table far far away with headphones, my mom's entire side of the family (including her and my brothers, also their in-laws) chew like fucking pigs.

I saw a post asking for a miso support group.\nI made a discord server, everybody is welcome!

However the last one was a woman and she was literally smacking her lips SO LOUD literally every 5-10 seconds for the entire 15 minutes. Like these smacks were AGGRESSIVELY loud. I am sorry I am literally so heated about it, it was pissing me off so much I literally wanted to scream the whole time. I left the lecture when there was like 2 minutes left cause I just could not take it anymore. WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS? CANNOT YOU HEAR YOURSELF? SURELY EVEN NORMAL PEOPLE FIND THIS A BIT ANNOYING? Okay rant over. So you probably heard it around 112 times in about 13 minutes, hats off to you I would not have lasted 1 min in.. This happened to me yesterday but for one hour. Why is it always women that smack her lips so loudly and consistently while talking? No gender hate or anything, but I have wondered for years, they do that way more. You got some downvotes, but as a woman I agree. I find it is usually women. Maybe it is cause of lip gloss? No idea lol.\n\nAlthough I did have a male professor right before her who was doing it a bit too. Was not as drastic, as loud, or as much though. Him being right before her probably made her even more annoying too lol. That is odd, in my experiences I have heard more men do it. I feel your pain, my English teacher last year would smack his lips after every single word he spoke. I almost dropped the class. At my youngest brother's high school graduation, his favorite teacher gave a 20 minute speech where he smacked his lips before LITERALLY. EVERY. SENTENCE. 2 years prior when my sister had graduated, her boyfriend who knew better came up before the ceremony started and smacked his gum as loudly as he could, forcing me to sit super far in the back away from my family. Before he showed up, a Karen several rows back managed to be so fucking loud with hers that I was ready to kill myself there and then. In a way, the piece of shit boyfriend had actually given me an out by pushing me over the edge.\n\nAfter the graduation my sister found out what he did, and also that he has cheated on her for the 9th time, so she ended things permanently. He still stalks her online to this day, pretending he is a victim or something, and earlier this year  he \"tried getting over it\" by beating up a drunk kid at a party, forcing him to leave, and trying to fuck a 14 year old. (He is at least 20 at the time) I had a professor last semester that did some kind of horrific tongue click/lip smack hybrid after every 5th word or so. It was fucking AWFUL. I could not listen to the lectures at all, so that class was a rough time Yeah I have no idea... But for example, I listen to a podcast where one guy has huge lips, but there is no lipsmack at all. Come to think of it, maybe it does not even have to do with the lips because a lot of people do it like full-mouth which is extremely disgusting. Once upon a time I tried to meditate. Watched some videos of known experts. One was an author whose books resonated with me, but he was a lip smacker. I absolutely could not listen to him. K. Griffin. Avoid him. God that is awful. Reminds me of a class or two in college (and MANY in high school) where I sat close to loud gum chewers. I barely remember anything I learned in those classes because I was too distracted and infuriated. I wonder the same thing: are these people not self aware?? How is anyone else not slightly annoyed by it at least? I praised any teacher who had gum bans for their classroom.\n\nOh and it just seems rude and unprofessional for a teacher of all people to chew gum during a lecture! Hello, you are supposed to be teaching!!!! Women tend to smack loudly at a higher pitch while men tend to make more disgusting internal mouth noises. However, some of the worst loud smackers I have dealt with in recent memory were men. I have recognized the generalization, but it is def not 100% of men-do-this or all women-do-that. I had an instructor that said \"go ahead and...\" before every single instruction. Go ahead and open your books.. go ahead and take the online test. One time she said \"go ahead and go ahead and..\" and my head almost exploded. Did not really trigger me like other things it was just kind of dumb. One thing I DID hate was people walking by in horseshoes or clogs.. well, just regular ladies shoes that apparently have giant blocks of wood for heels.

Sorry but those are the two noises I cannot handle.\" - u/princesspussypie\n\n(\n\nLetter to Friends, Family, and Co-workers:\n\n( I am 21 this man looks as though he is in his late 40\u2019s, I feel as though it would be incredibly rude to turn around and say \u201cplease stop yawning\u201d especially considering the age gap. &gt; I am 21 this man looks as though he is in his late 40\u2019s, I feel as though it would be incredibly rude to turn around and say \u201cplease stop yawning\u201d especially considering the age gap.\n\nIt is not incredibly rude to ask, not even slightly out of line to ask, and even if it was rude to ask, why should you even care? It still is not as rude as yawning, especially for anyone over the age of 8.\n\nIt is probably one of these scenarios:\n\nHe is unaware that his behavior is unacceptable or even noticed by anyone and he would be happy to oblige. If this is the case, then you get your help and some respect and maybe a new friend.\n\nOr he is could care less that his behavior is unacceptable or even noticed by anyone and he would be a complete asshole and do it even worse. In this case you know he is the Rat and does not deserve your respect.\n\nWork on your script. Maybe 'please stop yawning' is not enough, maybe 'can I share something with you? I have this thing that is out of my control, and your yawning is very distracting, could you please control it better?\"\n\nPut yourself first. Why is your suffering acceptable and his is not? If you were asthmatic and he was a smoker, would you go hide? You would likely let him know that he can help you, that he is ABLE to RESPOND with help, that he has a RESPONSIBILITY to help you.\n\nYou are worth it, there are people that want to help (sure not all of them) but you will not get help if you do not ask for it or demand it.", "Has misophonia impacted your relationships and if so, how? For me, it impacted my ability to sleep with my current and previous partners. Luckily, I have found an eye mask that is Bluetooth and has speakers near the ears (speakers can kind of be moved around as needed) that I wear, along with ear plugs. But that is the only way I can sleep with my partner and it is not as comfortable as going without the mask and earplugs but I would not change waking up next to him for the world.\n\nI also have a huge issue, like many people do, with chewing or eating in general. Even if a person is not smacking their lips, I can naturally still hear them chewing and food sloshing around the inside of their mouth and it disgusts and enrages me. Of course this is so hypocritcal because I am not always a quiet eater and also naturally... humans just...make sound lol. But this impacts my ability to happily share meals with my loved ones. Instead, I am left angry and disgusted or someone is left too embarrassed or ashamed of their eating sounds to even eat near me which in turn makes me feel awful.\n\nAlso other people\u2019s breathing has always been something that triggers me when I am trying to sleep but now it is beginning to bother me outside of sleeping. Like if someone starts breathing differently after they have eaten or something\n\nI have noticed my triggers expanding though. Footsteps bother me now - or anything I consider stomping.\n\nIt is so hard not to say anything and while I feel like I am getting better at keeping my mouth shut about all these sounds, I find myself staring in anger and people that know me well know what the stare means and it is not effective to stop vocally reacting if I cant stop reacting all together. \n\nAnyway my point is, I am a pretty overly critical person in general and misophonia does not make it easier to be less critical towards the people I love because I get upset when they chew or breathe or walk - aka perform natural and necessary human behaviors and I feel like this is ruining my life and one of the many contributors towards my struggle with every single interpersonal relationship I have ever had. My bf dumped me today so there is that tw: sui.\n\n**TLDR** : basically, it is made me into a miserable, suicidal asshole and it has made my parents into a guilt-tripping, ignorant \"united front\" (as they like to call themselves)\n\nmy parents say they understand and care, i tell them to not take it personally, but they are still emotionally abusive towards me because of it. it has affected my mood which has put me in a depressed state (not diagnosed depression, just the feeling of being depressed) for about a month or so then i go back to normal. \n\ni am currently discussing with my psychologist if there is a possibility of bipolar 2 because the depressed state comes and goes, after it i am all motivated, start all these tasks and goals, go through with them, my parents are cool with me and there is drama. then i get into that existential, self loathing mood for a month or more and my parents are yelling at me for not doing shit with myself, how i am disrespectful and scaring everyone, which is false by the way, i may come off as disrespectful because of my reactions to triggers and usually when she tells me i am scaring everyone is when she is screaming and i am crying, with *her* telling *me* i am scaring my younger sisters while she is screaming like a fucking madman. it is mainly my mum with the gaslighting and manipulating. \n\nso yeah, that is that It affects every relationship. And affects whether relationships even start in the first place for me.\n\nMy first misophonic response was when I was about 4 years old. I am 38. I learned about the term misophonia 2 years ago. My parents never supported me or even admitted the way I experience sound was real. My relationship with them was mostly emotional neglect related to misophonia but also they treated me like every criticism or complaint I had was invalid. They labeled me a malingerer because of misophonia. I stopped talking to them 6 years ago.\n\nDue to anxiety from misophonia I found it hard to make friends. Socializing is very difficult obviously. I leave the room a lot. I have only had one partner, my wife. She is supportive and understanding but miso makes problems there also. We sleep in separate rooms a lot. I wear earplugs at night and still do not get much sleep. I am trying to be better at this part but I still feel somewhat trapped in my marriage because of misophonia. My wife is by far the most understanding of miso person I have ever met(not that I have tried hard to find someone else) and I am scared of not having that understanding around me.\n\nHaving misophonia makes relationships nigh on impossible. That is the part of this that I think about the most and causes me the most problems. Yes, makes me not want to be around people that I love because of the things they do that trigger me. I find it to be more than sounds though. It is more a bout habitual movements that people do. For example\u2026 A person who is constantly adjusting their selves, a person who has a habit of flipping their hair in a certain way, a persons posture. I wish I knew how to overcome this.", "break down over coughing sound hello, i really need some advice about a problem i have: \n\nright now my country is in quarantine so its means everyone is home and i am learning trough zoom (16.5f) someone in my house is really coughing every around 3! minutes without stopping a very loud coughing sound which drives my insane! its without stopping litreally for hours! now even with closed door and headphones i still hear it which really makes me get breakdowns because i cant understand and hear the teachers which makes me really end every school day with me crying and punching my bed or wall and just silent scream. i cant talk to the person who does that and i really just dont know what to do, do someone exprienced same thing as me? and how did they got over it? i really cant ignore it. i am trying but my mind just does not let me.  any advice on how to make myself ignore it will help thank you very much everyone :) /u/Perdita_Starr, I have found an error in your post:\n\n &gt; \u201c~~its~~  without stopping\u201d\n\nI recommend that Perdita_Starr write \u201c~~its~~  without stopping\u201d instead. \u2018Its\u2019 is possessive; \u2018it is\u2019 means \u2018it is\u2019 or \u2018it has\u2019.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!) &gt;it is\n\nfixed it :) fuck you you useless bot lol dont be angry it is okay, i fixed it maybe it can bother pepole! hahahaa i got mad because i know how frustrating it is to have someone correct your grammar when you are talking about something serious! It did annoyed me because when i wrote it i was in one of my breakdowns and was really desperate for advice i understand you hahaha!!! but i dont know if grammar on this is very important so i prefered to fix it to not get into trouble friend!! hahaha yes understandable! Also I just want to let you know that your feelings regarding the coughing sound are valid. It is not your fault that you feel this way so do not blame yourself whatsoever and do not take it out on your self. I have been through what you have been through too. I do not know if the headphones you use are noise cancelling, but I suggest you invest in some noise cancelling headphones or earphones. They are very effective in blurring out external sounds. I also suggest you listen to \u201cwhite noise\u201d on youtube!  You can do this while you study. However when you are attending your zoom sessions, all you can do is try to close all doors between you and the person coughing, or maybe you can tell them to sit somewhere further?  It is extremely hard to ignore the sounds, I know. Try to stay patient, and understand that coughing is out of the person\u2019s control. Better said than done I know. I hope it gets better soon. If you ever need to rant or talk, I am here! actually it helps alot, you really sweet and you helped me alot!! to know i am not alone in this really gives me hope, i really thinking about buying  noise cancelling headphones and i will do it asap!! and the white noise really calms me down, its like sitting alone! i am drawing rn for my homework with this on and for once i can actually hear my mind and just calm down! bless your soul for talking to me thank you so much! you dont even realize how much it can help and calm down! I am so glad to hear I have helped! Have a good day and always remember this reddit community has tons of people like you. You are never alone! &lt;3 I feel you! My mum has an annoying cough and she is constantly clearing her throat. It annoys me most when I try to sleep as her room is next to mine, and we have very thin walls. I bought some sleep headphones from Amazon for about \u00a316/\u00a317 and they are so good! I listen to music and fall asleep not hearing any other sounds. I think for in the day when you cannot have the music as loud whilst you are concentrating, I would invest in some noise cancelling headphones, people rave about them on here! The reason I have not yet is because in the day my mum is downstairs and I am upstairs and the cough does not get to me as much, plus she is further away so it is quieter to block out with normal headphones. I hope you find some peace! And if there is any way you could ask the person or explain to them that might be good. But I completely understand if there is not a way. My mum got angry when I asked her to stop lol but oh well we just got to find ways around this! Good luck :) Why cannot you say \"please stop coughing, I am in a class and it is disturbing my studies, the teacher, and the other students. They have asked me to see if I can help.\"?\n\nAnyone who does that consistently is a Rat. I do that, I cough and I am not aware of it. My loved ones make me aware that I am doing it and that I am the Rat. They ask me to be aware of it and to try to control it.\n\nYou are the Dog. Eat the Rat. There is no reason at all that anyone should tolerate that at all, regardless of the miso. Approach this with the miso removed, and just as a conversation requesting normal consideration of others. &gt;some peace! And if there is any way you could ask the person or explain to them that might be good\n\nthank you so much for the advice friend! i really need to buy some headphones that are noise blocking, my house is more of apartment so everything is so close to eachother with thin walls so its hard! everyhting can be heard, i tried to talk to the person too but just as you said it dosent end well and ending up being angry! its sucks that pepole cant understand that! i will buy the headphones asap! thank you again for the advice stay safe my friend thank you for the advice friend, asking the person cant help cause there is nothing that make the person listen so its just ending up blaming me or being angry, which i cant take stuff like that, i think the hard part is thinking that misophonia is just in my head and i am trying to find things to get annoyed with, which in reality is just a lot of suffer which i would give my whole arm to just not have! thank you anyway for the advice! and thank you for understanding me! stay safe friend! No worries! You too \u2764\ufe0f Had the same problem when I was 18 with my father. I talked to him many times and he just would not give a fuck. The difference is back then it was 2012 and there was no quarantine. You are a hero for trying to keep up with school in that environment. Today I got the xm4's by Sony. I do not know if they block coughing since I have moved out but with music on I cannot hear my neighbor's dog anymore. If your budget is low you can also look at 450bt by Sennheiser or some earbuds (they have lower battery life and worse anc though). Also depending on that person's character you should either a) try to talk to him/her or b)guilt trip him/her that your class can hear him/her and that they are complaining about the noise. If none of that works you can use earplugs with your headphones on top during classes. Also if your house has a balcony or something similar you could watch your classes there. I hope any of these helps. Never give up \\m/ &gt;trip her that your class can hear her and that they are complaining about the noise. If none of that works\n\nfirst of all friend thank you so much for the support! you cant realize how much power it gives me, sadly for me i cant talk to the person who does it its not a opition and second i live in a small apartment which means all rooms are very very close to eachother and the walls are thins so even the smallest sounds are being heard. i am with earbuds actually but the problem is when they lose their battery life and need charge or when i am in class and there is no music only teacher talking so i can hear the cough loud enough to make my triggers start, i have to say its been 8 hours since i posted it and the person is still doing it! even if its january i am with a very loud fan on to try and make the noise smaller. i do need a  noise canceling headphones asap tho!! its sounds like a dream come true that will make my suffer go away, cause i really am in low place with a lot of inside anger because of that thing, which usually i am very calm person. thank you so much friend for the help i will look at the headphones!! bless your heart and stay safe &lt;3 Keep asking for help. You are worth it. How do you expect someone who is ill or has allergies to just \"stop coughing\"? \n\nI am seriously asking. This is not a person tapping their foot or clicking a pen. The person is COUGHING- A natural human reflex that cannot be 'stopped' simply because you are asked to do so. \n\nSeriously. That is like saying I should demand that my husband stop snoring. Sure, dude. Let me get right on that. Sure, someone who is ill cannot help it. But are they ill? Or is this just a nasty habit? Have they tried to muffle it or are they just honking it out with absolutely no regard for the people around them? Have they taken their medicine, seen a doctor, are they even aware that they are doing it? Or are they just being rude? Can they show any manners at all?\n\nIn other words, do they have the ability to respond with help? Have they even ever been asked for help?\n\nAsk for help. If they have the ability to respond with help, then they have a responsibility to help. Ask for help. Demand help. You are worth it. Do not accept no unless you know that they cannot offer  a yes.\n\nAnd of course your husband can can stop snoring. He can see a doctor, he can get a CPAP, he can get surgery for that deviated septum. He is actually able to respond with help. Have you asked him to stop snoring? Ask him to stop snoring. He has a responsibility to help. His health is in as much danger as your health is from it, apnea is a serious disorder. r/CPAP Lol. K dude. Glad you are fully aware of my husband's medical history, that is so amazing how you just guess and yet act like you TOTALLY know everything. Seriously impressive. Have you asked him for help? If not, I assume because you know he cannot help. If so, why would not you ask someone who coughs for their help? I feel your pain, that must be so difficult right now.\nIt sounds like the person coughing is unaware of what misophonia actually is. Maybe if they heard this  they could show a little more compassion? Is there possibly someone else in the household you could talk to and that could back you up to communicate with the person coughing?\nI have been in similar situation and the best solution for me was to live somewhere else. I know that that is obviously not always an option but I would consider asking relatives or friends if you could visit them for a while if you are already doing all classes remotely.\nHope that is an option for you too otherwise headphones and earplugs are a godsend !! \ud83d\ude4f thank you so so so much friend!!  i am reading the article right now and even for me its helps more! i really had hard time understanding what i have, i will show this to other person in the house! maybe it can help them to understand what i have is not my fault and i really do suffer, thank you so much again friend stay safe god bless! TOTALLY RELATE. my mom and my sister both smoke weed in my house day in and day out and cough like fucking animals all day long. it is literally the most infuriating shit ever. and it is frustrating because it is like, why do I have to live with the loud TV and white noise and ear plugs instead of being able to exist in peace? it is so fucking annoying.", "Potentially going to be homeless. So basically I have to get a job or move out of my parents house. I understand why, but every job I have ever had has been sensory hell except for the first store I worked at which closed down. My aunt offered me work in another city where my grandma lives so I am living there with my grandma for now.\n\nMy grandma makes so many triggering noises that I cannot function half the time. The only reason I am even able to write this is because I managed to get away from her for a few minutes. \n\nSometimes she comes and works at the warehouse with me since I am usually there alone. I mostly just move boxes around or sweep, nothing too physically demanding. While she is there she clanks things around and sniffles a lot. I have talked to her about this quite a few times and she just says that she forgets. \n\nI am at my breaking point. I cannot live like this but I also have nowhere to go. I do not want to die at a young age but I also do not want to deal with this shit for sixty more years. I will probably die on the streets but it would be better than hearing one more triggering sound. Brown noise really helps me drown out certain sounds. Maybe use headphones. I play it all day from my Alexa device. OK, first things first-- do you have any headphones or earplugs you can wear to help you cope with grandma while you are living with her?\n\nSecondly, this crappy situation wont be forever. Start looking at jobs that you feel you can handle. What are your triggers? Can you handle loud machine noises, maybe you can find an assembly line job where you can wear big heavy duty headphones all day. That will block out the majority of human noises.\n\nHave you thought about maybe going to a school or learning a trade that can allow you work where your miso wont be as affected? Im trying to learn web development so I can potentially work from home someday and get out of the traditional office setting.\n\nMy advice to you is get some earplugs and headphones, put brown or white noise on them. It will muffle your grandmas nasty sniffs. If you need help I will buy them for you and have them shipped to you through Amazon by tomorrow on me. Just let me know, it would be no problem and make me feel good to help out another sufferer.\n\nAre you on meds or do you take anything to help numb you out a little? I drink copious  amounts of chamomile tea as it helps relax me. I also like to do CBD oil but it is expensive so I dont use it often. I can throw together a care package for you with things I think will help you and make you feel safe again. PM me or reply to my comment if you are down. I want to help you. Think of it as an early Christmas present. :-) This. Some coworkers of mine have been suffering with allergies lately and brown noise has been my lifesaver. I wear foam ear plugs almost all the time when I go out.  They are a lifesaver.  \n\n\nOther than that, perhaps things can improve if OP is just consistent and persistent with the grandmother -- always \"reminding\" her about the triggers and also explaining how the triggers work.  It can take a long time for folks without miso to \"get it\" -- well, as much as they are ever going to get it. True!", "Me: ah yes, finally I am falling asleep at a normal bedtime hour yay! My family: hey let us put on this loud movie at FULL volume Ughhhhhhhh. I have a very hard time sleeping as it is (very light sleeper, wake up at almost any sound because of my hearing, also I struggle to fall asleep a lot). \n\nLiterally was just rolling over to drift off, BAM, family throws on a movie. Except thing is, everyone in my family is basically deaf except for me. They watch movies or shows at FULL volume because they claim they cannot hear it otherwise. \n\nMy bedroom is right on the other side of the living room wall, and despite the wall having extra insulation, it does not do shit. I can still hear everything on the other end. I get that 11:30 pm may not be late for some people, I am just in a bad mood because I never sleep well and the ONE time I decide to go to bed earlier they decide to watch a super loud movie. My mom has one of those surround sound speakers too, so it nearly vibrates the wall when it is turned up that high. I was soooo close to sleeping and now I am wide awake again and am likely going to have to stay up a few more hours until they go to bed. They do not really care about my hearing, I asked them to turn it down but they are ignoring me. So godamn annoying. \n\nEnd rant UGH that is beyond annoying &gt;:,( my stepdad\u2019s office is right outside my bedroom door (our walls are paper thin and the door is literally a sheet of plywood) where he makes loud calls every morning from 7am-noon with his annoying radio-man voice and his redundant stories to make his clients relate to him (his job is advertising for small businesses). this part is not a trigger but: he and my mom watch movies late at night and the living room is below my bedroom (they also have those surround sound speakers and YEAH it shakes my room!!) like guy... you did not let me sleep until like 1am last night... i am tired... please let me rest :,) It is so irritating. I would not even mind it as much if they just turned the volume down? Why does it have to be so loud?? What if I had to work the next morning? Watch your movie, fine, but turn it down omg. The fact that they ignore me when I tell them that is even more frustrating. \n\nAnd ugh yeah relatable with the thin walls. My house is newer and I thought the walls would be fairly soundproof, yeah they are not. I can hear pretty much everything going on outside my room. I feel you so much. Sounds are mostly tolerable for me until they interfere with my sleep, that is when I go absolutely crazy. My hearing is not very good and loud radios and TV drive me crazy, the sound is \u201ctinny\u201d (usually bad speakers). So I have taken to wearing earplugs when I am trying to sleep for the first few hours (I take them out semi awake. I am a semisomniac btw) or they leave a door open with blaring radios and so on.\n\nThey are really useful for this problem. If I am trying to listen my own thing I ask them to shut the door. Oddly enough they are happy to do so.\n\nSo maybe try earplugs? Remember those times when it was the parents telling their children to go to sleep and stay quiet, not the other way around? lol\n\nNext time I suggest you call them by their full names and say in the most assertive way possible \"it is past bedtime, go into pijamas, wash your teeth and go to sleep.

He is extremely insensitive to it and tells *me* to be nice to *him* when my own fucking brain is going haywire and I freak out. Misophonia is a physical condition with the brain that not I or anyone else with this condition can help. It destroys relationships and makes life absolutely  miserable.

I know how badly it sucks. I am really sorry, that sounds like so much to manage and deal with.\n\nI do not know if this will help, but -- I think a lot of this is defensiveness on his part. He feels criticized, or maybe even attacked, and so his response is to double down. When we are told that something we habitually do, and do not even realize we do, is a problem, defensiveness is probably the reflex reaction. The key is to get past it, which obviously he has not done. And I am sorry, because he should be trying to help, not just because you are his child, but because it is the decent thing to do.\n\nI only say this because since we cannot control other people, we can only control our reactions to them.

My mother clears her throat and one time I heard her in the bathroom and I politely asked if she cleared her throat? And she said yes and she said I was berating her but i was being polite and I accidentally made her cry and she got defensive and told me not to berate her everytime she does it, but I cannot control my response to the sound. I apologized and told her I did not mean to make her cry, it is the noise that bothers me, not her. When I was visiting my aunts they cleared they are throats the whole time I was there at they are apartment and when I left to go home with my family when they helped us pack our stuff in the car I heard one of them throat clearing downstairs I told them it bothered me and they kept apologizing. The constant apologies can sometimes be just as annoying as the noise itself. My aunt\u2019s only had a 2 bedroom apartment and I had to sleep downstairs with them. My aunt woke me up after clearing her throat and I told her it scared me and she said she was sorry.\nBut they are kind and understanding about my noise sensitivity and try not to do it when I am around. I could not sleep in one of the bedrooms by myself because my twin brother had to use one of my aunt\u2019s bedrooms and Some nights I had to share a bedroom with my younger brother and my mom, it was a living hell so I am glad to be back home. I brought my headphones for the whole trip.\nI am sorry your dad is treating you that way and you deserve better. If you need anything feel free to talk to me.It is not nice for him to mock your sensitivity. My advice would be to wear headphones if you are around him and wear earplugs at night and I like to play white noise when I am in bed so I do not wake up with noise startling me awake. Good luck my friend. Same here. My mom clears her throat but she never means to scare me and apologizes, but one day when I told her I got triggered she started to cry and told me she could not help it and she said I was berating her all I did was politely ask her if she cleared her throat she said she did I told her I did not yell and berate and I told her sorry for hurting her feelings. I hate living with noise sensitivity, it is hard so I understand. I am sorry, Your mom should be more understanding of your sensitivity too. Same here. I had to move home to help mom and an uncle through illnesses. Never had a reaction to throat clearing until mom started doing it....constantly. Ugh. I hate it. She knows it is a trigger but says she cannot help it. I think she should see a dr to find out why she does it so often!! And yes, she feels hurt if I look at her when she does it, let alone say something, so I just leave the room. Anyway, so sorry you are dealing with this.", "God material  That is super interesting. I have dreamed about this sort of thing. ", "Video conferencing Someone decided to eat on a recent video conference at work. I am beyond disgusted and angry. Unbelievably unprofessional and disgusting\n\nI am fucking vibrating, I am so angry. Jesus. Wtf Wtf indeed! I hate people sometimes... I had a girl in a class when I was in college that sat next to me and ate raw carrots. It was obnoxious. I would be angry even if I were the presenter. I would definitely say something. Even little noises can interfere with conferences. \n\nMic off unless you are talking. When I was still doing my online class, I would turn off my video whenever I put any morsel of food in my mouth. Did not even have to think twice about it, it was just an instinct because I am not disgusting or rude. This is why I always play low-fi beats and pink noise in the background, strategically arrange who I want to see in my main window and ask everyone who is not speaking to mute. \n\nI have been guilty of eating during zooms, but I am always camera and audio off! I wish we were using zoom or discord or something else. We are using Google meet and it does not give me many arrangement options. It does not let me mute people and it does not let me black people out. I might try and get them to use a different software. Being able to mute individuals like in discord is luxurious. I commend you. I do not think I could survive that.", "talking to someone who could relate to me would be nice. 16 year old female here, seeing psychiatrist and therapist but have not seen them in a while (about a month or two) they have narrowed down my diagnoses to misophonia, sensory processing disorder, AND obsessive compulsive disorder. with anxiety and depression following those. I am prescribed fluoxotine but I have not been taking it to be honest and I want to but I cannot get refils unless I see my psychiatrist, and since I cannot make every appointment I dont want to start the medication and then fall off track because I cannot see her to get a refil if that makes any sense. My trigger sounds are throat clearing and coughing and I cannot stand seeing people lick their lips on top of other sounds I do not like and etc. I would say all this started when I was around 7 or so sometime after my mom died. Everyone I live with coughs religiously and I guess they make an effort not to but it bothers me they do it at all and honestly the sounds piss me off most when coming from them. Even the throatclearing in tv and movies trigger me. I cannot help this stomping and hitting my head and screaming outbursts and sometimes I cannot help but burst in tears because I feel trapped. My family doesnt understand me no matter how much they say they do, sometimes they say shit like they dont care and that theyre not going to \"choke for me\" when I am not asking them to, I am just asking them to not do it so much around me, they act like its something I do to act out and I cannot help but get suicidal thoughts from it all. Idk how I will go on in my adult life with this and it is something I have expressed concern for to my therapist but idk sometimes it feels like its getting worse sometimes it feels like its getting better. I honestly do not think I will make it to adulthood, I fight this everyday, its exhausting. and on top of it all I have other shit going on, school is in the dump for me, missed almost all of 10th grade. have been pretty much flunking school since 5th grade. moms dead. havent seen my dad in almost a year and if he were to show up idek if I would want to continue a relationship with him anymore. relationship with my grandparents is iffy and when theyre gone I have nothing because I am not really close with anyone else in my huge family. I do not want to be in a psych ward or a home I just feel like moving out could do alot for me but my psychiatrist said I cannot because of my mental state or something. and my therapist said I would need to be able to support myself. and even with all this I dont even know if I would be able to get emancipated with this. Itll be seen as a classic case of I want to move out because I dont like my parents. Which isnt why for me. I think having someone to talk to who can relate to me would help alot. Someone who has this condition or something that impacts them everyday. I just feel so fucked up everyday and idk how much longer I can do it. Hey, I think a lot of us have been in a similar sort of situation, myself included. I am 22 now and hopefully my past experiences and advice can help you. \n\nRegarding loving with people; personally, my Misophonia is debilitating, so I needed to get a job and move out and live alone. That worked for me. I know that might not be the answer you are looking for but realistically that is probably one of the better solutions. Some people think that being a hermit is weird or whatever but it helps me stay sane. Depending on where you live, moving out might be doable at your age, it might not be. Also, most places you do not actually need to be 18 to move out.  That being said, you have got to deal with people in the meantime because moving out takes time, and maybe you do not want to be a hermit like me;). Typically the coping mechanisms we see people discuss here are:\n-get good headphones. Some people like noise cancelling, others do not. Go to the store and try some out if you can. I personally prefer foam earplugs with over-ear noise cancelling headphones, for really bad environments.\n-take care of yourself. Sleep enough, do not eat shit, stop drinking pop, drink enough water, exercise. The brain can deal with shit so much better if given the resources. I really recommend this one, but I do not started doing it in my twenties. I wish I would have sooner.\n-bonus from me; try meditation. I find this is my saving grace. Misophonia causes fight or flight responses and meditation can help to control those responses - this helps for things other than Misophonia too.  It is also free. You can download a guided meditation app, go to a park, and just sit there for a while. Do not do this if you are not going to take it seriously though, it does not work if your heart is not in it. \n\nI also want to comment on you being 16 - you have got a lot going on in your brain at that age. Emotions all start to feel different as you get older, so calling it quits at 16  because of how you feel right now might not be the most open minded thing to do. Sorry to talk more about me, but I just want you to know that this is coming from someone who spent time in a mental health ward for suicide because of Misophonia (among other things); I also have diagnosed OCD and PTSD. I hope this makes sense - Misophonia really makes life hard but it does not mean we cannot fight it. Give adulthood a chance, I guess is what I am trying to say.\n\nAbout your medication and not being able to see the psychiatrist, are you sure you are not able to make time to go and see them? If not, try calling the office and see if you can schedule a phone appointment or simply ask for a prescription refill. Most doctor's offices will do a prescription refill remotely and fax the prescription to your pharmacy as well. Personally I just ask the pharmacy to call the doctor's office to ask for a refill on my behalf and they usually take care of it all for me. Also, know That there has been little to no studies for medicating Misophonia specifically, so taking anything for it is uncharted territory, even for doctors, and it could make things worse so try to be self-aware of how it is making you feel and talk to your psychiatrist if it is making things worse. Again, coming from someone that was a pharmaceutical crash test dummy in my teens, but ultimately decided that meditation and exercise made me more mentally healthy than anything else. Not saying it will not work for you, just recommending you to be cautious and please make time for your doctor.\n\nI hope I said something helpful, I tried not to throw a bunch of irrelevant shit at you. if you want to talk more we are here for you. I am here for you. First I just want to say it means more than I can put in words a lot to me to talk to someone I can relate to and get advice from them. I do believe as I stated earlier that being on my own will help a bit when the time comes. I am at my most sane when I am by myself just doing my own thing. And I do want to live, I do, I try to keep in mind that I am in a very fragile and hormonal place as far as age right now, and try to keep a grip on everything best I can giving the circumstances. I am planning on seeing my psychiatrist and therapist soon to talk about some things and maybe come clean to them about me not taking my medicine to get a fresh start. I want to start taking my meds, sleeping meds included. The medicine my psychiatrist prescribed she says she prescribed because it fits with ocd mainly and the anxiety and depression that comes with it and it is not addictive. I will look into the sound cancelling headphones and since I am going to be trying to get back into school idk how to incorporate them into my school life since I have to hear the teacher but I can figure that out later. I have heard about the water tip but now I really feel inspired to actually do it hearing it from someone going through something like me, same with the meditation. I already like going places to think. \n\nas for questions.. totally ok if you are not comfortable with answering them but your job.. is it doable with your condition? are there any particular jobs you think would be good for someone with our kind of thing? I have a few ideas for a job to do but interested in asking you since you get what the whole thing is like. Secondly, do you have a meditation app you use that I should try? And you have mentioned water but what about foods should I watch those too? I do not really have a steady eating habit since the whole sounds thing and being disgusted sometimes. Lastly, what are your triggers? And thanks again for helping me, you have helped me a LOOOOOT already. No problem, I am good for all questions! \n\nAs for the job, that is a tough one. You are in a good position to decide that right now. Many people with Misophonia do not accept the fact that their career needs to jive with their Misophonia in order for them to be happy. I did not get this either for some reason and ended up working in a call center for a few years. Big open office where people ate at their desks - it was a living nightmare for me some days because eating is my biggest trigger among others.  I ended up quiting that job and now I work part time from home in a virtual call center lol. My advice is to try and get something you can do from home, with technology nowadays there is more and more companies going the remote route. You can be a writer, a social media writer, a IT person (like me), a programmer, and a bunch of other stuff all from home, if anything interests you that can be done from home push hard for that. That being said there are plenty of jobs that have very little to do with being around your triggers. I have even worked as a cook in restaurants before and it was fine because it was so loud I could not hear any of my triggers. But whatever you do, do not get an open office job you will hate it. Another point I will make is, school is valuable for someone with Misophonia because it will make you more of a valuable employee down the road, and companies give valuable employees their own offices and stuff like that. Also, no matter what job you pick, you are still going to probably be around a trigger sometimes, even working from home my neighbors are loud sometimes, or someone is mowing the lawn, etc, Misophonia is not something that is going to go away so it is good to learn some coping mechanisms that work for you regardless. Near the end of my tenure at the big open office call centre I got really good at keeping calm when I was triggered and moving on. \n\n\nI used to use a few different apps for guided meditation, headspace was one of them, mostly because I did not want to pay for extra lessons in one app. But, now I mostly just meditate on my own. I just sit in a quiet place or put some headphones on in a noisy one, and let my thoughts go. I try to think analyze myself and think about things objectively. Sometimes I end up not thinking about anything and that is okay. The big thing I focus on is control of that fight or flight response and that OCD, if you can train your brain to let go of triggers after they are done, my god does it help. I used to get so riled up when I was triggered once, it would fuck me up for hours and I would keep focusing on it with thoughts like \"god, I hate that person\" or just generally being angry/sad. And, worse than that, I would focus on the fact that I needed to deal with it again eventually - it is like even when I was not around my triggers I was still thinking about my triggers and feeling pissy. I think I am at a point now, after years of meditation, to have something trigger me and I can accept what is happening, wait for it to pass, then move on. And, in situations where I am not being triggered I do not freak out about having to go and get triggered next time I get on a bus. I know it is really not that easy, but I put my heart and soul into getting myself there. I still have really bad days like anyone, but they are not that common. \n\nAs for foods, I would say just keep an eye on sugars and fake sugars. Do not drink pop and do not drink energy drinks, those are the worst thing for Misophonia IMO. Coffee can be bad if you have too much too. Something about sugar makes your brain behave in a hyperactive way and in my experience that makes Misophonia worse. I cut my sugar intake way down and I think I am a lot more mellow because of it. I do not even eat sugary cereal, I eat old people cereal lol. \n\nAbout headphones, noisecancelling is good for situations when you do not need to hear people, not ideal for school. I bought some headphones from this website earpeace.com, a long time ago, but I am pretty sure you can get similar products on Amazon. They are high-fidelity invisible earplugs. They do not mute or muffle the world, they just turn the volume down, which I find really helpful; to me it makes triggers not so sharp. And, you only have a tiny tab sticking out of your ear so people do not really notice them, especially if you have got hair in the way. \n\nOh and triggers, basically any people noises. Eating is by far the worst one. Thank you. For jobs I have been thinking preschool teacher, assistant, masseuse, esthetician, baby sitter, etc but I will definitely look into jobs I can do at home. I will check out that mediation app and hopefully I can train myself to calm down too one day. Say, do you think those high fidelity invisible earplugs would work for school if not the noise canceling headphones? also what age would you say you started feeling this way? Did you have to go to college for your current job? How did you get through it? and sorry for flooding you with questions but how was like.. your family life when you were my age? Do you keep in touch with them now since you are kind of isolated? Those jobs definitely sound doable! Yeah those earplugs work great for toning down the volume in any situation, I still use them when I am irritable but still need to hear people. I think they would work great for your school, or they are at least worth a try. \n\nWhat age did I start having Misophonia or when did I start controlling myself better? I have had it since as early as I can remember, and I have been able to cope better since I turned 21. \n\nI actually am still going to university, but I did need to go in order to get the job I have. They were hiring students part time, and it happens to be what I am going to school for. I am going to school online with a university called the university of athabasca, which is a completely online university. It being online has been amazing. I highly recommend looking at this university and others in your area to see if there are any online universities that could work for you. Being able to go to school from anywhere is the perfect fit for Misophonia. No problem,\n\nMy family life was awful when I lived at home, so many nights I spent on a friend's couch because I fought so hard with my parents. Most of the time it was about Misophonia. I can still remember some of the more intense fights. As we got older they accept more about me now and they know I am not going to come around unless they reasonably accomodate my Misophonia, which is unfortunate but it turns out that is not as big of a  deal as some people make it. I can also tolerate more now, so that makes it easier. I honestly spent most of the time kicked out of the house because of how terrible my relationship with my parents and siblings was.\n\nWhen I initially moved out we did not talk for a year or two, but we do now that the dust has settled. It is much easier to be around your family when you get to choose how much you are around them, and can decide when you have had enough. Hey, TelephoneMelon, just a quick heads-up:  \n**accomodate** is actually spelled **accommodate**. You can remember it by **two cs, two ms**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Good bot I will have to look for those earphones then \ud83d\ude01 I bet online school does accommodate it. I have been thinking about online college when the time comes and also online highschool but still not sure if I will do online highschool or real life highschool, I feel like online would definitely be better but idk. It sucks you went through all of that with your family. I have my issues with mine too, a few months ago my grandpa was talking to me about a home and looking into it and they are always looking to give me away or put me out instead of trying to understand my issue but it is whatever I guess It is too much to ask of them. but idk there is nothing I can do since I do not want to live w any other relatives and I do not want to be on the street and do not rly want to live here either. So I guess if he chooses the home it will not be all that bad if she chooses a decent one and one that I can leave when I hit 18. I bet choosing how much you can be around your family is better, I noticed I liked them better when I was not around them everyday too. Hey there! Just to piggy-back off of the already awesome answer you got: I work in the retail industry. I work at a department store. I would highly recommend this as a first job. Does not pay enough to make it be your long term career (unless you move up to a supervisor/manager), but the independence you have will help you with the misophonia. What I mean is that if you work in let us say the shoe department, you will generally be left alone to tidy up or help the occasional customer. Or if your working in the women's department, you will probably just be folding and cleaning up the racks. Lots of time to yourself. Or even if you are a cashier, it is fast paced enough and the customer interactions are each so quick that there is little time to be triggered by anyone. Even if you have to work next to a cashier, in the down time you can be straightening up things near by. And when you are on a break, they are not going to MAKE you stay in the break room with other coworkers. You can take your snack out to your car, or go sit on a bench outside. I find that just a random stranger does not trigger me if I only need to have a few minutes of interaction with that person. And in retail, you are not constantly having that one on one task with coworkers either. \n\n\nRight now though, I work in the office of my retail store. I do payroll and administrative stuff. I only recently got my own office where I can close the door if I need to concentrate (read: being triggered). Before that I was in hell being stuck five days a week in an open office with noisy people that never stopped eating or chewing mints. \ud83d\ude44 So I would just look into staying on the sales floor or working as a cashier.", "I am dying inside  Earphones or earplugs can be sanity savers. Blast her back with one of these. She has a responsibility to help you. If she will not, then train her like the Rat that she is. \n\nShoreline Marine Eco Air Horn  I am sorry, siblings can be the absolute worst for triggers. They are brutal and incessant if they know it bothers you. I am also in the no medication camp, as I do not believe the antidepressants doctors blindly prescribe are worth it.\n\nHeadphones and stay strong. I hope you are able to leave your home and go for a walk or something to blow off steam also Thanks but I ended up breaking my headphones a few months ago cause of her, she was near my ear doing loud noises and I ended up breaking it out of anger. Lol this comment made me laugh, thanks will do. Yeah, shes a demon. The medication isnt actually for misophonia it is for an entirely different problem, being held hostage by my mom to get me to 'behave'.\nThanks, although then I could not leave, I will try your advice Keep in mind that while people do not \"owe\" you anything, if they are able to respond with help, then that is their \"respond ability\", or \"responsibility\". Not an obligation, but something that they should commit to doing to help someone who has a condition that disables them - a disability. Disabled people have rights. If Miso disables you, then you have rights.\n\nBe thankful that you have her so that you can learn how to fight for your rights now, so that you can develop and learn skills for the future. Be the Dog, eat the Rat. Do not take shit from anyone because there is nothing wrong with you and you deserve respect.\n\nGood luck! So... Maybe you need counseling too? \n\nYou need to learn self control even if your misophonia is horrible. All you did was punish yourself. Which is insane. \n\nYou can call CPS and complain that your parent is threatening to withold medication for mental illness as punishment..\n\nDoes she think letting a mentally ill child SKIP TREATMENT is going to make you behave better and make HER life easier? Who the fuck thinks that way?! The sad thing is that I cant. The medication is testosterone, and its because I am transgender. Testosterone that is unprescribed is illegal where I live so calling the CPS is just going to keep me farther away as legal treatment may take 5 years.\nShes already done this before lots of times with estrogen blockers that didnt work, so I had to resort to fasting most of the time and very low calories to stop my body from functioning, and it is honestly breaking me. Maybe the irritarion problems from the starvation is what is making my misophonia so bad so I am basically stuck with constant torture until she decides I am 'good enough' to order it. I was trying so hard not to. Whenever my misophonia gets bad I always get to a really high level, most of the time the highest. I have broken alot of things, whenever I get into that state it is like I am being stabbed slowly by a thousand knives and I need some sort of release. It is like I cant control myself anymore. Through all this covid mess I was unable to get a therapist and the one I will get will probably not understand it I have severe misophonia myself man, I get how it makes you FEEL..But just like you cannot punch someone for the words they say to you- no matter how horrible those words are - breaking stuff is only punishment for you and any loss of your ability to make rational choices that negatively impact you in that way, needs to be addressed IMMEDIATELY. You cannot go through life punching holes in walls. Those people end up very alone and / or in jail. PLEASE seek counseling too relearn your reactions before your hurt yourself or someone. \n\nWe cannot control our misophonia and our fight or flight response occuring- but you absolutely DO have a choice not to break things or throw tantrums. The option to leave the situation is always the one you need to take.\n\nI have seen my therapist twice a month online through Covid. Do not make excuses. There are people out there to help. You need to find one. ... how is neglecting and threatening your child legal in your country? It just does not make any sense... \n\nThere are foster homes in the US that manage to fully support thier transgender children... \n\nI hope to hell that the second you escape, you never EVER go back to those people for any reason.\n\nIs there an LGBTQ community support in your area? Something like PFLAG? You really need the support of adults who can help you get the fuck away from that abuse. Blackmail her. Steal her stuff and threaten to burn it if she does not stop. Hack her Facebook or insta or whatever (you can find hackers who do this online) and make sure she knows. Of course tell her also that you will send embarrassing messages to her friends and maybe boys from school (does she have a crush or a bf?) if she ever tells your mother.\nIf you are really desperate, that is. Do something she hates repeatedly and refuse to stop. Shes a demon and knows how much noises hurt me, which noises are the worst, and what volume to do them. Shes a torture device I swear. I have tried but nothing will hurt her as much as she can hurt me. Especially when my mom is near, I cant do that. Dude. Stop trying to personally attack her and find her deepest darkest pet peeve. Just be petty. Leave the seat up for her, wet her toothbrush for no reason. Randomly move her things under couch cushions and in drawers. Randomly put small things of food to rot inside her bags. Put grapes in her shoes. Mix nair hair remover into her shampoo. Etc. I would but shes pretty young, nothing seems to bother her. I have tried taking her stuff and hiding it but my mother always finds out cause my sisters a huge snitch. Shell piss me off then hide behind my mom. Just shove it under a couch cushion and say you have no idea where it is. Do it every single day. Creating triggers for someone takes time. Thanks. I will do that. Leave and live by yourself", "Confused about my condition  I just found out about misophonia and found this subreddit. I could really use some help to figure out what my condition is. Throughout my life I have found various noises I absolutely hate that other people usually do not. These include chewing noises, scrunching tissue paper, markers writing on paper, etc. This was especially highlighted to me when I moved into an apartments with 3 of my friends. I eat food without making any noise and have done so ever since I was little so I thought it was how everybody ate, however all 3 of my flatmates chew really loudly to the point where I can hear their chewing noises from across the room and it really gets to my nerves so much that I usually have to move to another room or put in earphones. I asked them how they could stand the noises of each other's chewing and they told me that they do not really mind it, which was really shocking to me.\n\nAnother interesting case was when I stumbled upon an ASMR video with the focus being markers writing on paper. I could not last more than 30 seconds without pausing the video and going to the comments to see how much people hated the noise only to find out that people loved that video.\n\nI searched on the internet and found this subreddit. Initially after reading the symptoms I thought that I had misophonia, however, after reading through some of the posts I am kind of confused. I see a lot of people discussing about how people have attacks or get anxiety because of sounds they dislike. I do not really relate to some of the extreme posts on here, as in the attacks I get are really unpleasant but they do not really have a lasting impact and only stay for the duration of the noise. Different sounds have different reactions. Whenever I hear markers writing on paper or anything similar (as in something as shrill as that) I just feel a really unpleasant feeling up my spine, sort of like a tingle that I cannot really stand, along with my ears hurting. Whenever I hear someone chewing loudly I just get really annoyed and irritated, sometimes even outright angry. With tissue paper it is gotten to the point where I cannot even hold a tissue paper without feeling really unpleasant, I hate the sound it makes as well as the feel.\n\nHowever my symptoms are not really too severe. Whenever I hear these sounds I feel really really unpleasant, but never get anxiety. On top of that, once the noise ends I can carry on like normal.\n\nI could really use some help to figure out whether I actually have misophonia or not and if I do whether it is something I could fix or something I should be concerned about It sounds like you do experience the same things as most Misophonia sufferers. Many Misophonia sufferers also have undiagnosed/diagnosed OCD alongside Misophonia. This is likely what creates the \"lasting impact\" that you are talking about. It is difficult for obsessive people to let go of things, it is always in our minds. OCD might also be the cause of \"trigger anticipation\", where Misophonia sufferers anticipate a noise and experience distress before the sound even occurs.  Indeed, it may never occur.\n\nIt sounds like you do have Misophonia, and could benefit from coping mechanisms recommended by this community and others. It is worth also mentioning that Misophonia does not have any official diagnostic criteria, so it is a very subjective analysis. Generally, people self-diagnose themselves on the basis of having averse reaction to sounds - chewing noises are always front-and-center when talking about Misophonia triggers.\n\nOne thing is very clear: people have Misophonia to varying extent. There is even a quiz you can take online somewhere that will tell you how extreme your Misophonia is on a scale from 1 to 10. Not sure how scientific it is, but it suggests a varying degree of impact within the Misophonia community.\n\nOne last thing, there are no proven treatments for Misophonia. Especially do not try exposure therapy, as that can be damaging. Many people with Misophonia live happy lives in spite of the condition. If you do have Misophonia, and it sounds like you do, all you can do is try to enjoy life as best you can and avoid sounds that set you off. Many very talented people are working to research Misophonia right now; eventually we might have some treatment options as a result of their work, but right now there is not anything. All we have are coping methods.\n\nReally important sidenote: I am not a doctor or a professional anything. I am just a guy who has read the stories of other Misophonia sufferers for the past 6 years. These are patterns that I see, but I may not be correct. Take it all with a grain of salt. I would recommend doing your own research on Misophonia, there are a number of good research papers published on the matter. It might help you form your own opinion on whether you share this condition with us or not. Thank you so much for the help. I had a feeling that I had misophonia but did not want to misdiagnose and create a placebo effect where I would feel like I have it when I do not.\n\nI am pretty sure I do not have OCD and it is really sad to hear about people having both the conditions simultaneously.\n\nI will definitely make sure to go through the coping mechanisms recommended by the community and will do my own research as well.\n\nThanks again for the quick reply, it really was a lot of help and gave me some much needed insight on the issue, it was exactly what I needed  Miso exists on a scale. Yours sounds relatively mild. Whether or not you address it depends on the degree of stress and dysfunction it causes.", "Do I have misophonia? I have always been sensitive to certain noises. Mostly snoring and heavy breathing, but I have always been able to live with it in spite of how angry it makes me.\n\nBut about a year ago my neighbour started stomping around loudly all day long, including late at night, and the sounds of her stomping started to make me feel very anxious.

If I hear similar noises at work or when visiting people I do not care.\n\nIs this even misophonia or something else? I have never had such extreme reactions before. I was not this sensitive to appartment-noises before. Has anybody experienced something similar?\n\nThanks for reading.  Hey! Most of the noises i suffer are from from my home also, espcially from certain pepole! i also had triggers by a child neighbour who would just make horse running sounds for hours and it would drive me insane! you shouldnt cancel the idea of having misophonia just because the noise that trigger you not makes you triggered by stranges, your reactions and emotions are valid! Misophonia makes pepole have abnormally strong and negative reactions to sounds, If you have reactions of wanting to leave the house just because the sounds, than you might have it, and it is alright! i really advice you to get some good sound proof headphones or earplugs, earplugs saved me! I am speaking all from my exprience btw! It does sounds rough, sending strength I believe this is just how misophonia forms in a human brain. You are a more sensitive to certain sound, you hear it over and over and OVER again, so it makes you go insane. It is like that water drop torture device, you would never think something so mildly annoying could make you feel so bad, but when it is being repeated for so long, then the person just breaks. I think this is misophonia. Misophonia can get worse around people who you know makes a sound that triggers you over and over again. And also, homes get super iffy around lots of people who have misophonia. This might be due to, tying back to what I said previously, the people who trigger you the most live in or around your home. The exact way I described it with the water drop thing, and when it happens consecutively in random intervals and different time spacing it is 10x worse for the water drops and this", "My so is sister's damn mouth noises (please, God, help) I just found this subreddit and never knew how much I needed it. Maybe someone here can offer some advice or maybe just writing this will help me feel better.\n\nSo, my so is sister is developmentally disabled. She pretty much acts like a 6 or 7 year old kid in a lot of ways, and chewing is one of them. She just cannot consistently chew with her mouth closed/quietly. And IT KILLS ME. I feel like such an ass, because I love her to death, but I cannot sit near her during meals or be around her when she has a snack. After eating or when her mouth is dry she just smacks her tongue and lips around. I have to wear earbuds and look away. \n\nI remind her, or my SO does because he knows it kills me, and she is better for around... thirty seconds? But then it is right back to loud mouth sounds. And I genuinely, 100% believe she is doing her best.\n\nNow that my rant is over, does anyone have any kind of advice for me here? I do not know how to explain this issue to her without sounding mean, and I do not even know if it would help. But I cannot deal with this and I hate feeling like I am being an asshole because I cannot stand how she eats. Ear plugs are a very good idea. If you feel embarrased (you shouldnt) about wearing them you can find very subtle hidden ear plugs. I think the exact product was linked in the pinned posts on this subreddit.\n\nAs for the visual triggers I have found that one thing that helps is to situate yourself so that they are not directly in your field of view. Also longer hair or bangs can help block whatever you dont wish to see (helps me with triggers coming from next to me). See if this helps\n Just curious, why the downvote?", "its getting worse I have been suffering from misophonia for about 9 years. it started around the age of 9 and I am almost 18.  it has always been bad, ruined my relationship with my family. now, I cannot stand going to school and people in general. I cannot even watch my favourite YouTubers and tv shows! I just get bothered by every single noise and I point it out more often now. things that never really bothered by now make me want to snap my neck because of how bad it got. I go to a vocational school and I am on track to get my dream job. the problem is, I cannot stand hearing anyone at this point. seeing certain people makes me panic on the inside because I know they annoy me. I really want to work with people (as a psychologist) but I cannot if do not want to listen. I am thinking of seeing an audiologist but my parents downplay the severity of and barely think misophonia a thing. they are supposed to help reduce the anxiety and stuff and help remove you from places you get triggered but the problem is I can because of my school. it is full-time and I am on track for a bright future but the certification I am going to get there requires me to talk to people. (also, my parents would flip if I wanted to leave my school and will not allow me to do online school. they are really expecting me to go to college and I want to continue my education after hs but I know I will not be able to handle it.) I told my doctor about it a couple of months ago and he never heard about it. another problem: there are no audiologists that handle misophonia cases near me. the closest that I found is two hours away. Does anyone know any audiologists that can meet online and do not charge a ridiculous amount? my insurance is not that great so they most likely will not help pay for the sessions. if you made it this far, thanks for reading :) have yourselves a wonderful day :D I dont have any audiologist suggestions (everything on google came up to hearing aids) but I wanted to let you know youre not alone. Im sure your already using some sort of sound filtering earplug or headphone, which is the only thing I use to cope other than mj and breathing techniques.

I learned the same manners as he did and nobody else seems to be bothered by it, and if it is soup or a drink he freaking slurps so damn loud.

He also walks like kind of with his heels do not know why and you can hear his steps all over the house. \n\nMy dad has the necessity to be constantly burping, coughing and clearing his throat (he used to smoke) and farting.

Also, I just found out about this sub, and I am genuinely happy to know there is so many of us. Stay strong fellas, we are not crazy. I hear you.\n\nI thought most of the noises my in-laws made were bad enough when I could get away from them by going out for a long walk or waiting for them to go out to some activity or other; but when we went into lockdown and I got furloughed from my job, ye gods it was like my ability to detect irritating sounds went through the damn roof, and it got even worse when they started having to cancel their own activities and instead doing everything on their 'phones or the computer or whatever (and neither of them seem to be able to talk at a normal volume when using anything with a microphone, they always get so much louder!).\n\nAnd then of course they keep asking if I am alright, spending so much time in my room, because it is the only place I can escape most of the noise (except bathroom stuff and people going up and down the stairs, because of the layout of the house) until they go to bed; which combined with not working means I am becoming more and more nocturnal in my habits...

She eats incredibly loudly and does not close her mouth (she is 29!). She will be right next to me on the couch doing this and I honestly want to vomit sometimes. I know it is ridiculous to complain about, but she even breathes loudly! She is constantly out of breath even walking the extremely short distance from her room to the kitchen.\n\nWorst of all, she is constantly on the phone. Day and night. She is going to school here but is from Israel and she talks to her family at night, which I get. That is what time they are up. But she also talks to them during the day. I go to sleep way earlier than her\u2014I go to bed at 11 or 12 and she stays up until 2 or 3. She will be taking loudly on the phone while I am trying to sleep. She is talking in Hebrew too so it is even more annoying because my brain is like \"these are words...but we do not know them. Let us try and figure them out.\" I will be trying to watch tv on the couch and she will be walking to her room to the fridge and then back again, over and over, talking very loudly, not even closing the door when she is in her room. She did this last week and I asked her to please shut the door and then she went on the defense and said \u201ccan you lower the tv volume?\u201d I said \u201cIt is up because I cannot hear it because you are talking on the phone loudly.\u201d Then she huffed and closed her door.\n\nI am at the end of my rope. She has been here for almost a year and when her lease is up, I NEED her to move out. She is actually very nice and we have been helpful to each other and we talk and all that (but we are not close friends. We would not hang out if we were not roommates and we do not do much with each other outside the apartment.) I do not know how I am going to approach this.\n\nI am in an industry where I take a gig for a couple weeks or months and then when that is over, I do not work and mostly stay home while I find a new gig. Because she is in school, she is at the apartment all the time during the summer and only goes to school for a few days a week. The other days, she is sitting on the couch because she cannot legally get a job with just a student visa. She is been away the last week visiting family who now live in Boston (this is the first time she is gone on a trip because the rest of her family is in Israel.) and it has been so nice finally getting some quiet. I am dreading her return.\n\nHow do I tell her she needs to move out? A family friend of mine bought this apartment for me to rent from him, so it definitely has to be her that moves out. Please let me know if you have any suggestions, they are much appreciated. Ive had a bunch of problems with roomates and moved around a lot.  Whenever possible I try to get a short leaser, either month to month or 6 months.  I used to try to find cheap studio/1br apartments so I could live alone, but always had problems hearing people through the walls, or thumping above me (and longer leases).\n\nWhat Ive been doing the last few years is living in a single family home with 2-4 other people.  Theyre easy to find on craigslist.  The leases are a lot shorter (typically I can get month to month).  When I look at places like this, I always talk to the potential roomates and am very clear that I like it quiet.  I live near a large university, so typically I am living with busy grad students.\n\nIt sometimes takes time to find a good place, but its ended up working better for me.  The biggest problems come when someone moves out, and someone else moves in.  In these cases I try to be very clear to potential new tenants that we are all clean/quiet.\n\nIn your case specifically, I would try to explain the detail and use the term misophia.  A lot of people do not understand how it feels, and talking to them can work wonders.  At very least you could try to set quiet hours?  Have you tried sleeping with earplugs and a noise machine?  If you want her to move out, you could wait until her lease is up, or tell her you will let her out of her lease early.  There is not much legally you can do to boot her if she has a lease.\n\nIn my situation, idk what I am going to do long term.  I cannot keep moving around, and I do not make enough to get a good quiet place alone.  Ive thought about moving into a van for a long time, and think I might finally pull the trigger in a few months. Have you gotten her out yet? \n\nIf you are still figuring it out - noise cancelling headphones is a lifesaver. That, and a daily prayer that you do not take her face and smash a pie into it. Oh wait, she will just start chewing then.", "Going mad! MY ROOMMATE WILL NOT STOP CLEARING HIS F'IN THROAT! I literally counted the seconds in between every throat clearing and its every 10-15 seconds. he does it HUNDREDS of times a day. I never noticed it before when he used to not work from home. BUT NOW he works at home and his office is near my room so its 8 hours of throat clearing that i have to endure. I started wearing headphones when i go to the kitchen and when I am in my bedroom but its annoying that i have to even do that! One time i started screaming and banged my desk after he did it and he texted me \"everything ok?\" and i just wanted to unleash my frustrations but i just said \"somewhat\" and that is it. I do not have the option to move out so i have to suffer and live this way for now. Ouch! That sounds maddening, I would probably say something even though there is nothing you can do. It is a habit that he likely will not be able to stop. Best wishes to you and the ThroatClearer3000 girl at work does the same, averages out every 18 seconds. Also, when she is talking and stops to noisiliy breathe in through her nostrils.\n\nI did not notice until we went on a tea break together and now i cannot un-notice it. Drives me mad! I would really suggest playing some white noise to drown it out. I have fans both next to my bed and next to my work area in my office, they help. But when I am at home/relaxing in my room/sleeping I play the sound of falling rain . I have one that plays for ten hours straight on YouTube, where there are hundreds more. I think it is reasonable to bring this up. It could be a sign of some kind of health issue. A friend of mine used to do this, and I cannot remember the exact issue, but it was some kind of a nerve problem causing him to feel like something was constantly in the back of his throat. Weirdly enough, going on a specific antidepressant cured it. Yes. I agree. I have an Alexa device that I play brown noise on 24/7 because I cannot stand hearing my neighbors tv through the floor. Hahah. It works really well and I find brown noise a bit of an easier listen. I had a friend come over one time and she said she did not realize there was any background noise at all until I pointed it out. If you are on a budget, the echo dot is pretty cheap. You really do need to talk about this with them. The sooner you can do it, the better. You do not want to do this when you are at your wits end.\n\nIt also sounds like they might need to go to a doctor. That is not a normal behavior.

My dad is staying with me to isolate now my siblings are starting back up at school. My dad also drinks a ridiculous amount of coffee every day.\n\nHow do I cope with my frustration and anger when I am stuck listening to him slurp and gulp coffee all the time? My reaction is currently either grinding my teeth, clenching my fists which hurts my palms as I have long nails, or literally gnawing on the sides on my fingers.\n\nThese are not really things I want to keep up for the indeterminate amount of time my dad will be living with me. Any suggestions on other coping methods would be great.\n\nMy dad is not aware of my misophonia as my parents can both be pretty dismissive of me so I have not bothered mentioning it. I love my dad a lot so I do not want to have to run out of the room every time he has something to eat or drink cause I do not want to upset him :( I am really sorry you are having to deal with this. \n\nI am not clear on how old you are, or why exactly your dad is staying with you -- Is he with you to reduce your siblings' risk of exposure to COVID? Or something like that? I guess I am trying to determine if you are in your own apartment (or whatever) separate from where your siblings are, and if it is yours -- i.e., if you signed a lease or what have you.\n\nRegardless, I think at some point you should tell your dad what is going on. Tell him you have a condition called misophonia, or at least that you are exhibiting the symptoms of it. Find a site, like Misophonia International, or maybe the Mayo Clinic, that explains it. Be clear that it is not his fault, but it is also something you have little to no control over in terms of reaction.\n\n(\n\nMy daughter has been exhibiting symptoms of this, too. It seems there might be some correlation with anxiety. I do not know if you have any anxiety issues, but if you do, perhaps you can see someone about it to try to find management/coping techniques.\n\nShe is triggered by eating sounds. She copes -- for now anyway -- but wearing noise-canceling headphones at meals and listening to brown noise. There are different \"colors\" of noise, and she finds brown noise is more effective at covering the sounds that bother her than the usual white noise. We can also talk to her, we just have to raise our voices a bit. \n\nI hope some of that can help with your dad. I do think if he will not stop, or take you seriously, then you should not feel bad at all about leaving the room or whatever you need to do in order to keep yourself calm. If he will not help you -- as a parent should -- then you will have to help yourself.\n\nGood luck. I am 24 with my own house, my dad is in the top 1% of critical risk peoples so while my younger siblings, whom still live with my mother, are back in school now, he is staying in my spare room so he can better isolate.\n\nI think I might try the headphones and brown noise for now and see if that helps, thank you. I read the article but it did not really have any pointers on how to deal with the anger itself.\n\nI had anxiety as a teenager but have had therapy and CBT to the point where I no longer consider myself an anxious person. I am not too sure if the response i have to the sounds is on the panic side of things though. I would say of the fight/flight/freeze it would definitely err more on the fight side haha I see. I think it is great that you are helping your dad isolate. Still, even though he is your dad, he is a guest, and he should act accordingly. Also there should just be a general baseline respect. You are 24, not 14, and if you tell your dad you have a condition, he should take you at face value.\n\nI do hope the headphones and brown noise help. My daughter gets the brown noise from YouTube videos, but there are also apps. I hope that helps. \n\nDo not know what to say about the anger, although I am sure there are coping tips for that online.

I know I would never do anything to him or to anybody, sometimes I feel like a psychopath. One time I enraged screaming while driving thinking of how he destroys my life with this and I almost fell unconscious. \n\nIt is hard but you have to control yourself one way or another.", "People are so annoying when they complain about my misophonia  Rant time: Why THE FUCK IS IT OK TO BITCH ABOUT UR BEST FRIEND (me) BEHINF MY BACK CUS I HAVE MISOPHONIA AND YOU CANT EAT CRISPS INFRONT OF ME. and apparently that is a deal breaker \n\nHOW ARE FUCKING CRISPS SO IMPORTANT IN PEOPLES LIVES Drives me crazy! Especially when people act like I am being difficult and need to just lighten up. It is like ummmm obviously if I could erase my misophonia I would in a heartbeat, no one wants this. But I cannot so please just let me be. Yep. Any other mental/emotional struggle it is about \"acceptance and understanding\" but then you open up about your struggles with EASY THINGS TO FIX and they act like you asked them to die for you (Jesus reference intended). Like, just do not chew gum when I am stuck in the car with you, is it really that hard? Sigh. Yeah I have had to tell people before \"oh im not saying you cannot eat Doritos... I am just saying I am going to throw up on you if you do.\" \n\n(I also have severe misophonia but I have a very visceral reaction to red Doritos- I can not stand the smell even a little- I just cannot believe how many people act like this is a big deal) Its insane how much people care about food over their friends I hate the fact that I have to feel like a fucking villain because I cannot handle when someone breathes loudly or eats next to me, I even have to force myself to breathe and eat as quietly as possible because I feel like a hypocrite, I luckily have people close to me that understand this and try there best to not make me have a mental breakdown every time I hear a trigger. I, particularly, am starting to own the fact I actively hate people. People say they have empathy and are in favor of equality and whatever, but in reality the status quo is the most important thing in their lives, and fuck the people who are hurt by said status quo. No, no, eat your fucking cookies next to me, it is cool, your sweets are way more important than my mental stability. Fuck people lmao, I really fucking love when people decide they should eat some gourmet meal directly Infront of me, mouth as open as possible even though I have told them multiple times to politely shut the fuck up. Ohhhh and when someone finds out about your misophonia so they intentionally use your trigger as a funny joke because seeing my \u201cfriend\u201d fidget in his chair is hilarious. I just end up feeling guilty even though I know I should not, though when someone outright disrespects my condition like my uncle who smacks pretty loud already purposefully being louder(to the point others noticed) then that guilt washes away pretty quick.\n\nI do not like inconveniencing people or making them feel guilty but come on, at least do not be a dick about something I cannot help.", "Triggered by my own breathing My misophonia started when I was 16, I am 17 now, and it is torture.

I was sitting on the couch next to my dad, and he made this exhale breathing sound, and I was like, \"wow that is annoying shut up\", but I did not actually tell him to shut up, it was just in my head. Every day from then on, my misophonia has gotten worse. I have tried every coping mechanism, but my misophonia ends up getting worse. My misophonia also pairs up with certain smells too. But lately it is gotten so bad, that I cannot stand my own breathing. I end up smacking and punching and biting myself when I just cannot take it. Anybody in my position would kill themselves however they can, I am sure of it. I do not try, because there is something inside me that thinks I can get over this misophonia and OCD that I have. Its also because I already tried to kill myself a few months before I felt my first version of misophonia, and the hospital I went to traumatized me.

I have separated it into paragraphs for you!\n\n\n\n_Send a private message with title **'opt out'** to prevent this bot from seeing your posts in the future._\n\nr/misophoniasupport has contributed 0.01% of all walls of text analyzed so far! First of all, I would really like to say I am sorry for what you are going through... it sounds practically unbearable, and It is amazing that you are still up and doing all you can to get through this. Seriously, props to you!! There are a couple things I could suggest, and I hope they help you a little bit.\n\nFirst of all, you NEED to be assertive with telling your parents what they need to avoid doing. To them, it would be as simple as fixing a bad habit. I know it will feel weird. It might feel like you are being a burden. But you HAVE to push through that feeling. Your sanity is more important than them keeping their habits. I cannot stress it enough. You are the one in pain, and I am sure they will see that and adapt for you.\n\nAs for your breathing, I would say you could practice making it slower and quieter. I have done this subconsciously over the years as a result of my misophonia, and its reeaaaally nice. The best thing you could do is to blow your nose as much as you can without drying it out too much, and then practice taking slow, shallow breaths every day just while sitting down until eventually you are able to incorporate it into your every day life. \n\nOne more thing I would suggest is to listen to some nice, loud white noise whenever you can. Try listening to it through headphones if you are able to. I know breathing can be extra loud through them, but you usually hear it less if something is playing. I personally listen to this video on repeat every single day: \n\n \n\nIf you do not already have one, you could get a fan in your room as well, or a radio. \n\nI hope that some of these suggestions help. Remember, nothing will get better if you do not keep ACTIVELY TRYING different things every single day, regardless of whether or not they stand in your comfort zone. This will be a tough as fuck battle, but i believe you can push through it as long as you keep trying and fighting. You have done an amazing job so far! If you want to talk more, you can message me. I will always be willing to listen. Thanks :)", "Does cannabis help? Please, does cannabis help? My sister is trying to kill me mentally. What keeps you trapped with your sister? Do you live in the same household? Yep. Not in my experience - it makes it worse for me.\n\nHeadphones and earplugs are the only real solutions I have found. I find whenever I am drunk/high I can stick a lot more noises and I would be less likely to find it as annoying as I usually do but it does not last very long probably about 30 mins to an hour until I start getting annoyed again. I guess it is just different for everyone. It depends. Some strains I find relaxing and become a lot more oblivious to certain sounds, which never happens sober and alleviates my miso. Other strains it is the opposite - I become super aware and even paranoid at times and I can hear everything. \n\nIt does not hurt to try it. Worst case it does not work, you get high for two hours and it is over. \n\nAlcohol helps IMO but I do not enjoy drinking. Psychedelics do not help and only make it worse for me. It helps me care less but that is just my experience For me yes, but it depends on the strain and only lasts whilst I am high. One of my favourite things is getting high and just being still listening to ambient/drone/noise music, with the right music every note is bliss. Thanks for the answers everyone! For me it depends on the strain as well. Indica dominant hybrids work best for my miso. Indica and CBD strains has helped me a lot.  It helps me cope with the anxiety and stress surrounding it but i still feel triggers in movies/tv shows when im high, which is one reason i never smoke with other people. yes. when i am high, noises hardly bother me.", "Looking for some guidance with quitting my job I have been with my current employer for just under 1.5 years. I am coming to the decision these past couple months that I need to draw a line here. I am in medical billing for an orthopedic/surgical practice. We are a 4-person department that handles a wide array of things (not just traditional billing things) for the 8 doctors working here. The workload is demanding and stressful, even when not being triggered. My workload was significantly increased in November and even after multiple reassurances from my manager that I would be taken care of financially, I was given no raise or bonus in December (I am not surprised, just disappointed). \n\nMy closest coworkers ultimately refuse to respect the one request I have repeatedly made to not trigger me all workweek long. I do not take their actions personally, they are mostly good people I guess, but I do not think it is healthy to continue working 40 hours a week in an environment where I am triggered this frequently (everyday guaranteed, usually several times a day). \n\nI am pretty ready to resign within the next month or so. I want to focus on a serious effort to get better more than anything. Idk what that means yet, I have tried working with several doctors over the last 3 years. But my parents are pretty supportive of my decision and I do have money saved up for the time being. I think getting better starts with bowing out of this fairly intense, unaccommodating work situation. My misophonia is the worst it is ever been and I do not want to go on like this. \n\nDo these sound like reasonable actions to take? Any advice or personal experience from a similar situation? I am just very tired of this place, I dread work all night and weekend long, and I am nervous. This is the second job I have had to step away from since February 2018 and is possibly \u201ctemporary career suicide\u201d as someone else put it, but I do not totally believe that. I guess I would like to hear that I am making healthy, logical choices towards a more sustainable future or what I could be doing better. I think you have given your situation serious consideration and thought. If sounds like your working environment is extremely stressful for you, which only intensifies your reactions to something irritating. I am sure the people you work with are doing the best they can to work for management that shows no respect or appreciation for their employees. \n\nYou are lucky you have family support. Get the help you need to cope with life, because sometimes it takes skills that take awhile to develop. Do not beat yourself up about what you need to do to be healthy. \n\nThere has to be a job out there that will be better for you. Keep looking, maybe try something different for awhile. Just do not give up chances to interact with other people, stay social. \n\nBe happy you have parents who are understanding and sympathetic, appreciate them!\n\nBest of luck to you. Get to the point where you can enjoy life and be happy Thank you very much for your opinion. I am committed to focusing on myself and my problems, confident in the resources around me so far, and hopeful that I can one day in the future find work that not only suffices but rejuvenates me. I am sorry to hear you are heading such a rough go of things in regards to your Misophonia. I have been in a similar situation where I worked reception in an environment where clients constantly made trigger noises in the waiting room. I loved my job, and my office manager was understanding of my situation, but the doctor was not and forbid me to remove myself to quieter areas. I would get angry and throw pens and kick boxes under the desk and it was just hard all around. You are so lucky to have family who supports you in this. If you can remove yourself from an environment that triggers you, and also one that does not seem to be professionally satisfying to you anymore, it would be a good idea to seize the opportunity. It would give you time to reset. Maybe in the future you could find a place that would allow you to use your skills and use headphones or sit in quieter areas while you work. Thank you. My situation reminds me so much of you. There is a lot I do not want to give up with this job. I have near unlimited breaks when needed (I drafted this whole thing at work this afternoon and no one gave me trouble) and the guy I report to in my department has looked out for me since the first interview when he insisted my boss take a chance on me. I have come to the conclusion I believe that, with all the good here, a job I truly find comfort in will be far better than one that simply allows me to cope with breaks etc. I really hope you are doing better these days and am looking forward to working on a better self, for me and everyone around me. I am sorry you are dealing with this! It sounds like you are looking for something new regardless of how misophonia affects you at work, but if you are interested in staying at this job, know that they are required to make reasonable accommodations for your disability, and you cannot be fired for making that request!

The Polyvagal Theory proposes that subjective responses to sounds are initially (before associative learning) based on two features of the acoustic signal: pitch and variation in pitch. The theory articulates that for mammals there is a frequency band of perceptual advantage in which social communication occurs. It is within this frequency band that acoustic \u201csafety\u201d cues are conveyed.\nConsistent with the theory, safety is signaled when the pitch of the acoustic signal is modulated within this band. Thus, a monotone within this band is not sufficient to signal safety. Moreover, the theory proposes that low frequency monotone sounds (e.g., dog\u2019s bark, lion\u2019s roar, large truck, and thunder) are inherent signals of predator and high frequency monotone sounds are inherent signals of pain and danger (e.g., shrill cries of babies or someone who is being injured).\n\n", "Anyone else super sensitive to the \u201cs\u201d sound, especially in public?

I can hear it loud and clear. I am not trying to blame you or make you feel bad for it. I just want to cover my ears and avoid it all without people judging and becoming defensive. I know that my brain's the problem, not your sounds and bad habits. Not to mention the sight triggers. Even if I cannot hear it, the sight of it gives me nearly the same effect.

However, what i did not notice in the 5 minutes I got to check out the apartment for inspection was that although it was three floors up, it was almost directly above the garage door for the complex and that the walls were razor thin... i could hear every door being slammed, every footstep of every neighbour above and around me and the garage door that screeched like fingernails on a blackboard every 5mins 24 hours a day. \n\nI slept with ear plugs in to no effect.

But in the end decided for my own wellbeing to just get out, i requested to break my lease, move back to my old house and pay the rent til they found someone else to rent it which they have, but not for another month. \n\nIt was an expensive experience and taught me a lot, but i know now i am not an apartment person! Friends who also live in apartments came to visit and initially said its just normal apartment noise, until they heard the garage door screeching and the stomping of the person above me, which they said was excessive and that it was just an unfortunate located apartment in the complex and to report it to the strata. At this point I am just happy to be out of there. I also had constant stress as i got numerous noise complaints from strata for my dog barking (barking at neighbours noises) and also he began to destroy the doors and poop on the carpet. I am pretty sure they were on the brink of kicking me out due to my dog anyway. Yeah I hate apartment living. I want to move into my own house on a quiet street. I know that feeling.\n\nEverytime i move i have that disappintment. On the bright side at least you have a choice go back to your house", "I feel guilty. I know that having this condition is not my fault and I should not feel bad about it, but really. I think some truly awful things about people I really care about just because they chew with their mouth open. I was talking with my dad today and he mentioned that the reason my mother is constantly licking her lips/ has her mouth open is because she took this medicine which had some side effects that she really did not want because she really needed some sort of anti-depressant. It did not even work, and the lip moving and open mouth stuff that irritates the crap out of me is not any fun for her either, and she was only doing it to relieve herself of mental pain, just like anyone here who is ever, say, chewed with their mouth open or listened to dangerously loud music to drown out your trigger. I just feel awful for thinking and muttering all these terrible things under my breath, forgetting to think about what is happening in the other person's head and why they are doing something and instead only thinking about how I feel. This is me in a heartbeat. I get exactly how you feel. I never have the courage to ask someone not use a trigger sound. For example, if someone is chewing with the mouth open, I never have the courage to ask them to close it. Your not alone. yes, I am always afraid to tell someone because I am worried they will think it is for attention, or that it will hurt their feelings. One of the biggest sound issue I have is someone slurping the milk in a cereal bowl(it is that specifically, I do not really care if it is soup or something else, I also do not know why it is that particular sound) and I have full on gotten pissed and snappy with people to sit as far away from me as possible if they insist on doing that. \n\nAnd then I just feel awful about it because they are just trying to eat breakfast and here I am being a complete asshole about it. And I really am not one most of the time. I feel you. Mine is similar. It goes: \"Why are these people doing this? Cannot they tell I am in pain?!\" To, \"I really should not be so angry at them. Would I tell them to stop drinking water? (Swallowing sounds kill me) To stop burping? (This also kills me) They are doing their best! They are even stifling their burps! (It does not help)\" \n\n\nThen, it moves to, \"I am the problem here. Not them. It is me. *Me.* Am I going to tell them to stop living their lives?\"\n\nAnd finally, \"I am a burden to them.\"\n\nI know these things are not true; I am not a burden, I cannot help having misophonia so this does not make me a selfish, demanding eejit (another thing that pops into my mind). Still. It hurts like crazy, and sometimes I just breakdown. I cry, and stay in bed for hours. I do not have my bath (triggers), brush (triggers) and the likes until well into the afternoon on extreme days. All the while I lie in bed, head buried in my pillow, crying.\n\nYou are not alone. \n\nKeep reminding yourself that, try as you might you do not have control over it. You are not being angry on purpose. You are not being selfish or demanding. You *cannot help it.* So there is no need to feel guilty. That is what I tell myself, and to be honest those extreme days have reduced. I relate to this as well. I know that I do not have control over it but my brain thinks about things from a multitude of perspectives. Sometimes, I think about all the times I have asked people to stop making a trigger noise and I wish they would just listen to me but I also think about how I need to let them live their life. I cannot help feeling guilty but also enraged at the same time. But how acceptable would it be for them to daily deal with nails on a chalkboard? If I am not supposed to stop them from \"living\" (like not doing trigger sounds is dying), then why are they allowed to stop me from my living? \n\nI have to be in my room moost of the time, always have to have earbuds in ears when going around my family eating, I am getting serious pain in neck because of my ticks, so I am the one being tormented and not being able to live my life, not them if they stop such a small thing. I cannot stop, they can. \n\nI am telling you, if you do not speak to people about it, nothing is going to happen. If you do not fight, you cannot win. There is always some middle ground where both sides can be happy.", "Do you think eating noises in food adverts should be banned, like flashing images? I was just about to start a YouTube video when a Cadbury advert came on for a cereal bar, with an overwhelming crunch. This was the type of crunch where it was not dramatized, but could be real crunching, which really set me off. And by dramatized crunches I mean like a chunk being broken instead of someone actually crunching hard or something like that. What do you guys think should happen with stuff like this, that could set people off? Should it be treated like epilepsy (a disorder I compare misophonia to a lot when someone tells me to 'deal with it'), where you cannot show flashing images, or have to show a warning?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a side note, it is interesting to see that 'misophonia' is still not considered a real word, due to the red underlining of it in this post. Makes you think really yes, yes i do!\n\nAs you say though, it is not really recognised.\n\nI was writing to someone on this sub the other day and said something along the lines of \"I am not sure you are allowed to talk about this with your parents\" and it made me realise how many of us are almost persecuted by those around us, particularly at a younger age, for trying to make ourselves heard.\n\nMaybe persecuted is too strong a word but from reading this sub it seems that very, very few of us are able to articulate our condition to our loved ones without fear of some kind of reprisal. Precisely. I have told my parents I have it, although I have not been medically tested for it because of...well want I am about to explain, but I do experience misophonia. My mum says she also has it, but does not really do much, and my dad will purposefully be loud, and say it is not real. Or he will say 'Its just in your head'. Like yes. My brain is in my head and there is something wrong with my brain. But you would not say autism or ADHD is not real. But yes I get what you are saying. The only real people I speak to about it are a friend diagnosed with it, and a really close friend, and she helps me speak about it I often say it is like dyslexia.\n\nI am almost 50 now. When I was a kid, dyslexia was not really very well known about and kids would get labelled as thick, stupid, bullied and teased etc because of it.\n\nNow dyslexia is fully recognised, people get extra time in exams, employers HAVE to make allowances etc etc. Very different times.\n\nSo at the moment it seems we are in a similar time to when dyslexia was not recognised. I work in a hospital and get access to research papers from a wide range of sources and there is a massive amount of research and theories popping up all over the place about miso.\n\nI guess there is an amount of 'we need to do what we can to understand this' but i would also put money on the probability that there is also a little bit of 'if we find a cure for this, our team will be famous'.\n\nWhatever. The research papers that I am seeing are mostly trying to come up with ways to narrow down exactly what miso is, in medical, scientific terms. Mostly seem to be split into the sources of the 'irritation' (to put it very, very mildly) including genetics and the human, social aspect of it. The other papers seem to be focused on empirical data on physical responses e.g. FMRI scans, cortisol, audio frequency sensitivity etc applied in different scenarios e.g. different groups watching the same film of someone eating with no sound and monitoring how different parts of the brain light up in response.\n\nSadly, nobody has brought their magic wand to any of these sessions and we are still no closer to finding a 'cure' but hey, at least more and more people know about it or are finding out about it. There is still no cure for dyslexia but at least sufferers of this condition are given more favourable conditions than they were a few decades ago.\n\nMmmm that was quite a long piece of writing. Hopefully that made sense and hopefully a little bit informative. If not, I think it probably did me good to get it out of my system heheh.\n\nAll the best bud :) Ah, interesting to see, and good to know as well. Also, seeing your close to medical, do you know how I can get diagnosed? Whether I have to go for hospital tests, or if a local not pharmacy but like Doctors office can actually diagnose it? I liked your epilepsy analogy btw, i think that works better than my dyslexia analogy in terms of the actual suffering endured.\n\nI do not know if it is possible to get diagnosed with miso yet. Possibly in the States. From what I understand it is a bit of a lottery if your medical practitioner has heard about it or not.\n\nI am in the UK. I am just beginning counselling with a psychiatrist. She would never heard of miso. I personally could not give a rat's butt if i get diagnosed or not, I just want to be normal and eat with friends and family.\nShe is recommending CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy). Considering she has never heard of miso, I suspect CBT might be her answer to everything. I HAVE had a glimmer of hope; I heard about EMDR which is a brand-new type of therapy Eye Movement Desensitisation R(?) cannot remember what the R stands for. It is been getting great results in trauma patients. I do not know much about it yet. But, again, it is using the psychology route as opposed to the medical route to try and find a solution. Ah ok, I am also from the UK so I guess we will have to see. and not heard of EMDR, but have CBT. The R might be the same R from the type of sleep you have when dreaming maybe? But I do not remember that one either lol. I said to my dad well I might need help with it and he said yeah they will make you stress test it, forgot what it was called, but basically listening to the sounds, and I said yes but I have already basically done that with my life, and the next option would be CBT. But guess I will have to wait and see From what I have heard, EMDR seems really interesting. But that is a whole different discussion.\n\nI approached \"Steps to wellbeing\". Free, NHS. I think it is only available to Dorset, Hampshire regions. If you live somewhere else in the UK then maybe just go online and search for something similar or speak with your GP. Guaranteed, they will be able to put you in touch with the right people to at least try and find out what is available for you to try.\n\n\n\nif you live outside of Hampshire/Dorset then this website can help you find the equivalent service in your area:\n\n Omg.  Ads for crunchy snacks?   I cannot reach for the remote fast enough. I cannot hit mute fast enough when the dude with the dental appliance takes it out. The sound that makes is legit traumatizing. And the woman with end-stage cancer and a tracheostomy who dies 2 days after filming an ad for....I forget. I am sure it is a grand cause, but the sound effects render said cause moot. \n\nEither Sonic or Rally ran a series of adverts that featured real American customers eating their products and *talking* while doing it. These people make livestock look like etiquette experts. And Kit Kat. Crunching obnoxiously to the beat of \"Give Me a break.... give me a break....break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar\"? I think not. Most emphatically not. Fuck this trend in advertising. It is abusive. I sometimes just want to scream into my hands and go deaf to deal with the noise. I know no one gives a damn about my misophonia and it is just so frustrating to deal with. It is just getting worse and worse  Absolutely I get a lift from a colleague to work and this radio advert came on and I kid you not, was a 30+ seconds ad of 2 women eating biscuits while discussing it. Literally eating while talking and constantly crunching non stop. Was absolutely vile and was struggling not to hit something. Can you imagine if someone had a reaction to that while driving? \ud83d\ude43\n\nThere are far too many ads who use eating noises, they should have a limit of how much they can have in 1 ad. Hard ***YES.*** A while back, there was some cookie ad that had a closeup of a kid eating a cookie, and &gt;!you could hear every last crunch as well as spit crackling in his mouth!&lt;*.* I would have to flee out of the room when it came on, because my mom does not believe miso is a thing. She just thinks I am being some kind of intentional asshole. Thank the Gods that my shrink does get it and is looking for ways to help.\n\n(Spoiler tag because I describe the sounds. Do not want to set anyone off.) Ah yes, people not beleieving is so annyoing and ughhhh\n\n(What is a shrink) A psychiatrist, and mine's a gem!", "Meetup in Minneapolis Every year since 2017 I have host a session at Minnebar as a meetup for local folks with Misophonia. It is very fun and informal. Every year it grows and it would be great to see people there. Here is more info and signup:\n\n(\n\n(\n\nMinnebar is a free tech conference put on by a local non-profit. It is very inclusive and anyone can host a session about anything. Food, happy hour and childcare care included. Odd that they would serve food.  I guess not everyone has that trigger though I guess. It is not a Misophonia conference, I am just doing a session in one quiet, closed room. People do need to eat did not a day - fortunately this is a giant venue and I have found lots of places to hide. Gotcha, my fault for not reading. Interesting to know about. I am actually in school for computer science right now and while I love it, I do worry about what future work environments will be like with open work spaces and the noises that they bring. I am in the Twin Cities areas and might have to check this out, thanks for sharing! ( and (\n\nHonestly the best hope is to find a job where you can work remotely. Open offices plague the computer science industry. Some companies understand that privacy can help productivity, most do not. I had to do a number of years in an open office before I worked up the repertoire and job security to demand the company allow me to work from home. That is also an option, but my advice is to find somewhere where you can work from home right from the start. It is not always a reality though, so do not dismiss the idea of going through hell in an open office for a little while to get the experience and job security so that you can ask to work from home. \n\nGitlabs is also another company to look into as they are completely remote. They like to hire young and talented people too.\n\nAnyways, that is my two cents. Good luck man.", "Do not mind me using yet another outdated meme format ", "Help? So, because I am pretty sure I have misophonia, I really need easy ways to cope with it.\n\nI am going to list a few things that do not work for me:\n\n-Moving to a different room ; my hearing is generally pretty good, and there are situations where I will be on a completely different level of my house and still hear a sound that makes me want to cry.\n\n-Music/Whitenoise; No matter how loud I blast it through my earbuds, I cannot get away from a sound.\n\n-Noise cancelling headphones; I talked to my father about it. He said, \u201cFor what? To isolate yourself more?\u201d My mother will say that they are too expensive or something.\n\n-\u2018Ignoring it\u2019/Zoning out, Not even possible at this point, never was possible\n\n-Trying to withstand it when I cannot move or do anything; It builds up so many negative emotions within me.\n\nIs there seriously anything I can do at this point? I just want to know if there are other ways people have coped with it because I am starting to think I am just going to have to endure it for as long as it is with me.\n\nI just want some advice. Sadly, the research on misophonia is extremely limited so there is really no easy fix. I honestly do not know how I get through each day but one thing that kind of works for me sometimes is mimicry. \n\nFor example, if I hear someone sniff/sniffle/snort, I can diffuse some of the stress it causes me by also sniffing. If people are sharing chips or something like that, I might join in even if I am not hungry because at least I am (usually) not triggered by my own crunching/chewing so it can work as a distraction.\n\nIn situations where you cannot actually hear the trigger noise but still feel lingering distress/anxiety from it, try closing your eyes and focusing on your breathing until your muscles relax. Personally I enjoy meditation and recommend it if it is something you are open to but I get that it is not everyone is cup of tea. Still, even just taking a few slow, deep breaths can be surprisingly effective in stressful situations.\n\nAnd you know what? If there is absolutely no way to physically escape the situation, I say there is no shame in sticking your fingers in your ears and singing \u201cLa-la-la-la I cannot hear youuuu\u201d\n\nOk, maybe that last one\u2019s a little immature and probably an unhealthy behavior and oh wait crap maybe I am the one who needs to find a better coping mechanism.\n\nWhen you get right down to it, misophonia is too complex for any kind of \u201ceasy fix\u201d to exist. Over the years, I have personally developed very specific strategies for very specific situations that I frequently find myself in but I am still very limited in the advice I can give despite my lifelong experience with misophonia. \n\nEveryone experiences misophonia differently. We all have different triggers. And these triggers can change over time or affect us differently in different situations. For some of us, we just need to feel like we are in control of the noise, while others can be triggered by the same noise regardless of context. We even all react differently to triggers. Some get angry, some get aggressive, some get panicky, some get sweaty, some get physically ill or nauseated.\n\nI do not know all the intricate details of your experience with misophonia, so I cannot tell you how to deal with it. I cannot give you a magical cure or a miraculous solution. Heck, I cannot even give you a nice little list of helpful tips and tricks or anything like that.\n\nMaybe mimicry and breathing exercises will work for you. Maybe you will get those noise canceling headphones someday and maybe those will work for you.\n\nYour triggers are your triggers.\n\nYour misophonia is your misophonia. \n\nYour coping mechanisms are your coping mechanisms.\n\nIt is messy. It is confusing. It is frustrating. It is lonely and awful and kind of terrifying and it takes a lot of kicking and screaming and blood and sweat and tears to figure out the right coping mechanisms and personal strategies.\n\nMisophonia is a deeply personal experience and it sucks. But you are not alone on this journey. You can survive this. You can find a coping mechanism that works.\n\nAnd I am sorry that all I can give you is anecdotal advice and a couple of encouraging words. But until misophonia is actually medically recognized, all I can say is: I believe in you.\n\nI do not know who you are, where you are from, or what your story is, but I believe that you are suffering. And I believe that things will get better for you. It is painful, but you can do this. You can absolutely kick your misophonia\u2019s butt and show it who is boss.\n\nIt is really really really hard sometimes, but you will find a way eventually. You will figure it out. Your feelings are valid and so are you. You can be strong. \n\nAnd I am here for you. And this subreddit is here for you. And I am willing to bet there are people in your life who care about you and will be open minded about your misophonia and support you while you look for a coping mechanism that works for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut yeah lol I am not really one to talk I still completely lose my shit sometimes when I get triggered You are one to talk actually.\n\nReading that gave me more hope.\n\nI used to think I was crazy or overly sensitive, I mean I am naturally pretty sensitive, but misophonia brings it to a whole new extent.\n\nYou are right, it is pretty different for a lot of us.\n\nAnd knowing that this subreddit exists is quite amazing. I do not have to feel alone about it anymore, we can all help each other.\n\nIt is pretty amazing, knowing we all can relate to an extent.\n\nBecause I think maybe before we all figured this out, we all felt really alone with it.\n\nYour words are really touching, because I feel like as if I can deeply connect with you.\n\nThe thought of knowing I could not get rid of it, it was pretty horrible.\n\nBut all you say is true; every single word.\n\nI know it is not easy to just easily figure a way out to deal with things, and I guess that saddens me a little bit, but I do believe I will find a way eventually.\n\nPlease just know that reading that really meant a lot to me.\nThank you. Oh my gosh you are so sweet. I am so happy my words had a positive impact on you. I have not even been on this sub very long but I agree that it really is amazing to know that a supportive and uplifting community can exist for people like us. It is so incredible we were able to have this connection but I do not know if my heart will be able to handle all the love and compassion I am trying to express to you right now. Oh my goodness you just seem like such a lovely person I want you to just go out there and live your best life and find an effective way to handle your triggers aaaaaa have a wonderful day you gorgeous stranger I am going to cry!\n\nI know you are just an internet stranger, but I want to try to remember what you have told me.\n\nBecause it just means so much, you are literally so amazing.\n\nYou told me everything that I have been needing to hear, and I cannot express how grateful I am to of read what you have told me!", "Growing sick to the point of vomiting of pictures of screaming athletes shoved in my eyes.

Its just like this e\\*\\*ng sound app (these sounds are luckily not a trigger for me) recently shown on the subreddit, the audacity!!! I feel your hardship.\n\nLook Ik their celebrating because they won or whatever, they can scream if they want, but the media needs to stop constantly shoving it in my face, its simple, just put these photos as sensitive content, or any cheering videos just block out the sound (as an option) because it makes me want to scream the entire house down. This makes me laugh a little because it is so relatable!!!! I do not want to see anyone else\u2019s tongue, ever.

The thing with visual screaming/celebrating (how I described it above) do not really make me feel like I want to vomit (i.e. something gross such as popping spots etc) but it makes me extremely angry, I start sweating and my face goes extremely hot. lipgloss! Fr? i wear it all the time makes me feel super pretty &amp; my lips super plump &amp; sensual. \nDo you feel rage when you see it? No, just disgust and nausea. My eyes are not great so if I am not wearing my glasses and do not look directly, luckily it is okay, just mild ew. I could never kiss someone with that stuff on, for sure. Luckily (in this very specific case) I am only attracted to men and they usually do not. I mean i kiss no one so I am good lol. But what would you call this? It is not misophonia or misokinesia, is it related? It is so similar to both. Its exactly the same feeling I get with wet sounds. It is just another part of my whole constellation of sensory issues. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I have a similar experience watching sports, but with the constant close-ups of coaches chewing gum, which it why I do not watch sports.\n\nI am curious about the trigger of wide open mouthes though; did it start off being connected to a sound, or is it kind of its own thing? I have hyperacusis too, the triggers started off with loud noises, that including laughter, and screaming etc. Its become a visual trigger as well", "PTSD question Does anyone else have misophonia as a symptom of PTSD? My sound sensitivity seems to only happen when I am really tired or anxious. I have PTSD and always thought it caused my misophonia because I recall the first time I experienced miso was right after the trauma. I asked a psych about it and she said it it is possible that the traumatic event set the miso off but there is not enough research to know exactly how they are related, but that most likely they are interrelated. There are many, many people who have miso and no trauma though. yup. A lot of my misophonia triggers are either directly or indirectly from the trauma", "I cannot do it it is getting too much for me. I have tried everything. Earplugs, earphones, meditation, you name it, it just does not work. school is torture. it is not even every lesson I get triggered, kid say it is actually a minority of the classes that trigger me. but them few lessons and being at home, around triggers, it jut drains me. every morning I cry before school because I know that at one point in the day, I will feel trapped and panicked and there is nothing I can do. \n\nmy school has allowed me to leave the class if need be, but it is too difficult. I cannot even leave the class properly because of COVID so what is the point if once u come back, the trigger will be back? it also takes ages to even be allowed to leave lesson as they have to email the reception but it often takes an hour to get a reply. I just... do not know anymore. \n\nI have even began to tic. I get triggered, i tic. the tics only get more aggressive and then it hurts my neck. and then because i tic so much, even when I am not triggered i tic. I do not want to get bullied. I do not want to be like this. why, why do I have to have this? I want to be able to hear someone chewing their fucking pen without visualising me punching them, without all the emotions I feel, I want to just be \u2018normal\u2019. no one actually gets it apart from my mom who even then does not fully. I do not expect them to, I just want to be able to vent to my friends and know they slightly understand. All they think it is is that I get irritated easily, or annoying sounds annoy me a bit more than normal. \n\nI want to be able to live a normal life, and not breakdown before social events, simply because someone will be chewing loud and I have to mentally prepare myself for it. I have noticed that when my mental health is down, my misophonia is worse. But then because of miso, my mental health gets worse then making my miso worse and it is just a viscous cycle that I do not know how to end because, I cannot. I wish there was something I could do. I can only think of one thing: when you are old enough and have enough money, get a house with soundproof walls. It is not very helpful, and I really do want to help, so please, just remember that everyone on this subreddit is here for you. We understand, we empathize, and we try our best to help, even if it does not help. You are not alone. You could see a psychiatrist or therapist, you could look for the best 'gear,' just try your best to make it through. We will be here, rooting you on. Please post this to r/askdocs if you can, I would really like to see how they might chime in. One suggestion I would make is seriously having a discussion with your parents about this and finding a medical team that understands and can help. I really urge you to do this as fast as you can, and please let every professional know everything. For example, if they try exposure therapy and you cannot do it, do not even try it. I cannot give you advice over a text, but that is the best I can do and I am so sorry. I wish you the best and if we all work together we might be able to solve this but terrible \"disorder\", we cannot do it alone. Are you seeing anyone for misophonia or other mental health difficulties? If not, I really think it would help you - even just venting to a counselor or psychologist who can advocate for you for better accommodations at school. My therapist recently suggested I look into medication - not to treat the misophonia but to help with the anxiety that makes it worse. I have been on medication before and am not quite sure it will be worth it for me to do that again, but worth looking into if it could help break out of that vicious cycle.  It really helps to have someone on your side who believes you, even if they are not an expert. Are you getting enough sleep, are you eating healthy and regularly 3 meals a day? Giving priority to these things helped a lot in my case. I do not know how old you are but you may want to look into online classes.  Also look into doctors in your area who may be able to get you white noise hearing aids, I have heard good things. Lastly, do not be afraid to speak up if something is bothering you. You might feel like a bitch, but it is not a big deal and most people would not want to be bothering someone in the first place if they can help it.", "amateurs  Got To have backups Related note, my math teacher let me listen to white noise during a math test today.

I have always had misophonia (I do not like loud noises or chewing), but it was manageable. Now, I think because of constant exposure to noise, things that I would be able to handle I no longer can. I feel so bad, my mum and sister were having an innocent conversation at the kitchen table and I had to leave the room because the sound of them talking sounded SO LOUD to me. Like they are trying to get Siri to transcribe everything they say, that is what it sounds like. \n\nI am scared.

My Dad is my biggest trigger because he has anger issues and slams doors, yells, chews with his mouth open, screams at TV, etc. He also breaks and drops a lot of things out of carelessness and it is just very hard to live with. Yesterday, though, I was in the living room with my sister and we were talking at a normal volume and he shoved his fingers into his ear, sighed really loudly, and started slamming his hands on the table. Turns out he was reading the newspaper and we were bothering him...despite the fact that he has an office, his bedroom, and an upstairs room that is lovely and quiet. My point is that when he yells and carries on and we complain, he says we should go elsewhere because it is the \"family room\", but when we have a conversation, it is suddenly \"his house\" and we are not allowed to talk unless it is in our bedrooms with the door closed. It just feels really hypocritical. I feel so unwanted and like i am not supposed to exist, or not welcome here (even though I know he loves me, and my Mum is great and I know she wants me there). \n\nANYWAY, im so so sorry for this long rant, but I am basically just so scared that I am going to turn into my dad. I hate the feeling of being unwelcome in my own home and I do not want my future roommate/husband/kids to ever feel like that. But if people having a conversation makes me need to leave the room because my head starts to hurt from the noise, how am I going to do that? \n\nYou are all welcome to vent in the comments, just get it all out LOL. Does your dad have misophonia too by chance? I realise it sounds like that but no. He just likes to be alone. I have tried to tell him about my\nMiso phobia and he does not get it at all. I feel like if he had it he would be like omg that is me He also never leaves the room because of any noise. Pain and suffering are a part of life. I know I have had my fair share of pain, and I am sure everyone else has. Those who have Misophonia, like you and me, live a life filled with fear and pain. You will be triggered again, and it will hurt. So here is my advice, worry about what you can control, and not about what you cannot. Will you have a trigger again? Of course, so do not worry about that, focus on how you can manage that reaction. Seek therapy, noice cancelling headphone(I always have these on me), medication(I personally am against this but maybe you would find it works for you), meditation, and more. Have a plan, and use it. Misophonia makes us live our days anxiously waiting for pain. Do you best to look forward for the good times, and bask in them when you are in them. I cannot stress enough that pain is temporary. It sucks and is awful but it does end. And makes the good days that much better. Focus on the changeable and remember things get better. Best of wishes! Thank you so much :) I have experimented with a medication and I am very much against it too. I will look into noise cancelling headphones. I think he is in denial. I am sorry you have to deal with all of it. I can relate so much. I often walk around the house with at least one ear plugged. Otherwise I get a meltdown. With cyber Monday coming up you can get some nice wireless ones for a good deal. Over ears are good for home use but I love my enacfire f1 headphones. Super cheap and work well with music. Also Musi is a free app with no sound adds, that plays YouTube.", "Every time my neighbour's child is jumping from a bed I want to kill myself No kidding.

They are trying my patience", "Had to get up from the table because of people chewing I am literally pissed right now. I have known for a long time that sounds were an issue for me. Breathing, chewing, clicking GETS to me. But I can normally breathe thru it and try my best to ignore it. For the first time today, I had to remove myself from being surrounded by three people eating donuts and chewing like they have never been taught how to eat before. I was about to literally lose it. I wanted to scream. So, I went to the bathroom and I feel like I am going to chew the insides of my cheeks off to keep from telling everyone to shut the actual hell up. I have never wanted to throw a donut at the floor so bad in my life. I do not know why I could not just ignore it this time but I am still PISSED about the noises I was hearing. My daily life I am really sorry that you feel like this daily. It is enraging. Lol, it is really bad, my stepfather chews like a dragon , makes a inhumanly thin voice, and does random awful sounds like \u201cuUHGHh\u201d, at least I am leaving my house for a month I hate these times too when I go visit my grandmother with my family I have to sit in a quiet room with people chewing gum VERY loudly and I can hear each breathe they take People who cannot eat in silence are the worst. This is one of the most basic things: shut your mouth when eating, ffs.\n\nI almost lost it yesterday when someone in my guild in a game was eating in my headphones. The sound is absolutely disgusting. I understand exactly what you mean OP.  Your reaction is understandable and far better than losing your shot on the spot.\n\nI started carrying earplugs around now and use them if urgent. I explain why and apologize but still, some people won\u2019f understand. \n\nI actually left a library once because of all the keyboard tapping noises. Sometimes going away from the problem is the only solution. I have to do this often, almost daily. It sucks, but most people eat so loud (or, I suppose, I am just annoyed too much by them). Going away is better than getting uselessly angry and upset.", "Does anyone feel like a total jerk after an episode? I am currently living with my dad -- and he likes to eat ALL DAY LONG. And he eats loudly without a care in the world, knowing I have misophonia. I get sooo angry and just put totally on edge every single time he starts eating something; I have to literally turn away from him so I do not see him eating, clamp my ears shut with my fingers, and curl up in a semi-ball on the couch. I feel like I want to rip my own ears off and shove them somewhere so I will not have to ever hear anymore. The other day I literally walked out of the living room until he finished eating, even though we were in the middle of watching something.\n\nI get pissed and become irritable/angry for up to an hour after the eating has stopped..\n\nAnd then later I feel like I was an irrational jerk who overreacted...until next time he starts eating, and it starts all over again.\n\nDoes anyone else have these guilty feelings after an episode? Like, I cannot control it but I feel bad. I get that you feel bad, but you should not. This is an involuntary reaction. I can imagine that you might think, \"but this is just a common sound, why am I reacting this way, I should be able to control it, something must be wrong with me.\"\n\nBut of course involuntary means you do not have control.\n\nFirst, I would try talking to your dad and explaining this the best you can. Try sites like Misophonia International or the Mayo Clinic. \n\nSecond, if you can, try noise cancelling headphones and find a noise that drowns out the triggers for you. My daughter has been dealing with misophonia and eating sounds also bother her. She wears headphones and listens to brown noise at meals, which she says drowns out the sounds better than white noise (and there are other colors of noise as well).\n\nI think leaving the room is a fine idea, and I would do it as often as necessary, and feel no guilt. I do the curling up on the couch too. But u can do it only for a while. Also u have to cover ur ears subtly so that ur parents will not notice otherwise they will scold u for ur \"overreaction\" or laugh at you. This is what happens to me. I get like that. It is like having a split personality. As soon as the noise stops, I am like \"well, was it really that bad? Maybe I should not of said anything...\"But when it starts again, I am irritated, if not full on angry, all over again. I do not think you should feel bad, as others have said it is an involuntary reaction. Some things that have helped me and my loved ones are:\n\n1) sending loved ones easy-to-read/minute-long read resources explaining misophonia (this may only work if they are open to learning unfortunately)\n\n2) *and this is my big one!* If you are able to, I highly recommend investing in a set of Loops ear plugs, or something similar (there are less expensive alternatives on the market too!). They are specifically designed to alleviate noise stressors while still allowing voices and conversation to be heard/kept. Getting a pair of Loops Experience changed my entire mealtime - I can now peacefully sit with my roommate -both my best friend and my biggest agitator because of the way he eats- while we eat meals together and I feel none of the symptoms of misophonia because I hear *none* of his awful eating sounds. \n\nTruly the earplugs have been a massive lifesaver, but the fact that I have empathetic people in my life who are willing to try and understand the struggle helps too. If you want any links for easy reading on misophonia that you can share, let me know! I can DM you some\n\n(Edited for formatting - sorry you all I am on mobile) Thanks you for the comment band suggestions! I will have to look into headphones/earbuds - I had not thought of that before. \n\nAlso, I just want to say I am so glad you are empathetic/understanding toward your daughter with this - my family never was when I was growing up (I am 23 now, thankfully moving out alone soon lol). My mom used to do the same thing when I lived with her (either laughing or getting extremely angry about it). Hope things get better for you in that regard! Exactly! Glad I am not the only one lol Thanks for the tips! Unfortunately, my dad has read those things I have sent to him and either does not get it or does not care. (Fortunately I will be moving out soon though.) And I will definitely look into headphones/earplugs in the meantime! Yeah, I tend to realize \"oh jeez, maybe I overreacted\" after an episode of any kind as well. What may be even worse is realizing you may be overreacting in the middle of an episode, but not being able to stop.\n\nAs others have said, do not feel too guilty about an involuntary reaction, though I do recommend trying to acknowledge that you did not mean it if the episode involved getting angry at someone (not necessarily saying you ever did, but I know it happens to some people, me included).\n\nRegardless, I recommend talking to him about this; if he is a reasonable person, chances are he will understand and will try to manage it. My family is aware that the sound of &gt;!silverware scraping against a plate!&lt; is really unpleasant to me and will try to avoid it (and will usually apologize when they accidentally do it), for instance. Unfortunately, I have known some people that do not seem to care that it is genuinely painful for me to have to listen to those sounds (or are awful enough to find it funny, even) and will intentionally make them anyway. Thanks Yes, I get this way with my boyfriend \ud83d\ude2d he understands but I always feel like crap after. He mainly just gets dirty looks but I still feel awful \ud83d\ude05 I feel you with wanting to rip your own ears out!! Misophonia literally makes me wish I were deaf which I know is kind of insensitive to deaf people but damn hearing nothing sounds way better than having to curl up in a ball and plug my ears and try not to cry for hours every day.", "When you lay down for a 30 minute nap with a migraine and your roommate decides it is the perfect time to train hard dog She has such a sharp, stern voice that seems to cut through the air no matter where I am (plus she is wearing headphones so it is louder than normal because she cannot hear herself) and so much repetitive clapping. She was perfectly silent doing work before and of course\u2014of course it is only when I am trying to lay down. Anybody else have issues with certain people\u2019s tones/repetitive noises? Now my head hurts from the migraine and the sounds. I have issues with certain tones of voice idk if that is a misophonia thing or not but its been a real issue recently especially with my mom cause she constantly sounds irritated plus I have not told anyone I know irl so yeah", "Do not really know wether I have misophonia or not. I (16M) do not remember being distressed by any kind of sound like tapping or crinkling sounds, but when it comes to  chewing noises, sniffling  or  tongue licking, I get some moderate distress. My dad is the one who bothers me the most, when we have lunch together he is just too noisy and I get really annoyed, I once asked him unpolitely to stop and that made him really upset. I do not want that to happen again, so I just rush my meal and go to my room, where I try to forget that awful sound. I am in the same situation but I have had this for a year that I am aware of. While I do not have any real advice, I want you to know you are not alone, even if you do not experience stress from other triggers you will not be judged for saying you have misophonia, and no matter what the cause, your feelings and thoughts about your mental situation are valid.\n\nIf you look through other posts here there are likely several people who have asked similar things and may have answers on how to cope. First of all you are not a bad son. My own parents dismissed me and thought I was being rude or dramatic for having breakdowns or removing myself from situations when they kept doing my trigger sounds. Misophonia is not something you can control. It also did not help that \"psychologist\" in my teenage mental hospital thought the same exact thing.\n\nAlso, only being triggered by specific people, such as family members, is common. Sometimes strangers tick me off but sometimes they do not. However family members make trigger noises always set me off and make me want to bash my head in the wall.\n\nMisophonia is an experience that very few relate to and even those that try to understand still will not. I suggest trying to sit down with your dad one day when the time is right, when you are not eating, explain that you have this very real and serious neurological condition, and politely remind him it is not your fault you have it, and most importantly, ask him for permission to request for them to stop or the free ability to remove yourself from situations. If you get told you are being a brat, being dramatic, or show them facts about Misophonia. Just be honest. Understand also that they are not going to understand what you are going through at first. I think it is typical that some sounds are easy to ignore, but others seem to take up your entire brain. Do not worry to much about the \"why this noise\" because it does not make sense. \n\nIf you are in the car with your dad, can you get him talking about something so he would naturally stop making teeth noises? Or turn on some music? It is really hard when eating a meal together though.", "The love of my life understands. I sat down with him and said, \"Listen... I have a neuropsychological condition. It is called 'misophonia'. And I\u2014\"\n\nI needed go no further. His eyes widened as understanding hit him. \"Ohhh... that is why you keep leaving the room when I (insert trigger onomatopoeia here). If I want to eat that, you can chase me into the spare room.\"\n\nAnd then he read anything he could get his hands on regarding this disorder. It is now to the point where he will hold up a food item and just say \"Spare room?\". It helps that he knows some Dialectical Behavior Therapy stuff.\n\nTwenty-one years, communication, therapy... and patience. He is my everything. Congratulations- sounds like you found a good one! \u2764\ufe0f That just made me chuckle- you got yourself a keeper! Yond just madeth me chuckle- thee did get yourself a keeper!\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Um... thanks?? Wow, congrats! I hope I find one like that. :D Blessings to you both! I adore this story. He truly takes an interest in you and what makes you, you! That is how it should be.\n\nI have not been with my SO for that long, but I explained it to him early on (in the least dramatic way possible). He looked at me more with fascination than anything, and then asked me to let him know whenever I am being triggered.\n\nLove and support goes such a long way. He is a keeper like mine! I love that you also have someone wise and compassionate! Yes indeed! Thanks, he makes life a lot brighter :)", "Finally confronted a family member about a trigger and it did not go over well I did not know misophonia was a thing up until a week ago when I literally looked up, \"Hearing people chew makes me want to cry\". Lmao. But I have felt this way about chewing and other things for years now, I just thought maybe I had anger issues and was being over-emotional this whole time.\n\nMy dad, love the guy, but he always does the things that trigger these extreme emotions I feel. Disgusting spitting, loud chewing, weird mouth/throat sounds, plate scraping, etc. I have not brought up the term misophonia because I feel like I would not be taken seriously, but he is also a complete asshole about what annoys me and will intentionally walk up to me and start chewing loudly. Tonight it was the plate scraping, which I am sure infuriates ANYBODY, but especially me because ofc with misophonia I usually either get teary-eyed or INSANELY angry.\n\nHe refuses to use plastic forks and always uses regular forks on plates and is always so rough with it. Tonight I put my headphones in and tried to block it out but it did nothing because he is SO loud. So I took them out, and I had always said something about it before, but this time I was more intense with it. I told him I was being 100% serious when I tell him that it literally drives me crazy and that he ALWAYS does this and he told me to just put my headphones in. I told him I did but he is so loud it does not matter. Arguing ensued and long story short it did not end well. I tried so hard to let him know that I was being genuine and this is something that really bothers me, and he got mad and offended over it like he was the one it was affecting.\n\nI am already an emotional person and I barely EVER argue with my parents, so that + the emotions I felt from the scraping are all hitting me hard rn and I really want to just have a good cry but I cannot lol. I will just have to suck it up like I ALWAYS do. I hate this. It took myself a couple of years to get my family to understand my misophonia. Sadly, I snapped before it before they understood completely. But it was my release of built up emotions that showed them I was serious about Misophonia. So, I would recommend that you feel those emotions. Cry if you want to. Crying is not a weakness. There is strength in feeling emotion. But I would also recommend taking action. Dwelling in your sorrows sucks. So take initiate. Study Misophonia, keep telling others about misophonia, embrace this part of yourself. And when it gets extremely hard, and cannot go on alone, do not. Find someone willing to stay by your side. Best of luck with what ever decisions you make. Thanks for the advice, I rly appreciate it I guess the good thing is that now you know that miso is a real thing and you are not the only one. But yeah, the sad truth is that you have to be careful who you tell about this because some people are going to continually \"test\" you to see if you react. It sucks bigtime. Why cannot you cry? I dunno, for me, crying helps release the agita. Could you go in the shower and cry?\nI find if I have underlying issues with a person, whatever noise they make seems to be ten times worse. Sometimes addressing the issues works, sometimes avoiding the person works.\n\nWhat helps me is to take some deep breaths when the trigger starts, and just focus on my breath and my own body, and not try to ignore the sound, just let it be what it is, let the anger bubble up, and breath thru it. It works most of the time now. I could not cry at the time of writing this because I was around others but best believe I have been crying for the last 20+ minutes now that I am alone lol. \n\nThanks alot for the advice I know how you feel. I am 18 and still never taken seriously. My dad thinks I am just an asshole even after I told him about misophonia and any time I show a reaction to my triggers, he gets pissed off at me and responds by either screaming at me or exaggerating his sounds more. If I were you, I would absolutely blast the headphones, or just refuse to eat with him anymore. I have pretty much stopped eating with my dad but idk if you are allowed to eat in your room. I know the interaction was not ideal because you were caught up in your feelings and overwhelmed. But these interactions rarely ever go the way we want because no matter how we phrase it, it sounds like and feels like we are telling the other person that they are doing something wrong. It seems like the only way we can make this work is to approach the conversation that there is something wrong with US and they are not doing anything wrong by making noises but could they please please keep those noises to a minimum and be accommodating just to help us out. I do not think anyone is really at fault here but the default reaction from noise makers is to get defensive because they are feeling called out for something that is not hurting anyone (in their eyes). \n\nI am so sorry. I do not think we should have to tiptoe around these conversations but it is been the only successful way in my experience. Crying is a natural sign of being upset. There is no healthy reason you should have to be alone in order to cry.", "I think I have misophonia, but I want to confirm. ", "Could being THIS triggered by others sex noises be from my misophonia? So I live with a young couple close to my age(f26). I am closer to the girl as she is in the same sort of carreer path as me, and also yeah she is a girl so there is that. The guy is sweet too.  \nOne thing is that we live in quite an old house. The furnishing looks like it is been done by a 7 year old and the doors do not at all shut the whole way.  \n\n\nTo the point. When they have sex I can hear EVERYTHING. I think for anyone who hears their roomies having sex would feel uncomfortable and put the music louder. But really, I feel my skin crawl. I immediately get sad and insanely anxious. Like I want to run away from my home. I got some loop earbuds and sound proof headphones which I IMMEDIATELY put on when I feel the slightest chance they could get going. It just feels painful all over. Just like with triggers nonetheless.  \n\n\nTheire not even that loud. But they f\\*ck quiite a lot. Not to mention that he is poly and brings home some girl now and then(not that often thank god). They are aware that I can hear it as my stupid boyfriend blurted it out to them without my permission(and i told him off for it haha). And it is not like I do not want them to have sex! I am quite sex positive, although my libidos really low. I mean yeah it could be I get triggered because I had a very conservative upbringing. But I also feel like I have working so hard to get pass that. And it just hit me one day, and I do not know why I have not thought of it before: It might as well be misophonia trigger?(BTW I dont get triggered watching porn!?)  \n\n\nAnd yeah I will totally just pop my headphones on forever... \n\nBut really it is made me super anxious about  being home with them. Whenever I hear a small noise that could indicate sex, even if it isnt sex - I just feel myself going into this weird zone of \"Oh my god no theire going to have sex nooo i have to get my headphones!\" And Its suuuuper stressful and not a good situation for me...   \n\n\nThe guy is also THE LOUDEST person eating in the entire world. I have not told him I have misophonia. There is just NO WAY I am telling him. I do not know why, but now I feel like now the time when I should have said something has passed. Whenever I see him with food I either leave or put my loops on.&gt;! He slurps and smacks, eats with open mouth, licks his fingers louder than anyone I have ever met.!&lt; It is insane. And no one else seems to mind???? which I know as asked both my boyfriend and his girlfriend. I even told him that he is a loud, but I cannot get myself to ask him to lower it.... just thinking about it makes my back crawl and punch a hole in the wall...  \n\n\nI have been moving around way too many times the two last years.. I am just scared I will have to move again. OVER THIS?? I mean I hope to move in with my boyfriend when he finishes Uni, but it is a bit soon as we cannot afford anywhere. Also I wish I could talk openly about it, but I just cannot make me... Anyway it is not like I think it would change if I did ask... I am just so tired of being alert all the time... The eating noises sound far worse than the sex sounds, but minus the panoply of ick that many folks experience when exposed to evidence of intimacy from people who are not their own sex partners. \n\nI would imagine there are some templates for letters you could give your housemates vis a vis the sex noises; likewise, ways to soundproof their quarters from the rest of the home. Standard advice like white noise generators for your own area and ANC headphones for others applies. Sometimes this is as cost effective as foam earplugs. Depends on the intensity of your response, I guess.\n\nNow might be a good time to introduce to them the subject of misophonia. Tbh, the dude sounds like a walking nightmare, but if he is willing to hear you and your extensive library of cited scientific articles and videos out, there may be hope for your situation. Dogspeed. It sounds like it is worsened because of his eating. Like you are more triggered by it because you are aware how loud he is. People eat really loudly and it annoys me so much - like who do you think you are eating so loud! Lol.\nIt will lessen with time, but saying something now will not help. Keep distracting yourself and minimise listening to them eat.\nIf they have sex, either ignore them or leave the house. It sucks, but it will get easier. I promise.

My anxiety has gotten way worse and it seems as the weeks go by my days off get shorter and shorter in dread going back to my job. I spend my days off looking at the clock waiting for \"Monday to start\" all over again.\n\nSo we have finished training this one new guy and that means the guy who works in the back office with me will return full-time meaning I will not have the office to myself anymore but on Saturdays which is his day off. I am in fight or flight all day long when he is back there. He sniffles loudly, coughs after he eats for hours, and randomly clears his throat so loud I jump in my chair and it is visible and so embarrassing.\n\nThere is also a problem I am having. I have acid reflux pretty bad and it settles in my throat and I have to clear it often (I know, how ironic that it is my biggest trigger too). I am not loud with it but I am scared to do it in front of other people. I can only cough and clear my throat when I am alone. I have no idea why I am like that, but I think it is a sympathy thing? Like I feel like everyone else is triggered by that sound so I try not to do it.\n\nThe past few months when I have been working once a week with this person I have skipped eating lunch because eating makes my throat worse. But now that he is returning full-time I cannot just starve myself all day. I do not know what to do.

Noise cancelling headphones and maybe a new job. Thank you", "Active Noise Cancelling Headphones I am looking into getting ANC headphones particularly to deal with bass low frequency intrusion. Any suggestions on what to get/avoid ? i am not an expert, so please take this with a grain of salt\nI bought AirPods Pro, but they have not arrived yet, but from what i have tried they appear to be kind of good. They are in-ear headphones though, so you should probably not expect a miracle from them. I would advise to stay away from the Samsung beans, as their active noise canceling sucks.\n\nOver-ear headphones are usually way better, but they come at the price of portability and well... price. I have seen good reviews of the AirPods Max, but they are probably only a better option if you have an iPhone or an apple product to pair with. And they are pretty expensive (US$550).\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4 may be a better option if you are looking to save some money (US$350) and it is considered one of the best active noise canceling headphones.\nYou may want to do some extensive research before buying any headphones, and for that there are many great youtube channels. My favorite is called dankpods, he talks about everything related to audio and is pretty funny.\nGood luck! Thanks for the feedback (pun intended)   wow I have never heard of the WH-1000XM4 being recommended as the money saving option. Did something change? I thought they were the best ANC headphones available last I checked. How are earbud for staying in your ears vs headphones staying on your head? My Sony WH-1000XM4 keeps slipping off when I do anything that requires tilting my head forward. Not exactly great for 24/7 wear.\n\nThinking of getting some ANC earbuds for use in bed as well as while I am doing anything requiring a lot of head movements, so I can truly have 24/7 ANC, but idk how well earbuds would stay on.

The difference is he does not have misophonia and when it takes him a while to get to sleep it is usually like 15 minutes, he usually conks out when his head hits the pillow. I would love to fall asleep that quickly but I have got to do breathing exercises and counting and relaxation techniques. By the time I am even close to relaxed he is started snoring so loudly the bed vibrates. He is always like \"oh just wake me up babe\" and I do but it makes me more and more angry. When I do finally fall asleep it is hours after I am meant to and when he is stopped snoring briefly. Then the next day I start work from home at 6.45am and he gets up for work about that time too so he will be in the kitchen (where my desk is) clinking dishes, moving stuff, getting ready etc and it is just so loud and sometimes makes me really jumpy so then I am feeling anxious and angry. Then when he comes home at 5:10 he will start his dinner or he will do the dishes and more clinking and moving stuff and just noises and by this point I am exhausted, have not finished work yet (I finish at 6.45pm) I am tired bc I did not sleep well, working all day and now all these noises are happening and I try my hardest just to be chill but I end up flipping out so often, he will then remind me that I should not have moved my desk to the kitchen from the bedroom.

She is seeing a therapist who is using cognitive behavioral therapy, I hope you can find something similar. She is bothered by the same sounds you are, and she is found a method to cope. She wears noise-canceling headphones and listens to brown noise during meals. She says this drowns out the sounds better than white noise or music, and it also allows us to have a conversation with her, we just need to speak up.\n\nThere is a rainbow of noises, so one may work better for you. Just remember if white noise does not work, there are others you can try. Sometimes she eats in another room, but the headphones have helped a lot.\n\nFirst, though, please find someone to tell/talk to, ideally your parents.

It is been around 3 months I found out I have misophonia. My father is my main \"trigger-person\" and the way he chews when we have lunch together may cause me strong feelings of anger and anxiety, he also made the habit of doing mouth noises all of sudden, which led me to feel distress and anger to the point that I had to resist not to hurt him or myself.\n\nAfter my family and I went to the doctor and he explained misophonia better, my dad gradually triggered me less times, today we do not have family meals together like we used to, and he stopped doing the mouth sounds, at least when I am nearby, and it is been weeks since the last time he triggered  me or that I felt strong anger from a trigger at all. \n\nEven though it is a great thing I do not feel anger anymore, I have been feeling puzzled wether I still have misophonia or not. One day I was checking on another subreddit that I do not remember the exact name, but it was about transexual people, the thing is one of the posts was titled \"Am I really transexual?\" or something like this, in which the OP said they were sure at some point they were transexual, but then they stopped to think \"Am I really transexual?\", and again were soon sure about it afterwards. Someone in the comment section said it could be \"Impostor Syndrome\", the thing is I have been feeling the same way than the OP, but with misophonia.\n\nYet I do have other people that trigger me, most triggers being chewing and noise/breathing noises, they cause me certain distress and anxiety at some point, but manageable most of times, if the sound overwhelms too much, I will just get some distance, and none has led me to the intense anger I felt when my father used to trigger me, and I am not triggered every time they happen and might depend on the time I am exposed to them. This dilemma is making it confused to me to understand myself and to be sure if I still have misophonia and I would like to know your thoughts on that. \n\nHas any of you had a similar experience where your main trigger is gone ?\n\nHas any of you stopped feeling anger from your misophonia ?\n\nHas any of you experienced \"Impostor Syndrome\" or something similar from having misophonia ?\n\nThanks for reading ! I have a similar experience... while my parents chewing still makes me upset, I do not feel like I want to punch them with brass knuckles anymore.\nIf you are having other triggers, then you still have misophonia. If those triggers go away as well, then that is okay and you may have adapted to your misophonia; if that were the case, I would say that you do not have it anymore and it is okay, for some people misophonia tends to come and go like that :)\nI like to think of misophonia as a scale.

I know it may feel confusing, but remember that this is a good thing. I think you still have misophonia. time of night can influence misophonia.  the more tired you are the worse it can get.  maybe you hung around your father then?  also, it can go away I think?\n\nalso you are using imposter syndrome improperly:\n I used to be triggered by vacuum and hairdryer sounds now it bothers me 0% (or I guess as much as it bothers other people as it can be loud/uncomfortable) so I guess triggers can disappear and it does not mean you do not have misophonia or that you are pretending like you have it. \nI would not worry about it too much, try and be glad that such pressing trigger does no longer bother you.", "Thought I would say hello as someone who is had this for a long time I have had this for many years I am 35 I cannot really remember when it started.

This kid is my sister, and I am her favorite person to be around, so I have no choice but to be around her almost 24/7 and I have to act like it does not bother me. I hate how she repeats the same damn word in the whiny toddler voice and it literally fucking hurts to listen to her all day. I do not hate her, but I cannot deal with the trigger anymore, it physically hurts and it makes me really mad and I come off as a total dick and it does not help that I do not like kids anyway. What do I do? Other than noise-blocking headphones, pink noise machines and \"get out of that house immediately\" which is common advice on Reddit... I think your best shot is going to therapy.\n\nFrom my personal experience, misophonia noise triggers worsen the more irritated we grow with the origin of the noise. For instance, my neighbor is a flamenco dancer; which means he dances like he is on a claqu\u00e9 competition a few afternoons a week when he has no shows going on. This is extremely triggering for me, as is whistling or background whispering.\n\nI became so irritated with *him*, not just with the noise, that I could spend a whole afternoon worrying about when exactly would he be dancing again, and oh boy when he did dance. I am not proud of my reactions whatsoever.\n\nAs of yet, there is no known way to cure misophonia because it is heavily linked to your brain's state of alertness. The more alert your brain is (and alertness increases drastically when you have experienced traumatic events or suffer from some sorts of mental illnesses), the more on edge you feel all the time, the more likely you are to react emotionally (\"dramatically\") or even violently to triggers (which is not at all your fault, by the way, in case nobody's ever told you).\n\nI suggest therapy mainly because your resentment toward your sister is likely to only do both of you dirty and worsen not only your relationship but also your reaction to other triggers (been there, done that), and I think you could benefit from trying to find a way to separate the trigger noise from the person that causes it, which might or might not work but it is always worth a try. If I figure out anything that helps me better, I will make sure to post it in the forum for everyone else to see; and if I can think of a better solution for your very concrete situation, I will let you know.\n\nIn any case, I hope letting some of your thoughts out helped you a bit today. You probably do not get to talk about misophonia often, since it is such a quirky little miserable trait that nobody fully understands, so I will let you know that you are not alone, and it will get better.

After all this new flat has very thick walls and many belong to owners instead of renters.  \n\nAlas now half a year later I have developed the same triggers to my upstairs neighbour, who I have had to ask several times to turn his TV down since I can just listen along. With the other flat on his (top) floor being unoccupied he started to take more liberties. The end result is that he is turned it down, but he is seemingly ramped up all other noise, and I can tell he is very unhappy about being asked to do this. \n\nFrom the moment I wake up, I dread hearing him wake up. He does not seem to leave for work every day anymore either. I am trying out various methods to see what blocks or distracts the best. But there is the constant anticipation that a sound will get through, and that the fight or flight will kick in. I am worried that by running the radio he will hear it and do the same but louder, even though my radio is not even audible on the other side of my flat (his still resounds all the way down to our hallway). For every sound I do hear, I wonder if it is him. I am trying to reserve my earplugs for sleep, and my noise cancelling headset as an escape / timeout tool. While working from home has been a blessing in other ways, it is horrible that it is now backfired in this way. \n\nThe funniest thing of it all is that I am actually glad they are working in the commercial units downstairs. All of Saturday they were running jackhammers to break out the floors and while it was extremely loud, for those hours there was absolutely nothing else getting through and I felt quite at ease. That for me really made me understand it is specific sounds, that someone makes intentionally and I wish they would be aware of how infuriating it is to me, even though he is not doing anything wrong by just living above me.

I know I still have to do some work from home/online (though it does not officially start until two weeks from now), but really, schoolwork does not typically bother me that much. The main reason I am glad for school closing is for the reason I even chose to post this on this sub.. because of my misophonia being triggered every 5 minutes at school. If it is a trigger sound of mine, I unfortunately have to hear it almost every day: gum chewing, loud chewing, lip smacking, whistling, loud talking, slurping, yelling across the room, sounds that are louder than they should be.. you name it. And let us face it, it is a shit ton harder to focus on doing work when people are making sounds that make you want to lose your damn mind!

I think all fellow misophonia (misophonics ?) sufferers collectively are rejoicing at being able to go into an environment where they can control noise. Dude, sniffling and gym chewing in class. I do not learn a darn thing Especially gum chewing for me - sniffing does not typically bother me unless it is very frequent (and even then, it is really more of just an annoyance). \n\nBut yeah, I really hate gum chewing. Someone never taught anyone at my school to chew quietly. I have seen cows that chewed quieter than them.. Enjoy! I would give anything for a couple weeks being school-aged and having off of school. I had the house all to myself a lot all throughout high school because both of my sisters were off to college, and it was just glorious. Free time as an adult is just not the same as when I was still in school. Hope you have a lovely, trigger-free break! For real, there are a few tiny good things about this situation that bring a little light into it all.  Not having to wake up as early to drive to school; not having to worry as much about having my misophonia triggered, or about my social anxiety; having more time to draw, garden, and play Animal Crossing when it comes out in three days; being able to pet my cat more; and other things.  As much as this situation just downright sucks, there are a few nice things about staying home that make it more bearable. Definitely!

My moms boyfriend\u2019s dog gives me triggers. I live with my mom and her boyfriend until everything gets back to normal so I can move out. My moms boyfriend has this gross dog I absolutely just cannot tolerate. The dog licks itself for a good hour straight. The sound is so obnoxiously loud slurping noise and I just cannot be around it for more than a minute. When we are watching a movie together in the living room and the dog is sitting there licking itself, I immediately start getting irritated and go into fight mode then flight. I get up and lock myself in my room for the rest of the day because I just cannot stand hearing that. That is the one triggering sound I absolutely cannot tolerate. I have not tried these for trigger sounds yet, but my mom got me a pair on Vibes earplugs for loud noises. They specifically block out sound (not muffle it like normal earplugs). May I also suggest getting the dog to chew on something (specifically during a movie like you mentioned)? If you can get him distracted, like chewing on something, sleeping or playing with treat toys. Even having the dog in another room maybe. Good luck! :) I am in the exact same boat as you, OP. My family has a dog who cannot get enough of licking herself and it drives me up the wall. The sucking/slurping is just too much...it does not help she has severe allergy issues and so licks herself even more :/ I am the exact opposite. My cat constantly licks herself and generally makes plenty of sounds that if a human did it would trigger me, but she is never triggered me. In the contrary, I find them adorable. I am really sorry for the situation you are in. I mean, you cannot really tell your dog to be quiet. Just stay strong and we are here for you :) I actually surprisingly feel the opposite.

That is really difficult.\n\nThank you so much for the advice, it is much appreciated! Hopefully I can build up the bravery to speak to a teacher about this. Those are some good ideas. Once again, thank you for taking time to reply. I really do appreciate it. I am happy for you that no food was allowed in class back then, and thank you. That would be a great accommodation to request that your teachers make! If students ask why, your teacher can talk about food mess or make up whatever other excuse so the burden of that is not on you.

If it substantially covers your ears all the time, you might be able to discretely use some light-duty earplugs to filter out at least some of the noise, or perhaps suggest to have music on at dinnertime to drown it out? I have no idea whether your parents would allow that, but I think it may be worth a shot. Here is two links to documents that might be useful to you and your parents:\n\n(\n\n(\n\nThere is also more links that you may not have seen before on (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might also suggest looking into purchasing some \"invisible\" in-ear earplugs to inconspicuously provide yourself some level comfort, even if it just takes the edge off because none of them will block out sound 100%.  Music has helped me in these situations. And try to sit the closest to the source of sound if possible. Where do you get these invisible earplugs?? Practical advice would be to not sit right next to the person making the most sound. Also the same as other people said: ear plugs. As for your parents, that is a difficult one. Maybe even show them this subreddit where real people have the same disorder as you.  I bought mine from ( but I have seen some on amazon that have pretty good reviews. They go inside of your ear and there is a small tab that sticks out of your ear so that you can still get them out. The tab is small enough that nobody notices it. They turn down the volume about 50-75% depending on the type of sound, but still let you hear someone talking to you. Most of them come with different \"filters\" that block different levels of sound.   I have pretty long hair, about waist length, so I can cover earplugs up. The only problem is that my family likes to have conversations during dinner, so I have to be able to hear or my parents may get upset. Thank you for your advice! But my family likes to talk during meals, and they do not like music playing in the background.\n\n Thank you for your advice! \nThe seating arrangement is so that the two couples sit next to each other, so either way I end up near a grandparent. Both make similar noises. I love them to bits, but...\n\nI guess I will show them this subreddit and r/misophonia.\n\n Here is a sneak peek of /r/misophonia using the ( of the year!\n\n\\#1: ( | (  \n\\#2: (  \n\\#3: (\n\n----\n^^I am ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| ( ^^| ( ^^| ( Thank you very much!\n You should be able to hear through them at least a little, but you could always try one to start on the side that bothers you the most. So I just remembered another thing that I do when I cant escape from dinner. I start making louder eating sounds myself. Its so weird that it helps me but whatever I can do I do. If other people notice you doing this it is going to seem really rude though... Yeah, I will try it out. Thanks again. Yeah.. *sigh*. My brother specifically pays attention to me when I eat, so that he can tell me not to make noise. (He does it of of spite, because I have told him to eat a little more quietly quite a few time\u2019s before.)  my good grief, you are describing my childhood (minus the grandparents but otherwise snap!)\n\ndoes not matter where you sit, there is no escape - if you are lucky at least you are not looking directly at them when they are eating but there is always the noise wherever you are...\n\nno music, no radio, no background noise just let us all sit around the table and listen to mouths and eating.\n\ni do not know if this is of any help... i do not quite fully understand it myself yet but here goes as an attempt of an explanation: recently i have moved back in with my parents (long family story that is really not necessary to go into here) and since returning to my home country and my home i have been able to tolerate most of my miso triggers (almost all of them related to eating) in a way that i have never been able to before.\n\nWith this way of thinking you are still acutely aware of all of the triggers that you normally have (from general ones to extremely specific ones) but it seems that you can somehow remove a key level of stress.... i do not really know how to describe it other than it becomes bearable, not pleasant nor comfortable but bearable.\n\nAnd to switch off this reflex to react, well i cannot tell you exactly what i think as i am not sure what it is myself yet but it is thoughts along the lines of \"this is just somebody making a noise, that is all it is. a noise. you hear plenty of other noises all the time. This is ok, it is going to be fine, it is going to be alright\".\n\nI do not really know how to explain, this is new to me. I am 45 and i have had miso since 4. Somehow my brain has taught itself to stick the proverbial fingers in its ears and go 'la la la la la la la, i am not listening!'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni know i am not the best at explaining myself here (your English is fantastic by the way) can anybody else relate?\n\nAny other comments?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm i being super fucking obvious and should i have just shut up? For your parents I would go to the Harvard website and print out the paper they wrote on misophonia and show it to your parents. The person who wrote it has a PHD so they might start to realise its a serious subject. I am going to try it myself cause my Mom also tells me to get over it.  Thank you very much. I will try this out. \ud83d\ude0a Thank you. I will check it out. \ud83d\ude0a I have no advice that has not already been shared, but I just want to say that especially for a non-native speaker your writing is awesome.

What are we eating? A classic morning meal- *cereal*. Now, I love cereal. Cereal is the blood of life in my opinion. It is so easy to make, easy to eat, easy all around, *and* delicious as *fuck*. But when I eat it, I do not slurp, smack, or make any other kind of disgusting noises. I keep my mouth shut and eat in peace so no one else has to hear my gross mouth sounds.\n\nThat being said, let us continue into why I am absolutely fucking *pissed*.\n\nAs I said, I eat my cereal without slurping, smacking, or obnoxious crunching (the crunching happens but it is within reason. Cereal *is* just inherently crunchy.) so as to not disturb anyone or myself while eating. But my sibling? Oh *noooo*! They cannot do *that*. They have to fucking *slurp* and *smack* and *crunch* the shit *loud as fuck* like a fucking *six year old*!\n\nI have not had to eat breakfast with them in a really long time because I am always at school (I am 18) by the time they even wake up (they are 23) so I would forgotten how awful it is to sit across from them and deal with that shit. However, I never really said anything about it so I decided now would be the best time to say something. \n\nME* Calm but mildly annoyed*: \"Dude, could you stop crunching?\"\n\nTHEM, *With an attitude*: \"Why?\"\n\nME *Calmly but still annoyed*: \"It is gross.\"\n\nTHEM *With a snotty ass tone while still eating and slurping*: \"Well I cannot eat without doing it.\"\n\nME *Calm and trying to stay that way*: \"Just do not slurp.\n\nTHEM *With the same snotty tone*: \"Well if I do not it will drip down my chin and that really will be gross.\" *They take another spoonful of cereal and slurp loudly*.\n\nME: \"Just do this.\" *I demonstrate by eating a bite neatly and quietly without dripping, slurping, or smacking*.\n\nTHEM *Clearly pissy now and with an abundance of attitude*: *They get up and walk away into the living room, snapping at me as they do*, \"Just shut up!\" \n\nOur mom was in the living room when this happened. She asked my sibling why they were mad and came into the living room all huffy with their cereal, leading to this conversation:\n\nMOM: \"What happened?\"\n\nTHEM *Still pissy and snappy*: \"She was *freaking out* because I was slurping my cereal.\"\n\nME *From the other room*: \"I was not freaking out, I told you to stop.\"\n\nMOM *To both of us*: \"Alright calm down.\" *Then softly she says to my sibling*, \"I slurp my cereal when I eat, too.\"\n\n\nHow the fuck is making me feel stupid for making a simple request okay? If it were me I would have just said \"Okay, no problem\" and stopped making the sounds. I fucking hate how people just discount other's feelings just because they do not get it. My family is so fucking immature about shit like this. I just eat alone in my room or wait for everyone to get done before I eat. It sucks being alone but I would rather eat alone than be constantly triggered I just cannot either. My dad is like REEEEE whenever I simply ask him if I can move to the other room. These fucking people just do not understand, dude No offense to your family, but I do not get how people can be so inconsiderate. If a family member or a friend asked me to stop doing something so simple I would just fucking stop. It is especially annoying when your family suddenly expects your misophonia to go away after a while because you do not talk about it 24/7 and then when you do ask they get all bitchy Oh yeah, it is the *best*. I especially *love* when my family acts like my hypersensitivity is some surprise just because I have not really said anything about it in a while. Ya know. Even though I have *been* this way since I was little and have continued to have the issues that go with having both hypersensitivity and misophonia even into my adult life. Do not you just *adore* being made to feel like a burden and a social handicap to those around you? God, it is just *awesome*. I FEEL YOU! And then they guilt you into thinking you are supposed to be able to HoLd YoUr fEeLiNgS iN and just \"deal\" (exact word my mother said to me). It is truly the best feeling ever :( My family says that shit to me about my hypersensitivity (extremely heightened senses), particularly when it comes to me and loud noises. All of my senses are heightened and difficult to deal with but my sense of hearing is the worst out of them.\n\nNow, if a typical person hears loud music, harsh sounds, or noises hitting a certain pitch or volume, they might get a bit annoyed by it. Some might even *like* the loud music or be completely unbothered by *it*, or any of the other things mentioned. But me? Boy *fucking* howdy, *no.* I cannot handle loud noises of any kind. I get anxiety which then triggers my vertigo, I start panicking, I get headaches like you would not believe- it is a fucking nightmare.\n\nNot to mention, it causes me *PHYSICAL PAIN*. That is right. Pain. Of the physical kind. In my ears, my head. Oh yeah. Not. Fucking. Fun.\n\nBut do they care? *NOOOO*! No, they do not. So I am stuck feeling like I am a handicap on everyone in my life because they have brought me up to believe that all the things I have wrong with me (including but also besides the hypersensitivity) are nothing but burdens on *other people*, rather than understanding and trying to help me the best they can.\n\nBut *then* if I try to stay in my room to avoid being an issue, they get pissy because I am never around. What the *fuck*?\n\nGot To love toxic families that make you believe you are a burden on everyone and totally disregard your feelings, even though *you are* the one dealing with all these things on top being socially ostracized because of things you cannot control. I am so sorry you have to deal with that bullshit. My dad's girlfriend is not supportive either. At dinner I feel trapped and I cannot ask them to pLEASE chew quietly bc they will not do jack shit. ugh\n\n I also get physical pain from certain sounds. Especially certain singing. I love my sister to death but for some reason I really hate her singing voice, even though she has studied opera and has an objectively amazing voice. I get you and I am sorry you have to deal with that, too. I hate my sibling's singing voice but that is just cause I hate their voice cause they kind of suck and they used to sing all the time to piss me off when I was little to the point of me crying and screaming. It annoys the everloving fuck out of me to hear them sing now and I have to physically leave the area if they start singing, even softly. I have been unable to ask people to stop making trigger sounds as well. I have tried, do not get me wrong - back in 7th grade I had to sit near a kid who was making some sort of \"clicking\" sound with his mouth (I do not know how to describe it, but it can be made by pressing your tongue to the roof of your mouth and then quickly pulling it back down), and I asked him to stop since it is a trigger sound of mine and was distracting me. He got pissy, said he was making the sound because it supposedly helps him focus, and essentially claimed I was being a bitch about it. So, yeah, I feel you.. I wish people were more considerate of others. You do not know who could be hypersensitive, phonophobic, misophonic, or just get bothered by those types of noises. It is just so shitty people feel the need to be so awful about just not doing a thing that is bothering someone. Just do not do it. It is really that easy. Exactly! If someone asks you not to do something that you can control perfectly well, there is really not a reason why you have to be such a shithead about it. lol yeah I wish I could appreciate her voice more tho. I do not like any of my family's singing voices now that I think about it, but probably bc none of them are very good except for my sister.\n\nThat is fucked up that they would still sing even when you were crying? Yeah my sister would have to practice constantly in HS since she went to a school that specializes in liberal arts. Thankfully she is since gone to college and moved out. Yeah and also since it is really really hard to describe Misophonia to someone who does not have it. I will tell someone and they either say something along the lines of, \"OMG WOW I HAVE THAT TOO!! Chewing is like, soooooo disgusting!!\" Or they will say its fake and shut me down completely :( Yeah I have learned from experience do not ever tell your siblings anything about your triggers cause they will do it louder and more often This was not a playful thing, they are just spiteful and my mom never stops them from doing the shit they do. But I appreciate the advice.", "Feeling abnormal Is it not normal to want to live in peace?\n\nTo be able to go into a room and hear nothing but silence?\n\nI moved house a few weeks ago and I have realised I live in between two very noisy neighbours.\n\nThe day we moved in they had a huge party and the music was absolutely blasting, I mean it was as if the party was in my house.\nTonight the other neighbour is throwing a party, I just think homes are for relaxing in... is that so wrong of me to think that?\n\nWhy should I sleep with earplugs every night?\n\nWhy do the neighbours not care what people around them feel?\n\nWhen I bring this up to friends and family they say things like; ignore it... it is just one party... people like to enjoy themselves... you are just boring...\n\nMaybe I am not cut out to be here, I will never be able to afford a detached house...

Lately I have been noticing a lot of movies and tv shows use this fake cork screw squeak when opening alcohol bottles. I used to work in a bar so I know for a fact that most of the time they do not make that sound! And certainly not that exaggerated. It is just so high pitched- it makes my teeth itch lol I really cannot handle it. It is gotten to the point where if I see a bottle even being picked up I will mute whatever I am watching. Anyone else experience this? Or another sound on tv?Personally, The Soprano\u2019s was difficult to get through as well because Tony is always eating and always so loud. I had a problem with a lot of audiobook narrators. It seems like they were always gasping for breath into the microphone everyfew seconds. I just gave up, which was sad cause I liked doing crafts while listening. Oh that is the worst! I have not really gotten into many books but there are a few podcasts I can listen to. I am pretty picky with that too. Maybe you just have to find one narrator you like &amp; then only listen to books they have done. I cannot watch the Star Wars movies because I cannot listen to Darth Vader\u2019s breathing Some movies have characters eating like pigs with really exaggerated noises and it drives me insane. I also notice a lot of youtubers and radio interviewees getting all spitty and that makes me want to throw the device off of a cliff. Some producers and directors encourage actors to eat like pigs. Matt Damon comes to mind. He eats like a starved hog at a full trough. On a parallel note, kissing and oral sex sounds are also disgusting. \n\nWhenever eating or sex scenes come up, I engage closed captions and mute. Screw that shit. It is abusive. I can see that the characters are fucking or dining.\n\nFYI, Rally's \"real customer\" ads are also vile, as well as certain Kit Kat commercials. I have had to abandon meditation guides and video narrator's because they smacked their lips between sentences or clauses. A few were authorities in their fields. One would think that they would know to edit that shit out, but noooooo. Every day of my life, tv triggers me, but for other reasons:  shooting/violent scenes (the fighting sounds), screaming talk show hosts, horrible commercials with tap dancing, fencing, yelling comedians and people making weird sounds....well, the list goes on. Will keep an ear out for yours. Happy New Year! Maybe we should uncork it and just drink it until we do not hear these things? I know, not the answer, or is it?\ud83d\ude2f Definitely!! Always eating sounds or when someone is gasping for breath, for some reason. There is a fairly long scene in Mindhunter where they are interviewing a guy who is chewing tobacco and I had to read a wiki summary of the episode because I could not watch. Fun! I am appalled at the number of audiobook narrators, podcast/radio hosts, etc that still manage to get the nasty spitting sounds through to broadcast. Have they never heard of a pop filter or a mic sock? Good grief. Lots of throat clearing. Cannot they just stop filming for a second so that everybody has their chance to clear their throats and then resume filming?? Also, when people clear throats to acknowledge their presence. The reason I started watching movies with subtitles. Oh man there was a scene in one of the new trilogy movies where a character had an echoing finger snapping sequence that made my brain feel on fire. OMG THIS. I am a video editor with misophonia. The amount of \"ums\" \"so\" and lip smacks I hear drives me so crazy that at the end of the day I get mad at my husband just for talking. I HAAAAAAAATE when the volume suddenly changes. Like they were talking quietly for one scene and the next scene is like a rocket launch set to loud dramatic music. UGH! I usually turn down the volume and turn on subtitles. Or just switch the show if it pissed me off that much. There needs to be a thing you can set on your TV to not go above certain decibals.", "I hate it. Whenever I have asked someone to be quiet while eating I have only ever been mocked, my mother is the worst, I can hear her eating from my room no matter where she is in the house, every single time she takes a sip of a drink or puts food in her mouth she makes sure to smack her lips fucking inhumanly loud, of course when ever I have asked her to stop she mocked me. I just get so stressed and frustrated so easily now that the slightest trigger makes me want to punch myself in the fucking face. The kind of anger you feel when someone wrongs you, it feels unexplainable, idk. I get mocked too. My siblings will make sounds on purpose just to make me mad. It really sucks when the most important people in your life make a joke out of a condition that makes everyday life extremely difficult, so I hear you! that is how my dad is. i have learned to expect no empathy from him, so i try to remove myself from the situation instead. not always possible and not easy at all though \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc4d I did not mention it in my post but my father, when he has too much saliva in his mouse, loudly sucks it back into his throat. Plus everyone in my house eat with their mouths open, tbh I have stopped trying with the obnoxious fucks. I have become more anti-social so I can avoid noises and I write this as I wait for my mother to stop eating in the kitchen so I can go to the fridge lmao. Same with my uncle but he finds his pleasure in using his ice and getting a fridge upstairs so every morning he is can pour ice into the sink and it is horrible, and there so much shit about him beyond that Oh god I made a ( about this the other week, the mockery is so awful, disrespectful, humiliating. They simply do not believe that misophonia is a thing. \n\nI always cannot help but think WHY on Earth would I be making this up?? Why would I storm out of the room when someone is eating? Why would I wear earplugs half of the day? Does that sound fun?? Why would I inconvenience myself so much for the sake of what you believe to be a fake condition?? My mom stands right behind me while eating things like carrots and celery, if I say something she purposely leans into my ear before I can move away. If I hit her in the face Im the asshole though?\n\nIve had misophonia my entire life , shes well aware of my issues.

This is dumb. Keep it to yourself. No need to be rude. Yes you can. If I read a trigger, I will then have that trigger. I am not the only one.

When I hear or read the name of one of my triggers, it causes me distress. No need to be rude because that is not a symptom you experience. Wow.\n\nCalling someone ridiculous for a symtom of misophonia. Surely you can have empathy, if you have this disorder as well, considering how many people think the whole thing is ridiculous.\n\nOh, you are going to cry or run away cause someone is eating?? *Ridiculous.* Strange. I never considered this. Do people with misophonia typically get triggered just by reading about their triggers? I guess I only get triggered by the actual noises themselves when I hear them. Also I have never heard of someone just gaining a trigger just because they read about someone else also having that trigger. Not challenging, just genuinely curious if this is normal. So if someone mentions to you that they get triggered by something that is not already a trigger for you, that gets added to your list of triggers? If someone mentions a trigger and it is not already one of mine, it will become one. I dont gain then, but reading about it does trigger me, less so than hearing them, but it does. Yeah, it gets triggering when people mention them.

He eats incredibly loud, seems to eat so fast to the point he has to groan and gasp for air, grunts a lot because of his arthritis, and acts like I am being a jerk when I get angry (I have an angry/violent reaction to my triggers) \n\nThis particular event happened a few minutes ago. We went out shopping for our usual groceries and decided to get frozen yogurt on the way home. The problem is he SLURPS IT SO LOUD. I was trying not to get pissed off but I did not have my earbuds and he was not taking the hints I was giving him by looking at him like -_- in fact he only did it louder. \n\nHe said \"do you have a problem?\" I said \"Yeah I have misophonia\" and he does his *LOUD MF SLURP AND CRUNCH* My instant reaction was to hit the car window as opposed to punching him in the face. So of course he mimicks me and dramatically grabs a napkin (they gave us extra when we got the frozen yogurt) so I lost it and basically yelled \"IT IS A REAL DISORDER WILL YOU STOP!??\" and he screams back \"I DIDNT FUCKING DO ANYTHING EXCEPT TRY TO BREATHE BY GETTING A TISSUE TO BLOW MY NOSE\"\n\nIS HE FUCKING SERIOUS? THAT IS ALL HE FUCKING DID? OTHER THAN TRIGGER ME ON PURPOSE WHEN IVE TOLD HIM MULITPLE TIMES I HAVE MISOPHONIA??? Its already difficult enough for me to have to hear him grunt every day with every damn step he takes. Yes I understand he is in pain and of course I care BUT IT DRIVES ME INSANE and the only reason I do not lose it is because I know he is in pain. HOWEVER, HE COULD AT LEAST TRY TO EAT MORE QUIETLY AND HE JUST DOES IT LOUDER TO PISS ME OFF What a dick of a father, I am sorry to hear this Yeah he can be at times. He is better than my mom though Oof Yeah that is abuse.\n\nFind a doctor, church, neighbor, call a hotline, just get help. You are worth it. I am so sorry. I hate it when people provoke you like this. I made it a habit to always have ear buds in all my pockets or close by. I have plugged my ears in front of the \"offender\" and they did not even notice it lol I hope you feel better soon I know this just happened. I almost always have my earbuds and I used them constantly but since we have been home all day and I can be in my room etc I have lost track of where I put them so I really need to find them. I have tried plugging my ears too but I could not do it this time though because I was holding a cone lol Please explain the downvote. \n\nIf the father were hitting or sexually assaulting their child, what would YOU suggest? Why would you NOT suggest the same for this abuse?\n\nThis is abuse and neglect and it has no business being between an adult and their child. This pisses me off so much. I dont even know what to say. You need to call someone or try to get help about this guy. But for the meantime, I really, really wish the best for you. Spend time doing what helps you feel relaxed. Misophonia sucks absolute dick, especially when idiots are so oblivious to it with such persistence. But I still hope that things can get better for you, even if its little by little. I experience pretty much the same but with my mom. I have not told my dad because he will think I am crazy and there is going to be a big ass fight, he will end up taking my phone and I will not leave my room (the only good thing that will happen) and that is not the best when you are in quarantine. My mom understands it a mental disorder and especially in the beginning she helped by searching shit on google. Now she tries to turn it into a joke sometimes and triggers me on purpose and tells me to just stop caring, as if it is that easy. I get how you feel. You said in a comment that your mom is worse. Are you sure she will not help your dad stop doing what he does? Oh absolutely not. I do not even consider her a mother. I am sorry you have to deal with this crap, especially because she understands its a real disorder. My dad just does not seem to care so idk if he believes its real or not. I think in his mind I am just overreacting and being an asshole. My mom would just think I am weird and be like \"Uhh okay\" because she is never cared about my health, mental or physical, unless it had to do with the way I looked (weight, bruises, scratches) \n\nIf you want to know more on my mom, here is a link to a post I made about her and I also commented a lot of details. You do not have to read it, just leaving it for context. \n I am really sorry to hear about what you are going through :( I will check the post out. And stay strong. Beat the living fuck out of your dad. Only way he will get the message and then he will not bother you again. Take control. I am 17F and he has a temper, he would probably hit me back. I am sure I could hurt him, but I do not think I would be able to \"beat the living fuck\" out of him lmao I appreciate what you are saying, but I have been through so much worse neglectful/emotional abuse when living with my mother, so something like this is trivial to me and does not call for anything drastic like that. Is he being an asshole? 100% percent. Is he absuing me? Maybe I am giving him slightly more credit because he is better than my mom (actually cares about and took care of my physical health the second I moved), but I still would not take it as far as to say its abuse, I really just wanted to rant because I knew others in this subreddit would understand my frustration whereas anyone else would think I was being a child. Also, I really do love my dad and he is the last family member, (other than maybe my older brother who used to physically/verbally abuse me a few years ago) that I have any emotional/familial connection to and I would really hate to ruin that relationship. \n\nI dont consider my mom a mother tbh, she is  in my contacts. If you want to know more about my mom, here is a post I made regarding her and I also wrote some details in the comments and replies. You do not have to read it of course, its just for context. \n Thanks, I appreciate it. Its nice having this subreddit because people actually understand that I am not being a dramatic teenager. Well, that is what objects are for. When he is falling asleep on the couch watching a movie you give him the beating of a lifetime with a bat Sorry \ud83d\ude05 it is just that things like that really upset me. People like that. It reminds of situations that I could not control and I just let people bother me and torture me and I wish I could have done something Yeah I get it \ud83d\ude02 I am not going to beat him with a bat but it did make me laugh so thanks You are welcome \ud83d\ude0a lol sometimes I guess that is all we can do to get through it all is to just laugh through the pain That makes perfect sense. \"A bad day golfing is better than a good day working\" seems to be what you are saying, you would rather have a dysfunctional relationship than none at all. I fully understand that.\n\nBut I do hope you seek out and get the help you need and that your relationship with your father comes out stronger because of it. If he is teasing you like this (to the point where I would call it cruel and repeated, or \"abuse\") then it may be that it is simply how he learned to behave. Hopefully, he may be open to learning other ways to show he cares.\n\nPlease keep putting yourself first! If you do, others will follow you. You are worth it.\n\n( Yeah, thank god for the internet. They just do not get it and that is the most infuriating part. They think we are just being difficult and have no idea what we are going through. So sorry for your situation ;(.", "Goals in life: become Queen Dagmar to tell people stop eating ", "Headphone usage over long periods of time Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well!\n\nLet me try and explain quickly: I am currently living in quite a noisy environment with a lot of triggers, and while I am looking to move, it is just not possible in the near future.  To be able to work and somewhat function I have resorted to wearing headphones most of the time, even while I fall asleep, my doctor says it is not healthy to wear them all the time (which is certainly true, and also english is not my first language so I am not sure how this specific doctor is called, sorry about that) but the amount and type of noise its just too much for me and it continues well late into the night, I am refusing to name any specifics in case someone is triggered, but they are right next to me and quite loud, if anyone is curious I will put the specific noise here:  &gt;!incessant dog barking!&lt; \n\nI tried explaining this to a couple of doctors, as well as my family and my neighbors, but I do not think any of them believe me, or at least they do not take seriously the amount of stress this is giving me, I do not think I have slept a full night in months.\n\nSo my question is: do you have any advice or personal experience using headphones over long periods of time? \n\nThe doctors told me I should not wear them for more than a couple of hours a day, but that is just not happening. I am trying to only use them when the noise its at its peak, and then rest my ears for as long as possible until the noise starts again; but sometimes said peak can span over hours, and even the whole night.\n\n In the meantime, I am looking for a doctor that will actually listen to me, thanks in advance! An ENT I visited did not give me great tips, but she said that it is better to wear ear phones instead of earbuds to reduce longterm effects/damage, so you are already off to a good start. :) Good luck! I, too, am looking for a doctor that gets it. I hope you find a solution that works well for you soon! Oh, that is great to hear! I will definitely share if I gather some more helpful tips, and good luck to you too! It can certainly cause hearing loss and tinnitus. \n\nSome people wear ear plugs and use special headphones that you hear the sound through your jaw. I have not tried these but it is something you may want to look up What is the difference between earphones and earbuds? Headphones are the ones that go over your ears, like the big ones people use for gaming, and earbuds are the small ones that go inside your ear! Yeah, that is what I am afraid of :c I have never heard of that, I will definitely look those up. They are called bone conduction headphones. They do work in the sense they play music through your bones, but they do not do as much as headphones or earbuds do to passively block out sound. I know headphones and earphones. What about earbuds and earphones? Oh, okay. Well, according to google they both go inside the ear; but earphones are inserted into the ear canal, and earbuds rest outside of the ear canal. Ah, I see. Thanks.", "Do Airpods help? I am a teenager and my birthday is coming up soon. I suffer from misophonia with all mouth noises and some bone cracking. I do not think I will be able to afford the Airpod Pros, but would it be worth it to ask for just the regular Airpods? I have never asked for anything this expensive but I feel like it will be worth an investment as my misophonia causes a lot of dispute with my family (but so does money). I do not want a cheap knockoff of the airpods either because I want to have quality- if I complain even with the knockoffs in I think I might get disowned. Thanks(: I have the original ones and I think they are excellent! Definitely! I bring them with me any time I am with a bunch of family bc sometimes I can just not deal with all the talking. \n\nHowever, I do not know if the effect is because of the music its self or the airpods muffling noise. I would say they will be about the same as regular earbud headphones.\n\nThey are very similar to Apples original EarPods. thank you. I have the regular wired headphones but my parents think it can be disrespectful so I was going for something where I both would not have to carry my phone and is not that noticeable thank you- i plan on playing music so that is not a huge issue for me. I am also a runner so I think they could come in handy for that as well For running tbh I would either make sure to get the lil grips they have that brace the airpods against your ear or get one like the pros (but less expensive) like the Samsung buds. From my experience &amp; what a lot of my customers (at a phone store) say they do tend to slip when running. I keep a pair of JBL ones for the gym. Yeah, that makes sense! Hope that helps xo that helps a lot! thank you No problem! From what I have tested, Airpods pro and bose headphones are the best.

As in, does anyone get times where their Misophonia is worse than it normally is than others? I began to experience great discomfort and dread from hearing specific sounds around age 17. I am 26 now and ever since then, the discomfort I get has been growing worse. However, there are times where I am not as irritated as I had been. The sounds still make me upset, but It is not to where I am on the verge of a meltdown or screaming in public. But when it does get that bad, they are what I call \"rough patches\". I will will need to make a scene just to show that I hate hearing those sounds. This can happen even when I wear my construction head phones and ear plugs at the same time. Sometimes, the rough patches will fade off and I will only be mildly angry about hearing the noises. The time length these rough patches last for can vary between a few weeks to several months. I have been currently going though a rough patch. I do not know how long this one will last, but so far, it will be five months by this weekend. I will say that once the patch is over, my irritation will still be worse than it was before the rough patch began.\n\nThis rough patch has most certainly been the most difficult with how much agony and mental pain I go through from hearing the sounds. It is been to where I am almost reclusive. I hardly go out unless it is for work or if it is totally necessary. I am drowning deeper into depression with this current rough patch, too. I am crying more often and feeling far more hopeless and alone. It is getting to where I am hearing the sounds in my head (not as an auditory hallucination, think of it like having a song in your head) and when I do, I will become miserable. My new psychiatrist even had to turn me down because she makes the sound that triggers me. I was going into panic mode having to hear her. It is not a sound she or anyone for that matter can easily stop making, so this was the only choice she had. Because of this, I am yet again on the search for a new provider.\n\nIn my case, the sounds that trigger me the most is something that I am afraid of sharing here because I do not want to offend anyone that uses this sound. I have had to say what it was to people before and when I have, I am met with negative reactions. Even when I am being as compassionate and polite as possible, people will become angry at me and sometimes even ridicule me for being this way. I really wish I could say so here as it would better explain why I am in such agony. The sounds that trigger me are heard EVERYWHERE in public. It has gotten to where I have been downright embarrassing myself with how I react to the sounds and how much agony they put me in. I had to leave the gym after only being there for maybe 10 minuets or less because I got too caught up in my stress and started crying after having to dwell in it. I did not even get to work out. It is like I walked in, signed in, and left. I am sorry you are suffering with this. I cannot say mine comes in waves, but there are times it is worse than others. It usually revolves around who is making the sound. Also, I do think it is worse around my period. (PMS makes everything worse.) As far as not wanting to name your triggers here, I have found this to be a pretty safe space to take about it. No one will judge you, since we all know that no one has control over it. But really it is up to you to decide whether you are comfortable talking about it. I wish I had some helpful advice, but please just know that you are not crazy, you are not alone, and you are not a bad person. Yes I think I have only noticed mine get worse when I am  already stressed or anxious about other things. I usually am not too bad with trigger sounds, they make me stressed or angry but I can usually find a way to leave, but if I am already not doing well and hear trigger sounds I can just burst into tears or get VERY irritable. It sucks, I feel you. I was better for years, but about six months ago it came raging back. Mine is worse when I am in a place where I am not okay with just getting up and leaving (like a restaurant) or cannot just leave (like school, work, or home when I am trying to sleep). If I can just walk away, I do not get so worked up. I have noticed that how bad it affects me depends on my mood. \n\nDo not be ashamed for a condition you did not choose to have. \u2764\ufe0f We all have weird triggers. One of my biggest is yawning. I also do not like to hear laughing or humming. You are not alone. I get this weird thing where my misophonia will de-escelate after getting to stage 6 or 7, and then peaking really fast after to the point where it takes all my willpower not to attack the source. So, kind of. What are the stages you are mentioning in your comment? It is how you act depending on how triggered you are, 1 being ever so slightly triggered and 10 being violent.", "So I am wondering if anyone can help me here I have never gone to a doctor to get it confirmed, but I feel I may have some form of misophonia. When I was around 5-6 I would have sharp pains in my head and would suffer intense discomfort when I heard certain noises or felt certain materials (hearing Velcro and feeling the material on my Grandmothers couch to name a few). When I was closer to 10-13 I would get intensely agitated when someone chewed or scratched certain things. I remember once it came to me socking one of my brothers when he continuously scratched a certain fabric.  It has only gotten worse over time and I feel like it is isolating me from my friend groups, I feel so awful and no one believes me when I bring it up. \n\nThank you if anyone can help", "Anyone else have an ear covering habit? I am spending 6+ hours a day holding my ears. When I hear pretty much anything beyond silence outside my room, I will start holding them. Not because the sounds are triggering, it is because I am deathly afraid of being triggered. Like I have given up listening to lyrical music because breathing is one of my triggers. I have tried to cold turkey this habit, but it makes my Miso worse. Now I am trying to replace it with headphones. Idk. Can I like talk to someone in private about my Miso? I feel super stuck covering my ears. It is my neck that hurts the most, cuz I use my shoulder in one ear. I cover my ears too! If you want to go ahead and talk to me about it, I am open to listen. Venting will help you. Yess me I honestly think this is why I have neck problems because in lessons (at school) people click their tongues and chew gum, etc, all the time and nobody knows I have misophonia/what it is besides my friends so before quarantine I used to spend ages sneakily putting my hands over my ears so it looked like I was just holding my head up and being lazy (I probably look so weird doing it but idc) so my neck was constantly at a weird angle.", "Quick Update on my Situation: My dad still will not listen to me, continues to wilfully ignore everything everyone is saying and when I call him out and point out how much of a narcissist hem is he threatens to take away my internet and even have the audacity to call me abusive. Yeah, not going to write much else other than my dad still wilfully refuses to see my point of view, when I show him how people think that his behaviour is unacceptable he goes on to say \"Yeah well people can say whatever they like, I am not going to acknowledge it or change what I am doing.\". Still refuses to read anything or watch anything how people actually need to have their headphones on at all times, but to make things worse when I point to him how much of a narcissist he is as well as telling him that his behaviour is unacceptable (as you know) he then has the audacity to call me abusive then also threaten to take away the internet if I continue to be \"rude to him\" (granted I told him to go eat shit and die, but to be fair he had it coming), while also saying \"How am I abusive when I bring you in your food and do nice things for you?\"\n\nSo no he has not budged one bit. How can I make him stop and see things from my point of view? The only thing I would say you can do at this point- since he is not understanding any other attempt- is to extend the olive branch. IE: apologize first. Yeah, you are probably not sorry. Yeah, he was a dick first. But you cannot bully him into understanding, he is obviously too stupid. So tell him you are sorry for the way you came across, explain that your actions are caused by frustration and not any innate disdain for him as a person. And lastly, ask for help. It is the only way I could get my parents to understand. They did not get it until I finally broke down and told them that I hate being like this just as much as they hate dealing with me being like this. Anyway, sorry for the novel and best of luck to you. The thing is, I know that apologizing is not going to do anything either, since he is very set on doing this, so he will not leave me alone. So even if I apologized for it, he still would not change his behaviour.\n\nEven if I explain to him that my actions are caused by frustration and ask for help he will go on by saying \"But we are already helping you by getting you into this routine.\" He is just not going to see any other way.\n\nSo yeah what can I do in this kind of situation? That sucks, I am sorry to hear it :/ that means he will not understand until you are grown and out of his house- this was the case with my parents- all I can say is, bide your time and I am really sorry. unfortunately parents just do not like listening to their kids in general, at least not until the kid moves out, gets their own life going, and the parents suddenly realize they need their kids in one way or another.  Telling him to eat shit and die, even if he deserved it, is basically guaranteeing that your conversation will not go anywhere.   For many people, childhood is something to survive, to live through, until you have the chance to get out and live the life you choose for yourself.  I hope you do not have to wait too long for that to happen.", "Dog next door is driving me to insanity My neighbours have a dog that barks from morning to dusk, sometimes to even past midnight. It is not as loud as other dogs but it still somehow takes more than headphones and the television to block it out. It gives me anxiety and it keeps me on edge all the time. It triggers my misophonia more than anything else and it sends me into a very violent rage. I have not ever attacked anyone or anything but I have had incredibly violent thoughts. It makes me feel guilty that I think about harming the dog daily. Dogs do not have morals so therefore it does not know the stress it causes. (Dont worry people, I will not hurt it even though it is slowly killing my mental health.) It is really likely to be lonely because the neighbours leave it home alone all day but it even barks nonstop when they are home which means they probably lock it in a room or crate.\n\nEither way, it causes me to spiral into a state of unimaginable rage and anxiety that lasts all day and a lot of times, all night and my parents do not understand it because it does not bother them. I needed a place to vent so I came here and I hope at least a couple of you will understand though I do not know how many other people with misophonia have triggers that are from a noise an animal makes. I will likely have to put up with this nonstop barking for the rest of high school because nobody else I know cares. As if school was not stressful enough, I have to come home every day to nonstop barking and wake up every weekend to barking and go to bed while hearing barking. It makes it very hard to function normally and I hardly remember the feeling of calmness because of the barking.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk and I wish you all a very silent and peaceful day/night.  I do not know where you live or what your noise ordinance laws are, but where I live that is considered excessive noise and they can be reported and fined if this is a daily occurrence. I would recommend making a noise complaint to the non emergency police and start recording or making a log of the noise. Also, sounds like that dog is being neglected which could easily be reported too. You deserve peace and quiet, friend, it cannot hurt to try to report it and see if something can be done. Wish you well, and know you are not alone when it comes to having crappy, loud neighbors. I agree.\n\nUnfortunately I had a similar problem where a neighbor's dog was barking directly at my house from 8am-8pm from their backyard. I looked up the city ordinance, took multiple recordings of the dog violating the ordinance, and attempted to have a polite conversation with the neighbors initially. When the conversation soured (they told me I could do nothing about it, and they know someone from the police) I revealed I already had recordings of the ordinance violation and would be alerting authorities moving forward. The barking stopped.\n\nI am glad to hear you have control over your emotions, but please do not feel bad taking action if you are following the proper channels. If they are neglecting the dog, you are doing the right thing. If they are breaking the law, you are doing the right thing.\n\nGood luck. What if you made friends with the dog and started walking it? It might reduce the amount of barking abs Thanks for the suggestions! I will definitely start making a log on it and see if I can get it reported for neglect", "Could I have misophonia? I think I may have misophonia, but it might be that I get easily annoyed\n\nYou see my mother always stomps her feet when she walks and you can hear it all around our stupid tiny little house. Even when writing about it I get this intense rage that makes me want to punch her in the face. Whenever I am upstairs trying to study I feel this tention and stress, knowing that at any point in time, she could start walking again. And when she does, oh boy oh boy I get angry. And not even a little, I get furious. I swing my arms all around trying to punch the air. I punch my mattress and my pillows and I scream. I cannot control it, it is my only way to cope with the noise. Yesterday it got so bad that I started screaming some very bad words.. I just get so insanely frustrated knowing that there is no other place in the house I can study, knowing that she is always home (she has no job). Knowing that I am probably going to have to live here for a few more years and that I am going to have to put up with that shit drives me insane. I have tried noise cancelling headphones, but it does not help, because it is more a bass-like thump that makes the floor vibrate than it is a sound.\n\nI get this same reaction when people are chewing, when people swing their feet and I can vaguely notice their feet swinging in the corner of my eye, or when there is a party in the neighborhood and I cannot hear the exact music, but I can hear and feel the bass thump. But in those situations, I only get annoyed, not as enraged as I get at my mom for stomping her feet.\n\nCan anybody help me and tell me if I might be leaning towards misophonia? And is it possible to get that diagnosed by a doctor or is it not a ''real thing''?  I think you do have misophonia. You get angry and abs anxious when hearing certain sounds and you cannot control your reaction.  The thing is that it is not even officially seen as a disorder yet, and not many know about it. So the main reactions that you are going to get are \u201cit is all in your head\u201d, \u201c just ignore it\u201d and \u201comg same\u201d. So be prepared for that. Also misophonia usually gets worse over time, so you might develop even more triggers. \n\nIt this point, there are not many doctors who can diagnose you with it, so unfortunately, you just have to  deal with it. You can try talking to your mom about it. Try to explain it as a physical pain, rather than a mental one. That way she will understand it better. Welcome is the squad! I agree, this sounds like misophonia so welcome to a horrible horrible club. It is starting to become more well known/accepted, but it is pretty unlikely you will be able to get a \"real\" diagnosis. \n\nThis sub sometimes has some good coping suggestions, but I would suggest checking out just r/misophonia. It has interesting research links and information about the disorder. There is also constant discussions about good headphones/earplugs/etc.\n\nGood luck.", "I am on this train for 15 more hours and I just realized I forgot my earplugs. The guy across the aisle just opened up a bag of chips. This has been your /r/misophonia + /r/twosentencehorror crossover. I am so sorry. I know what that is like. Please refrain from hurting this man, even if your visceral response commands it. It is okay to feel frustrated, just do not let it consume you during these 15 hours. Please hang in there! &lt;3 That is a LONG train ride. Are you going across all of Europe?? Upstate NY to Chicago. I could have flown, but I actually love train rides... usually. Thanks lol. White noise of the train + fingers in ears and elbows on tray table worked surprisingly well. Not comfortable, but at least I do not have to listen, and nobody's eating anymore currently.

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/misophoniasupport) if you have any questions or concerns.* I do not have the disorder but my best friend does. We also dated and lived together for close to five years. When we would go to my family's place to eat, I would set some nice music. Enough to help muffle triggering sounds. When we ate at home she would usually be okay except for crunchy / loud food, like chips. She would out music, sometimes we would watch TV. I also corrected the way I ate so, it was more pleasant for her. \n\nIt sounds like for you, it is not possible to drown out the sound of your family eating with a speaker or smart home device. You have to try to get them on board with making it easier on you. Are they open to your disorder? Have you explained it to them? Sometimes printing out some science based research to persuade the more ignorant individuals is helpful. What I am getting at is, they should try to ease or lessen the possible triggers when you all sit down for to eat.\n\nI find it fascinating that with your friend's chewing does not bother you as much. I found similar patterns with my good friend. It seemed that certain family members would trigger her more than others; and not just because of their eating habits. I do not know how to explain it. It makes me curious though. \n\nSorry I could not be more helpful. Goodluck It helps to know I am not the only one that certain people tend to trigger me more than others. I just feel awful that some people (especially those close to me) are worse than others, as if I can pick and choose who does and does not trigger me.\n\nWhen it comes to my family, my mom just gets rather frustrated at me for the whole thing. She just tends to (in a frustrated manner) put down what she is eating and sort of just wants me to leave so she can eat. My dad understands a bit more, which is nice. So he is more patient with me. I just do not think they would eat differently for me. I have talked to them (this has been going on for as long as I can remember) and yeah....now we are here.\n\nThank you so much though. I will try to talk to them again when the time is right. Maybe we can all come to some type of agreement with this.....I hope", "My parents not taking me seriously about misophonia is ruining our relationship (photo is what I wrote in another sub as well)  Not sure if you just want to vent or are looking for ideas as well.   I think it is important to know that your parents are not intentionally doing this to torment you.  From their perspective I think they just want to have some quality time as a family, especially as it gets closer to when you and your siblings start to move out and then those times when you are all together will not happen very often.  At the same time I think taking away your coping mechanism is driving you away and is counterproductive to having a family meal together.  So there needs to be some mutual understanding and some compromise from both sides.  When talking to your parents, describe the triggers themselves and the effect of those triggers, do not focus on the person creating the triggers.  You are not going to get very far if they think it is a personal attack.  As for some possible compromises, what has helped me is having some music going at mealtime - not too loud that it makes conversation difficult but just something to focus on instead of the triggers.  Sometimes, if ambient music is not appropriate/possible, I use an earbud in just one ear so I can still participate, but I have something other than the triggers to listen to.  Of course I do not know your situation or the severity of your misophonia so your mileage may vary.  Good luck, I hope you can sort this out. &gt;My mom chews and smacks horribly. My dad inhales his food, slurps, chews with mouth open so you can see and hear all the food\n\n When reading this part I thought it sounded like it was me who wrote this vent (even though I did not). My parents do the exact same. My mom smacks all the time (including when drinking a beverage) and her position when eating triggers me to the max. My dad also inhales his food, even with foods like I have cream. It is so bad I can literally hear what is going on inside of his mouth. When I call them out on it, my mom claims how it is her orthotic (sorry if I spelt it incorrectly) and my dad only eats quietly when being recorded/eating near his mother. My parents refused to eat quietly for me because they truly believed that it was the best thing for me. My mom said, \u201cthe world is not going to change for you, so you had better learn to live in the world as it is\u201d. My dad said he would not be doing me any favors by indulging me and that I was overly sensitive and will eventually get over it. I never did get over it. I left at 18 and never went back. I wish I could tell my parents that they were wrong (now that there is a name for this disorder), but they died a long time ago. Anyway, I do not have any advice. I just wanted you to know that you are not alone. \u2764\ufe0f Have you tried explaining why you want to use the earplugs, and that these noises just make you deeply uncomfortable and it is not an attack on anyone? If you have, I have no advice and I am just sorry you have to deal with this &lt;3\n\nI cannot sit near my so is sister during meals. She has a neuro/physical disorder that makes it REALLY hard for her to chew with her mouth fully shut and without making noises. She can also spend ~an hour and a half eating dinner. I love her to death, but it makes me want to die. I sort of suffered in silence at first, but eventually explained that eating noises bother me (did not try to explain further) and I am working on it. Not that there is much work to be done, so maaaaybe that part was a lie. But it helped everyone understand and try to avoid making awful noises.\n\nI hope everything works out here &lt;3 This sucks and I hope it gets better for you. Thank you. Playing music does help but my mom purposely does not let me louder the music . She knows I want it louder to drown out the chewing , but she does not let me louder it because she knows it is because of that I have but they do not get it... it is hard to use a coping mechanism because my parents get mad It seems like they think they are helping by exposing you to the triggers, that it will help you in the long run. I would maybe try explaining to them that getting you used to the triggers will only hurt you and make the triggers worse in the short term and long term. It sounds like you have already done this some but remind them that coping mechanisms and your earbuds help you (and also talk abt just how much the triggers affect you as another user suggested) and that if they want you to be involved in family time, earbuds are the only way that you can do it safely It frustrates me that parents have that attitude. I get it, the world is like that. But your family should be a place where you CAN find comfort and understanding when elsewhere you do not. Maybe they are actually angry at the situation and not at you specifically?Maybe they hate the idea that their child has a problem that they cannot solve, so they are angry whenever anything reminds them of it? Maybe they do not want you to be bothered by their eating habits, and all they know is they feel angry? Idk, but maybe try saying \u201cI know you both love me and you want me to be happy and knowing that I have a neurological disorder is upsetting to you. But you should not add to my pain by getting angry with me. I did not ask to have this condition and it makes my life absolutely miserable. Please do not make my burden worse for me by getting angry when I tell you what I need.\u201d", "Looking For Good Noise Cancelling Headphones Once again my headphones are kind of broken, but unfortunately I cannot find any good working headphones in my house. I am planning on buying a new pair of headphones before my current one break 100%. Any good noise cancelling headphones you guys recommended? If you have the budget, I would take a look at the Sony WF-1000XM3's. These things block out everything when you have a bit of music on. I moved to these ones from regular in-ear buds and do not regret it at all. \n\nIf you do not like the in-ear design, then the other two to recommend are the Bose QC II's and the Sony WH-1000XM3 (or the new WH-1000XM4 model, but not that much different). Note that many people say that the Bose QC II's are comfier while the Sony WH-1000XM3's are less comfy, but have stronger noise cancellation. \n\nI wrote about this more in my comment ( I mentioned a few budget headphone models and some good reviews to check out. Here is what I wrote so you do not need to click the link:  \n\n\n&gt;If you want to take noise isolation a step further, the WF-1000XM3s are also quite good. I think they need more recognition than they get. They are basically the in-ear version of the WH-1000XM3's. However, they go deep into the ear canal and come with 2 different types of ear buds. The idea is to create a good seal and increase the amount of noise isolation you get. They also have a similar noise cancelling driver which removes background noise. They also have the \"hold to listen\" button, just like the WH-1000XM3s have, which allows you to listen to someone speaking without taking the headphones out.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To be clear, noise isolation is important for blocking out the more intrusive noises like people speaking, eating noises, and more. With some music, you cannot hear much of anything. Think of it like plugging your ears with earplugs but with noise-cancelling and music added.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I mention the XM3 series here because they use an equally performant noise cancelling device as the XM4 series. It is worth noting because a lot of people could save a significant amount of money by purchasing the older XM3 model - assuming that they do not care about the new bluetooth functionality (connect 2 devices simultaneously) and increased music quality that the XM4s offer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I personally like the WF-1000XM3s more than any over-ear headphone for those difficult situations. Although, the battery is not as good as the WH-1000XM3s or the Bose QC II's. So, that is a little bit of a con. But other than that, the in-ear variety are by far my favorite.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Reviews that I found *extremely* helpful and informative:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In-depth comparison of the Bose QC IIs and the Sony WH-1000XM3s can be found ( He does a breakdown of everything to do with the headphones, but the most important part is when he shows a recording of the noise cancelling in-action. I have found his recordings to be an accurate display of each headphone's noise cancelling performance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If anyone is on a budget, check out a taotronics model that competes with even the expensive brands, (  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Finally, my personal favorite, checkout a review of the in-ear Sony WH-1000XM3s compared to the Airpod pro ( Another budget model is reviewed in this video as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps! I decided to splurge on the Sony  WH-1000XM4 and they really are amazing. They are pretty pricey and I kind of had to justify this purchase to myself, but I decided this was an investment in mental health. I recommend them 100%. \n\nEdit: If you are on a budget, I was comparing them to the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 and it looks like they are a VERY good alternative for a third of the price! I recommend checking out some of the product reviews and comparisons on Youtube. Thank you so much! Thank you! Following this \u2022_\u2022 Bose wireless sound cancelling! I have them on almost 24/7 including when I sleep Jabra Elite 75t if you want earbuds. The hear through and active noise cancellation both work great. They also come with the option to play pink or white noise directly through the app. They cover up the annoying sounds that my coworkers like to make, but I can still hear the important stuff. I have accidentally hit the one in my left ear with the phone, because I forget I am wearing it. \n\nFor on ear, I love my Beats. I have always though they were ridiculously overpriced regular headphones. And then I got a pair. I said ahhhhhh out loud the second I put them on. It was so QUIET. The hear through feature is great on them as well. \n\n(\n\n( for the Jabras, because apparently I have weird shaped ears.\n\n( Thank you! I hope it helps!", "Helping some one with possible misophonia? I hope this post is allowed. My mom was never diagnosed with misophonia, and she might not even know what it is. I want to try to help her so that the house is not such a miserable place for her, but I do not really know how. The problem is compounded because I am Deaf, so I often do not even know I am making sounds.  Hey! First of all, thank you for being kind enough to actually care about this. Most people would not give a damn. Second of all, if you feel like she has Misophonia, maybe you can ask her in a subtle way (\"hey, is it annoying when people make sounds while eating?\"). There is nothing really wrong with asking, communication is key! Also, I personally do not think you have to actually be diagnosed to know that you have Misophonia. If it really seems like she suffers from it, you can start off with the \"basics\" if you have not already. For example, try to refrain from eating \"crunchy\" foods next to her (chips, apples, cucumbers, carrots, etc). Chewing noises are probably the most common trigger, but other sounds such as slurping, crunching, mouth noises, tongue clicking, sniffling, and tapping are all auditory stimuli that incite misophonia. The fact that you are deaf will make it harder to tell whether or not you are making sounds, and some people also have visual triggers as well. So honestly, to be blunt, the only way to actually help her is to not eat around her, or at least not often. But before all of this, I really suggest you guys talk about this, maybe it can help resolve some problems. Good luck and have a nice day! So true about visual triggers as well! Do you feel sounds? Do sounds have to be at a pretty high volume to be able to feel them? I am eating right now and trying to determine how I would know I am making noise if I cannot rely on the sounds.\n\n\nI think my husband and I are at a place where I can look at him and he knows the sounds he is making or that are happening are not great for me. If your mom could visually signal you when you are making sounds that are not good for her it would help you identify them and how to stop.\n\n\nIf that is going to work, she needs to understand misophonia. How does she process new info? For me, if I can read a few articles from Wikipedia/internet it makes me feel more comfortable with the subject. thank you for caring that is a huge first step. i think talking to her and telling her to signal to you if she is bothered could help. make sure she knows no hard feelings if she has to walk out for a sec. noise canceling headphones or earplugs are lifesavers too.  It is a really difficult thing to address without sitting down with the person and finding out what triggers them.\n\nMaybe open with your concern for her, you have heard about this thing called misophonia, you are worried that she may be a sufferer and you are trying to find out if there is anything you - or anyone else- can do to help.", "Sick of this. I am sick of my family telling me that the sounds are not that bad. I said to my brother, \u201cMaybe for you.\u201d and he said \u201cAnd for you.\u201d The fuck do I say to that?\n\nNo matter how many times I try to explain it to my family, they do not understand.\n\nThat is my only wish. But I do not think they will ever get it.\n\nI have four siblings, two parents, and one soon to be stepfather.\n\nI have a big family.\n\nAnd it is hell.\n\nNo matter how much I explain, how much I get annoyed, it is not clear to them.\n\nI have explained COUNTLESS times to everyone that I do have something wrong.\n\nOne of my sisters said \u201ceveryone has misophonia.\u201d That Is false.\n\nMy other sister, and two brothers do not take it into account at all.\n\nMy stepfather and mother are fine. \n\nMy father tells me I have to \u201cbrush it off and deal with it\u201d. Is that really what I have to do?\n\nIs there nothing I can do to help myself? I do not have any coping mechanisms that work for me.\n\nMusic does not work.\n\nMoving to a different room only works sometimes.\n\nI cannot fucking ignore it like everyone tells me to.\n\nMeditating does not even work.\n\nI do not want to be a burden toward my family but I am losing confidence.\n\nAnd you know what? I am embarrassed as hell about my misophonia. I sound insane everytime I explain it.\n\nI am so miserable, I do not feel like my family likes me because of this. I feel so terrible. I cannot make them understand, can I?\n\nAm I just having the wrong approach? It is okay for you to feel that way. This is not your fault. It is not you being silly and making a fuss, and there is no need to feel guilty for the way you involuntarily feel and react. \n\nI agree, it is a hard thing to explain without sounding exaggerated and like a poor excuse, but some things require an explanation, no matter how much the other person would disagree with that answer. \n\nMy family do not understand me, they just tell me off for making a fuss and getting upset when it is really beyond my control. That is quite something to cope with, that the people you love do not think of your emotions as real and as distressing as they are.\n\nI am wondering if you have introduced them to any research or resources? There is so much out there on the Internet to help explain to others and show how you are truly affected. Sometimes, that does not work, but it is completely worth the shot. Maybe choose the person you are closest to, and sit down and discuss it?\n\nYou are most definitely not a burden. It is okay to have misophonia, and to struggle with noises that your family make, and it is not something that you are alone in. Quite possibly your family just do not understand how or why, and thus you can show them.\n\nI hope things get better :) Well, that made me cry.\n\nI want to show them research, but, in truth, they do not care enough.\n\nEven if I did, they will forget I ever showed them. And it will go back to how it is now.\n\nCome to think of it... I have showed them. But do they care? No. My mom was the only one who took the time to look through articles with me, but I told her that I just wanted my own family to get it, and all she says is, \u201cI do not know, u/inuaa.\u201d\nI think she is starting to care less.\n\nI do not want to be pushy with talking about it, because I have tried quite a lot.\n\nI am close to just giving up on trying to explain it. I am close to accepting that I will have to live with these thoughts and feelings, because it just seems all they ever do is irritate people. I am so sorry for making you cry \u2764\n\nI no longer discuss this kind of thing with my family. They know I react badly to certain noises and that I will make a (what they deem unnecessary) fuss about it. Once, I refused to leave my bedroom and eat, and I was threatened with a number of unfavourable things. That was the only time my emotions with regards to misophonia have ever been discussed.\n\nI have just learnt to stay quiet on the subject. Take plenty of time for myself. It is okay to not spend time with someone if you do not want to. When you are feeling overwhelmed, you can take yourself away from the noises and listen to music (noise-cancelling headphones?) or just bury your head in a cushion and release the emotion. Your family might not understand, but you do. You take care of yourself because that is what matters. Do what helps you to cope. It is not about them, this is about you being happy and healthy and coping with all of the emotions that you are going through as a result of misophonia.\n\nHave you discussed this with anyone outside of your family? I have struggles at school (obviously not at the moment!) and I have had to be quiet open with my friends about what I am going through. It has meant that I have a listening ear for me to vent or just somewhere to relax a little and recover emotionally. If things get too much, then you could always try texting or calling a friend (I am open to DMs if you just want a space to vent or talk about it).\n\nAs for irritating people, of course that is frustrating. But we all irritate other people whether or not it is related to misophonia. Your misophonia is just something which you cannot control and therefore you really should not feel at all guilty for such involuntary reactions. Your priority is you, and then you worry about other people. But you first. Always. Oh, I did not cry because I was sad, I just cry because I am sensitive and a subject such as misophonia makes me feel miserable.\n\nI am also usually forced to go out to eat, and at dinner when I want to move away from anyone that is annoying me, my father always made me sit back by them. I was so angry.\n\nI have actually suggested noise cancelling headphones.\nMy father said to me, \u201cFor what? To isolate yourself more?\u201d He has also told me to \u201cbrush it off and deal with it.\u201d\n\nMusic does not help at all anymore. I am pretty sure my misophonia is quite severe.\n\nAnd all the coping mechanisms I try either never work, or only work sometimes. Moving to another room results in sometimes hearing a sound still, and that is just as bad.\n\nA good portion of my friends know about my misophonia. One of them has very similar reactions to the same sounds as me, and we relate a lot. If it is even possible, there is a chance she also has misophonia.\n\nI have tried to explain my reactions are involuntary. My sister said I cannot use my misophonia as an excuse to be mean, and I could get if I am being rude, but she does not understand I have no control over how I react and that it is no excuse. Indeed, I am forced to endure family dinnertimes too. It is not fun, and I am sorry there is no way to avoid it. I really think the only thing that is ever helped me is to isolate myself from the noises. As much as it may seem hard in other aspects, I would recommend trying anything you think could possibly help - that is going to be the only way you identify how best to help yourself.\n\nIt is hard to go through something so individual and different from other people. But you and your friend clearly have a good relationship and a lot of understanding betwern you. She will know you well, so how about you discuss your coping techniques with her? When I have brought up things like that with my friend, they have always pointed out areas for changr or improvement. That is a possibility for you to find a little more help.\n\nI am sorry I cannot promise a quick and less tiring solution, and I hope you can find the positives amongst this hardship There truly is not any quick and less tiring solutions for this.\n\nThere is not an actual ACTUAL solution anyway.\nSimply ways to cope, but not get rid of it.\n\nI try to isolate myself as much as possible, but it gets bad when you are shamed for it.\n\nMy friend and I discuss stuff already, so we have got that. We are really close and do have a good relationship.\n\nThank you for talking to me, it made me feel better and made my day. \ud83d\udc95 There is no right approach. I am sorry, but that is the reality.  \n\nYou cannot make them understand. But just because they do not get it does not mean they cannot try to help you. I am sure that your family is concerned for your wellbeing even if they seem like they are being insensitive. I remember my dad telling me \"You will grow out of it\" and \"Just deal with it\" and \"I used to get annoyed by noises too but then I learned how to tolerate them and you can do the same\". But as the years went on, he eventually started to accept that my misophonia would not go away. And it took years of crying, screaming, and fighting to get to the point where he actually takes my triggers seriously sometimes (when he is in a good mood, at least).  \n\nIf you are able to, I think you should try to talk to your parents (and stepfather) when your siblings are not around. Do your best to *calmly* explain that the reason why you cannot tolerate certain noises is because your brain works differently from theirs. Explain to them what they can do to support you. Hopefully at least one of your parents will be willing to work with you to find a solution together. \n\n~~Obligatory \"I am not a professional; take my advice with a grain of salt\"~~\n\nGood luck! Damn, youre literally such a great person. I can try . Remember, it is okay if it goes horribly wrong. Living with misophonia sucks and it can take a lot of trial and error to learn how to manage it. That is true I guess. I just wish it did not exist. Mmmm same. But hey, at least there is actually research being done now. We young people can hold onto the hope that proper medical treatment may become available someday. I really hope so.. I feel like I am not normal having misophonia so \n\nAnd the thought of already being this miserable when I am still kind of young and then having to live with it for as long as I exist is terrible.   ): Could this maybe help?\n\n(\n\nCould you get them to take you to a doctor, and with help from him/her maybe you could get some recognition and support from your family?\n\nAre there things that they DO actually do to help and you maybe can leverage those by recognizing them and 'rewarding' them for helping? Or making others aware of what your stepfather and mother do that they could do as well?\n\nBut you are not wrong. You should NEVER be ashamed of or embarrassed about a disability. It is something you were given, you had no choice and you have to deal with it, and... if others are able to respond with help, then they have a RESPONSIBILITY to help. Not an obligation, but a responsibility. You are not a burden. Your demand for a helpful response, one that they have the ability to supply, is not a burden.\n\nIf they choose to respond with no help, or worse, with teasing and neglect, then recognize that this is ABUSE. Make them aware that it is ABUSE. Do not accept abuse or neglect, fight for your rights as a disabled person.\n\nReview your approach when asking for help. When did you get help and what had you done then that you should try to repeat in the future? Practice your script so that emotions do not trash your words.\n\nAnd the last thing I can think of is that if you do have a sit-down meeting with anyone to discuss it, decide what your PPP is. What is the Purpose of the meeting (to discuss your disability and how it is affecting everyone), what Process the meeting will follow (explain what miso is, what triggers you, how it is like getting stung by a wasp, what effects this has on the entire family, and what others have done that has helped), and what the Payoff is for everyone (your sanity, your pain reduces, your behavior improves, everyone happier). Explain the PPP *before* the meeting so that everyone in it is aware of the Payoff and will help to reach it.\n\nI wish you luck. If it all fails, just get one of these and blast their asses every time they piss you off.\n\n( That is very good advice. I am going to screenshot that so I can actually remember it, thank you so much, you are really nice!\n\nAlso, that last part made me laugh, I may be broke but I can afford that horn. :)   This is how you get your family to take you seriously. It is a neurological disorder, the science is burgeoning, and underexposed, but it is genetic. \nYou are not alone, there are literally dozens of us. \n\nI fucking love squishy earplugs.", "If you could put into words what misophonia feels like, how would you describe it?  I was trying to find a way to articulate this to someone I live with, as it is been a problem a lot during dinner time.  Eating sounds are my biggest trigger.  What came to mind was \"Imagine if I put my hands on your head to hold you in place while eating directly beside your ears in the most disgusting way imaginable, and there was nothing you could do about it.\"  Because it is not just a \"gross\" or \"annoying\" sound.  It feels like it is intentional, even when you know it is not, and it makes you feel helpless against it because it is impossible to ignore.  IME, anyway. It feels like everyone around you is pulling your nails straight out of your fingers, and them being baffled and upset if you tell them it hurts It is like everyone is out to hurt you and you cannot escape, and if you go away or ask them to stop they pretend they did not do a thing. Emotionally. For me it is like an internal screaming and the feeling like spiders are crawling all over my skin and there is no escape.  \n\nCertain noises bother me - like changes in pitch and volume rapidly. So its people's voices and their speech patterns , changing stations on the radio using the knob and alarms.  Basically  anything  jarring. Reeeeeeee I am allergic to sound Fingernails on a chalkboard inside my soul where no one else can hear it. agony Torture. Like they are physically and mentally torturing me. Like it needs to stop or my heads going to explode from the build up I find it odd how nobody is mentioning fear. For me trigger sounds teriffy me, I feel like I am forced to watch a dark web video, it is agonizing A waking nightmare. It feels like needles, or a sword going \"ssshhiing!!!\" through my brain. Then tickley on the inside of my brain; must scratch the heck out of it! Physically I feel all my muscles tense and my heart starts pounding, it is like restless legs but everywhere at once, kind of like when at night sometimes your muscles tense really bad and you have to do the thing where you just move it but it comes like more of a twitch (I hope this is not something that just happens to me). Emotionally it makes me feel afraid and angry and then guilty because I know I should not be angry but I do anyways, cannot help it. Like a hive of bees buzzing suddenly and intensely right inside of your ears. Blind rage I feel like a wind-up toy. My key gets twisted until I am nearly at my breaking point. Ouch  \u201cBrain rape\u201d. Fight or flight, but you cannot escape or attack it either, so you are left helpless and scared that you might just explode, and what would happen if you did. Every second feels incredibly long and you can only pray for it to end. It feels like you are being assaulted but obviously people do not understand how they are affecting you since it is in your head, but you just cannot help being enraged. If you manage to suppress it for a while, it will just be worse when you cannot anymore. And all the bad thoughts just make you feel guilty like a monster afterwards. You become a more negative person overall because you are being constantly triggered and the aftermath lasts even longer and then you are just waiting for the next one. You just cannot get away from it and do not know how to cope. Sometimes you just cry out of frustration. A volcano filling with lava i feel like i am crazy.", "Singing/humming/clapping?

Hello everyone.\n\nNow a few of you may have seen me post this addon here on this subreddit a few times, but I wanted to share it in this post for those that may end up or are suffering from trigger names (I.E misophonia getting triggered from seeing a name or word.) (I.E misonomia.) Allow me to introduce you to SwappitySwap, an addon for chrome that swaps your trigger word for a word that is non triggering. This is especially useful for those that suffer from this particular type of miso and want help when reading discord posts, online articles, reddit posts as well as many other things. You can get the addon here: \n\nKeep in mind the addon is case sensitive when it comes to words, so make sure you are replacing your trigger word in any way possible (I.E all caps, words with a capital letter in the beginning of it, words all lower case, words with punctuation anywhere in it, sentences with words together in one sentence that make the trigger name/word etc.).  I hope this addon helps you.  what if it is just a letter that triggers me? i will not disclose it but i will tell you it is not in this comment lol. what about swapping letters out for a \"-\"? it is an uncommon letter so i doubt it will be any trouble to understand when reading but is that possible with this add-on? It is indeed possible with this addon, however be prepared for some funky stuff happening with many things ceasing to function because many things may require the letter for the site to function properly or even function at all. Do keep in mind this is possible to get around if you disable the addon and re-enable it via right clicking it and selecting \"this addon can change data when you click the extension\" etc.\n\nI hope this is helpful to you. Super interesting! I do not have this trigger, but I will put this on the solutions to add to the ( review site.", "Does this actively resonate with anyone? In the 2 years I have had this disability, I have never physically observed anyone with a severity of this condition similar to mine. So as some cry into the ethos for reassurance, does my story resonate with any of you guys on any extremely personal level?\n\nThe ONLY thing I associate society with anymore is trigger noises. Every single minor task outside my house has become a major endeavor due to my constant vigilant mentality. The sudden, harsh reaction overwhelms me in an instant, so I have had countless visible meltdowns. I have never physically encountered anyone who has difficulty masking what I would perceive as Misophonia. I am just a teenager either speed walking around public with his ears covered, or wearing big Bose headphones, each one being visibly paranoid. My therapist says people cope with their Anxiety in personal ways, which is why I usually do not visibly see anyone upset. I agree, but as a teen, you would think I would see at-least ONE kid covering their ears and/or specific people actively wearing headphones. Lastly, my ASD should help the context of this. With my obsessive thinking, routines, meltdowns and lack of filtration. \n\nWriting this made me a bit sad, so this will double as advice. Is this severe hypervigilance controllable? The instinct to associate society with triggers IS the main culprit to this whole situation. But the therapeutic techniques meant to mitigate said Anxiety are futile. I permanently have this distinct brain feeling and heightened perception when out in public. I will not take any advice as a substitute for professional help. I just want input because I am desperate. My system build to remain sane is doing well, but it is just a mask on top of my extreme emotional fragility I cannot fix. I just want what I would consider a normal life back so I can actively feel the belonging and connection I so desperately need. Like, I had to brace myself for over a week to get a haircut today. No one should have to brace for a haircut. I am so sorry to everyone who suffers from this satanic disability. I hope this community gives everyone here at least a small amount of hope. Everyone here is a warrior. You are not alone. I struggle to mask mine and often embarrass myself in public by having to leave restaurants, isolate myself, cover my ears, or visibly displaying how horrified and scared I am to the point that strangers have commented on it. I avoid certain situations and last week I had to mentally prepare myself days in advance for a flight and a winery tour. \n\nUnfortunately I do not know any solutions, all I can say is do not feel like you are alone in this. You can PM me anytime for support. This is the main reason I cut my own hair, it might not look perfect but I cannot imagine the looks I would get squirming and maybe even crying while getting it cut professionally. \n\nAlso I can completely relate to everything you said. I hate that I have to congratulate myself on leaving the house. It takes me days to work up the courage to go outside and even then I am *constantly* paranoid about being triggered. I have also tried to look around to see if other people may have misophonia but no one seems physically bothered like I do. I really hope things get better for the both of us. I do not know if this will help, it helps me. When I start to be triggered, I slow down my breathing, I do \"square\" breathing, where I inhale on a count of four, hold for at least two counts (supposed to be for four but it takes me at least two \"squares\" to do it)  and then exhale for four counts, then pause for four counts, then start over with an intake for four counts, etc. Depending on the trigger I can feel better right away, or I have to keep square breathing until I can leave the situation. Noise cancelling headphones saved my life &amp; my sanity.... you are not alone, I am 53 and have had this since my 20s.\n\nI have over ear headphones (visual signal I am not engaging), smaller Bose set &amp; and ear buds that do not look quite so rude to use when somebody is feral kid is in meltdown so a bit more subtle, but I carry them everywhere as I travel for work and toddler in meltdown at an airport is extremely unpleasant for me. My misophonia has also made going out really stressful. I especially have a hard time in places like movie theaters when the person sitting next to me is scarfing down popcorn. Just thinking about it is triggering to me. I have set up a few personal rules for me if I am going to go out though - for instance, if I am going to a place like a restaurant or cafe, I will not go unless I have headphones or earplugs. If I am going to watch a movie, I have get a seat on the aisle close to an exit. I also bring earplugs there because most of the time the film is loud enough that I can hear through the earplugs but they will drown out any eating or wrapper noises. These solutions are not ideal but they do work for me.", "I am losing my mind Everything my family does is absolutely driving me nuts. I feel like I cannot do this anymore. \n\nBeing a socially anxious introvert, quarantine was a really nice escape and felt good for a bit. But so many months into it, I am going mad. \n\nI have developed new triggers now. My earlier triggers like chewing were relatively easy to avoid since I could just leave the room and my family was aware about it. Now it is just like every f*cking thing is triggering me. EVERYTHING. I am annoyed even if I am not getting triggered, because I am constantly on the edge, awaiting a trigger. Constantly on flight or fight mode. \n\nEvery day is torture. I do not know what to do anymore, there is no escape. Why do I have this disorder please why does it exist. Why. I feel you. I hate it when I am constantly on edge, waiting for a sound to be made. It is torturing to say the least. Someone always has to eat when I am around. My triggers also worsened, I cannot even be with my sister in a suit room without feeling super on edge. Breathing, eating, lip smacking, teeth sucking, burping, nail biting and so on. I am glad that I am going back to school because I do not seem to have any other triggers for now. \n\nThis disorder is also way more difficult to understand and explain to others so they just see you as a \u00ab\u00a0 faker\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0attention seeker\u00a0\u00bb it is sad, really sad. But we have each other here, that is what is keeping me sane Dude I am so, so sorry. The waiting-for-the-trigger part can be almost worse than the trigger itself. \n\nI found this sub pretty recently (thank God!), and I am sure this is posted here somewhere already, but really good earplugs have saved my life for sounds like the ones you have mentioned. Personally I have never had luck with noise-cancelling earphones or white noise machines. \n\nThe earplugs available at drugstores do not do anything, and I hope I am not breaking any rules here, but I get mine in bulk from the earplug store. You can order an ( that range in size and noise-cancelling ability, so you can figure out which ones work best for you. My absolute favorite are the (  I wore these babies on the bus when I lived in LA, and they blocked \\*everything - people talking on the phone, chewing, rustling bags, radios. \n\nGood luck, I hope you can find some peace. I am so sorry. That sounds really terrible. \n\nI relate to those triggers you have mentioned too. It is great that you are going back to school...I hope it gets better for you!\n\nThank you so much for the support, it really means a lot. Yeah faker, attention seeker is how most people see us unfortunately. You are right, this sub really keeps me going too. \u2665\ufe0f Yeah, the waiting-for-the-trigger-part is sometimes most horrible. \n\nI am glad you found this sub- it really is relieving and supportive. I am so happy that you found a relief in the form of ear plugs! \n\nMan I am legit emotional right now. This is so damn kind of you. Thank you so much, I really have no words. I will definitely check them out. Thank you again\u2665\ufe0f I know what you mean about new triggers. Before quarantine the misophonia was still really bad but i didnt get triggered by repetitive noises (except coughing and sniffing) but after being in the house so long with a door right next to my room that does not stop banging if not closed properly, everytime i leave the bathroom i have to make sure the door is closed so everything is right", "How do I tell my mom about my misophonia? I am a teen. I have been silently struggling with misophonia for a couple of months. My family is aware that I do not like certain sounds (chewing, swallowing, etc.) as I have presented them over time, but are not aware of the actual disorder itself and other, unrelatable triggers as I am a bit too shy to actually talk about it to them and was never given the right opportunity. Unfortunately, these are pretty common noises to be annoyed at. This is useful in a bit. Today at dinner, I broke down and started crying because of all of the trigger noises that were filling my ears and constantly replaying in my head. My mom pulled me aside and me, being put on the spot to describe what was happening, I made it really general and listed more of the common noises that triggered me. My mom basically said \"yeah, I get you, we all find these annoying\". How can I tell her that this is not relatable for her? I do not see her constantly not trying to break down and start sobbing at the table. I feel like this is a good opportunity to talk with her about it and go into more depth about what I am dealing with but I want to get it right. What should I say? How did you tell your parents? Anything is appreciated. Why do not you show them this community?  Find a couple posts that really resonate with you and let your parents read them.  Show them that this is real, and suffered by people of all ages.  I am 44, and have been suffering from misophonia for decades.  You are not alone. Thank you, I appreciate this. In my experience, one of the key things to distinguish when explaining misophonia to people is that yes, everyone can be annoyed by those noises, but people with misophonia are not able to tune it out like most people. \n\nThe metaphorical switch being flipped in our brains causes a fight or flight reaction. Staying and sitting immersed with your trigger sounds and not having an emotional outburst is the same as our ancestors staying in an open space (rather than running away) when there is a lion, bear, or some predator running at us to kill and eat us. It seems ridiculous to compare the two scenarios, but the fight or flight reactions in our brains have evolved to protect us from things, and the sound of a lion or bear roaring triggers that fight or flight reaction. \n\nNow, people with misophonia have a set of sounds that trigger that same reaction and it is traumatic for most people to sit quietly and remain in the space where those trigger sounds are. \n\nIf you struggle to effectively communicate your internal feelings and reactions without generalizing them, it might help to simply have scholarly articles that you can send a link to the person with whom you are having the conversation, or even print them off if possible. Anything to open the door to the conversation that is less generalized. You do not have to walk through the door by having a conversation about specifics, but at least present the opportunity for the other people to walk through the door beyond generalized conversations with some knowledge about the background and science to misophonia. \n\nIt is really invigorating to hear that you are a teenager and looking for ways to have this conversation with your family! I did not find out what misophonia was until I was 19 or 20 after suffering with it for over ten years with a family who thought I was over emotional and dramatic despite sitting quietly most of the time with that lion or bear roaring in my face. \n\nBest of luck xx and let us know how it goes! Thank you so much, you have no idea how much this means to me! You are so very welcome. The community here on Reddit is amazing, and I really do believe that you will find a solution that works for you! \ud83d\udc95", "Six ways to adjust now if your spouse has misophonia  ( an amp-less link for anyone who needs it", "My mother does not give a fuck I have lived with misophonia for about 5 years now. All of my family members thought I was insane at first, but 2 years ago they realized that it would help me a lot if they tried not to make trigger noises. My dad and my brother still thought I was dumb, but at least they understood how uncomfortable my triggers make me. \n\nThe situation got a lot worse during the lockdown, so I decided to tell them about what exactly misophonia is and how serious I am. My dad and my brother now take me seriously and do not think I am stupid anymore, they really try not to trigger me.\n\nBut my mother just does not care at all. She knows what my triggers are and makes those sounds on purpose. One of my worst triggers is cracking your knuckles and guess what she does whenever she gets the chance to? \n\nAnd if I tell her not to do that she says something like 'jUsT iGNoRe iT', even if I told her a million times that I cannot.\n\nMy dad told her how serious my situation is and she just said 'i aLSo hAvE miSoPHoNiA bECauSe i GeT anNoYeD whEn mY ChiLDrEn tALk LouDLy'.\n\nAnother gReAT example of what she says is that 'everyone is annoyed by some noises' and I am only more sensitive 'because I' staring at my phone all day'\n\nA few days ago she decided to crack her knuckles right in front of me, I was not in a good mood that day so I told her to stop in a loud voice. And guess who felt attacked because her daughter is sO eViL?\nShe started shouting at me that if I want her to move out I could just tell her.\n\nThe last example of what she says is this: another really bad trigger of mine are eating sounds, especially my mom's. I told her this and she just said 'should I stop eating then?!'.\n\nShe has ZERO understanding for how serious misophonia is, and the way she reacts to it is destroying my mental health. I try to avoid my mother but not even my room is a safe place. Our bathroom is right next to my room and whenever she leaves the bathroom I hear her cracking her knuckles when she walks past my door. Or she decides to sing as loud as she can, and I am in my room trying to cover my ears so I do not have to hear it.\n\nI am starting to hate my mother and my mental health is falling apart because of her. If you feel you are being emotionally abused and are running outta options. I would recommend you seek some help. Here is a link describing emotional abuse and domestic violence:     If you feel you are being abuse you should contact thehotline.org. I am not saying these are your only options or even that you are at this point yet. But I am saying that you do not deserve to be punished for something you cannot control, and speaking from experience, letting this go on can lead to some serious long-term effects. Best of luck with whatever choice you make. Honestly I think she is clearly getting satisfaction out of triggering you and getting a rise out of you. That is extremely toxic and I am sorry that it is coming from a parent. \n\nOne of the best ways to combat bullies like her is the \"grey rock\" strategy. It is really hard with misophonia because we feel really strong rage when we hear the trigger noises, but do your best to give her the ultimate cold shoulder. When she does the triggering things, just leave the room. No words. Just leave. When she confronts you- show no emotion. Do not respond. Dead eyes. Walk away. If she offers to do something fun with you or buy you something, politely refuse. Let her lash out at you and make a fool of herself, and maybe she will realize you are not the problem in the household. It also will communicate to your dad and brother that you are done entertaining your mom's crap. \n\nBest case scenario, she burns out and stops purposefully triggering you. Maybe could even lead to her apologizing and acknowledging your disorder as real. In that case, you could start to heal your friendship with her.\n\nWorst case, you just continue to distance yourself from her toxic behavior as long as needed. You win either way. I will definetely search for help if nothing else works. Thank you so much!\ud83e\udd7a I guess that is the only thing that will make her think about her behaviour, I will try it.\nThank you for your support, it really means much to me :) I know it is hard, and I can tell you want a good relationship with your mom.

Now I just mutter all kinds of obscenities to myself.\nCurrently I live with my grandpa, I have had issues with him since the beginning. I do not talk to him cause I cannot stand seeing/hearing certain things. He is partially deaf so he talks very loudly. No matter where he is is the house or even outside, I can hear him, 80% of the time I cannot hear the person he is talking to, just him. He is got some health problems and will literally cough every 5-30 seconds for hours. I try to escape and sit in the driveway in my truck but I can still hear the coughing. On warmers days he will sir outside and cough or talk to a friend so I cannot even enjoy working on my vehicles, I will have to go back inside and hide.\n\nI have tried shutting the door, blocking the crack, playing music or tv loudly. It is okay until there is a split second of silence on tv and he coughs at the perfect moment every time. My ears do not hold earbuds well at all. I get very uncomfortable and constantly move around so bulkier headphones do not stay put but for a minute. \nI switch between tv, YouTube on my phone, reading stuff on my phone in silence, reading books. So I do not think I could just wear headphones and be good. \nIt is driving me absolutely insane now and I do not know what to do. \n\nAs far as telling him about it, ive only ever written a letter that did include \"sound of chewing, but I have a lot of triggers\" is why I do not talk to you. Secretly I cannot sit and talk to him either cause he wears open toed shoes and his toes literally do no stop wiggling, along with a pretty consistent lip flicking.

I would recommend paying careful attention to how squeeky the floor is when your viewing a building, and tapping the walls a little to see if they seem thin or not. Thank you for your reply. The loud foot steps is one of my concerns about moving into an apartment. I feel like I might be just like mr Heckles from friends. But at least I wont feel rude if I put headphones on to drown it out. Most of the places with roommates are the ones with old shitty buildings.

Could be you just do not like him. Everything else he does that drives you mad could be coincidental.\n\nWhat really annoys me is people using their cell's speakerphone instead of holding their phone up to their ear. It is loud, tinny, scratchy, and often hard to understand. Naturally, people start yelling into the speakerphone themselves. Trying to tell them that it is not nice falls on deaf ears. And then they are surprised when I leave the noise polluted area. Yeah - after I cooled off I remembered that I do not like him in general and that is contributing to my anxiety.

Well, maybe you are just noise sensetive. Perhaps do some research. It is okay, my dude. Support.

Most of mine are more common, like mouth noises, but I have got some weird ones too\u2014recordings of moving water, for example, which I have never heard anyone else mention in this context. \nMy point is, I think the reaction to a sound is more indicative of misophonia than what sounds trigger that reaction.

What is the point in slamming the groceries down onto the counter like you get back from the store?!? Why does every piece of furniture need to be moved so brutally?!!\n\nIt is the cherry on the cake really, because I deal with my misophonia by using earplugs or music but these get passed those barriers. It is like there is no refuge anymore.\n\nUgh I do not know what this post is for, had to vent. Totally get what you mean. One of mine is people just being unnecessarily loud. Walking loudly, talking loudly, slamming things down onto tables when they could be placed disc gently. Ugh yeah why does everyone have to be so LOUD? Loud cars, loud music, loud kids etc etc just STFU! I hate aggressively loud people so much. Not only noises like stomping and pacing around, but the kind of people who literally scream in your ear as you are standing a few feet away and trying to have a conversation because they do not know how to talk at a normal fucking volume. I swear my family all walk on their fucking heels, when my brother gets home from work at like 10 he leaves his boots on as he stomps you the stairs, and I have to go to sleep before then bc of school and it just sucks so much. I have been waiting for this. I never understand why people slam cabinets and drawers shut, have to dramatically sneeze or yawn, have to slam down cups and silverware, or walk so damn loudly. Only recently have I noticed how quietly I do things. I even catch myself walking on my toes at home because IDK I do not need to stomp around like a BARBARIAN After spending a year WFH with a loud-talker for one roommate and an actor (loud and clueless), I finally have my own place. The peace is amazing. Good lord I know someone like this. Has to walk aggressively, sit down in a chair as hard as possible, kick his shoes off instead of taking them off, drives like the world is ending.... everything is so over the top and aggressive.\n\nEvery door is closed loudly and everything has to be repeated because he just is not really paying attention to anything but himself. I actually am exhausted after being around this person. There has to be a name for them. Thank you for this! I can totally relate to everything you said. Sometimes I find myself thinking \u201cam I crazy?\u201d because it is like literally everything my spouse does drives me nuts!

I have been having issues with one particular sound and now hearing about misophonia, I am wondering if one particular effect this has on me is misophonia? \n\n\nThe only trigger I have is my parents kissing. As soon as they do it I begin to have a panic attack and a wave of negative emotions come over me. But one particular thing that happens that I self harm every time they do it. For example I would smack my head or bang it on a wall. It is so instant I do not realise what I have done until it is done. \n\nI have explained it to my dad and he shouted at me that \u201che has a right to kiss my mother\u201d. Which I have no issue with. It is just around me where I can clearly hear it. \n\nThey got divorced but still together (a lot of drama and trauma resulted in it) \n\nI remember being irritated about the sound when I was younger but it was not as bad as it is now. I did not conflict pain upon myself. But I am still wondering if I do have misophonia or does it sound like a different issue. I am planning on going to the doctors in the future about it. But before that I want to narrow it down a bit and see how I can somewhat control it until then. It does sound similar to Misophonia, but seems like there might be another thing going on as well. we are not medically or psychologically trained so we cannot diagnose you, but that sounds like misophonia. As /u/Alex_Bailey_12 stated, we (at the very least, they and I) are not medical professionals, and are not qualified to provide a diagnosis.  That said, yours does not sound EXACTLY like misophonia as it usually presents, but your symptoms themselves are definitely misophonic in nature, especially if they are causing you to self-harm.  What I mean is, misophona is not usually one specific noise.  It is more like an array of noises.\n\nI cannot help but feel that there is more to it than this, but I do not know your relationship with your parents and would not be qualified to discern what it is if I did have that information, but I strongly recommend you seek out a clinic that specializes in family behavioral therapy.  A person or team trained in understanding family dynamics.  I went to one, and with my help, he drew this whole \"map\" of my immediate family and friends I regard as family, and used various \"connectors\" to associate positive and negative inter-relational traits with them.  Then he helped me identify the core causes of harm in the family dynamic (the root of the poison from my perspective).  Turned out a lot of my anger was misdirected at my dad.  I reconciled with him after basically writing him out of my life and not going to Thanksgiving.  By Christmas, we had a few good talks and now my relationship with him is very good, and I have lost my resentment for the way he treated me as a child.  Prior to that, I barely tolerated him for decades, had constant nightmares about him, and actively resented certain events.\n\nI only share my story to give an example as to why I would recommend a behavioral therapist.  They can really help you stop hurting yourself and start focusing on healing the emotional wounds that you have. Thank you for replying! I am aware that nobody is trained or anything of that nature to diagnose me. It was more of a question of does this sound like misophonia  but now I got some opinion I can now get an idea what it could possibly be so I can explain to my doctor a bit more and find new ways to deal with it in the meantime. But thank you so much I do appreciate it!! ", "New Trigger My parents are supportive of me and current triggers but I have started to think that another sound is a trigger.

This is not something I can just get over or deal with and exposure therapy does not help. Thank you Unfortunately, with this disorder, new triggers can be \"activated\" anytime. Hopefully your parents understand that it is not a static set of triggers that will not change over time.", "I have had Lyme disease for the past 2 years I do not know where else to post this, but I really just want to tell someone. I just found out that the reason I have had enormous chronic fatigue, the reason my misophonia has been terrible, and the reason that I can hardly do any kind of work anymore was literally just because a tick bit me and I did not notice. I have had to move schools (I am about a senior in high school), I have gone to lots of doctors and I have been told that my fatigue has been from a million different things. I have generally had doctors tell me that I am depressed or that it is caused by anxiety or something else. I have had my life slowly stripped away from me, I have lost virtually all the friends I had, my grades are nothing like they used to be and my life\u2019s course has been totally altered all because I did not check for ticks at some point when I was 16. Tiredness makes my misophonia much worse and I have hardly been able to function in public places like schools and restaurants because of it. \n\nIf anyone else has had flu-like symptoms for a long time, *please* get tested for Lyme. My doctor told me that it is fixable and that I just have to take antibiotics for a few months. Here is to hoping that I actually get better. \n\nI am so happy that there might be an end in sight for how I have been feeling. I really thought that I would probably just have to live the rest of my life like this and now it seems like that will not be the case. I am really sorry about all that has happened to you. I wish there was something I could say or do to make your situation better, but I cannot even begin to imagine what you have gone through. Thank you!!

How do I reverse it? Can someone please help!\n\nBecause of my constant exposure to the misophonic triggers I ended up developing conditions that I have coined misothemia (the hatred of sight) and misonomia (the hatred of names). However I also feel the constant exposure to my triggers has made something within me numb, because my physiological responses are not activating they should.\n\nNow I am looking for a way to get these responses back any way possible, please, I feel, so numb, cold and mentally naked, please help me reverse this numbing and dying physiological response. i am not sure how I can help you other than recommending talking to a professional about this. i am sorry you feel this way, I hope you can find the help you need &lt;333\n(also i think u mean -kinesis and not -kisenic, and im not sure if it differs from your term misothemia) Here is my worry, I fear that the professional will not know how to solve this and I will just run into a brick wall.\n\nAlso themic differs from kinesis because you are triggered by the sight of something and not just the sound. It developed when I was exposed to the trigger source far longer than I should have been. Most therapists do not have experience with misophonia specifically, but they do generally have experience with anxiety, panic disorders, OCD, sensory processing disorders, etc. which in many ways are similar misophonia. So I think that someone will be able to help you. \n\nAlso for me personally, thinking about \"solving\" my misophonia was never helpful and only made me feel worse. I wanted it to go away and that made me feel worse when I could not control it. Now instead I have accepted that it is a part of me, and that makes it easier for me to manage the things that make my misophonia worse - like I used to forget to eat, and then being really hungry made trigger sounds unbearable. Now I make sure that I eat any time I get hungry and that is made things easier.\n\nA therapist will not be able to get rid of your misophonia, but they will be able to help you manage it by preparing for trigger sounds, practicing mindfulness, and overall helping build your confidence in your day to day life. I recommend finding a therapist who specializes in CBT (a type of therapy originally developed for people with borderline personality disorder, who often have low self-esteem, see things very negatively, and have emotional outbursts). I found that very helpful personally.", "Dad tortures me for fun, amongst other disability related issues. Advice/help desperately needed. This was a long rant, so I copy/pasted that to my notes app and instead am doing a tldr. Any more info needed to help me better, just comment or dm, I will be checking over the course of the next few days.\n\nThe TLDR is: My extremely Narcissistic and Angry manipulative father looks my in the eyes when he smacks his mouth and triggers my misophonia, does it literally whenever he knows I am going to be around, and gets angry when I say or do literally anything to question it, avoid it, or beg for it to stop, including but not limited to extreme fits of rage that leave me, in a crumpled up pile of tears, fear, and misery on the floor. He clearly has fun doing it and does everything in his power to make me suffer. My mother enables him, and I have almost no hope of moving out within the next year shy of winning the freaking lottery. I got yelled at by my mother for cooking with soundproof earbuds in. I could not explain why I had them in because my father was near, and he was why, and questioning his divine right to torture me is heresy.\n\nI am somewhat suicidal, and this inescapable nightmare does not help. I am so sorry about your parents and situation. Do you have anyone or places you can escape to for large pockets of time to get away? Do you have school or a job to go to that you can stay at for a while? Finally, and I know this can be insanely hard, but your dad is doing this to get a reaction out of you. \n\nI know that this is nearly impossible and not incredibly helpful, but perhaps you should just try to act overtly sweet and nice. Maybe if he stops getting a reaction he will be less likely to do it so frequently. Your situation really sucks and sounds highly abusive. You need to get out asap.  I feel bad for you, can you discreetly leave a message for them in a way that tells them about this condition or find a professional to talk to about it \nAbout the last part, remember death is a permanent solution for a temporary problem. My parents have known about misophonia for almost a decade. I cannot afford it. Rent is 1400 minimum in my area now and waiting lists are over a year long.  And I live in a rural area, so this is kind of insane. I cannot escape, because rent is too expensive and wait lists are too long. Can you maybe explain to them the suercidal thoughts? might bring it to light that they are doing the wrong thing I hear ya\n\nCost of living can be way cheaper in some places like eastern NY if you can save enough money to move out. Somewhere like that it would help you so much. I understand the difficulty in committing to such a thing.\n\nTry to keep it in mind at least. There is a path forward, a way to escape the abuse. Good luck :( Are you under the age of 18? (You do not have to reveal your exact age here). I am wondering if you can contact CPS or the authorities for child abuse. It might be extreme, but this IS abuse. No child should be mentally tortured by their parents. It is disgusting. If you want to consider this, use it as a last resort, try some of the other things first, like acting calm and giving them no reaction. Easier said than done though.. I am 24. In the long rant I previously was going to post I detailed why it is almost literally impossible to move out or really do anything. Any time I bring it up they just get angry and guilt trip me. \"THAT IS JUST GREAT, OP.

I have also thought about moving to New York lately, though Milwaukee WI has a pair of internet friends who may be able to help me I cannot believe anyone\u2019s father would do that to them. I am so sorry. Based on your info you have given to other commenters, your parents sound like narcissistic a-holes. They have deep rooted insecurities and project them on you (guilt tripping, etc.) Not that knowing that really helps. If you cannot move out, maybe just stay out of the house as much as possible. Only return to sleep. If they question it say \u201cI am an adult I can do what I want\u201d. They have ZERO control over your life. Do what you can to make them realize that. \n\nYou do not have to do exactly that but something along those lines if you can. I have an online friend who manages to move away from her own guilt tripping parents to another state. She had a bf to move in with though. Not the time, bot. Not the time. Maybe I will work on my abs so I can get a long distance gf to move in with \ud83d\ude05 My mom says she yelled at him last night and he said it was an accident/I forgot/I did not even know I did it\n\nI am just glad he did not try coming in my room to confront me/fake apologize First off, I am really sorry you have to deal with this. I do not know what other disability or -related issues you are discussing, but regardless, these people are bad people and bad parents. You are not doing and have not done anything wrong.\n\nThat said, if you are having suicidal thoughts, please get some help. I gather you are in the US, so you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or ( for online chats. You could also try the ( at 1-800-799-7233, or do an online chat at their site.\n\nYour parents do not have a right to treat you poorly, even if they think they do. However, I realize that for better or worse, this makes it harder on you to advocate for yourself. If you search \"how to deal with a narcissist\", you will find many results, and I hope some of them help. \n\nI am no expert, but I think you need to draw some boundaries. If there is a meal, you should wait until they are done, or eat in another room (if possible), or perhaps use headphones with some sound to drown out the sounds. My daughter listens to brown noise during meals; she says it drowns the sounds out better than white noise, plus we can have a conversation even while she wears them. \n\nIt also sounds to me like you should not engage them in arguments or discussions, because I am betting there is simply no way you can win, no matter how many facts you have at your disposal.\n\nI really, really hope you call one of the hotlines. Also, if you have some friends, call them. Just start with one person, explain the situation, and ask if they can put you up for a night or two. Then go from there. As I tell my daughter -- one thing at a time. \n\nGood luck. I usually do not have to eat with them anymore, as I am 24 and hide in my room as much as possible, but every now and then there is a birthday or 'special occasion' where I do not get a choice. Those times are miserable. Other disabilities are adhd and Aspergers, which my parents promised me they would not treat me different over, but for some reason they allowed my younger brother and sister to practice driving for their licenses, but me? I had to wait until my best friends 4 years in the Navy were done so he and his wife could come home and practice with me. My mom keeps lying about why she would not drive with me, saying \"Your sister needed it more than you\" (a lie, her boyfriend she lives with drives her around) and \"I have too much anxiety\" (but not with my sister)\n\nMy parents view me as stupid and incapable and nothing I do convinces them otherwise, so any problem i have is immediately dismissed as a personal attack and a childish tantrum. When my mom found out that slurping triggers me, she literally made soup for a week straight and made sure to slurp obnoxiously. I was not allowed to leave the table until everyone else was finished. If you have any friends you can think of that could accommodate you, consider that as well. Say that you will help pay their rent or clean their home or something to compensate. There is options out there but none are easy\u2026 WI also has some pretty good cost of living! Looks like that is a good idea to explore first. This is something I have been thinking about, I am just not sure I have many options. I have one friend I *MIGHT* be able to move in with nearby, and things would probably be pretty chill. I am just not sure I want to A) live with a friend since that is a whole different thing and B) I am not sure I want to live so close to my parents house. The only time I managed to live on my own, it was a small cabin just 2 minutes down the road, and not only did that end with my landlord extorting me do hard I had to move back in, but for the 4-ish months I was living there, my mom would stop by almost daily to accuse me of being incapable of supporting myself because I had dishes in the sink for longer than a day, or some other bs. If you did end up moving out, no matter where you go you do not *have* to tell them where you are going. If they are so bad they are making you depressed and suicidal, I honestly think you do not owe them a damn thing. Not even information. Yes living with a friend can have its own challenges, but you would need to be up front about your issues, why you are moving, and hope for the best. It is just not possible to hide everything from them and completely cut them out of my life right now. Are you old enough where you could get a PT job?  Maybe you could work after school and get away from him? I am 24. A possible miracle occurred just yesterday and today, but the problem was that my *full time* job both did not pay me enough to  move out, and that job was full of misery of its own. I honestly feel so bad for u. I have misophonia, related to loud laughter/screaming etc I hate it. I am overall a very happy person with strong mental health, but the triggers make me so angry. Everyday I have to put up with it at school, and try to keep my emotions in. I have lost the plot a few times before, but I realise this only makes the situation worse and scares others as they do not understand it. \n\nFrom my experience, I totally understand how you feel, and the fact that your own parents torture you with it to the point of mental breakdown is honestly heartbreaking to read. I honestly never think your father will understand you, but what I will recommend you do is have a long conversation with your mother about it, so at least she may understand that you cannot help it. I also recommend you talking to someone that you trust, maybe your best mate, teachers, just so you do not feel so alone. If you really have not got anyone to turn to, then please reach out to me, or other people on the subreddit. Im sure they will be very happy to help u. \n\nIdk how old you are, but I recommend you go and ask a doctor to find you a psychologist, that can teach you coping mechanisms for it.\n\nIf you really feel suicidal, just call a samaritan, visit the suicide hotline website or call 1-800-273-8255. I personally think you should never consider suicide. Your situation will change at some point, soon you will be out of your parents way, maybe in college or uni etc. It will not be the same for ever. Stay strong!!!", "Struggling on Discord Since my post got deleted on r/misophonia and all I received was a rather rude reply as to why, I have come here for help.\nDoes anyone have any advice? I use discord quite a lot when playing games with friends, however the breathing into the mic is reducing me to panic and tears, and now physical pain. My boyfriend has brought this issue up to the people we play with, but the issue seems to go unnoticed (i suppose most people do not notice when they are breathing particularly loudly) but it is made me decide to not be on call anymore. I cannot do it, it is too much for me, I put up with it for as long as I could but tonight made me snap and I sat in tears after the call. I have tried muting the people but then there is no point being in the call with them. maybe you could ask them to use discord\u2019s native voice suppression feature? it is not perfect but it is better than nothing Thank you! I think maybe doing that and perhaps asking them to move their mic away slightly will help, it is unfortunate because I do not want to make anyone feel guilty  i THINK nvidia broadcast has a feature that allows you to reduce noise to your headphones/speakers! I will take a proper look tomorrow for you if you cannot get it working :) let me know how it goes! thank you!! Did it work? :) sorry i have only just seen your reply! unfortunately it did not ):", "I am sad that misophonia has to ruin everything I am at a hotel with my best friend because we wanted to have fun and do something together but she is just. constantly eating. Eating is my biggest trigger. And she talks while she eats so I cannot even plug my ears. I am sad that misophonia has to take everything away. I am so sick of the intense panic and anger I feel when I hear my triggers. So sick of it. I do not even know how to explain how much pain it puts me in but it is worse than any physical pain I have ever felt. My mom claims that she had bad misophonia as a kid and she \u201clearned to control\u201d her responses so she thinks I should be able to as well. I cant. It is infuriating she is your best friend. explain to her your situation and a good friend will respect it regardless of whether or not they understand it. see if you can pick up a pair of portable headphones that you can blast music into whenever she is eating yeah i just slap mine (not hard) cause we do not see each other often so she forgets and then just like that she remembers people do not understand that misophonia cannot just \"be controlled.\" obviously that would be so much better than what we go through now. Sorry your mom does not understand. My brother loves to make fun of me for it thank you for understanding. sorry about your brother, that sucks. I totally understand and I am sorry you are going through it. Have you heard of dBud earplugs? They can be used so you can still hear people talking, but smaller sounds like eating sounds are muffled out and quieter. Girl I feel your pain. This is why I have resulted to online friends only and it sucks. I have not heard of them but I will look into it, thank you! I am sorry :( Thank you, I am sorry you have to deal with it as well.", "Do I have misophonia I have had a very severe sensitivity to a pencil writing on paper and when someone does it near me I get goosebumps, basically nails on a chalkboard. And I write with gel pen because it makes no noise, teachers hate me for it and I googled why this happened to me and I got a result saying it is misophonia. If it is, how do I work around it? Some people use head phones or earplugs (I suggest earplugs if your doing a test), breathing techiniques can help but mainly earplugs or headphones If you have more sound triggers I would say that is misophonia, if you have other sensory issues maybe spd? If that is the only problem, maybe a fear? I had an old friend that was the same way. Also a bit weird that you have physical symptoms (the goosebumps). Usually misophonia is multiple triggers but the coping mechanisms still work, though there is no real solution. Maybe erasable pens? Hope this helps. Good luck :)\n\nEdit: check out saccular acoustic sensitivity I do not even have to hear the sound to get goosebumps. It can be in a photo or video, or if I see someone else writing with pencil, it is also just paper as a whole. I hold it by the very most corner to try and cope Maybe preliminary misophonia? If it turns into more triggers for sure but watch it so it does not get worse. The way misophonia usually works is that it worsens over time and you get more triggers so just practice controlling your reactions and coping to triggers I would say", "Tv show ( Sex education) I was so shocked to hear Ruby tell Otis she has misophonia?! And then the other guy explained it as the phobia of sound and told Otis to stop eating.LIKE WHAT. Totally caught me off guard Phobia of sound..? Right?! So awesome to have it acknowledged on a public platform. I am glad it was brought to light but I thought it was portrayed really badly\u2026 Yes I do agree, glad it is being acknowledged but they clearly had done about 10 minutes of research and were like yeah let us add that in. Exactly!! She is just portrayed as a bitchy character and it kind of just seems placed in there to make her even more bitchy\n\nWhich I understand that my misophonia makes me bitchy sometimes lol but they definitely could have done a wayyyy better job of throwing that in there", "Is it too severe? I have bad misophonia. Too many sounds annoy me, and it is literally impossible to escape from them.\n\nI have noise cancelling headphones, and I promise you; they are incredibly useful.\n\nI am not sure how true this is, but I have read those with misophonia generally have good hearing. I will be honest, my hearing is decent.\n\nDoes it make sense my misophonia is so bad I am able to hear trigger sounds even when I am wearing my beadphones ?\n\nMy headphones are probably the best thing I have ever gotten, but I am not sure if it is my misophonia or just the person making the trigger sound being incredibly loud.\n\nWho clicks their computer so loudly to the point I can faintly hear it?\n\nI really do not know if it is my headphones (I doubt it), my misophonia (of course it is to an extent, but I mean as a whole), or simply the person making the noise.\n\nBecause on some computers, you can adjust it to where you just have to lightly tap the trackpad and you can still select and move things around... I understand this so much.  I know so many people who could just tap but no, they must click the mouse button which makes such a loud noise.\n\nAnd headphones do not mask the noise, they really do not. I do not by any means have exceptional hearing, but I can hear triggers very clearly with my noise-cancelling headphones on.\n\nYou are not alone \u2665 Do you know the other person is using the computer? If so, I tend to hear the echo of the sound even though I have not heard the sound itself. Idk could be just me And if someone is using a mouse are not there like silent mice you can buy? Even if they are expensive, I have never checked the price lol cause I do not use a mouse.\n\nAlso thank you so much. \ud83d\udc95 Misophonia triggers do this really cool thing where they burn into your brain like a branding iron and play for hours after the initial sound is gone. It could be your brain filling the silence in the most annoying way possible. I get what you mean. I actually have instances where I hear a sound when it is not there due to lingering anxiety from it . Oh boy we just fucking LOVE triggers do not we haha... haha ): .....\n\nAlso yeah, probably. Can I ask a question? \n\nNoise cancelling headphones, do they also cancel noise when you are not listening to music or a podcast.\n\nIs it like wearing ear plugs? Yes, they do. You do not have to be listening to music for them to work. Thank you! I am definitely getting some.\n\nWhich ones did you get? They are of the Sony brand, and they are the WH-1000XM3. I doubt all noise cancelling headphones cancel sound completely, but because these are like earplugs, even better actually, they muffle the sound to a great extent. Thank you! I am going to ask for them for my birthday. No problem! I hope you get some, they will be a huge help. In answer to your question, yes I can hear noises while I am listening to music or even just wearing earplugs I can hear triggers sometimes and i have to check if it is really happening or I am imagining it.\n\nUsually I am imagining it, so weird! An old fan I used to have made me think I was hearing heavy breathing and ohgod.\n\nI really hate when people tell me to listen to music because my misophonia is so bad that it never works anymore. My trigger actually is music, bass music coming from my neighbours so, If I listen to music myself I trigger myself lol.\n\nWhy is this happening to us?! Oh my, music is your trigger?? That Is horrible!\n\nI think the many many triggers I have are bad but I could not imagine having music as a trigger...\n\nMisophonia is a piece of shit... More so if it is a neighbour playing it far too loud and I can hear it in my house, or if the bass makes my house shake.\n\nI freak out! They should not be playing it loud anyway. Man, and if it makes your house shake you must be miserable. I am, I had to go and get anti depressants :(\n\nWe are moving but it will be at least another year. Oh god, that makes me feel really sad...\n\nAt least there is hope for the future, but I hope the new place is far better and I want things to get better for you as well ! It will get better for us BOTH! \nLet us be positive :) Yeah..! :) I have the same issue. I can hear triggers through headphones or even hear/see triggers at times when there are none. I have auditory hallucinations a lot and it is so terrible &amp; annoying :/ Well shit, that just makes it ten times worse. I feel bad for you, man. ):", "i could really use some positive misophonia stories right now  My wife is wonderful about understanding my triggers, and accepting my solutions to them. She does not mind that music is played at every meal, and understands that I go crazy if she snores, so she does not judge me if I need to sleep in another room. When I visit family my sisters act like I am crazy, which only sets me off more, but my parents are totally cool about it and understanding (even if they make the worst sounds while they eat). It is so nice to find people that either understand as facilitate me, or at least the very least do not mind the solutions that I come up with to solve the issue. There are definitely people out there who do not take it personally and instead just adjust. They are amazing and we live for them &lt;3 My family did not really understand it in the beginning, I think it started when I was 8 or 9 (when I started noticing it) I am about 19 now. My first step was to do research myself and find out what it actually is. After that I informed my family when they did make sounds that bothered me. They did not really get it at first, and my mom would come even closer to make noise directly into my ear (this was hell). But in the recent years (the last 2/3 after I lost my brother) I have been home with my family a lot more, my dad started working from home as well and they have been much more respectful about it. I think it starts slow, it started with my sister and cousin who took it very seriously and if they realized they were making a noise that triggered me they would say sorry, and that they did not realize they were doing it (which helped me a lot control my anger/panic).\n\nThen my dad became very understanding and usually he is completely oblivious that he is making a noise that bugs me but he is still nice about letting me wear headphones during our family dinners or letting me eat in my room if I need to. My mom does this too, she often apologizes when she notices she is eating around me and sees me tense up a bit. \n\nThere is still fights/rough patches here and there. Sometimes I try to hold it in and bare through it, and then end up going into full panic mode, especially in cars during trips. It will always be something that keeps me from doing regular things like dinner with family or having to step out when my family is hanging out together like watching a movie and eating snacks but it is much much better than it used to be.", "Ways to reduce lisp in music? I love listening to music throughout the day.  I also go to sleep with music in the background as it helps me.\n\nBut there are certain periods in which I am more sensitive, and things will bother me more than usual.\n\nI can notice even the slightest lisp in music, movies, online videos etc. Sometimes in songs which did not bother me before!\n\nAnd when that happens, I cannot continue listening to the songs... I keep skipping songs and all of my energy goes to that instead of whatever I want to actually do...\n\nI wonder if anyone knows of some way to reduce or somehow control this type of thing?

It would help me out a lot.  I understand what you are saying! I know it is hard to express certain emotions and thoughts at times. I feel that sometimes some disorders cause others, you know. For example, OCD can result in depression and anxiety, etc. You opened my eyes to the idea that the feelings of OCD and are similar to the feelings of misophonia, so thank you! Additionally, I am so sorry you have to live in a constants state of anxiety. I know that is no fun, but I applaud you for being so strong and facing it everyday! That is truly amazing. I appreciate your kind words. I hope this research leads to even more! There is so much left to be discovered. :) Thank you for saying that, I love to help so anything you may have questions about, feel free to ask. I am not someone who gets upset about talking about my issues because I feel like that is the answer to solving them. What you are saying makes a lot of sense and also makes me confused about my situation. My OCD makes me feel like instantly I am panicking so it feels so much like the instant panic and anger from Misophonia.. maybe that is because mine has to do so much with my body and feeling \"even\". I only notice OCD situation happening when it is upon me &amp; I realise I have been doing/using something on one side of my body like shaking a leg or hand or running to the right on a video game (makes me fail all the time lol). On the worse side of things if I bump into something or step on something sharp on one side I have to do it to the other and the panic and frustration I feel because I can NEVER get the feeling exactly the same is so similar like the feels I get from Misophonia. I wonder if my brain just goes to 100 for everything or if OCD is just so vast that I cannot understand it. I really like the word glibly, thanks for adding that to my vocabulary and I am sorry for tangents.

My mom is constantly insisting that I am making it hard to live with especially because my brother has severe Autism and should tiptoe around him. While I do not get even the slightest amount of respect thrown my way. My miso has gotten to the point of tic fits, hitting my ears, and crying full fucking buckets whenever someone chews. I have other triggers that I can semi-drown out with music (Ironic that one of my triggers is guitar and I am a big metalhead) She alternates between caring about it enough to discuss coping mechanisms (only happened twice) and full fucking chastising me, putting me down, treating me like a mental case, and denying my suffering. She is going on and on about how hard it is to take care of an Autistic child and apparently, constant paranoia and anxiety of whether or not someone will crack open the pantry or refrigerator or play guitar, or if my sibling will go onto his annoying fucking tracing app that goes on full blast is not suffering, it is me being a \"melodramatic, bossy, insufferable piece of shit\". She is told me that I will become a reclusive shut-in if I somehow do not \"get cured\". She is like an anti-gay parent that wants to convert their child. It is fucked up. She has actively put me down and chastised me for being this way. To the point to where I feel like a shitty person 24/7. She is been at family gatherings and whenever I walk into a room, she has said, on multiple occasions \"oh, xxxprintmaster42069's here, I would better starve so he does not scream at me to stop eating\" Truly disgusting. She is also punishing me for having mental breakdowns due to miso. She takes away my computer every time my Misophonia gets out of control, and I scream out in agony. She thinks my safe space (my computer) and my miso are connected and whole heartedly believes that I will be better if I do not have it for a week. FYI, each time she takes away my computer, it is pure hell. I am Ashiest and if hell exists, this is it for me. Just the constant chewing, my little brother playing guitar, the other one eating while on his app, it is impossible to describe how horrible it is. I must have a mild concussion from banging my head against the walls because I would rather be dead, deaf, or \"normal\".  I truly feel bad for my brother and his mental disorder cocktail he has going on (Autism, ADHD, OCD, and Bipolar Disorder), but it is hard to feel that way when he has his mouth like that goatse picture with those horrible sounds, I hate it.\n\nI do not have a problem with my little, \"normal\" brother eating because my father has trained some decent manners into his mind. Also, my father is the only other person in my family that I can tolerate. Because unlike my mother and Autistic brother, he has decent manners, he treats my conditions with respect, and is a pretty upstanding guy that does not belittle me every second of every day. I have been taking up cooking from him and have found a side interest to mechanical projects and woodworking.\n\nEven though my mother wholeheartedly believes in Autism, she has yet to read anything pertaining to my conditions and show a shred of decency towards me. I have 3/5 people in my immediate circle that I respect, me included. My dad and my brothers are the best and I would do anything for them. My mom is the absolute worst and I cannot wait to move away from her bullshit, and I have had severe depression that stemmed from her belittling me and the misophonia. I have lost faith in my mother because she feels like my misophonia and my laptop are connected and she takes it away whenever I have an extreme mental breakdown (which is a lot). She is been brainwashed by Facebook and truly believes it with every fiber of her being. I have long since stopped using her for emotional support when it comes to miso, but she is great when it comes to bullying. I am a prime target at school because I am quiet, put earplugs in every time I see gum, listen to music whenever I get the chance, and have a \"fucking idiot retard brother who I need to take after and shut the fuck up\" that one quote messed me up for months and still rings in my head all these years later. So, not only do I have my abusive mother to balme for my depression, paranoia, and anxiety, I also have resident bullies. before you say in the comments, I am financially reliant on my parents, 15, and have no escape places like a nearby park, or a friend's house. I am in hell and Cannot wait to get out as soon as I get accepted into college, and I will not let my mother walk me into the gate. dude\u2026 i am so sorry. facebook is a fucking brainwashing machine. your mother sounds like the worst person alive, and i cannot even imagine how horrible that situation is. i really hope she does not get to see your face ever after you are 18. good luck out there I am so sorry that you are going through this. I really hope you find a way to get through the time you still have to live around your mom. Try to focus in the good parts. Try to spend some more time with your dad who seems like a cool dad and your brothers that you enjoy doing things with. Misophonia is so hard and complicated and it is very sad when your family is not supportive and understanding but you will not have to live there forever. Stay strong!!! You got this! Take care of yourself. I have wondered for a long time if there is a connection between autism and misophonia, extreme sensitivity to various sensory input is a symptom of both, right? I still think I am on the spectrum somewhere, but doubt I will ever get a diagnosis. I suspect the same might be true for you. Maybe if you had autism to blame for the misophonia, your mother would understand \ud83d\ude44 I will make sure she does not yes! i struggled with misophonia so i went to a psychiatrist, and got an asperger\u2019s diagnosis. There are plenty of other symptoms of autism alongside misophonia, maybe you have had them during your childhood and did not notice, like hating strangers tapping your head, being selective with food, not wearing tight shoes or shoes with a bump inside, hating sticky things, even tourettes like tics (less severe than tourettes), or at least these are some of my signs. Sounds like you want to be special like you are autistic brother therefore your condition get worse. It is not that you make it on purpose, it is your your subconscious. Btw autism is kind of hereditary, or at least some of its symptoms... You might have some if you get that crazy over nothing I might, but she would not care. He is the golden child and I am a neglected scapegoat. Even if I did, I do not think she would care. I have always been blamed for everything for as long as my brothers were born. Hell, since my brother's diagnoses, my mother put all of her love and care into him. My brother and I are damn near neglected, and I am a scapegoat so that makes things worse. I hear you. I had a vaguely relatable issue with a severely mentally ill sibling taking most of our mother's energy and patience when I lived at home. You are in a really shit situation, I wish I could help somehow. I wonder if there are any community groups where you live, where they might set you up with some kind of mentor/understanding adult who at least might be able to give you a shoulder to lean on sometimes or a safe space to retreat to when you need it. Even church groups like youth groups might be good to reach out to... I am not religious, but they can be helpful people, in some contexts... I dunno, I am thinking out loud a little bit here.", "Learn About Misophonia ", "Chewing in the Work Place I work at a newspaper, and my editor, who sits behind me, is the loudest chewer I have ever heard, and chewing is a huge trigger for me. When he is chewing I become incredibly frustrated and have trouble focusing on the conversation at hand. He even drinks loudly. Once when I was speaking to my other editor, I could not help my reflex of turning to look at the guy chewing. They noticed and asked what I was reacting to, and my non-chewer editor asked if it was his chewing. I said yes, and tried to explain that I am very observant/sensitive to chewing sounds and she told me she had never heard someone say that before, and called me \"crazy.\" The chewing editor did nothing to change how he chews. I do not know what my next step should be. I feel like if I go to our supervisor she will embarrass me and make fun of me for being difficult (we have a blunt sense of humor in the office,) or if she takes it seriously the chewing editor is someone who already has trouble with people who view things differently than him, and with change, and I do not think he would understand. I do put in headphones when he chews but it is not always an option, plus my headphones are uncomfortable and I am having a lot of trouble choosing new ones. Any advice for addressing workplace chewing? Not eating at our desks is not an option. I feel so alone during these moments, especially knowing that they do not understand.\n\nI am in an entry-level position and just joined this company a little over a month ago. Some years ago I experienced the same. I was in office with my superior (only me and him), and he used to have a chewing-gum, and it deconcentrated me a lot.\n\nI politely explained him about my misophonia and he had been comprehensive, and ceased it (at least, he quit chewing with open mouth, that was good for me).\n\nI know I was lucky to have a superior like him.

Someone recently moved into the apartment next to us and started blasting music an hour ago, at 4:30 a.m. It was pretty faint, but I immediately flew into a rage and started pounding my fist on the wall. They turned down the music to where I could not hear it right away, which is a good sign. I could also hear my them doing other shit afterwards, slamming God knows what around and as I type this some kind of noise like they are plugging and unplugging things from the wall, and I get infuriated at every little sound I hear. I am sure they are just doing standard move-in things (at least I hope that this will not be a permanent thing) and at an odd hour because they cannot sleep or something. But meanwhile, just outside, seagulls are screeching, trains are passing by below and shaking the whole apartment, and semi trucks are rattling by, just lots of sounds a lot louder or more distinct than what is going on next door, and I do not even give a second thought to them. It is because we know something can be done about those human noises. People have control over them. Even my dogs licking drives me insane, but I can get them to stop, so it makes sense that sound is a trigger as well.", "I have a strained relationship with my family And I blame it on misophonia. It was some years back that I could not stand my father's loud chewing and slurping. I tried to tell it to him, it only tensed the situation more. Neither of us was ready to accommodate. As a result, it has been almost five years I do not eat with my family. They ask it to me sometimes and say I should, but I do not understand how can they ignore and forget all the times I have told them about the problem with loud chewing. \n\nThis extends to loud footsteps, dragging of feet and what not. I have tried to talk to my mother, and it always ends in the tone where she tells me it is something normal and I should make peace with it instead of trying to change it. I feel like my problems are dismissed. She also says a problem is that I have an issue with more or less everything, which I do. But I do not know how to help it, and her saying such things does not help it either. \n\nShe time and again raises her concerns about why I do not spend a lot of time with them and why I stay isolated. This only pushes me further away. \n\nI feel aggressive, I feel like screeming it out, but I know no one's here to hear me. If you can, try to have your meals with your family. That is the best place for you to try to hear but ignore the triggers.\n\nDo not do it on the days that you are under pressure of any kind, but try it while you are feeling fine and not under pressure for anything. Sorry it sounds like you are struggling. Can you try to find ways to spend time with your family that does not involve food? Like watching movies together or something? That way you are not so isolated...maybe ask if they could do that with you? (I am a mom with a child who has misophonia and I worry about the isolation that is created for sure...and I probably say the wrong things also). I am going through the exact same thing. I eat dinner in my room and only use the TV after my mom and stepdad go to bed. While I have seen my mood get better since I have stopped eating with them, I can barely spend any time with them because I know they are a ticking time bomb for a trigger.\n\nI do not have too much advice, but you should know you are not alone with this. Perhaps you could try sending them information about misophonia, like over text or email? It may be easier to get your point across when they are not dismissing you as you speak. If they refuse to cooperate, do not feel bad about not being able to eat with them. You explained your boundaries, and you can stick with them. Your happiness and comfort goes above others I am older now, but younger me went through a lot of this. The first big change for us happened with me finding a name for what I had gone through my whole life- misophonia. And then a few articles were finally written about it and sharing those with my mother helped \"validate\" my issue. Unfortunately, this was long after my teen years where it was a major strain and hard to handle. I wanted to eat with my family but... it was a challenge. I often felt so guilty and horrible after finally leaving the table (aka once away from the triggers).   \n\n\nI recommend a few things, one is sharing articles about misophonia. Next, for me restaurants are much easier, I make sure the person who triggers me is not sitting right on either side of me- my right ear (something that took me a while to discover) is the one that hurts the most so I specifically make sure the person the triggers me is diagonally to my left. My mom has come to accept that at least and I can often give her a look, or ask my husband for help, to make this seating arrangement work.   \n\n\nThere are some sounds I have to deal with, but having found ways to cope with other sounds, it feels a little easier.   \n\n\nEspecially once realizing which ear it is that hurts more than the other. I am able to lean on that ear, cover it with my hair to make it work.   \n\n\nHighly recommend sending articles, and figuring out which side triggers you more! Good luck! Yes, I am not old enough to move out yet, and do not have much money. It would be rude of me to not join my family at the dinner table, and I feel obliged to whether they make me or not, because my family is so kind and accommodating. I have told my best friend and a parent who also has Misophonia on a much lower level. My best friend was just like \"oh...ok,\" and the conversation moved on. My parent tried to show support but mostly just said \"You got to deal with it\" which I know I do but this is the only place I think I can figure out how.", "I was thinking of of getting some of these loop ear plugs but I wanted to know if any of you have tried them and if they work for blocking out trigger noises ", "GRAMMARLY ADS CAN SUCK MY HUGE PP (trigger safe) i pressed mute aND IT DID NOT MUTE AND I TRIED TO PAUSE BUT IT DID NOT AND I HAD TO F_KING SIT THROUGH THAT WHILE SLAMMING MY LAPTOP I AM DONE. i HATE THIS. and it is a f_king BIRD'S EYE VIEW on that sh_t and it is SO LOUD FOR NO DAMN REASON. i am so exhausted, of everything, of these f_king grammarly ads. i do have adblock btw but it turned off for god knows what reason.

My grandfather had (still has) an illness that messes with his organs and makes him burp every fucking 3 minutes. I was just annoyed by the sound from thr start, but it got worse and worse to the point where I was banging my head because of the rage.\n\nI was 10 when I found out how there are other people that were like me. I had developed 3 more triggers (chewing a gum, my biggest trigger ever) (that dumb fucking noise of pen clicking) (slurping)\n\nI was so excited, I translated the whole wikipedia page to my parents, which caused them to break my tablet.\n\nLiterally.\n\nBecause oh mEnTaL dIsOrdEr ShItS are the play of the devil. And they did not want me to get influenced by the crazy people on the internet.\n\nI got beat up so fucking hard I never could stand up for myself about my own opinions anymore.\n\nNow these people are treating me so fucking hard you would not believe it. I am not studying? They chew a gum so that I cry my lungs out and be forced to study. I am not tidying up my room? They go through my all fucking triggers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hate them all.\n\nThe thing about my family is that they are all assholes. I live them but they are.

I tried blocking the sounds but they seem to enjoy me getting mad, and they do these even more on purpose. I have a family that wants me to support them but fails at protecting my sanity. I hate them all. I hope they go through an even worse thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 15 right now. I developed 6 different triggers. Would you believe me if I said I bit my hand so hard it bleeded to the point where I had to use a bandage because my mom was cutting her nails next door?\n\nI dont know what to do anymore.

That is terrible :( I am so sorry your family will not support you and worse purposely triggers you. I am so sorry this is happening to you, this is my absolute worst nightmare. Can you start a job (if you do not have one yet) and save up money to move out? Having a job and school will hopefully keep you out of the house for a while. Your parents sound abusive so I would be weary about your money - if you have a shared bank account try not to keep too much on there (they can potentially take it) and keep cash stored around your room. Try to make hobbies that include leaving the house (biking, going to the gym, studying at the library). It is horrible that this is happening to you, but you can make it out of this.\n\nFeel free to message me at any time if you need to talk &lt;3  I know exactly what you are going through.

Just because people like us have certain triggers it does not make us \u2018mad\u2019.\n\n I hope things get better for you and I hope that you can get through this. It will be just three years until you are eighteen and then you can move out.  You have not done anything wrong in this situation. Thank you! I cannot have a job because I need to be 18 in my country, but outdoor activities sounds fun. I will move out as soon as I can. What you said about cash is reasonable, also. Thank you, again! Thank you! I bought noise canceling headphones but they dont work. It is problably because of me though.\n\nThanks! I will move out as soon as I can. Man, if you say it like that there is not much left-I will be an adult. If they are actually beating you up for this, report them to the police so that they can get done for child abuse. If you are scared to do so just remember getting them found out is more important than supporting them. Do not be put under their thumb, you deserve way better than that.\n\nIf the authorities are actually not treating your situation seriously, record what they do to you so that the evidence can be shown to them and the correct charges are placed on them.\n\nDo as much as you can to get them found out and tried. If you cannot get a job can you still do community work for pocket money? Like mow the lawn for the elderly or disabled in your area or walk their dogs? I know exactly how you feel and I am sorry for all that you are going through. You have my utmost sympathy.\n\nFirst off, I want you to know that you are NOT crazy or a dumbass. What you are experiencing is a legitimate issue, even if those around you choose to be ignorant to it.\n\nI know this is not the best advice, but when I am feeling triggered, I try to distract myself by doing something that I enjoy - drawing, writing, listening to music, etc. Perhaps you can try to find something that you enjoy doing and focus on that.\n\nI am sorry that I do not have any other advice, but please know that, even it if does not seem like it, there are people who will support and sympathise with you. \n\nBest wishes and I truly hope that things get better for you.", "I need help, MISOPHONIACS ASSEMBLE  Sorry, your post/comment has been removed as your account is under 10 days old.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have lived at so many apartments! But I have never been able to accurately predict ones which will be quiet...\n\nIn addition to misophonia, I work 12 hr nights shifts and only sleep during the day, so it needs to be quiet during the day too. \ud83d\ude05\n\nAny tips? Like the material used or year built? First floor or second?\n\nMy only ideas so far:\n-no windows in the bedroom\n-few shared walls (corner unit?)\n-carpet instead of hard floors to muffle sound\n\nPlease give me any tips or wisdom or experiences concerning apartment hunting with misophonia! Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\n\nPS- my big triggers are bass noises and loud air conditioning units. Anything with low frequencies and vibrations. Get top floor if you can. If you live anywhere where there is a unit above you you will hear stomping from your upstairs neighbors all day. I hate the sound personally, and it makes a low frequency so I would assume you would also hate it. If you find a place you really like that is not a top floor unit, ask the landlord or realtor if they can go upstairs and stomp to test the soundproofing of the floors... I wish I had done this, because I expressed my concern about footsteps upstairs to the lady showing me the unit I wound up getting, and she insisted that the floors were made of solid concrete and were soundproof, which was a complete lie.\n\nDo not get a place right next to the highway or interstate. I made that mistake when looking for places near my university and now I am having to deal with people driving their cars with full bass playing at 3 AM. It may just be an issue with where I live, but still be cautious of this.\n\nOne potential problem you could encounter with your humming low frequency trigger is the sound of units next to you running washer and dryer units, in which case you might want to find an apartment complex that does not come with in-unit washers+dryers (preferably one with a laundry room on-site though, since it would be a hassle to drive all the way to a laundromat). \n\nArea rugs and carpets help absorb sound, so that could be an additional thing to support noise suppression, although it is not foolproof or extremely substantial.\n\nAnd overall you will need to remember that living in an apartment comes with a lot of unavoidable noise. It is very unfortunate, and I absolutely hate living in this apartment (and believe me I want to get my degree done ASAP so I can leave this hellhole), but there is a lot of sacrifice that comes with living in any kind of multi unit living space as opposed to a single family home... it sucks even more because renting a house is super expensive... But there is not much that can be done.\n\nHope some of this helped! Give up. Quiet apartments do not exist.\n\n&gt; I work 12 hr nights shifts and sleep during the day. So I need a place that is quiet during the day. I am a light sleeper and stressed about this.\n\nESPECIALLY if this is your situation. RIP you. Then should I try renting a house instead? Your comment is not very unhelpful. Get a house in the middle of nowhere FAR FAR away from any potential neighbors, custom built with STC 100+ if you can afford it. I definitely cannot.\n\nIf you do not have money, I do not have helpful advice. We are all doomed to be tortured by noises at EVERY place we live.\n\nI am not kidding when I say quiet apartments do not exist. They literally do not. So if you are hunting for a quiet apartment you have already lost. Considering that you are a light sleeper, you are probably noise sensitive, you have misophonia, and you have an unconventional schedule, I would try your ABSOLUTE best to rent something that is not an apartment. I know that is probably not what you want to hear, but apartments are misophonia hell. The extra commute to get something with a little more space is probably worth it for you. A single family home with a couple good roommates is preferable, because you can work out some agreements with roommates. Your next door neighbors have no obligation to work with you. In an apartment, quiet hours are the only protection you have (and sometimes even then, it is not great protection). When you are trying to sleep outside of these hours, people are allowed to (and will) play music, listen to TV, work out, close/slam doors, run the dishwasher, run around with kids, and you cannot really do anything about it. This is not a good setup for people like us who are bothered by this. You can block some of it out, but you can never block all of it out, no matter how well constructed the apartment is.\n\nI live in a very nice (expensive) top-floor corner apartment that is actually very quiet, but I still hear and feel almost everything my downstairs neighbors do because I am very sensitive. It is just not possible to exist within 10 feet of someone and not feel them at least occasionally.\n\nAll of that doom and gloom aside, if you do try an apartment:\n\n* ALWAYS. ALWAYS upstairs. Try to get a corner unit away from the road or parking lot.\n* Avoid apartment complexes with playgrounds. They attract families, and children are very loud. This is less worrying if you are renting a 1 bedroom and you are surrounded by other 1 bedrooms.\n* If you do not have a pet, look for complexes that do not allow pets. Dogs tend to bark when they are left alone during the workday.\n* Look for well insolated doors and windows.\n* Pay a lot of attention to where the bedroom is. Is it at all connected to someone is living room?\n* More space is better. That way if it is loud, you can move to a different area of the apartment. You might want to set up multiple places that can serve as a \"bedroom\". THANK YOU, I appreciate your advice!! Most definitely get one on the top floor, and it is on the very end of the building. I know most apartment are designed and built differently, but this is how mine is. The apartment complex is not all connected. The buildings are designed with two breeze ways,then there is space in between the next apartment building ( I hope that made sense). The sides of the building are made of brick,so that is a plus for blocking out noise. \n\nit is been going really well so far. I struggle with the same noise triggers too. I refused for the longest time to ever live in an apartment, but I had no other choice. Just make sure you look into some nice noise cancelling headphones. I would not recommend hard floor plan either cause noise is going to be bouncing of the wall as and the floor. \n\nAlso, mine is located in a quiet place. Not too far from the city, but far enough so that it is still quiet. I spent months just reading reviews for apartment to really see what people said about noise. I just used google mostly and some apartment websites to find the reviews. \n\nLastly, do not be afraid to ask the owner or whoever is showing you the apartment,\u201dis it noisy here? Cause I have very sensitive ears so I really need an honest answer.\u201d This actually helped out a lot when I asked cause the person really thought of the most quiet block they have. Not all people are that nice so I got lucky, but it really proved to me that the office people cared about their residents as well. \n\nI hope this helps you out! Good luck with finding your new home! ^can second this. Quiet apartments DO NOT exist.", "what if i never stop getting new triggers when i first realised i had misophonia, i only had one trigger. it is been over a year and now i have got at least over 10. i always get scared when a new one starts to pop up because i know that it will become a trigger but i cant do anything about it. what if i never stop getting new triggers and every noise bothers me? it is kind of scary because i can tell if something is going to become a trigger but i cant do anything about it. In this case, I have discovered that the power of the mind over this curse is pretty strong. I have been meditating, watching inflammatory foods (which I think greatly contribute to misophonia), and also actively relaxing my body when I hear one of my triggers. It is gotten some better over time. I do not expect it will ever go away, but I have decided I am not letting this thing jerk me around all the time and I fight it. Of course, I still use my earplugs and headphones from time to time. But like with any affliction of the mind, not letting it have the final say over your happiness is key! my best advice is if you can, as soon as you are brain starts the process of \"dont like this sound, it is repetitive i think it is going to become a trigger soon\" avoid that sound for a while, and distract yourself as soon as possible,,,, for a couple days to a week\n\ni find that it prevents most new triggers as I do not give my misophonia the chance build that thought pattern with that sound,, and especially use a distraction\n\nwhen your triggers become full fledged, it is hard to distract from them, but if they are mild you can semi train your brain back into \"that sound is not a threat\" thank you! i will try relax myself when i next hear a trigger, ty for the advice :) the thing is, most of my triggers start with noises that are made by my family/people around me. if there is any noises that i make that bother me, i will try to avoid making them. thank you! :) for sure it is easier said than done!! some triggers cannot be avoided if theyre constant with your environment, but some triggers can definitely be retrained if they are new! I think trying to avoid triggers is like trying to not think of a pink elephant.

Or I have difficulties using some books at school because of what the papers are made of, ect\u2026\n\nIt is so weird, like all of a sudden I cannot handle anything anymore.

To the point where if my hands get wet, I have to immediately slather tons of lotion on them because just the act of them getting wet and then dry makes them too dry. If that makes sense. It is absolutely unbearable and affects my life more than I would like to admit. In desperate moments I have actually rubbed chapstick on them. Yes!

Description in comments.  I live at home with my very loud family (not blaming them at all, just suffering)\n\nMy bedroom is the loft there is a staircase that leads up to my room and I have a thin curtain up from elementary school at the top. There is no door and the wall is a half-wall as shown in picture. I am across from the main bathroom, next to/above the laundry room, and my staircase is directly next to the wooden stairs that lead to the main floor. My stairs are carpet as is my room.\n\nI can hear everything in my room.\nFrom someone doing the dishes in the kitchen to the front door opening to someone walking up the basement stairs to someone breathing in the upstairs hallway.\n\nAlso, my brother has autism and he gets in extremely loud arguments with my parents and he stomps a lot. \n\nI have loop earplugs and they are wonderful but i have very small ears so they hurt even with the smallest size\n\nAny advice for semi-soundproofing my room? Maybe a thicker curtain that reaches down the the floor? I am really sorry you have to go through this A blackout curtain maybe? They usually have an extra layer, you can find them relatively cheap on amazon.  Also, egg crate sound proofing foam will help soak up the sound, it is used in music studios, and restaurants, its on amazon too, and you could possibly get some relief from strategically placed foam. I am not one of those experts in sound mitigation, but here are my thoughts. \n\nIn lieu of a door, the curtain and loft situation is likely your biggest issue - you probably know that. I think you realistically only have a few ways of approaching this.\n\nFirst, I would consider a heavier curtain. Something that is more flush to the roof and made of denser material. This can muffle the sound slightly and absorb the echoing - if done well, I think this could solve the quieter noises like breathing, but it will not solve extremely loud breathers or other noises. If changing the curtain is not possible in your situation, you could still look at some free-standing room-dividers. They may not help that much unless they extend to the roof, but they can help to absorb some of the sound. A room-divider may work even better if you hang a dense blanket or carpet over it (I hang a carpet on my wall to absorb some of the neighbor sounds). If you find that sounds are entering your room from the floor - that is another area where a thick carpet or blanket can help. At the very least, it will dampen the vibrations. If you are able, you could also investigate hanging a decorative rug near or in the staircase; this could catch some of the noise coming from down the stairs. Instead of rugs, you can also look at sound proof foam panels like ( (I just looked it up, I know nothing of that brand, best do your research if you go down this route). These foam panels could be put in the staircase or your room. These can absorb and prevent sound from bouncing up into your room from downstairs. \n\nSecond, investing in some comfortable headphones is a great alternative IMO. Finding something that is within your budget and comfortable is tricky, but well worth the effort. Personally I make due with Bose QC 35 II's. They are by no means cheap headphones, but the noise cancelling + comfort + outstanding battery life make them perfect for me. I would not hesitate to say they are a mandatory component of my everyday routine. These are over-the-ear headphones so I wear them literally all day almost every day. I recently replaced the headphone cups and they are like brand new after having them for 2 years. Eventually the cups wear down and do not provide such a good seal, but you can replace them for like 20 dollars on amazon. They are expensive, but they will last a very long time. Taotronics also has some great and inexpensive alternatives that you could look into. I have made a comment about headphones and earbuds before - you can see it ( if you are interested in more leads.\n\nThird, open air white noise or fans have helped some people. Maybe it is the distraction, maybe the sound can overwhelm the trigger noises so that you cannot hear them. Either way, you could try to find a white noise generator or fan that does not trigger you, then have that running all the time. I find this helps with the quieter noises, and when used in conjunction with headphones it helps with the louder sounds too. In my place, the furnace fan is very loud and it helps keep me sane. These white noise generators can be very cheap or you can utilize some speakers you already have. I personally bought a white noise generator because the speaker is on top of the unit - this makes it easier to throw the sound up and all over the room. \n\nOf course, nothing is likely to be perfect, so if it were me I would try to hit it from multiple angles. Even headphones allow some sound to get through because louder sounds will enter through your skull. A combination of environmental sound proofing and some comfy headphones is likely going to work the best. \n\nHope that helps and good luck! Fans!  Yes fans!!!!!! It definitely helps!!!! You can focus on that sound instead of the awful ones!  Like a big box fan!! Thank you thank you thank you. Seriously thank you. I had a pair of sennheisers for about 7 years and I miss them dearly. My fianc\u00e9 has Bose buds and I am pretty sure the quiet comfort over the ears I def will need to try them out at home. I got airpods to replace my sennheisers when they reallly broke because for a good two weeks I decided *running was my passion*\n\n\nI digress. All of the ideas you listed are amazing and I am going to definitely get a new bulky curtain and look into the other options you put too! Seriously thank you. Me and my babe are hopefully moving out in 2023 or 2024 after he finishes his degree, so it is so hard to decide cost benefit when I will not be here much longer. Lowkey do you think bed comforters would do anything if I used them as curtains? Sure!  That would be a great idea! Just please be careful- with the additions many people have suggested- you are also very much increasing your danger in the event of a fire. I am not sure how noise cancelling headphones work- but if you DO decide to get them AND you have added all this very flammable material for soundproofing reasons- please make sure you have got ample smoke detectors and have a deaf smoke alarm installed with either a vibration device, flashing lights or both because I would very much worry in the event of a fire.", "HEKZYNWOSTWNSUZHSHKWVSUSHWJ IM GONAB CRY MY M IS OVNOXIOUSLY CHEWINGBSUNFLOWER SeEEDS LIKE NOT WVENE CHWEINT FH SHE IS MASSGAONG THEFOOD WOSJWKSUOWWBSJCGLSUX You know, at first I was confused and annoyed that I could barely read this.

It is because going to work involves a lot of mental effort to keep my misophonia and anxiety in balance. When I leave my apartment and get into an Uber, my brain starts into fight-or-flight mode. I am hypervigilant of when I will hear my next trigger. I am tensing my muscles unknowingly from the adrenaline being pumped out by my adrenal glands. My misophonia causes my body to feel it is in a constant state of danger because leaving my home equals entering a world of triggers that I cannot control. When I go to work I am hyper-aware and waiting for when my co-workers or customers make a trigger. I have to bear down on my body so I do not startle or jump and cause people to feel uncomfortable around me. The constant tension causes lots of headaches and shortness of breath. I am in a panic state for 9 hours a day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I come home, my nerves are shot. My body exhausted like it just came back from battle (from being in a permanent state of fight-or-flight). My brain is fried. All I want to do is binge eat junk food and go to bed. I want to forget about the stressful feelings I endured for the day. Going out or seeing family is the last thing I want to do. As a result I feel like I am not truly \"living\" my best life. I am not thriving. I feel unhealthy and stressed all of the time. My misophonia is in my mind every single minute as is the feeling of not being safe or comforted. My only escape is sleep, provided I do not have a dream about my triggers (which has happened before).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dream of a life where I do not have to face my worst fears everyday. There is no cure for misophonia. I am never going to get over the sounds that shake me. I long to either have a full-time work at home job or be a stay at home mother. I do not want to have to be away from home and deal with triggers all day. I just want to feel safe. I am so jealous of people who get to stay at home all day and do not have to feel the things I feel. I cannot say things like this to the people in my real life because I know they are not going to understand, and get pissed and offended at me. It is a constant battle to stay sane. Misophonia has caused me to want to end my life a couple of times, and I am so afraid of that getting worse as I get older. I feel so out of control in my life, like I have no control over what happens to me. It is the scariest feeling. I hang on to what makes me feel safe so hard , and a lot of it is bad for me/sinful. Binge eating, compulsive spending, masturbation, sexual fantasy, romantic fantasy, cussing, acting out--all of these things give me a feeling of control I rarely feel. For once *I* can make myself feel a certain way, for once *I* can forget about misophonia and the effects it has on my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I have figured it out. I am not addicted because I am a whore or bad person, I am addicted because it is the only thing that makes me feel in control. Misophonia is hard and people who do not have it have no idea what we go through.  The only thing we can do is avoid the sounds/sights that trigger us, but that just means isolating ourselves more and more from the world.\n\nIt is too bad humanity has not reached the stage where society can feel empathy for us instead of just scoffing at us and telling us to suck it up.

Thanks for sharing I get it when people touch their face (e.g. twirling their hair or chewing their nails). \n\nWtf is up with these random visual triggers... ugh Oh fuck I hate for some reason when people say \u201eOh my god, that is terrible.\u201c and shake their head.

It feels so good to not be the only one", "Had a terrible encounter with my art teacher I will try to keep this short, and in shortest possible words, today has been horrible.\n\n\nFor a bit of a background, my miso trigger is the sound of things on paper- markers, pastels, pencils, hands, anything really. Despite that, I have been doing art all my life, and I am now attending an art school. I got a bit used to pencils, mostly from the exposure, but it is still terrible, so I always block out the sound.\n\n\nToday, we got a new art teacher. He seemed alright when we were talking, a bit ignorant, but pretty educated. \n\nWe were supposed to draw a figure with charcoal- which involved a lot of smudging and other horrible noises- and as we had our things prepared, he told us that we \"cannot use our headphones\", because it would disrupt us. \n\nI walked up to him, told him I have misophina, I hate the sound of charcoal on paper, and to please let me put on my headphones or I will go crazy.\n\nHe told me no and to \"not listen to noises, just focus on art\".\n\nI honestly did not know what to say. Two of my friends vouched for me, told him I have been like that since our first year, but he still told me no.\n\nIt was a bit of a blur after that. People started drawing, I started crying. I was sitting on the floor for a long time, shaking. I managed to find my anxiety meds and swallowed them because I honestly felt terrible.\n\nThe teacher asked me if I am serious, and what is the disorder called, but I was honestly too busy trying to not run away or stab myself with the nearest pencil to get away from the sound.\n\nEventually, the teacher walked away (after just standing there and watching me for a bit, not saying anything, no apology or offer to have me keep my headphones on), I got up, put my headphones on anyway, and managed to draw something half passable. The teacher acted like nothing happened.\n\n\n\nI do not completely hate my new teacher, he was uneducated, a lot of people are, but I still felt horrible for a long time. I still do. \n\nI honestly want to get a doctor's note for my misophonia, but I do not think I can. This was just the first time I found out some people were not as, helpful, as others.\n\nAnd that is it. That is my day. If anyone is reading this, thank you. I hope you will have a lot of respectful people in your life. I am really sorry your teacher was not more understanding. Not to excuse him, but he may not have known what to do either, and obviously does not seem to understand the severity here. If he is never been faced with this before, he may just have taken what seemed to be the reasonable way out, to him. I am not trying to excuse him, but you do not seem to think he was malicious, just uneducated.\n\nI do not know about getting a doctor's note from misophonia, but -- I recently took my daughter, who is exhibiting signs of misophonia to an ENT, and they gave her a diagnosis of hyperacusis, which is similar. Perhaps you could see a doctor and get that diagnosis. I would think if you had a diagnosis like that, the teacher would have to accommodate you somehow.\n\nHere is a link to a site with info about hyperacusis: (\n\nAside from that, I think you should try to talk to your teacher outside of class. I am not sure if having a friend or parent available would help, but it might, as they could vouch for you. Outside of class, without the time pressure on either of you to teach or do assignments, it might be an easier conversation to have, and you would have more time to explain.\n\nWhat do you listen to? Music? Or a noise like white or brown? Perhaps you could use one of the color noises and let him hear it too, so that he realizes you are not listening to music or something else he might think is \"distracting.\" Would it help if you could go in the hallway and draw? I know that is not optimal, but it might be an interim solution and would get you away from the noise in class.\n\nIf the teacher does not help, I would try going to an advisor, or whoever is the next step up. I know it will be tiring, but work your way up the ladder, and do not skip the student health office if there is one, for a physician or a counselor. Someone there should help you, you just may have to press to find that person.\n\nGood luck Unfortunate that this teacher handled the situation so poorly. Do not give up, as this is not an unreasonable request for a disorder in a school setting. \n\nDepending where you are, you can get letters from misophonia providers to school to request accommodations. ( has some sample letters and links to websites where you can get connected to providers. \n\nYou can also print out some scientific articles that describe what misophonia is and bring them to the teacher and the school counselor. That might be a good start.\n\nHope this teacher will change his mind and you can enjoy art class again! Get your parents involved. If you can ofc.", "STOP THE MISOPHONIA NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Reading this made me sweat. I am not an assertive person, at least in person, but misophonia has made me much more willing to ask for people to eat away from me.\n\n\"I am so sorry, but I really cannot concentrate with the sound of chips crunching - would you mind waiting a minute?\" Yep, our zoom meetings only last about 10 minutes each day, but I can guarantee that a few people on the meeting feel the need to be stuffing food down their face or keep sipping out of a water bottle. Very infuriating. Just wait until the meeting has finished for god\u2019s sake. you would think it would be common knowledge to mute yourself whenever you are not talking on a Zoom call... but to not mute while EATING?! jesus christ. how can people be so indecent. I would explode. i am sorry you had to suffer through that.  even if it is that urgent, simply mute and i will do my best to ignore you \ud83d\ude2b RIGHT LIKE EVEN WITHOUT MISOPHONIA WHO WANTS TO HEAR THAT? she is like 24! should know better it is so hard for me to be polite while triggered. definitely something i need to work on so i can start saying things like that. if i were to say something it would probably come out sounding something like \u201cplease shut the fuck up before you make me cry\u201d I totally understand it definitely takes practice when you are not triggered, or with friends while you are.\n\nAlthough last time my best friend walked up to me while loudly munching chips out of the bag, I only lasted about two seconds before I had to say \"Do you realize how close I am to hitting you? Literally?\"\n\nHe was cool and laughed it off... but also has not done it again.  I had already explained the whole thing to him but I think it took me being triggered for him to finally get it. that friend is a real keeper...i feel like most people get super defensive about it :/ especially in my experience w my family which has made it hard to talk to my friends and others Yep, they do, even my wife at first, but they will come around if they are good people.\n\nI find it helpful to frame it as my problem, but sometimes you do have to grab an actual chalkboard and run your nails over it before certain people truly get it. \n\nMost people can imagine what nails on a chalkboard make them feel like though, so I do use the analogy a lot.  I just focus on me and not them to keep the defensiveness at bay.  \"I have got that nails on a chalkboard feeling right now... not your fault at all, but I sure would appreciate it if you would let me finish what I am doing so I can leave you alone to make that sound\". that is interesting about the nails on a chalkboard analogy, sometimes when i explain it and people are like \u201coh, so like nails in a chalkboard\u201d i want to say no, because i feel like that simplifies it. i want to tell them \u201cno it is not like anything you will ever experience\u201d even though that may not be true. \n\ni think the irrationality of the illness is what does it for me. when someone scrapes nails on a chalkboard, the whole class squirms and begs them to stop. but with chewing and other noises like that it is so normal that there is this whole guilt thing that happens. and it becomes such an angry, frustrated, confused response. nails on a chalkboard is unpleasant, but bearable. \n\ni think you have a point though. that analogy is probably the only way to get people to understand, and there is no need for me to gatekeep misophonia, lol. i have trouble remembering how noises bothered me before i had misophonia, but it is probably not all that different from the nails. I have this problem regularly with my boss. He eats and talks at the same time. Or smacks his lips because he is constantly drinking. Or sometimes just smacks his lips without speaking but not being muted.\n\nOne time I was leading the meeting and thank goodness I was able to mute him. That was on teams btw lol, when u mute on teams does not it mute for everyone? Yes that is the point. And he can unmute himself when he is ready to speak If you are leading a zoom call, does not it let you mute anyone you want? Like zoom call mod privileges or something. im not sure, but it was actually her account since she works for my organization and has a paid account. that would be nice though", "Sometimes I wish I was deaf but then I realize it would be better dead  We are here if you need to vent.

I have not talked to him about my triggers or misophonia in general because I am always worried I am being rude somehow. We are quarantined together now and every meal I am struggling. I think it is getting worse because of all the stress and anxiety too. He just chews so loudly. Smacks his lips. Constantly eats crunchy food. He can tell something is off but I do not know how to talk to him about it. People always feel like I am mad at them when I tell them about it but I am not. I feel soooo angry in the moment but I still love them. Idk. I have no idea what to do. I feel like I am going to loose my mind or snap at him Please take this advice with a grain of salt because I am working on telling people about my Misophonia without coming off like an ass. \n\nThe longer you wait to tell them about what is going on, it will stew anger and resentment inside of you and make them more uncomfortable and upset. There is no easy way to tell someone that something they are doing, which seems like nothing to them or (I assume) anyone else, is bothering you as bad as it is. Misophonia sucks, but it sucks more not being honest about it.\n\nMy suggestion would be to explain to them what Misophonia is (I would hope they are open and understanding about mental illness) in a way that is not shaming or putting the blame on either of you. For example, do not say \u201cwhen YOU chew with your mouth open, it makes me really upset\u201d, instead generalize it in a way that makes it about the noise, not that the person is at fault. Say something along the lines of how certain noises bother you, noises that anyone else would turn a blind eye to. That it is not something you can control but not something you are mad at the person about.\n\nI confuse all the time my anger for the person making the noise rather than my ability to control the noise itself. If there is constant stomping, sure I can be upset with the person doing it, saying they are rude and not paying attention to anyone else\u2019s feelings, but that would not be true. People do not know there is a problem unless you tell them there is one.\n\nJust be honest. You are totally right. I am so non confrontational that this stuff worries me so much. I actually just talked to him about it! He is so sweet I should have known that he would understand. Apparently his ex wife struggled with it too! I know she was not the nicest person though so I feel like I need to prove to him that even though I have this I am not going to be mean to him when something is bothering me if that makes sense I am really happy to hear that! A lot of people struggle with it and have no clue they even have it, I did not for years and just recently accepted there was something else going on. And for the last part yes I completely understand that, so long as you are genuine and not blaming, I am sure everything will turn out fine.\n\nGood for you! Good luck with everything. It is difficult enough dealing with noise sensitivity and trying to explain it. Your in a situation where you do not want to come across as being cruel but for your own sanity and peace of mind you have got to say something. It really is a horrible affliction (that is how I think of it) I used to think it was just me. Thank you! Definitely not just you. We are all in this together I am sorry to hear about that and I am young and still trying to find my way of just coping but I wish you the best of luck with telling and my advice is to just not go into much detail and when he is more comfortable with that idea tell him a little more detail.

I have been bribing him outside with treats and he whines and headbutts the door trying to get inside. \n\nI feel so immensely guilty about it. Am I a shitty person? Ouch that is a tough one to solve, but no you are not a shitty person. \n\nIs it possible to use headphones instead of earplugs? I know that when I have music playing through my headphones I cannot really hear someone right beside me.\n\nOn the other hand, if he is trainable you could try and give him incentives to sit and be quiet. I would try and tell him to sit in the living room, leave and close the door, then come back with some treats. Keep doing this while making the time you are gone longer and longer. It might be a bit of a time commitment to teach him that when he sits quietly he is rewarded, but it might make him less anxious in the long run. \n\nEither way good luck. \n\nP.S.

I hope this helps \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f If you are going to leave it at that, yes, that is very shitty. I totally get that it is very hard to deal with trigger sounds, but if you let that dictate how you treat others you are letting the disorder take over your life, and this is just the first step. \n\nA pet has no life outside of you and what you give them \u2013 they cannot leave, they cannot hang out with someone else if the person they are closest to pushes them away. Without meaning to sound harsh, this is a commitment. If, due to a disorder you find yourself unable to properly care for a pet, you need to actively look for a solution.\n\nThis would be a good time to either train your dog or work on your triggers with a therapist. Punishing the dog solves nothing, and will ultimately only increase stress. I appreciate your honesty, and you are 100% right. I have started seeing a psychologist so I really hope she can help.", "Sleeping in separate rooms bc I cannot tolerate snoring I am so happy that I Found this group. I did not even know that this \u201ccondition\u201d was called misophonia. I have been wondering for YEARS if what I had even existed or if I am just a difficult person. \n\nI am unable to sleep with a snorer. It will keep me awake and I will easily get angry and frustrated. I get so emotional that I have cried before while the person next to me is happily asleep snoring. Lol\u2026 I have had this issue for a long time. It started when I was about 8 years old. I had to share a bedroom with my 2 younger brothers. They either breathed really loud or snored. It would keep me awake at night, unable to fall asleep. I would get so angry at them because my younger brothers were such loud children in general. Whatever they did, it had to be obnoxious and loud. When they played together, it was just chaotic noise and I was never able to escape the noise as a kid. I remember thinking to myself that I cannot even get peace and quiet at night, im forced to push through their snoring. I would try to make my own earplugs by shoving toilet paper in my ears. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not. It was rough times as a kid!\n\nNow that I am a full adult, I am having issues sleeping in the same bed as my boyfriend. We currently sleep in separate bedrooms because of it. He falls asleep so quick, I do not have time to fall asleep before he does. It usually takes me about 1 hour to fall asleep unfortunately (due to the typical depression and stress). \n\nI am frustrated bc I want to be able to sleep with my boyfriend and enjoy the intimacy of sharing a bed with someone you love. I have tried pushing through it but it is hard. It comes to the point that foam earplugs do not work anymore, I can still hear him snore clearly. I did some research about that and apparently your ears can get used to the earplug which makes your hearing work harder to hear noises. It is bad guys. Is there anyone else out there that is living the same thing as me?!", "Coping Techniques Wanted! Hi, everyone! I am desperate and need some advice. \n\nI hate the sounds my dad makes. He grunts and groans whenever he moves. He can be sitting and still make the most awful noises. He also watches videos on his iPad on full volume at all times of the day. \n\nThese sounds are so revolting to me. They make me uncomfortable to the point that I feel physically sick hearing them. \n\nWhenever I have brought this up to him he gets really mad and throws a fit. He will then proceed to be mean to me for the next few days and try to exaggerate his noises even more than usual. This has really strained our relationship. \n\nWhen I am at home I am pretty much wearing my noise cancelling headphones at all times. I even bought the noise cancelling headphones you would wear to a shooting range as back up if the battery dies on my Bluetooth ones. \n\nThe issue is, he gets really mad at me for wearing them. He feelings like I am ignoring him. He thinks I am being rude when I wear them. Do any of you have any advice on how to deal with sounds when you are forced to hear them? \n\nI have a technic I use but it is getting less and less effective. Whenever I hear a really gross sound I will drum my fingers on a surface as a way to \u201cclear\u201d the bad sound from my brain. It use to be really helpful, but not so much lately. \n\nI wish I could move out, but I am just not financially stable enough to do so right now. I also cannot stand the constant noise and feelings of animosity. \n\nI am sorry for the long post, but I would really appreciate some advice! Ugh, no advice here.\n\nI am so sorry, I just had a misophonia breakdown reading your post. Following the thread for some new and any advice I am sorry my post caused you to feel that way! I have definitely experienced the same feeling read similar posts on here. I hate that anyone has to go through this, but there is some comfort in knowing I am not alone! I hope we can both get some good advice in how to deal with this condition. Oh no, that is just how real this shit is. I feel like misophonia ppl (misophones?) Should just go out and make our own community lollll You will have to be less accommodating of his feelings since he does not care about yours. The headphones are a good idea. Let him be mad. I would definitely join that community! It would be devoid of triggers and socially acceptable to wear headphones whenever you need to. Thank you for the advice! You are definitely right. I need to get over the anxiety I feel about him being mad at me. I wear some smaller earplugs that muffle trigger sounds like breathing noises but still allow me to hear conversations.  They are more inconspicuous than headphones so may be easier for him to tolerate.  Mack\u2019s foam earplugs are almost invisible once you get the hang of inserting them properly, that may be an option as well. As I was typing what is below I did realize I do have a healthy coping mechanism: I make wooden pipes.1) I have an excuse to wear noise cancelling head phones, 2) although I have invested in a few tools all you need really is a decent hand saw, a drill and a dremel (maybe $250 investment at most). 3) I can use it as an excuse to get away from a situation I do not want to be around. For example, \"oh crap I forgot about the glue on that pipe\" and excuse myself from the situation. I have a big plastic box of pipes, now realizing it. \n\nI would be scared it could get cult-ish without the devil itself, HOA. There would have to be an evaluation for someone to join the community and a quick fix for anything that goes south with new community members. \n\nI do wish there were dating groups for it, because someone can turn me off really quickly, especially that first date, you eat like a f---g pig, hard pass. I have a girlfriend, but she can be *exactly* like your dad. But not always. That is what leads me to a poor coping mechanism in which I see no reason to share. Try \"square\" breathing while acknowledging the sounds.  Square breathing is to breathe in for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, breathe out for a count of 6. Repeat as needed. You can do it quietly.\n\nFocus on your breath, focus on what your body is doing as you breathe.  And also try not to push the sounds away, actively listen to the sounds and say to yourself \"I am hearing this sound and I do not like it.\" And then, if another emotion comes up, say \"I am feeling angry (nervous/aggravated/etc,) and I am feeling it in my belly (or wherever in your body you are feeling the emotion.) You can repeat this with the same emotion, or notice if you have more than one, do it for each emotion as it comes up.\n\nThis works for me, somehow the anger I feel melts away and the sound is just a sound.\n\nFrom what you describe, it sounds like you might need some support. If you can get some therapy to help you address the underlying problems with your dad, it might help. I know when I have unresolved issues with people, the misophonia gets bad.  \n\nIf you are a teen, and your parents would not agree to therapy for whatever reason, go to your primary doctor and ask for a referral or, if they would hurt you if they found out you did that, go to Planned Parenthood. They do more than birth control and sti testing, they can help you get what you need. They use a sliding scale, my guess is your visit would be free or close to it.  You could also go to your guidance counselor at school, but you would need to be lucky and get a good one. Thank you so much! I will look into getting a pair. Thank you so much for the advice! I will definitely be trying the breathing technique. Whenever I am upset I normally force myself to count to ten over and over until the feelings go away. I think it will be much more beneficial to actually focus on the feels and acknowledge them like you advised. I definitely have underlying issues with my dad. I think that is why he is one of my biggest triggers. I am going to look into therapy. Maybe if I can work through some of the other issues it will help me deal with my misophonia. Thanks again! It is really overwhelming to let those sounds in at first, not going to lie.  But I remind myself emotions cannot actually hurt me, and what I am doing to try to protect myself is actually hurting me more than feeling my feelings.  And also reminding myself it is not the sounds bothering me, it is the person, it the issue I am having with the person. Somehow it helps the angst and agitation melt away. I hope it works for you too!! Imagine getting mad at someone with poor eyesight because they wear glasses.\n\nImagine getting upset and accusing someone who cannot walk because you do not like their wheelchair.\n\nImagine being a dick to deaf people because they have hearing aid or require sign.\n\nImagine being an asshole to bipolar people because they need medicine.\n\nOr cancer patient who needs chemo and wears a hat all day.\n\nOr a drug addict who needs methadone.\n\nOr an alcoholic who needs rehab.\n\nOr a teenager who needs braces on their teeth.\n\nOr an allergy sufferer who needs epinephrine.\n\nOr an abuse victim who needs therapy.\n\n...", "Relating to owls has somehow eased the rage associated with my misophonia. I have realized the power of naming my demons so I can address them. My wife struggles to understand how noises around the house affect me. This morning was a particularly awful one, where my flight response drove me out of my noisy house quickly and very angrily. I took the dogs for a walk in the woods and encountered a pair of Great Horned Owls that I have been observing for a few months now. \n\nThat was when I realized how much I related to them and I found a way to describe how I felt.\n\nThe owls wake before the crack of dawn and immediately go murder something. Then they frolic with each other for a bit, then go sleep all day.\n\n THAT is what my feelings are telling me I want. Of course that is not an option, but somehow it feels a little better to have that perspective.", "Why does seeing my partner touch his feet I furibard me?? Is that what this group is for? Do I fit in here? I just cannot stand when he crosses one foot over a knee and starts to massage or tap his foot with his fingers. I HATE it. He says it is his way of self soothing. It bothers me so much that I want to scream. Why am I like this? My blood boils. I think about how dirty feet are and how he will touch me with the same hands and I hate the feeling of sticky fingers not gliding over skin but instead catching with friction because of germs and sweat. Also the sound of his wrists cracking randomly while he types. I fucking hate even the sound of typing. What is wrong with me? Is this normal? And the sound and image of my moms lips parting and making that I sticking sound before she speaks or when he is touching her hair with her hands. I mean my stomach tightens and flips out. Do others feel this way? How? Why? Who? Misophonia is the same idea but related to sound. Check out Misokinesia, that is what you are looking for! For some reason this bothers me too. I do not think it is misophonia though, because it is not auditory.\n\nMisokinesia is related to sight/movement instead. There is a subreddit at /r/Misokinesia. \n\nGood luck! Yes, this is very common.  Sight and sound go hand in hand for most misophonia/misokinesia sufferers.  \n\nPeople are annoying. *furibard*???? Thank you! I will check that out! THANK YOU!! Thank you Yes Of course! A lot of people with misophonia seem to have these things overlap. It does seem that the hatred/anger starts with the sound and then develops into frustration at just seeing the visual that makes the sound happen. \n\nIn my understanding Misokinesia is the opposite, where seeing people tap or twitch or perform certain movements causes the same type of distress and anxiety, which then can bleed and start to overlap into hating sounds that come along with it.\n\nSome people just straight up have both at the same time. Any way you slice and dice it is valid- but its good to start thinking about the origin and what part actually triggers you, especially if you want to focus on anxiety reduction. \n\nI started doing exposure therapy a few months ago and things are so much better now! What does that mean? My husband rubs his feet together all the time and it drives me up the wall. I feel bad asking him to stop because as your partner says, it is a comforting, soothing thing for them. Nothing else really to add but yeah you are not alone.", "I am going to lose it. My coworker sounds like she is choking on her dentures and eating her tongue every time she eats. Which is ALWAYS. I have never been so triggered. Her stomach also consistently growls while she is eating, she gulps, slurps and talks with her mouth full. I am thinking of investing in some good ear plugs when I can afford it but how do I wear them in the car with her on breaks without hurting her feelings? I have literally never had someone trigger me so much. I want to beat the shit out of her face and scream and cry and quit my job. I cannot handle it. And I cannot just keep standing outside in the freezing rain every day when she eats. How could I wear earplugs without being rude or offensive? Record her and play it to her! People need to know they sound like hell!! I am going to start explaining as a form of anxiety bc in my book it is. I even talked to my doctor about it. Maybe that will help too. You need to ask for help. You are not alone in your hesitation to ask for fear of ridicule or push back. Those that do that are Rats, and you should not fear \"offending\" them.\n\nIf someone has the ability to respond with help, well, that is their \"response ability\", or responsibility. You are worth it, you deserve it. You could say it is not much different than someone with a wheelchair faced with stairs, or an asthmatic faced with a smoker in the office.\n\n\"hey, can I tell you guys something? I have this weird thing called misophonia and it makes me panic when I am around gum chewing and pen clicking. I am pretty embarrassed about it but I cannot help it. Sorry but those are the two noises I cannot handle.\" - (\n\n(\n\nLetter to Friends, Family, and Co-workers:\n\n( Well, ask politely first. Then tear her to shreds if she does not respond. Be the Dog. Eat the Rat. Unfortunately I have mentioned the issue before, and she is the type of person who would rather make a problem out of it than be understanding. Idk why I am trying not to offend her honestly. I guess just because I hate confrontation :( What kind of office? Do you have HR to help? How did you mention it before? Are you documenting it?\n\nYou hate the confrontation because you know it could lead to more stings if she ignores her responsibility. You are afraid that you will not approach it correctly and she will be 'offended' (or she would be offended no matter what) and will not respond within her ability to help because if the 'offense'. You have real and valid reasons for not wanting to approach her to ask for help. Acknowledge that. Put that in stone. You have real reasons to avoid the confrontation. \n\nNow that you acknowledge the reasons, overcome them. Ignore them. Discredit them. They do not matter because she does not matter. YOU MATTER. You fight the sting of miso every day. A normal human would burst into flames. You have more courage than anyone you have ever met. \n\nUse the Letter, print it out, and use the simple \"hey this sounds crazy\" approach and ask for help. Be polite. Be honest.\n\nIf she helps, then you have made a better friend.\n\nYou can handle her rejection if that is what comes, and if it is, she is just a Rat. Document it. Take it to HR. Your manager. Others in the office. Be honest to yourself. Be the Dog. Eat the Rat. I would just stop worrying about offending her since you mentioned telling her and she would rather make it a problem.\n\nI had to do this with my cubemate. I have been there six months and it took me quite a while to stop feeling guilty/offensive for wearing headphones all day. But then I remembered how she warned me of her constant snacking when we became cubemates and said something proving she knows about misophonia--that she does not know if I am the kind of person that minds that but if so it might help her lose some weight. I do not want to dictate anyone's behavior but I did respond by asking if I was allowed to wear headphones to let her know that those sounds do actually bother me. She responded in kind of a discouraging tone that \"some people wear one in so they can still hear buuuut...\"\n\nAnd then she has continued to bring crunchy snacks that she grazes on all day every day. She has continued to lean over my shoulder whole chewing and to keep snacking when our team is discussing things as a group. Among everything else she does that she is aware bothers people and does anyway. So now I just quit caring if I am oblivious while she tries to get my attention. She can tap my shoulder or chat me. I play white noise on YouTube at the same time as my podcasts.\n\nEdit: I meant to ask about the eating situation? Are you forced to eat in her car with her? I would just go for it. You said she does not really care about your feelings in the matter, so why let it get to you? We clean houses so it is just me, her and my boss in the same vehicle driving from place to place and when we have to take breaks I am either stuck listening to her or I have to freeze outside in the rain.  Sometimes I will cut our break time short and just go back to work because I cant handle it. Her and I have had a conversation before about all of the sounds that bother me and why and what it is like. But she is one of those people who thinks it is cute and funny to not care about anyone around them. Like the girls who think they are \"blunt\" but really they are just jerks. can you wear earbuds and play something to distract yourself? I think I am going to invest in some and give it a try after reading around here a bit. I hope it helps! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e", "Hot ones lil nas real bad kiddies Eating sounds trigger me big time but hot ones is usually fine because you cannot hear them eat. Holy shit though the new video with lil nas is the worst fucking thing i have ever heard. He eats like a goddamn pig. I unstan. Stay away. My ears feel violated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis channel used to be my favorite too. I do highly recommend the undertaker episode though. I personally could not hear any audible eating but if you are highly sensitive it might still trigger you. What lil nas x video? Can I get a link to ( Thanks, also I see what you mean. I listened to it with my headphones near but not on my ears (Since I do not want to trigger my Misophonia severely) and oh my god his chewing was just....no. See him chewing his food also made it worse", "What is the worst thing miso has made you do? I have struggled with miso for 30 yrs. At least it has a name now.\nWondering what miso has driven you to do. \nIt is a long list of yelling and kicking things for me, but my top is probably throwing a deodorant stick thru our paper thin closet door. Left a hole the shape of the deodorant. And all it took was someone sneezing or coughing. When I was 8 or 9 after meningitis my brother was eating cereal in a glass bowl. I picked up the bowl and threw it over his head and it shattered on the wall. \n\nSince then I have not had any major outrage. Oh wow. Never knew it could manifest that early. Mine started in my teens. Glad to hear no more major outrages. Did u find a coping mechanism to prevent further outrages? Woodworking is the only healthy coping mechanism.  I have two or three unhealthy mechanisms that I am working on stopping steadily and diligently. I use woodworking as a thing to basically have an excuse escape from a trigger (e.g. oh sh*t I forgot that was gluing brb!) and it let us me walk around a lot with ear muffs on and seem normal. I chose a career that would keep me isolated outside and now I am in an office more so, but I have my own private office (thank God).\n\nI also make sure that I do not have any glassware in the house or anything. Slept in the car cuz my brother had a cold. All his sick noises made me want to have an autism meltdown and headbang after every trigger. I only slept there for one night, though he was sick for a few nights. Had to wait in the basement till 2 A.M. as to be 1000% sure he was asleep until I could go to sleep myself. I have had worse instances of trigger experiences, but sitting in that freezing car, alone with my thoughts, just made me think \u2018Is this really what I have become? for hours. This disorder is awful. Just as a note. Miso does not \u201cmake you\u201d do anything. We all have free will. It may compel you or give you a VERY strong urge, but our actions are, at the end of the day, ours.\n\nThat said, I have yelled at people a lot before because of it. Ended otherwise good relationships. I respectfully disagree to some extent.\n\nI mean, you can torture someone to the point of breaking too. But they have free will, so at the end of the day it was their decision to break, right?\n\nThis is neurological disorder that causes fight or flight response. That is on par with not being startled if someone scares you, because you have 'free will.' I have managed to keep my cool, mostly my blow ups are internalized, I leave if I have to. But when i was maybe 12 i was in a wendy's eating out with my mom and she went to the bathroom and i saw that there was this kid sitting behind where she had been sitting eating so disgusting. When my mom got back I was literally in tears and begging to go eat in the car. And my mom was pissed because she thought we were going to have a nice, mother daughter date. I started hating all women. I am really disgusted by that. I cannot help that mostly women trigger me. It is gotten to the point that when I open a book in the bookstore I first check whether the author was female, when I listen to music I evade most female artists (I must admit when it comes to music it is a bit different, the ones I listened to years ago do not trigger me), when I look at paintings I tend to ignore the ones painted by females.\n\nI do realize it is wrong. I really do. And I am as disgusted by myself as you are.\n\nIt is gotten to the point that my brain just associates females with pain/annoyance/triggers/etc. Someone in the comments mentioned 'free will' - I do not think it is a black &amp; white sort of issue. Yes, you have free will, but there are things that simply do not make sense to us yet. At the end of the day our brains are quite complex and summarizing that with a simple 'you have free will' is a bit delusional.\n\nNote: By 'hating' I mean, I would never do anything physical/hurt someone explicitly because they are a woman. I would never discriminate in the workplace based on gender. I would never advocate against women's rights. I just want them and the noises they make away from me. I have practiced my self-control to the point where if a woman chews next to me 99% of the times I do not say a thing, because I do not want to hurt their feelings, especially if they are not family (since my family already knows). I simply make an excuse and leave. I am curious, what noises do women make that are so different from or worse than men? I do not claim women make different noises than men. Men trigger me as well, but for whatever reason women just make me go insane.\n\nIf I had an answer as to why it is females and not males then my life would not be as confusing. I have a theory based solely on my experiences - I did not have the best relationship with my mother and I remember the first time I experienced misophonia was when I was in the car and she was chewing a gum.\n\nSince she was my first 'trigger', I suspect our not-so-great relationship fueled that sort of hatred. \nKeep in mind all this happened while I was a small child, I think it messed with my perception of women.\n\nThough I must admit, some of the most influential and inspiring people in my life have been females. I do not get it either, just sharing my experience. Thanks for sharing. I was just interested because I have never heard about anything like this in relation to misophonia. However, I wonder if it is not so different from how we tend to get most annoyed with sounds from family members and loved ones. It is such a painful part of this condition, that the people we care about most are often the ones that trigger us the most. In a similar way, you are more triggered by one gender. That sounds really hard especially because it is not something you have any control over. Thank you for your comment - I am glad you are trying to understand my side of things! I can also kind of relate to the family/strangers triggers, but for me it is mostly gender-based. Misophonia really is a cursed thing.. it has some sort of weird rules that apply differently to everyone. Truly bizarre. want to kill my parents. practically bully my little sister. it is turned me into a piece of shit. a suicidal one might i add. i just want to be normal again. I take my nails and will tear at my hands untill I am well past bleeding, and only after I have calmed down for quite a while can I feel any of it. It makes my friends so sad whenever they see the new scabs or the old scars and that is the worst part of it.  I was riding in a car to a concert with my then-girlfriend. She was driving and eating a piece of pizza. She was a very loud eater, and I had been suffering through it for the 3-4 months that we would been dating.\n\nSo I asked her if I could have a bite. When she handed it over, I threw it out the window.\n\nWe broke up that very night. Wow, I really empathize with you; that is very hard to deal with, and pretty much impossible to explain to non-misophones.\n\nI have a similar thing, but just with women's voices. Not all women, but mostly just the ones who talk in that low vocal-fry register. It disturbs me to my core. I cannot handle it for more than about five seconds. Some males do it too, but it is mostly women. I listen to a ton of podcasts, but it is gotten to the point where if any of the participants are women with vocal fry, I just have to stop listening. It sucks and makes me feel like a sexist asshole. Oh my god. I am so glad it is not only me!!!! (Even though at the same time I feel really bad for you..)\n\nYes, whenever I try to elaborate on my 'hatred' or try to defend my reasoning behind it, people just look at me weirdly and start asking me questions trying to expose me as a sexist and so on. These days I am so tired of trying to explain something they simply will not get that I just *leave* the situation or change the topic. \n\nAlso, if someone is not going to bother to try understanding me then they can leave my life for good. I was escorted out of a restaurant by police for throwing a chair at someone else who was eating a plate of nachos obnoxiously loud.... Not to justify things, but i was across the room, and the room was large. I did not get charges because I missed him and his friends, however, I am permanently banned from that chain for life. The biggest thing for me is getting upset with my animals for cleaning themselves. I never hurt them but I have yelled at them for it. I have gotten pretty angry at some of them and scared them... I feel pretty bad about it. It is not nice to see your animals scared of you... I often run into my room, slam my door put on headphones with some other noise that drowns that out and just insult and swear the person who is triggering me.\n\n.\n\nAnd after a while I feel better, go back to the people and the cycle repeats Yup. Sadly I just did this myself. Wonder if there is a miso support group for these ppl in our lives. Good question. The thing is, people think that I am just an unfriendly asshole because I sometimes react like I said. Likewise I am sure. The guilt. Oh the guilt. Yup. Same. Very few friends. Had a good buddy but the way he cleared his throat. Ugh. Such a great guy but could not be friends with him cause miso Know you are not alone. Been there. Hang in there. Use headphones / ear plugs if ya can. They will perceive it as rude but for me, it is better than going off on my family. I think they would agree Sorry bud. It is surely a strain on my marriage and it is a daily battle. I am trying out white noise machines and wearing my headphones around the house. Not ideal but there is less yelling and throwing Agree. My dog used to cuddle but his whining and barking trigger me. He is old and cannot help it. It is awful. Very well put. I did not know how to respond to that one. I understand where they are coming from but 100% agree with u. It is more akin to a reflex Suicide attempt, absolutley shattered two laptops, broke headphones, violence, I broke some other stuff cannot remember it right now. When I was 10 I stuffed a sock into my younger cousin's mouth and tried to ducktape it shut. She was sleeping over and was snoring insanely loud. I still remember the rage. I just wanted to sleep. \n\nMy entire family thought I was trying to kill her. She was fine, she immediately woke up. \n\nBut yeah that was my first experience with it. \n\nI exhaust myself everyday trying to keep my cool. I have punched a few walls but normally I just end up hitting myself. \n\nI do not know if other people do that but yeah. I usually hit myself in the head. I cannot really control it. I just do it. I am sorry, I hope you find a way to overcome it.", "Discovered a new coping mechanism My husband bought me a portable hot tub and I have discovered that the bubbles are so intense that they are loud enough to cover almost any irritating sound, even the dog next door that never stops barking.

Give me questions to suggest \n\nIt began around 8 years old for me, I had a couple concussions at the least. What makes this interesting is misophonia started directly after/towards the end of meningitis. I can recall my brother eating cereal, I was still getting better (on a lot of meds) and I took a glass bowl and threw it at his head like a frisbee and missed. Ever since then, I have lost a lot of relationships because I cant STAND a lot of noises. Also, I take the max dosage a day of Klonopins because my doctor thinks it is an anxiety disorder (DO NOT TAKE NARCOTICS)\n\nGive me your stories so I can write an article for the health section of the newspaper! It began at a similar time to you, I was made hyperconscious of eating noises when my parents were teaching table manners. I was previously oblivious to these noises that I and others made but by being forced to be aware I am now very sensitive to these noises. A member of my family used to and sometimes still deliberately eats loudly and near to me, in order to upset me. For me misophonia is a torture I may have to suffer for the rest of my life, but I think that steps can be taken by us all and our families/partners to ease the symptoms.\n\nI believe that is what caused my misophonia, so it is interesting that you mention head injuries which is something I have not thought of. I have not had any head injuries to speak of but I am relatively sensitive to slight knocks which often give me bad headaches.\n\nI suffer from anxiety and depression (to answer about other conditions).\n\nI am curious to find out how much misophonia is psychological and how much biological. The community seems to be split on this issue from what I have seen.\n\nPlease spread the word about misophonia because the more people who are aware, the more can be done to help people like us. Please keep the article anonymous, thanks! Mine began around 5-6 I believe. I recall having sob fits when I touched my seatbelt or car seat because the material drove me insane. At around 12 I learned about misophonia as my triggers got worse and more apparent, now chewing, smacking, sniffing, people pronouncing their \u201cS\u201d, Velcro, and lots of fabrics are all triggers. I did have a head injury that was not super severe around 7 I believe that required my head to get glued. And I do not believe I have any other conditions I first noticed that certain sounds bothered me when I started secondary school (11 years old). I have no official diagnosis but I have been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember, so most of my childhood (I am currently a teenager). When I was younger I had an unspecified anxiety problem. \n\nOne thing I have noticed is that all of my trigger sounds come from other people (e.g. mouth sounds, clicking knuckles). Is this true for you guys? Everything will be anonymous! I am just asking here first to investigate more links. Thank you for your story and I am sorry about one family member intentionally getting under your skin :/ Ouch, sorry about your head! \n\nThis is interesting to me because I occasionally cannot stand certain materials causing difficulty breathing when I have been around that linen for a while (bed sheet randomly). Nobody believes me about that, and I cannot stand that super super soft stuff it gives me the chills thinking about it. Yeah mouth sounds seem to be the number one complaint and there is other things that will be different from person to person, in my reading. For example, any mouth sounds I hate. My mom, for example, has a permanent cough (not from smoking or anything) and when I am around her and she is lightly coughing all the time it makes our visits kind of worse. There is a lotttt! Read on these pages, and see what you can do at your age to help alleviate it while your young, just bare in mind nobody has answers, really. :/ I cant stand the feeling of woolen gloves (the ones I had at school anyway) or when salt dries on them from the sea or something Thanks for taking the time to reply. Sorry to hear about your mum, that sounds so frustrating! I am new to reddit but this sub is really helpful. I know that nobody has found a cure, but at least there are other people that understand. It seems that more research is being done into what misophonia actually is and if it is related to other issues, so I am hoping that the results might give us all some insight.\n\nEdit - this comment was meant to be a reply to OP. Still figuring out how to reply to people lol 1. It is been present since my early childhood (early enough that I could not possibly give a definitive starting time, probably when I was about 5 years old though idk)\n2. I have never had a head injury \n3. Anxiety \n\nAlso worth noting: My misophonia became much more manageable after I was prescribed medication for my anxiety. I just think it is interesting how closely linked my anxiety and misophonia are, but obviously it can be very different for different people. However, I have reason to believe my case it is possibly either genetic or the anxiety is genetic and the misophonia came with it, or vice versa. \n\nYeah ok I have no idea. It is all a mystery lol I have pretty mild misophonia that varies in intensity, some days it is bad and some days I can handle it easy. I am generally 3/4 on the activation scale. It first started with one trigger when I was about 11, and I was not aware of it but I know it annoyed the hell out of me. When I was 15 and went to a new school I randomly got my biggest trigger (sniffling), and I have been getting new ones ever since. I think another one is developing - lip smacking because I find I am struggling to listen to music where they lip smack a lot.\n\nI do not have any mental issues diagnosed and I am a generally ok person. I have not had any injuries, it was just super random. I do not remember an exact age but I was probably around 6-7 when I first really remember it affected me. My older brother and I were hanging out at my Aunt's horse farm and as a joke  my brother started chewing \"like a horse\" aka mouth open wide and side to side a chew. For some reason(now I know its misophonia), that really upset me and I asked him to stop. He thought it was hilarious and kept doing it. I think I recall at one point he was sitting on top of me doing it at me. Even while typing this, I feel like this paints him in a bad light. He was just being an annoying older brother and I cannot imagine he truly understood how much much that grated on me. Also, I do honestly believe that it was a minor annoyance and that situation cemented it as true issue for me. I can remember it starting around 11 or 12. My brother has Tourette\u2019s and would make lots of snorting and throat clicking noises and my older sister would pop her gum. Those were my main triggers. My poor brother, though, could not help it. And I would freak out. :(\n\nI never went to the doctor for this but I went flying off a bike and flew head first into a wooden bench. I was knocked unconscious and could not remember the following couple of hours. Was never taken to the hospital but pretty positive I suffered a concussion at the very least. That was around age 9 or 10 The first time I noticed it when I was around 11-12 specifically with my dad he makes a whole host of noises and because of them I would start fights with him. He moved out with I was 13-14 luckily. But I was also as a child very disgusted by people eating and all of my triggers not related to my dad are all about mouth sounds (especially chewing) so I think it might have come from eating lunch at school. It was generally visually based (8 year olds chewing with their mouths open) but I would not he suprised of there was also a audio issue as well. I used to eat lunch on the coat room sometimes.\n\nTLDR; it started with noises from one specific person and also mouth noises sometime in elementary school I can remember it starting around 10 years old. Previous to this I did experience a rather severe concussion (loss of consciousness, vomiting, etc.) I also have generalized anxiety and a small pituitary tumor (does not really impact my day to day like this does, but it is there.) \n\nThe sounds of chewing, mouth breathing, sniffling and slurping/sipping are so incredibly infuriating to me. I know that there are struggles I probably do not understand about not having a full range of hearing (and I do not mean this to be insensitive to that!) but I catch myself fantasizing about losing some hearing ability, to make being in an office/coffee shop/dinner table more bearable. The level of emotional response I have towards these sounds is frustrating and heavily impacts overall quality of life. I started getting anxiety, depression, ocd-symptoms, and more when I became a teenager. I wanted the house clean and noticed the horrible habits of my family. I wish I grew up somewhere else. I wish all the classmates I have lived alongside never appeared in my life. They gaslighted me and used verbal and behavioral violence. I am a product of ppl. I get no empathy. As far as I am aware, since I was born (I remember being 3yo and being triggered). Only with my mom, whom I love but slightly resent and I think its linked to that. No head injuries, depression from teen years on. I pretend that I have with both my parents so my mom does not feel personally attacked. So I act triggered when my dad eats near me even though I am not bothered.", "The Miso List: Support misophone-owned businesses Discover and support businesses by other misophones: (\n\nThe Miso List is a free, curated directory to help us support each other's work.\n\nHave something you want to list?

It has bothered me for as long as I can remember. I used to intentionally sit as far away from my dad as I possibly could when he made me go to church because he is a heavy breather. If anybody has any tips to get over this it would be greatly appreciated because it is something I deal with just about every day. \n\nI am also planning on joining the Army after high school and snoring sets me off, so I am worried that this will get in the way at basic. When I have to sleep near someone who snores I toss and turn all night feeling pretty helpless and angry. It would really suck for something as small as breathing or snoring to get in the way of a dream I have had since I was 10. I do not think there is a solution, there are ways to adapt though like noise cancellation &amp; ear buds. I know we cannot wear them all the time that is why this \u201cadaptation\u201d mindset is not particularly feasible tbh.\nI do not know what to say really, best of luck! Speaking as a veteran, it is going to be hard for you in boot, especially early on. Eventually, exhaustion will kick in and your body will shut down. (At least, that is how it was for me.) But the military is not going to be very helpful to a misophonia sufferer, I am afraid. All I can suggest is a set of noise-canceling earplugs (yes, they make those, thank Gods). They may not allow you to use them in boot, but you would probably be able to get away with them as long as they are not causing you to oversleep or something. That is pretty much what I figured would happen. All I really needed to hear is that it is possible so thanks. It is possible. But be ready to battle triggers. Either way, welcome in.

I had to resist so hard to not scream at them. My solution was to listen to music max volume (with my hood on so my teacher does not see) but very clear issue, i cant listen to the teacher and I cannot do anything. School starts up in a couple hours. It is 2:14am and I cannot do anything. Because of my anxiety I kept it to myself forever. My mom is the only one I have told irl and just like my anxiety she for a while did not realize just how bad it was because I was scared to tell her. But she signed me up to talk to a concealer, but that is not for another week iirc ;W;. \n\nEven right now I am basically freaking out just out of fear (or anxiety idk) but I will not be surprised if I have to \"go to the bathroom\" to freak out in \"private\". \n\nWhat already does not make it easy is that I have adhd and that already so school is basically impossible. I have thought of trying to do it online but I failed the first half of 9th grade because I could not be self motivated enough to do work because adhd, I thought of doing alternate school, but I have never tried that and I am worried it will end up badly. \n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  Try alternate schools or schools that specialize in this kind of thing! That is kind of why they exist. Alternatively, talk to your teacher or school about this. Maybe they would let you take tests alone in a quiet testing environment if you asked?  You are not alone. My grades plummeted from literally straight A's to a lot of Ds and worse after the onset of my misophonia. I had teachers force me to stay in class when they knew letting me work on my own in the hallway  would be an immediate fix. My grades would actually increase when I had in school suspension because that room was typically quiet, so I would blaze through my work and then get to write or doodle for the rest of the day.\n\nKnow that I think of it, I should have done things to get ISS on purpose. My grades would have been perfect.", "Misophonia Coping ", "Has anyone here, who has misophonia, been to a mental hospital? I think I should check myself in because I am feeling suicidal but idk if they eat and sleep together or if there would be other noises I would have to worry about. I would suggest seeking therapy first, and working out a plan with them. Plus, you can even call the suicide hotline, I am sure they would have answers to this question. You deserve help. I am wishing you the best with what ever choice you make. \n\nSide note: The lessons I have learned from my struggle with Misophonia have allowed me to help so many people. Through my pain I have been able to lift up others. You can do the same. It is kind of like lifting weights, in the moment it feels excruciating, but the results are what truly matter. If you are feeling low, feel free to seek help or even message myself. I have, but it was a few years ago and I was not diagnosed with misophonia yet. You might have a roommate, but if you tell them that you have misophonia they might allow you to have a room to yourself depending on how many people are there at the time. The people close to your age range will probably eat with you, but again since you have misophonia and if you explain to the staff that eating sounds are a trigger they will probably allow you to eat alone at a table. Most of the patients did that anyways.\nIt might be a little bit different for you since I doubt you will be going to the same hospital I went to, but everyone there is there to help you and I am sure they will be understanding if you just tell them you have misophonia. I do not know you and I do not know your story, but I wish you all the best and I hope you are able to get the help you need. I definitely recommend seeking some sort of therapy if you have not already before deciding to go to a mental hospital. Stay strong. Feel free to dm me if you ever need someone to talk to or if you have anymore questions. I have never, but i would strongly advise you to seek help for those thoughts. I am feeling the same lately and i already book an appointment with my psychiatrist. \n\nOn a lighter note, only us misos to worry if there are going to be triggers in a mental hospital huh. Please be safe and seek help immediately I say it is best to be triggered in a hospital because, at least for me, there were staff that did anything and everything to accommodate for me, and I am sure they would do the same with you. Even though I could hardly participate in the hospitals activities because of Misophonia, I still left feeling a lot less suicidal because I educated staff and patients about Misophonia and made new friends by doing that! You can and should totally do the same. You will most likely eat in a small cafeteria and sleep in separate close rooms, but you will probably be allowed to eat in your room away from everyone else. As for sleep, they could lend you a radio, or they could pull out a mattress so you can sleep in a room further away from everyone else. Those are all things that happened to me. If all else somehow fails, you are guaranteed to have staff to discuss your problems with. \n\nIn short, I would say yes to the hospital because, if you are suicidal, it is best to be triggered with support than triggered isolated from support. I will be keeping you in my prayers, internet stranger. I have never been to inpatient, but I have been to a partial hospitalization program twice. The staff were always super nice and let me wear headphones during lunch. Yes, you do eat together, and you will probably share a room.\nBut if you are feeling suicidal, you should go, it is for your own good.", "I think my misophonia is selective? For example a trigger for me is chewing sounds. I would get really irritated and annoyed and angry about hearing my family members do it, but i feel like if i heard it in an ASMR video I would not be bothered by it that much. Is anyone else like this? Do i actually have misophonia or am I just and asshole? haha I do not think you are an asshole. You could actually watch an ASMR video to see if it really affects you, and even then, a lot of different people have their own individual symptoms. I am also bothered when my family is eating, but my friends do not bother me as much for some reason. It certainly seems as though you have miso, and it would not surprise me if it were selective. Yeah that is really interesting. I feel like i would not be bothered as much by friends doing it either. I wonder how or why it is selective like that. I will try some chewing ASMR(..?) anyway. Thanks. I definitely notice as well that I am more triggered by family than strangers. I find my misophonia is almost always worse when I am stressed. ASMR is usually associated with relaxing. I do not think you are an asshole, I just think stress makes you more sensitive to triggers. :) Oh that would make sense. The people in my house really annoy me, and to be honest it is hard to tell whether it is the sounds they all make, or that they just annoy me, and that that makes the sounds they make unbearable. I fantasise about moving out when I am older and getting to live in peace hahaha. I am kind of the same way....any human whos eating triggers me into a panic attack pretty much. However, if a dog or a cat is eating, does not phaze me one bit! Idk why I am like this or why I have misophonia, but I hate myself because of it. I wouldnt wish it upon my worst enemy. Yeah.

I started having misophonic symptoms about 3 years ago, until I could not stand it anymore and searched for help.\nI spent half of last year eating in my room and having more restrictions towards my triggers, but it still was not enough.\nI started to get psychological help, and it did not help too much, and my psychologist believed it could be something neurological instead of emotional because of the lack of change in my sensitivity. She suggested i went to a psychiatrist, and I did.\nFirst time i went there and he asked me a ton of questions, like if i had any repulse to other senses, like small clothes, mushy food (or if hated most food), being touched by strangers, loud noises if i was an introvert and many other questions.\nIt all made sense then. I had most of those symptoms for all of my life. He suggested it could be Asperger\u2019s syndrome, which is a \u201cmild\u201d form of autism, and gave me a medicine called Risperidone. He also suggested I took a neuropsychological test, to be sure that it was Asperger\u2019s or not, and so i did.\nA couple days ago the results came, and it was indeed Asperger\u2019s. The psychiatrist said the symptoms can be reverted.\nI started to have sessions with a comportamental therapist a week ago, and so far it is going well.\nMy point is that misophonia may be related to autism in some way for you aswell. I am not trying to diagnose anyone, nor promote any medication (you already heard this a thousand times already, but do not take any medication without your doctor\u2019s prescription), i am just suggesting that misophonia may be part of something bigger. Do you also have other symptoms? For me it is! I was diagnosed with autism very recently but was pretty sure I had it for years. \n\nI think it could be that autism makes us more susceptible to developing misophonia because of an existing sensitivity to noise and a tendency to focus on small details. I have been wondering if it could be autism as well for me, but I also have social anxiety.. the last professional I contacted never got back to me and im struggling to bring myself to reach out. I want to seek diagnosis though... thank you for posting this. you are welcome! It is never too late to seek help. A real professional will not judge you. I am baute im on the spectrum but have no diagnosis I am not sure that the link to autism is very accurate, I say this because one of my uncles has autism and never suffered any misophonic symptoms. There are also non-autistic misophonia sufferers as well, so I am not so sure that the link is entirely accurate. Wow, this is something new. I have always had these problems. Only one smell bothers me and that mint. It makes me feel like I am suffocating. along with that, my misophonia is only triggered around my family. I have full-on panic attacks when they eat or even drink around me.  When I hear these sounds all of my happiness gets replaced with rage and anger and sadness in an instant.  So, I never or rarely eat with my family. Its mainly my dad though. He does not seem to care about how I feel when he eats, and there is no way he forgets because he does this 24/7.  \n\nI do have a big fear of being around people or talking to people, especially if I do not know them. Once I was at my sister's friend's birthday, and I am close, kind of , with her friend. My mom forced me to go in the room where all the big kids were hanging out so she could talk with the other adults. I felt like I was going to cry. I had a mini panic attack. I hated it . I do not understand how I can perform on stage with hundreds of people in the audience but I cant talk to people.  The introvert in me is just a mess. \n\nI am a child , so maybe Ill grow out the social interaction fear. Sensory processing disorder is either very very common with or is actually a part of autism, which would mean that any misophonia you have would be intensified", "I think I am trembling Currently my house is being remodeled so we are living in a small apartment (It is not that small but there is five of us and only two bedrooms) and as a result I am being exposed to triggers much more than I was before (I can hear my grandma clicking her tongue in the next room right now). I do not get that many anger reactions, most of the time I get anxiety attacks. But recently I have noticed my limbs trembling after lunch or at night before sleeping (Sleeping=trying to ignore my mom and sister's breath and get some sleep because I have to share a room woth them.) I have never had this reaction before and it does not happen at the same time as the attacks, or at least I think so, I do not reakly pay attention to my limbs when I have an anxiety attack.\n\n\u00bfHas any of you had this kind of reaction? Have you asked her to stop the clicking? I do not think she is conscious of it and she has Alzheimer so even if I ask her she probably would forget about it five minutes later. I do not think she does it on purpose though so the only thing is to get a pair of sleeping ear plugs. They will save your life. That sounds horrible. Is there any way you can isolate from it or block it out? Maybe play some music loud on your headphones or earphones to try and ignore it? I know it cannot be easy. There is building work going on a few houses down and sometimes I can hear them in my bedroom and it drives me insane.  Headphones have helped me. Maybe a fan for white noise, or if you can maybe look up rain/washing machine sounds and wear earplugs I have found similar, and my coping mechanism which I would ABSOLUTELY NOT recommend was scratching myself, sometimes to the point of bleeding.\n\nI told the person making the sound, despite the obvious awkwardness of that, and they are now understanding and sympathetic despite initially being defensive.\n\nReading you are other comments about her Alzheimer\u2019s (I am sorry to hear that, it is a horrible disease), I would suggest drowning out the noise with headphones or music from speakers - or if that is not an option find a way to leave until the trigger sound has stopped. \n\nObviously that is not an option at night but sleeping with earplugs or earphones playing relaxing music even may work well?", "Misophonia during lockdown Hi everyone, hope you have all been safe during the past few months!\n\nI do not know where else or who else I can talk with about this, I am glad to have found this community.  \n\n\nI cannot remember when my misophonia first kicked in but I know it has definitely gotten more and more intense, especially during the past few months in quarantine.

Yes I know it is rude!!! My family dinners are usually just eating and rather short and there is a language barrier, so it is not like we would be talking much. \n\nI feel your pain! :-( I have gotten a new trigger over lockdown- hearing music/tv through the walls. Especially the low tones, I feel like stabbing my ears. What is worse is trying to listen to music over it makes it worse somehow, like if I can still hear it anxiety goes \ud83d\udcc8 and if it is loud enough that I cannot hear it the loud music stresses me out too. It is lose-lose-lose.\n\nGood luck talking to your family about it! I hope they are understanding Eating sounds dont bother me at all. I feel like an outcast in an already outcasted group :( I dont have issues with eating noises.

I love eating alone so that would not bother me at all.\nHave you explored other options or is that a last resort for you?\n\nI am a fast eater by nature and when i am done i start immediately reorganizing the kitchen utensils and dishes i used for cooking to keep me distracted until it is all over.\nI have found opening the window when possible to drown out the noise a little made things a bit easier! Thanks for the kind words. Definitely not a prime time for our kind! I find my solace is absolute silence locked up in my room. Keeping myself busy has not been a problem during these days so at least i have something other than dreadful memories of family meals to keep my brain cells occupied. That must be harsh! Graph says it all.\nI can imagine the feeling though. I lived with my grandmother for a while who was hard of hearing and every time she turned that sucker on i felt like i was in that guitar amplifier scene from back to the future. I have no particular aversion to tv sounds except for when they are in the way of me trying to have a conversation or just so loud that it would turn most heads. But when it hits, it hits lol\n\nLuckily they have been always been very supportive and understanding, just need to present it in a way that does not make me look like a hypocrite.\nAll the best to you as well in optimally drowning out or resolving your situation.\nI have these really good earplugs from honeywell, the model is laser lite if i remember correctly and they are pink and yellow in color. They managed to block out a leaf blower and lawn mower the other day. Always travel with some too just in case. Do you live in the city or further out?\nCity life like that would be tough!\n\nI sometimes open my window for some fresh air but the current always slams my door after a few seconds into my zen ventilation moment..\nI somehow always forget to block the door and the way it startles me fills me with mild rage as well :( Luckily there are so many more wonderful things humans are capable of haha\nWhat triggers you the most? Hi, I just want you to know that you are not the only one. A group of four young males have just moved in next door to me about a month before lockdown started. If it were not for my husband and kids needing a home, I swear I would have bought a tent and pitched it in the middle of a forest. All I have heard is unbelievably loud music directly through my wall, arguing, laughing, banging doors. Here is the worst part, I am not hearing REAL automobiles, I am hearing computer game automobiles. Who needs the TV THAT loud when playing computer games. Hmmm, I k ow that half the problem is me and my cursed hearing but half the problem is these inconsiderate boys. Anyway, you are not alone! These are my triggers too! My misophonia always seems to get worst during stressful seasons of life. :( This has definitely been one of those seasons. Ear plugs and headphones have helped a lot. Getting enough sleep (or as close to it as possible) helps as well. Best of luck to you! Bass, motorcycle, at, loud car stereo or even sound of regular cars passing, slamming doors of any kind, any loud neighbor noise honestly in general. I guess i just hate people I cannot even begin to imagine what that would be like.. hope you managed to find good ways to cope with all that. How do you mitigate this when you go out grocery shopping for example? Surpringsly I only am bothered when at home.  I know that sounds dumb but its true. I cope any other time I totally get you.\n\nWhen I am out there is usually a lot more background noise and I am too busy doing something else to focus on it. At home during meals this person sits right next to me, less than a meter away from my ears and it is  just way too loud to block it out, plus it is a lot quieter.\n\nAt the movies it is another story though. They do not sell many snacks at the movies in the country I live in, though in other countries I have visited you can get a lot more things like nachos and other stuff which has a lot more crunch to it than popcorn.", "I was just accused of being \u201can idiot\u201d and \u201cover the top\u201d for sighing with contempt and dread at someone loudly consuming a particular food product. That is all. I just do not understand how disgusting mouth-eating is not socially frowned upon??? Like I get that the majority of people do not have the physiological/emotional response to sounds we do, but how can everyone not be a little put off by loud eating and open mouth chewing? I feel like that should have the same response as someone farting in public. I wish you all the best and hope you do not have to deal with trigger sounds too much. What is worse is in some cultures, slurping, smacking, burping and loud eating are seen as polite and a sign of respect because it means you enjoy the food. I could not handle that shit. Yeah I encountered that once and had to leave the room. r/misophonia How am I supposed to distinguish what goes where? Oh i was not saying. To post that there, i was saying to check out that sub because people with misophonia tend to hate chewing sounds. Yeah. That is... Why I posted it here.

At school, we all gather together to eat lunch, and i stg, every single one of them chew SO LOUDLY. It is absolute torture. I also do not have earphones/headphones/air pods or whatever bc my parents took them away.\n\nAny suggestions on coping? Please help i am losing my mind\n\nBTW i still have in-person school what kind of parents are those that take your earphones away? Do they know you are sensitive to sounds or not? if they do not, sit down and have a talk to them, if they do, try to convince them to give them back to you. Also, talking to your principal about it and maybe asking for a separate seat might not be a bad idea! Yeaa my parents dont know that i have miso. they just think that it is only chewing and that i only feel slight discomfort. I will try talking to them about it!! Do you have to eat lunch together? I have in-person school but we are discouraged from eating around each other - even taking masks off within small groups is optional. Would it be possible for you to claim you feel unsafe eating around that many others due to covid? Do you know anyone high-risk you can use to back-up your case? (\"My aunt is high risk, so I want to be around as few people as possible\"). Could you walk outside and/or to the park during lunch, or stay in the library/another classroom/bathrooms? It sucks that they are making you eat all together in one room like that.\n\nSchools been really tough for me, too. Because of covid there is a lot less group work or ambient chatter during classes, which means just a near-silent room and endless triggers for me. We will make it out of this! I had this. I told the school that I just wanted to be alone to do my own thing and they put me in my own room by myself. I can invite people in there if I like but I do not have any friends so I do not, but it is a quiet room where I cannot hear anyone else. Maybe you could try that? if you are still in school in june, try getting a library pass or eating lunch with a teacher you like. you can also hide in the bathroom if you have to, that is what i used to do", "Why do some folks slam and bang doors when there are handles? How can anyone tolerate bang bang bang bang slam slam , how can anyone be okay with this in a home environment?\n\nCar door, a factory floor or a rare temper tantrum seem reasonable for slamming doors...

Or go for a drive listening to some music at the same time. Hope you are ok \ud83d\ude4f Right now I have ear plugs in and am listening to low frequency music to try and block out everything. My friend and I discovered some \u201cgood noise\u201d music so that is what I am leaning on. Thanks for the suggestion maybe I can try that. I really appreciate it \n\nIt is just a horrible day for hearing so I am just trying to get thought it c: What would we do without headphones! I enjoy Lo-Fi Beats playlists on Spotify too - good for when I need to concentrate but my misophonia is particularly bad I typically turn on my noise cancelling and blast music, a video, or a livestream in my ears. I know it is not good for my ears but honestly at this point I just do not care. As long as it helps get away from the pain then I will do it Thanks, I found some lo fi that they dampened the snare on beat 3 so that is really nice. Thanks c: Yeah that is what I am doing with music right now on top of wearing ear plugs under my over ear headphones. Self-care. \nTake some time to yourself, take a nap or go to bed early, meditate.\nAlso try to find a distraction. I usually watch something or scroll through social media and distract myself with things that I know will not trigger me. Anything relaxing, comforting, familiar, and distracting that makes me happy. I just curl up in bed and let myself be sad and I just remind myself that it is okay to have these days sometimes. this is quite long i apologise :/\n\ni find exercise does not help, clothing that is comfy helps (sometimes if in my room no shirt or pants) and just finding the right sensory environment. watch safe shows/movies, i find most cartoons do not include much triggers as there is no human sounds, and if you have any \"safe people\" to hang out with to distract you then call  them up. \n\nif you can get out the house (w/ headphones if need be) i suggest going to a nice public place like a library, art gallery/museum or another quiet but engaging place. definitely not eateries though lol. \n\nnothing stressful. have a mental health day and no projects unless you work, then keep it at least minimal. if you know any other coping mechanisms then splendid, add  them on in. play games you never played before so you can focus all your thinking to new information... \n\ntry harm reduction if you are prone to self harm or drug use, for me i get my headphones and sit in a dark room and rock back and forth and cry if it is *real* bad, but lessening sensory input and comfort stimming can help heaps, if you need an outlet then grab an object and have it be your \"designated violence object\" like a stuffed toy or a wood plank lol, and just go ape, if that is what you need.\n\nit is all about finding what works and what does not. hope you learn some good coping strategies :) &lt;3 also i heard other people having a stuffed toy specifically to stab and throw around so if you are wanting to do that absolutely no judgement there, seems better than people tbh haha I try and put music on or watch TV. Although the sound, most of the time, repeats on a loop in my head, causing more triggers. I usually end up pulling my hair, clenching my teeth, scratching my arm/hand, etc. It is bad. Thanks I will try my best to find something. You do not have to apologize for the long response if anything I really appreciate it.

Then pretty much right on cue her boyfriend comes in trying to call the cat going pspspspsps which also triggers me, and my mom was like \u201cdoes that trigger you?\u201d And I said yes, and she made the sound right at me again on purpose and I started crying right there because I just did not even know what else to do I was so taken back that she was blatantly mocking something I cannot change about myself and am super self conscious of, thanks to my family, but not only that I have made them self conscious about how they eat and breathe around me which makes me feel like a piece of shit too. You should not feel bad for things you do not control. They are essentially doing the same thing as going to a scitzophrenic and saying just stop seeing or hearing things or going to someone blind and saying just see. If they are unwilling to accept how severe your case is then that is their fault, not yours. If you think you can get them to understand, go for it. But if they never understand or even want to understand then there is nothing you can do about. And why be angry about things you cannot do anything about? Best of wishes I am sorry that happened.\n\nI have been in the same boat. My mother has chewed right in my ear and smirked.\n\nI have tried asking my Dad to hold on for a couple of secs until I leave the room but he thinks I am trying to stop him eating. \n\nI have tried explaining misophonia and misokinesis(?) to them.

Well aparently he took this as a person attack and started ranting at me about how I am trying to boss him around and he is not going to because I am not even reading at the moment. My dad has massive anger issues so I am very much use to being yelled at for things like having a different opinion but I was just so confused at what was happening. I probably should not have but I ended up saying \"did you just wake up this morning and decide to be a twat?\" Which made him angrier and he yelled at me about how I am such an \"arsehole\"\n\nI probably should not have called him a twat but I do not see why I should let someone verbally abuse me for no reason just because they are my parent, especially when the noise they are creating is causing me mental distress", "I CANT EVEN YALL- so I am hiding in my bathroom with the fan on cause my grandfather is eating popcorn like a FREAKING HDJSJEJFJSK- I am so angry I cannot just be around everyone.

But if I can help one person then it is worth posting, such is the pain and suffering caused by miso.\n\nI am going to try to keep this relatively brief and just share the facts.  My life was ruined by misophina - it cost me my marriage and very nearly my career.  Sniffing in particular was my kryptonite, chewing sounds, mouth smacking, even keyboard typing caused me instant, intense anxiety and anger.  The usual stuff.  I had literally given up hope after reading and being told countless times that there is no cure.\n\nAfter years of seeing various doctors, psychiatrists, neurologists, taking anti-depressants etc etc I ran some tests on my gut and discovered I had a bad Candida infection - possibly for about 4-5 years.  I would never heard of Candida before.  I followed nutritionists advice (see 'candida diet') and cleaned up my diet, quit alcohol completely, took probiotics and did whatever I needed to do.  Over a couple of months the misophonia melted away.  The most important thing was quitting refined sugary foods, processed carbs and alcohol.  I noticed a huge difference.  It is been almost 18 months now and I can gladly tolerate any such sound, when I hear them now I smile to myself and thank god.  I used to literally live with earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones in my ears, now I never use avoidance techniques, ever.  \n\nI am not suggesting everyone with misophonia has Candida - it seems I did though, maybe someone else does too and I really feel like I need to talk about it and share my experience.  This approach only involves a healthy diet, probiotics, cleaning up and healing your gut so really what have you got to lose in trying. No medication, no spending money on products or services, just real clean living.  It does take dedication and commitment, you have to cut all that stuff out and stick with it.  I call bullshit. There is no way there is a correlation between a neurological disorder and something wrong with your gut. Maybe one can trick themselves into believing this helps, but this would only be a very extreme placebo. In case this seriously worked for you, good for you. But again, no way that this is something anyone else could use as advice. That is simply too good to be true. I knew I would get non-sensical responses from people like this, but Im sharing this info anyway because it may help people.\n\n\"In case this seriously worked for you, good for you\" &lt;- It did\n\n\"There is no way there is a correlation between a neurological disorder and something wrong with your gut\" &lt;- How can you possibly make a statement like that ?\n\n\"No way that this is something anyone else could use as advice\" &lt;- You are saying that no way my advice of 'eating clean and taking care of your gut' should be taken as advice by anyone ...\n\n\"That is simply too good to be true.\" &lt;- False\n\nMisophonia, the brain, the body are super complex things that you and I know precisely nothing about, so lets not pretend we do.\n\nPerpetuating the notion that misophonia is a life sentence and cant possibly be reversed is really damaging, it destroys peoples sense of hope and it is  not true. The mods of r/misophonia are on some pathetic power trip; the sub is barely about helping people at this point. In order to avoid some controversy allow me to rephrase the title to \"cured my life-ruining misophonia SYMPTOMS\"\n\nOfcourse I do not know what the true underlying cause of misophonia is. Maybe I still have those underlying issues, I really do not know.\n\nWhat I do know, is after working through the Candida treatment - which is not easy, it requires commitment - the symptoms disappeared ... eventually completely. \n\nAnd that is more than good enough for me, my quality of life has been restored and I never believed it to be possible because people kept saying it was impossible.

I have bad misophonia (and visual triggers) about Loud laughter, Cheering and Screaming When I was a child (age 3-9) years, I had severe hyperacusis (Sound sensitivity disorder where everything seemed extremely loud.) I actually still have hyperacusis although wearing earplugs has helped a lot with everyday sounds such as car horns, industrial work, barking dogs etc. Although my sound sensitivity is not as bad anymore, the Misophonia has developed from psychological trauma (not ptsd luckily).\n\nWhen I was at nursery, I was diagnosed with ADHD, Aspergers. In nursery/pre school, I was trapped in a room full of children screaming and shouting, just generally being as loud as they can, it was excruciatingly painful for me. When I could finally talk, My mum took me out of nursery to care for me, I was homeschooled until I was 9, where I joined school for the first time. I actually in the end had a good time at school, although it is still hard to this day (now 15 years old)\n\nThis caused me to develop misophonia about Loud laughter (usually group), Cheering (football crowds, concerts and celebrations) and just generally very loud people screaming. These things I see and hear A LOT on social media, I experience fear, and large amounts of stress when I see these things.\n\nThe worst thing about it is that I also get strong visual triggers from these things (misokinesia?). The things that triggers me most are the Gaping mouths (which reminds me of people being loud, causing pain when younger.) Of people when celebrating and cheering/screaming their heads off with excitement. For example, I cannot stand the FIFA 21 cover where Mbappe on the cover is shown screaming with his mouth wide open, or athletes lifting the cup after winning a game while they all go mad with their cheering. The laughter is the same thing, usually when people start shaking and leaning their heads back/Teeth bared, gaping their mouths, making an absolute racket. For instance search up **\"Zias laughing meme.\"** This is honestly so debilitating for me in my everyday life, restricting many activities I do, I cannot enter busy restaurants in evening, nor can I walk past pubs late at night, I cannot even watch TV adverts in case an ad comes on that triggers me, nor can I watch certain programmes such as most comedies containing canned laughter, love island, Britains got talent etc. My worst thing about it is I cannot go in big meet-ups with my mates or go partying which makes me feel isolated and lonely as nobody understands. At school I experience it all the time too which also makes my life very difficult.\n\nI know people are just enjoying themselves and are doing nothing to hurt me whenever they express themselves in this way, and it saddens me that this sort of joy upsets me, it also upsets and guilts me that I cannot be happy for them, Fr I wish I could be...\n\n**Has anybody else had any therapy for misophonia which has helped them get over their phobias, if so, what sort of therapy and how long will it take.

Also, look away. Straight ahead. Dark glasses in public? Exposure therapy does *not* work for misophonia, but you might try low dose, online glimpses at your triggers while YOU control how much you see AS you hold an ice cube in your hand, listen to sounds that soothe you.\n\nI am going to try microdosing psilocybin as soon as I can find some. It is been shown to have some success with hyperacusis, and miso may be in the same ballpark.

Thank you so much!! I really appreciate you I cannot say I have any advice. .... but reading this, I am relating to it more than you know. The way you describe disliking cheering, screaming, celebrating, etc. along with the visual of the mouths - I thought I was just kind of an asshole my whole life. But no, these things really affect me.

In my mind, the noise was a threat and would interfere with my leisure time at home e.g. playing video games or watching tv/movies. Of course with the current situation with covid restrictions in the UK, I am not able to do other activities outside the apartment.\n\nI am trying to resolve the noise with the restaurant but it is taking time. I am worried that it will not ever get resolved. On the bright side, I was able to accept the appliance noise which is not bothering me as much anymore. My anxiety only seems to get triggered when I hear the restaurant noise. I also feel a lot of anger and pretty much lose all interest in everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not sure if this sounds like misophonia or something else. My doctor just said it was anxiety but I feel like this particular noise is the only thing triggering it. I do tend to get annoyed easily by other people's actions and the extractor fan noise would count as such. My therapist says I have anxiety, which I agree, and that anxiety can be a cause of my recent misophonia. I used to be annoyed by chewing sounds ans such, but just last year over quarantine it all got extremely worse. I can no longer be in the same room with my family during dinner times. It is any human who chews, my dog does not phase me when he chomps on his dog food. I do not get the rage feeling most do, I start to shake and tear up (used to cry, but I worked on keeping it in), I cannot focus on anything, and get overwhelmed by the trigger sound. I just freeze and tense up whenever I hear the sound and if I cannot leave within 5 seconds of hearing it, then my body just wont move until the sound is gone and I have calmed down for 5 minutes. I call those my little \"moments\". I have recently started using earbuds to block out the sounds, but having to wear earbuds whenever you are in your apartment might be uncomfortable. My therapist also reccomended me having a calming sound machine just playing in the background, focusing on breathing slowly, and drinking or sucking on a cool drink/ice cube. Misophonia sucks, and for me, it seems to pop in whenever my life gets really bad (parents split up for a while when I was 9, and now quarantine starting when I was 13). My therapist also recommended to see an audiologist. But, with covid, idk if that is possible where you are at.

The dog did nothing wrong :( It does not really flow imo wow Do not forget \"I want to put you on the dick shaped rocket and shoot it directly into the sun &lt;3\" Lmao hire Bezos and put him in it too Me when I hear dog noises: Neither did the person coughing", "Mother told me that I \u201cjust need to not let it  get to me so much and that I just need to think about them less/differently\u201d This was said to me during an attempt at reinstating family dinners the other night when I had to put in earbuds playing classical music for the sake of my sanity.\n\nAs many of you probably know very, very, well\u2026 this is not how it works.\n\nI have already told my mother I have misophonia, she does not seem to understand or care.\n\nAnyways about an hour later I got her back when she complained about some random minor annoyance about something annoying people tend to do (snoring maybe?) and I told her she needs to stop letting it get to her and just has to think about it differently. \n\nI think she got my point. Try, \"I have a neurological condition called misophonia. Certain sounds activate my brains limbic system, resulting in a fight/flight or physical response.  \n\nI cannot control this response, so I need you to help me find a successful strategy in this situation.\".  \n\nthe top part I learned from a fellow redditor in this sub. anecdotally, there are some strategies that work for family dinner. music is a great one. What I did to make my mother understand what Misophonia is, was sending her a link to the website of the Dutch Misophonia group listing the symptoms and what it does to people. To me it helped a lot. Thanks, I hope this explanation will help. \n\nHopefully I can science my mother into taking me seriously, though if not at least I am moving out (permanently I hope?) next month. I love my mother but this is hardly the only thing she refuses to take me seriously on. I have also told her I am asexual, am an introvert, and believe I have aspergers, and she denies all of it :/ I think my mom just wants to believe I fit her idilic version of \u201cnormal\u201d even though that is not how it works. Kind of like how she wants to do family dinners again so we can look like a \u201cnormal\u201d family.\n\nAlso I believe my misophonia is ptsd related as it really only showed up when the other ptsd symptoms showed up, plus my father who is diagnosed with ptsd was the same way about sounds and even had similar triggers to me. He does not live at my house anymore but he always asked me to turn on the radio during family dinners and always complained about |spoons clanking in bowls, the whispering me and my siblings would do in our room at night, walking too loudly/shuffling, etc.|\n\nAnyways thanks again, even if this is not successful with my dear ol ma, I am sure it will come in handy for new people I meet going into the future. My family said the same thing to me: \"Only you can decide what upsets you.\"\n\nI was too young to know any better. I had to explain to my mom that certain noises are like nails on a chalkboard to me and elicit the same response. I think she understood more after that. I am sorry you have to juggle all of these things right now. That is a lot for one person to take on.  \n\nI am not *your* mother, but I am proud of you for figuring all of these things out about yourself. Nobody is \"normal\". You are a valuable person with much to give this world, exactly as you are. If you have not had a chance to speak with a doctor about any of these conditions, I would work on doing that. It is always helpful to speak with a doctor or therapist during times of big life changes.  \n\nI also have ADHD which is pretty debilitating when unmedicated. Many of us misophones suffer multiple conditions. You are not alone. You will learn strategies that work for you. You will be successful, and you are worthy and deserving of love.  \n\nGood luck with your mom and all of these major changes in your life. My situation is kind of similar, but I do not think my mother is willing to stop chewing loudly as she claims eating is joyless without doing so. I guess I am going to buy a noise-isolating IEM &gt;!(Etymotic Research er2xr, mainly for its -35dB noise isolation for high pitched noises and its sound signature)!&lt; and wear it most of the time at home. I will probably start practicing self-defence in case she tries to forcibly take it away from me.", "Does repetition bother anyone else? I work in a nursing home. I know most patients are hard of hearing. I do not mind repeating myself to them or raising my voice. \n\nHowever, when they speak to each other it usually goes like this (currently happening) \"Did you eat yet?\". (Other patient) \"What?\" \"Did you eat yet\" (Other patient) \"What?\" \"Did you eat yet\" and so on. This can go on for a solid minute until the question is never answered. They start up with the same question 10 minutes later.\n\nI have more sympathy for them because they are older. However, I go home to a 16 year old child who I make sure has my attention before I ask anything. I tell her to put down the phone and look at me. When I ask her a question, she usually sighs or ignores me out of defiance. She has learned that saying \"what?\" triggers frustration and uses it for fun.\n\nAdd a boyfriend who is legally deaf. He has hearing aides but is going to go completely deaf some day. I did not know he had this condition when we met. I usually have to repeat every. single. thing. at least 3 times all day every day to him or shout.\n\nI love my family and tell myself I can do this but find it hard not to completely rage out in frustration. Whenever someone says \"what\" or \"huh?\" I feel like lashing out. \n\nDoes anyone have any coping skills for this? I resort to not speaking at all all day because I feel exhausted by the end of the day. Thanks. Yes, i grew up with my mom who had awful bad hearing and it was so annoying her screaming repetitive things from downstairs. I have a deaf parent and understand how exhausting, frustrating and downright depressing your experience must be.\n\nAt first I tried not speaking as much, or simply walking away calmly as if I had an errand to do.\n\nAt this stage it actually causes migraines so I just use that as the reason to excuse myself and go lie down, usually for the rest of the day as I cannot recover from headaches or migraines until after a proper sleep.\n\nIt is not exactly a good coping technique, but the reality for me is that constantly repeating myself means I am stuck in a mental loop....unable to actually progress as I have to keep thinking about what I just said so as to repeat it. I think long term this could cause serious forgetfulness and in my case a kind of rage due to unresolved frustration.\n\nThe bottom line is you are being disrespected. This may not be on purpose due to deafness or age, however it is disheartening, depressing and draining to think, put thoughts into words, attempt to start a conversation and be derailed every time due to \"wat?\" \"wat?\" \"wat?\" or interruptions breaking throught patterns. \n\nYou are always the one who is expected to do the work, while the other person can just interrupt, argue or ignore and be totally justified due to their hearing or attitude problem. It is unbalanced as the stress of the situation is always carried by you. If you give up, or seek privacy, or attempt to explain how horrible this has been, you end up risking accusation, or argument. Sometimes at my worst I find it akin to a form of abuse... Yet there is no abuser. \n\nMy only advice is to have a private place, room, house or car where you can go, and do not feel you have to explain yourself, just go. Maybe use migraines or something as an excuse... Or be honest that having to repeat yourself has caused mental health issues for you over the years and you have to make changes. \n\nAlso harass your GP constantly over this issue. They are pathetic with this disease and need to do their jobs and prescribe something such as medical thc drink to de-stress, or some kind of counseling to relieve the symptoms of misophonia. You nailed it.\n\n\"You are always the one who is expected to do the work, while the other person can just interrupt, argue or ignore and be totally justified due to their hearing or attitude problem.

UGH YES!!! Repetition INFURIATES me, especially if it is not just the same words, but all the same inflection every time.", "Does anyone else only get affected by family members? Idk about everyone else, but I am mainly only affected by my family members. Sure every once in a while I will encounter a trigger from a stranger or one of my friends, but it does not affect me like my dad or sisters. Can anyone else relate?", "White noise I listen to white noise to block out other sounds all the time. I have an entire playlist dedicated to it. Its very effective at drowning sounds out. But here is the thing. I fucking hate white noise, too. It makes me feel like my head is going to pop. \n\nI have not found a single thing that really helps. Everything is painful. Sometimes I wish I was deaf. I find less and less enjoyment in my life every day because noises are so painful. Its hard to accept that my entire life will be this way. \n\nSometimes when something is very painful to hear I end up hitting myself in the head out of frustration. I dont think about it I just do it. Does anyone else do this? I use the app white noise generator, and it gives you 10 or so soft sounds in nature and you can play a few at the same time. I hate noise so I use noise cancelling airpods or id be crying and screaming Try brown noise. White noise makes me want to throw myself into a volcano. It is way less harsh and actually relaxing. Brown noise is what works for me. I have white noise! Yea, white noise is just another trigger for me. I have been playing cello playlists on youtube (I have a lot of trigger sounds around me due to construction and being home 24/7 bc of Corona ) they tend to work pretty well, I will also sometimes listen to cello/piano  or violin playlists that are covers of current popular songs, the familiarity helps for me. Thanks for the suggestions! This is a bit more technical, but if there is a certain quality of the (insert color)noise that is intolerable, you might have luck getting the 30 day free trial of Ableton live and importing the mp3 directly so you can apply various filters/effects to modify the noise so it is more suitable.  This is very helpful! Thank you For sure! Good luck to ya!", "Misophonia getting worse as I become more aware of it I recently (about a year ago) found out about misophonia. I had a misophonic classmate that explained to me what it was when he noticed that I was really aggravated with sounds/noises at the library. As I took note of this, I became more and more aware of how sounds anger me and induced that fight-or-flight feeling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, this same year, I had an upstairs neighbor that would get up and walk in circles, because her Fitbit told her to (and, mind you, this was an old creaky apartment). It really drove me crazy and to tears; in fact I even put a hole through the wall. I was so angry and upset by how people can be so inconsiderate, even though I have politely asked them to stop so many times! I had even told them how sensitive to noise I am...but I feel like no one really gets it and they brush me off.\n\n  \nFlash forward, I moved into a new apartment. I loved my roommates, but there were also strains in our relationships. The walls were thin in this house, and I shared a wall with one of my roommates who would game and yell a lot! He would also slam our very hollow wooden doors and let the latch slam into the plate. I have also asked him politely to be mindful multiple times...This time around I covered it up as me wanting to sleep early, which was sometimes true. I had to keep reminding him, and at some point I gave up. It upsets me how non-self-aware some people can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am back home living with my dad, and I have to catch myself from lashing out sometimes. A LOT more things seem to trigger me now, including the church bells right behind my home, dad's whistling, bad quality / muffled music, etc. Once it upset me to the point I had to hide and cry in the shower. Now I cannot help but feel like I can only live alone...I feel \"unsafe\" at home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is really strange too, because I am from NYC, and I can handle regular noise of cars and honking, etc. when I am out and about. It is when I am home, these sounds seem to be amplified and all up in my ears. My ears feel like they are getting violated all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all that said, here are some questions:\n\n* Is it possible that sounds have become more triggering to me, because I am more aware of them and my potential misophonia?\n* Does anyone have any advice on how to tell/explain to people close to you? I feel like simply telling them that I am sensitive to noise does not really break through to them, but explaining the disorder in detail seems like it could be overwhelming to take in\n* Do you have any additional advice/recommendations? Have any of you been in similar shoes? It is because of the changes in living conditions. Go for a long and free and wild road trip and see for yourself. Only thing worse than room mates is when you return to nuclear family members to live with. Funny thing is I did do a cross-country roadtrip in between the moves. I do plan on traveling more eventually, and hopefully getting away relieves it a bit Life situation changes make the trigger intensity fluctuate!   \n\n\nMost people experience being less bothered when they enter new relationship, when they move out (of childhood home), when they have a baby, when they are on a road trip and when they are around strangers.   \n\n\nAnd being more bothered when they return to more contact with nuclear family members, when they are around room mates, when they have been in a relationship with someone important for a bit longer than just the beginning. 1. Honestly, when I figured out a few years ago about Misophonia, I found myself taking notice of the sounds more. It is because we are looking to avoid those sounds so our ears attract them. We hear them louder than others, and we hear them more. Try putting headphones on with music when you are at home or just walking around, it can help to a certain point I believe. \n2.  Only one of my friends really gets it. Honestly, I have had to drop many people in my life because of it. You just have to explain it calmly and if they keep going at it then call them out on it. Nothing is wrong with a little bit of public embarrassment sometimes. \n3. 3. I do not wear noise cancelling headphones, but I do use that type with my music. I actually wore them during a movie recently and it was great! Unfortunately like any habit that will just increase the amount of sensitivity you have and make you more likely to wear headphones than not to be wearing them. \n   1.  I hope you get better mate :) This is a hard crappy thing that some people get to deal with. But you will survive. Make friends that will understand. Those are the people you want in your life. :) * Is it possible that sounds have become more triggering to me, because I am more aware of them and my potential misophonia?\n\nI have written about this before, here is some of my thoughts from my comment on another person's Misophonia getting worse after they had gone to therapy for it. \n\n&gt;I think anytime you really focus on your Misophonia it can get worse. I strongly believe that Misophonia has a lot to do with focus; I have gone days where I feel like a normal human being simply because I have been too busy to acknowledge or dwell on any of my triggers, my head is scattered at the best of times. I have seen others post about this happening to them as well. I have pursued this idea further by implementing exercises and meditation into my life that is directed towards controlling what my mind is focused on. I am diagnosed OCD, so this has really helped with that too; I am able to focus on other things in some scenarios where a trigger is present. I am still not perfect, and I still break down a lot, but I feel like I have improved. When I look back at the last year or so, I do not feel the overwhelming despair that I did before, I genuinely see life with Misophonia alright (still hard, but alright) and worth living now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;( is essentially the engine in the brain that I have made it is my life work to exploit and control as a means of fighting my Misophonia. I think this concept can explain how we are able to focus in on a trigger, even in a busy environment like a train.\n\n* Does anyone have any advice on how to tell/explain to people close to you? I feel like simply telling them that I am sensitive to noise does not really break through to them, but explaining the disorder in detail seems like it could be overwhelming to take in\n\nI tell people that I have an auditory processing disorder that makes certain frequencies uncomfortable and sometimes causes physical pain. Something about using words that make people think \"ear problem\" instead of \"brain problem\" makes people more accepting and understanding of the condition. All of my close friends and family have learned it in-depth and know all of the latest research about it, but this is just how I explain it to people for the first time. For most people they have reactions like \"A that is why you do not eat with us\" or \"that is why that noise \"bugs\" you\", where they have moments of clarity about the disorder. Some people are way less open minded and I find myself naturally spending less time with them because they cannot care to understand something that is such a huge part of who I am. Not saying push people away, just saying I personally think it is okay if that happens naturally as a result of someone not being capable of understanding a big part of who you are. \n\n* Do you have any additional advice/recommendations? Have any of you been in similar shoes?\n\nMy recommendation is always meditation. It is helped me a lot to be able to control where my focus is.\n\n* For people who have tried noise-canceling headphones, has this made you more sensitive to noise when you are not wearing them?\n\nI read a post from someone who went to an audiologist and had something really useful explained to them - I am paraphrasing: *When you put headphones on and block everything out your brain adjusts to the lack of noise and when you take them off your brain goes through a shock period where everything is perceived as being louder. This is similar to when you turn the lights on after being in the dark all night and your eyes need time to adjust.* \n\nThat being said, that issue can be controlled IMO. I think if you know when and where to wear headphones, as well as know when and where to remove them, then that is one way you can use headphones as a better coping mechanism. That is, knowing when and where to take them off can help minimize that shock that your brain goes through, and allow it to comfortably adjust back to normal volumes. Wearing headphones at home when you have long periods of not being interrupted is probably okay. Wearing headphones at work where you have to constantly take them on and off is probably not the best if someone feels they are susceptible to their Misophonia getting worse when their triggers are blocked out.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is all just my opinions, I hope some of it helps, but above all I hope you find *something* that helps you. You are right! I think I still have a little adjusting to do. Thank you for the advice :) It is good to hear that most people on here agree that noticing their misophonia can make them more sensitive. It felt like my ears were betraying me the last year. \n\nI guess real friends would take the time to try to understand, so that makes sense!\n\nI am happy that you found a way to cope!! :) I think I will try holding off on the headphones for now to see if I can coach my ears out of the feelings.\n\nThank you! I am grateful to have a lot understanding friends in my life! I hope you do too :) I feel like just living in general is more difficult now than it was when I was still in school. I feel way more sensitive to stuff for some reason, mostly noise, but also other things, like going to the dentist or doctor is way more uncomfortable now. Maybe it just has something to do with getting older and learning more about yourself.\n\nI remember when I was living with my parents I would get so irritated in my bedroom with the muffled sound of the radio from my parents' room that my mom would play every morning and the muffled sound of the TV from downstairs at night. Now I cannot stand hearing my boyfriend listening to TV or videos on his phone in the other room. So I suppose that is always been a trigger for me. I honestly cannot remember any other triggers from home or school when I was younger, but lots of shit triggers me at work now. The Cocktail Party Effect is such an accurate description! It is like that very moment, the only thing I can hear is that sound. The noises are louder than my own thoughts, and I freeze up. \n\nI am going to have to find a way to tell my dad without him looking at me funny, and I think the ear problem would be a good way to start.\n\nYes, yes meditation seems like it would help. I think another thing is I need to stop associating noises with people out to get me (?) I do not know if this makes sense, but whenever I hear a violating noise, it makes me believe these people are trying to attack me\u2014 when really maybe they just do not know. \n\nFor the headphones...that is true; too much of a good thing could be bad. \n\nThank you so much for the detailed advice! This helps a lot :) **I hope these answers could help you.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; Is it possible that sounds have become more triggering to me, because I am more aware of them and my potential misophonia? \n\n**Do you feel more anxiety because you know that it is going to happen?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; Does anyone have any advice on how to tell/explain to people close to you?   \n\n**What do you think about this letter?** (", "Misophonia and Music Survey Hello!

Thank you!", "Is it just me or does just seeing triggers bother me I have had misophonia for 2 years and as it is gotten worse I realized that I could have my headphones on and not hear the trigger sound at all but when I just look at it, it makes me feel mad like when I actually do hear a trigger sound. Does this happen to other people or just me Yes this is very common. A big trigger of mine is my mother\u2019s chewing, so now even when I see her eating it is enough to send me over the edge It is called misokinesia Yes, a lot of us have it. Yes, visuals trigger me as well. I can be in a restaurant and see someone across the room whom I cannot hear at all, but it looks like they are eating loudly, and it triggers me. Also I find that repetitive, rhythmic (silent) motions trigger me, such as swaying feet, etc. I do not know if that is related to misophonia, but I also have OCD, so that could be why I hate/ get distracted by patterned movements. Happens all the time. To me it feels almost like a moment of panicked anticipation of a triggering sound. Like if I see someone put their hand to their mouth to bite their nails but they have not made a sound yet. Sometimes even when i cannot ear it and turn around no to see... I just know the person is still doing it and I get a little paranoid, so I have to move away from the person. I cannot be anywhere near cotton balls because I can*hear* the squeeking. I am glad I am not the only one for me I cannot see people chewing or if someone is fidgeting with their hands it makes me have a misophonia like trigger", "Help?

It is worrying me quite a lot.\n\n\\ Lockdown or not, triggers are more likely to grow than shrink, sorry to say. A year after my partner moved in with me, an old visual trigger\\ came back.

Have not found a way to make it better yet. Sending care your way, hope you find things that work for you (: Yes, it has become so much worse for me.

I 100% understand. Yes it gets worse for me That is why I do not understand how exposure therapy is supposed to work yeah...on both accounts. i am getting worse and my posts have been removed from there. i do not get the rules either and their so rude ab it :/  Same! Both my therapist and psychiatrist say they have seen success in people with exposure therapy. It seems like exposure is what makes it worse as I have just developed more triggers over time and misokinesia. Also the thought of doing exposure therapy terrifies me yeah, for most misophonic people it gets worse, but learning ways to cope earlier on is the key to bring able to tolerate triggers They really are. I messaged the team to ask why my post was removed and they temporarily banned me a month. Ok... surely the point of the sub is for people to discuss their experiences, relate to others, and learn more about this condition? yeah i sent like a long message explaining that my account was only so new because it is like a throw away account and they sent me like a 2 word really hostile response...made me feel like shit. it is not u, it is them Same here! It was already getting gradually worse with time. However, the lockdown made things exponentially worse both with a whole bunch of new triggers I never had before, as well as the intensity of all triggers being much more intense. I think it is because I no longer have the 6-7 hours of blissful quiet of working from home that I had before. It shows how much quiet time is important for this condition. Hey, I am sorry you are going through this. I live with my mother with early dementia and she is constantly chewing on her cheek, clacking her teeth, and talking to the dog. I feel badly because I cannot even be around her without feeling angry. It is absolutely constant with no respite. It is way worse being in lockdown and trying to work from home and just being CONSTANTLY trigged. Added stress and all that. I REALLY HOPE that things will improve as our Covid situation does. As far as I am aware, many mental health professionals are straying away from promoting exposure therapy for this very reason, it is not very helpful for certain things and can make some things worse. I have been getting the last few years, I think because other mental health issues have been getting worse.

I went for a lot of walks because I did not want to be stuck inside with all my triggers. \n\nIt sucks that people do not understand. But it does not need to stop you from being happy - get away when you need to. My heart goes out to you...I remember this exact scenario playing out so many times during my teen years.\n\nI second going for a walk if you can. Those moments when I had to blast music and cry, I wrote down how I was feeling in a journal, no matter how ugly. \n\nIf you have access to a smart phone, I highly recommend downloading a brown noise app, I think it can be a lot more relaxing than music when you need to play something to drown out triggers.\n\nAnd finally, I know this does not really help now, but there will come a time when you will be out of that house and able to control your own living situation as an adult. I have not felt trapped with my triggers at home for years now (I am 30). It will get better!

The only reason I keep living is for my friend. She has an ED and I am one of her best friends helping her through this. So instead of dealing with my problems, I listen to her. That distracts me from my own emptiness and I love helping her. Her birthday is coming up and I am going to visit her tomorrow. I had bought and made  a lot of gifts, but I still wanted to give her some flowers too. Who does not love flowers? \n\nI go to ask my mom for some money ( I do not really have an allowance) and she just flips off. She tells me that I am doing wayy to much for her and that I am not even studying and that I am so lazy, bla bla bla\u2026 you understand it. But she is talking (borderline screaming lmao) with so much saliva and I told her to please swallow. You know what she did? She started playing with the spit in her mouth to trigger me. \n\nI-I have no words\u2026how can someone be this immature and unsupportive? Why purposely trigger me??? She knows how difficult it is for me and I already have told her that people at school purposely trigger me too, and yet she still does it? I cannot handle this anymore, I am so done Mother\u2019s a jackass. If she knows it torture then she is inhumane. If she keeps this up, tell someone who is trusted. But I would ask an adult if I were you. If you have a therapist or psychiatrist. Tell them what your mother is doing. Yikes, parents are typically the most triggering and having it used against you is the worst. Know you are not alone &lt;3 I cannot trust anyone, no one takes this seriously. I do not have any support. And unfortunately I also do not go to therapy Im not sure what to do \ud83d\ude26 Me neither haha, thank you so much for your advice and support tho! At least I can come to you all Ever need help ANY time just message me. The sounds that bother you are the exact ones that bother me. I have had mesophonia for 8 years  Thank you so much, and for the award too! I really appreciate it. And wow for 8 years?? I have only had it for 2 but it already feels like an eternity. Thank you so much for your support, I wish people IRL were like this. You can always text me too if you need ANYTHING Thanks( \u00b4\u2200\uff40) it is difficult to not get support from the people who are supposed to be your guardians and supporters. Totally. My mom does the same thing, it is still frustrating 20 years later! Wow, they really be saying \u201cI WouLD Do EveRYthiNg fOR My ChiLd\u201d yet they cannot even respect basic boundaries, like not bullying your child lmao I cringed just thinking about someone doing that to me. She did it to me as well. We had an argument and she forced me to listen to her phone call with a friend who is voice I find really annoying Yeah, I have developed tics now. When I read something similar or my head for some reason decides to repeat the sound, I get tics Oh my goodness, that is relentless. I would have stormed out immediately. I really do not hold back my reactions when something like this happens. Because I know she started the disrespect. And it is not even disrespectful lol, it is literally torture for you. I am sorry you are dealing with that \u2661 I was in a car so I counted walk out :(. One of these days I will jump out the car door Wow\u2026I am so sorry. What the hell?? Why do our own mothers like to torture us?? I hope you are feeling better", "I am being treated like an inconvenience. Hello, I (14M) have crippling misophonia (as do most on this sub). My main triggers are chewing, guitar, and this iPad app my brother has. for this story, the guitar trigger rears its ugly head. So, I start running a big 3d print (extremely important). The cardinal rule of 3d printing is watch the first 2 layers, or else the print will fail. While that happens my dad and little brother (51 and 10 respectively) start on the acoustic guitars. Instantly, I tell my little brother to stop or quiet down. FYI I cannot tell my dad to stop because he will have my head on a pike. They obviously did not take it well and my dad told me these exact words, \"Hey, your 3d Printer drives me crazy, I am going to play guitar to cover it up.\" He did not say that from a place of truth, he said it mockingly and callously. Like when someone tells you a joke when they are angry. Also, my old printer sounded like a fax machine, so I could sort of understand what he was saying if he was talking about that one that my friend has now. But my current one sounds borderline silent, the only thing you hear on it is the fan and slight whirring. He is basically saying he has a problem with all fans, but targeted one of my hobbies in a mocking manner to make a point. and it made me sick. I proceeded to lose my fucking mind in the bathroom. Once I emerged from the shitter, I went back to check on the print. It failed. When I went to calibrate and troubleshoot, they started back up again. I once again, told them to stop, quiet down, or move somewhere else. My dad yelled at me and told me I cannot control my brother and that he will not walk on eggshells around me. My dad went to the bathroom and in a fit of sobbing and rage I somehow managed to utter the words \"Please.....stop................Please, man......stop\" It is times like this that make me feel like both an inconvenience and a controlling asshole. I feel like I am walking on eggshells to not have my parents scold me for having this. Between my other, severely Autistic brother chewing his food like a goddamn horse, and the other one playing guitar, I try to tell the player to stop (the chewer will not understand, too many syllables), and he listens, it is the parents getting mad on his behalf and telling him to almost negate this problem that I am extremely depressed about.\n\nI went up to take a shower, but the chewer was having his teeth brushed. I went to the player's room where my mom was laying with him (standard procedure for him or else he cannot sleep). She wanted to show me a facebook post she saw and asked why I was moping during my response. I told her what happened. She was pretty sympathetic at first. She was telling me that he does not and will never understand what I am going through. But then the conversation took a turn. She then went into saying that I am fighting a losing battle and will become a hermit if I \"let it affect me so much\". Straight Bullshit. She denied the inconvenience part, but still held up the belief that I am controlling and I am trying to control people. She said that she never saw the player with a guitar in his hands without me yelling at him to stop. This is partly true. Whenever there is not an important practice or a 1 on 1 lesson, I pretty much tell him to stop and only yell if it gets too bad. I went back into a fit of crying and tried to tell her my perspective. I told her how it felt and how I tell him this to preserve my own sanity. She also upheld my dad's point saying that I was targeting one of his hobbies, but that is insane. I was telling them that they could move somewhere else and they proceeded to tear me down to make a point about me being an asshole. I cannot post this to r/AmItheAsshole because my account will get perma-suspended, but I want to know who was in the right here, and who was justified in their reasonings. I just want to feel less shitty about this whole thing and hopefully get it through to my dad that I am in hell every day and he should at least make an effort to accommodate my issues and be more understanding. I am just done with this bullshit that is misophonia. I hear ya. It is really a tough problem to deal with. It is even a daily struggle. So, you are definitely not alone, trust me. I am a 28 year old male with a full time job (thankfully I am working remote because being in an office was a night mare at times) and I still get frustrated regularly and go to isolate myself in my room when things get on my nerves. \n\nIn my experience, the big breakthrough was finding out my struggle was actually a medically-proven condition. I will never forget when my parents called my twin brother and I into the living room (we both have misophonia) and my parents, who were watching CBS Sunday Morning, said, \u201cThere is actually a name for what you guys have been complaining about all these years.\u201d It was the first time I knew I had an actual condition, too, and that I was not just crazy or an asshole for hating certain sounds. From then on, my parents were much more understanding (although they still have bouts of frustration with us). I was also much more upfront with my friends and eventually even my coworkers because I knew I was not full of shit. Sure, I got some weird looks or confusion, but in general people have been pretty understanding. \n\nSo, my recommendation would be to show your family a medical website explaining your condition to let them know it is legit and that you are not just making it up (if they are not aware it is a mental health condition already). But, from then on, I think it is important to understand that it is going to be an uphill struggle, constantly. Because once you move out of your house, it will be your roommates who bug you, then it will be your coworkers, and so on. I do not say this to discourage you, but to get you mentally prepared for what is ahead. Because you can do it. It just takes practice, coping techniques, and a willingness to communicate. \n\nIn a perfect world, misophonia would be treated on par with depression and other mental health conditions. Because it can have serious effects on mental health, as you know (I have had bouts of depression and severe anxiety and agitation and isolation because of it). But that is probably a long way off. So you really have to advocate for yourself. Be willing to communicate your issues, even if you are family and friends respond negatively. You are in the right. Never forget that. However, IMO, it is important not to be condescending about it when you tell people. For me, the best practice is to come from a place of sensitivity, and to let them know that their actions affect you but not to make it sound like an accusation or that they are actively trying to hurt you. They just live life in a different way then us. The things that bother us do not even remotely bother them. So it will be tough to convince them to see the world the way you do. But I always try my best to get them to respect the way I see and hear the world, despite the gap in understanding. \n\nThe thing is, a lot of people really are not willing to change their habits to accommodate our condition. It is an incredibly frustrating realization, but it is what it is. So, for me, it is really come down to coping techniques. None of them are perfect, but I have found that they take the edge off just enough to get by. A few suggestions include:\n\n1) Get a loud fan and put it in your room. When you get bothered, go to your room, and turn it on full blast to dull the sounds outside. It will not drown everything out, but it can help. \n\n2) Get noise canceling headphones. Even the kind that construction workers and airplane traffic controllers use. \n\n3) Download an atmospheric noise app, like Calm. I cannot tell you how many times pulling up that app when I am triggered has helped calm me down. There is a bunch of really great white noise type atmospheres (like rivers, lakes, waterfalls) that help drown out the noise.\n\nAll combined, that should help alleviate some of the noises you are dealing with (hopefully). At the end of the day, it is something that you are going to have to deal with on a daily basis. But the more you come to terms with it and advocate for yourself and find ways to cope, the better off you will be IMO.\n\nHope this helps! The other poster gave you amazing advice - you are not alone!\n \nI also get triggered by guitar playing! I did not always and all my other \u201csounds\u201d are the usual eating/breathing related ones. I also play guitar and when I play, it is not an issue. But the second I hear someone else, I am fighting or flighting. I cannot fucking STAND when someone plays electric unplugged so they strum really hard to make it louder. \n\nSorry you are struggling. It truly truly sucks. But you are not alone. Love this reply \ud83d\udc9c First off, you are definitely NTA. You *have* a problem, but you are *not* a problem. Remember that. You are not doing anything wrong, and the fact that you end up kind of lashing out is a result of a lack of help and understanding on your parents' part.\n\nI do not have misophina, but my daughter does, so we are learning as we go. One thing I have sensed reading posts here is that when people are asked/told not to make sounds, they get defensive, and that is hard to deal with, but also not something you can control. \n\nAs someone suggested, try showing them some information. Here is a site called ( and here is the page on ( Here is a ( \n\nMy daughter's not triggered by guitars, but by eating sounds. One thing she is done to help herself is listen to brown noise through her (noise-canceling) headphones. She says brown noise works better than white noise to drown out the sounds. There is a spectrum of noises, so maybe you can experiment to find which one(s) works for you.\n\nYou are going to have to advocate for yourself, and I know that is hard when your parents are not solidly behind you. But start with them, and show them the information. I would also suggest you talk to another adult -- a relative, a teacher, a school nurse or counselor, your doctor, maybe even someone at your church if you attend one. Keep talking until someone listens and will hopefully support you. Maybe they can speak to your parents with you; unfortunately sometimes adults will take other adults seriously where they will not with a teenager or child.\n\nMisophonia seems to be tied to anxiety and stress -- do you have an anxiety disorder, or something like ADHD? I ask because if so, you might be able to get a diagnosis for that, and your parents might take that more seriously. Help on those issues might help with misophonia.\n\nThere is help out there, and I wish it was easier for you to get.\n\nGood luck.", "Making progress? So the past two weeks have been the worst, hardest days of my life. I cannot really be with people anymore. Even my boyfriend comforting me was too much. I had a breakdown, all I could think was, how could this get any worse? Id never kill myself but I found myself thinking about it multiple times a day for  these past two weeks. My boyfriend called the hospital and tried to find me help and they actually said they think they can help. But here is the catch, they do not work with insurance. It is $200 to get diagnosed/evaluated. Then like $450 a semester for therapy. I was so fucking upset. We are so poor, we live off my boyfriend's disability and neither of us work because of mental health issues. I do not want to pay $200 to be told 'oh yep, you have misophonia' like fuck. \n\n  I started calling around, probably like 8 places and no one even heard of misophonia. My last call I actually got someone who at least heard of it and I made an appointment on the 28th. They work with insurance so worst case scenario if it does not work, I do not have to pay a million dollars for nothing.  Wish me luck. You are doing a good thing by trying to find a professional to help you. Do not give up on that search just yet. It helps to talk to someone about mental health issues in general, even if they are a result of Misophonia.  \n\nTake my experience with a grain of salt, but I want to share it with you. I live in Canada, so I have had the luxury of trying some things out without paying for them. The first thing I found was that I got lumped into groups of people with general anxiety disorders and/or depression among other things. Unless you are in an area with a Misophonia specialist, you are likely going to be treated by someone who has no experience treating someone with Misophonia. In my case I was diagnosed and treated for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. One of the things that they tried out was exposure therapy - that was awful and I think it made my Misophonia much worse for many years of my life. I was also prescribed a number of SSRI's which I think made my life a little dull. Ultimately I strayed away from professional help because it felt like I was just getting worse. \n\nThat was something like 6 years ago, so I am not really sure if any of that is changed. Maybe treatment options are different in other countries, but I am not really in a position to say. \n\nI ended up treating my Misophonia with a better lifestyle in general. I started drinking more water, eating better, getting more sleep, and getting more exercise. I do not know what it is about that combo, but it seriously helped me. My Misophonia is not gone, but I think I deal with it a lot better. Most importantly, I have a positive outlook on life. I do not want to die to escape my triggers and I have an easier time forgetting about them after the sound stops. \n\nI also got into meditation to help control my emotions surrounding Misophonia. I do not meditate as often nowadays, but I feel that the skills I taught myself by just being mindful of my emotions help me not get so worked up. Do not take it just from me though, ( In my very unprofessional personal opinion, I think meditation can help you control the \"Cocktail Party Effect\" in the brain. Sometimes, I feel like I can force my brain to disregard trigger sounds as background noise. But, that is probably a topic for another day. \n\nNow the last thing I will share is about my environment. Try to find little quiet spots to hang out in during the day. Life cannot be quiet all the time, but you can find little spots to keep yourself sane. I used to hangout in the stock-room at my old job instead of at my desk. Just going outside and seeing the sun can do wonders for your emotional state too. \n\nIf this professional gives you some treatment to try, go for it. But, you might want to consider having a active and healthy lifestyle too. My thoughts are: if Misophonia is hitting you that hard, hit it back with everything you can.  \n\nOkay one more thing: If your boyfriend understands your situation even a little bit, do not push him away. Those people are hard to come by. A good partner who understands this sort of thing can actually make Misophonia a lot more comforting, in my opinion. \n\nWhatever you do, I hope things get better.  I do not mean to recommend anything necessarily, just advise you of some options that you might not know about. You should do what you are comfortable with and do more research beyond what I ramble about.\n\nAgain, hope it turns out okay for you. We are actually going to the gym daily now, eating better too. I do not really have high hopes for my appointment but I am willing to try anything at this point. Thank you for sharing your story with me, it gave me hope \u2764\ufe0f Good Luck \u2764\ufe0f", "Propranolol For the past 5 years I have been plagued with misophonia. I have screwed up many interviews because of it- lost a job because of it- been looked at like a weirdo- girls would not date me- and been generally ruined because of it.\n\nEvery time I would hear a sniffing noise among other verbal triggers I would twitch. It would get worse the more I would hear the triggers and the more I would twitch the more people would sniff and say the verbal triggers that trigger me. \n\nI was concerned for my future and thought I would never progress in life... That was until I found propranolol.\n\nI heard about propranolol on Reddit. And it seemed to fit my problem.\n\nNow ever since I have been taking propranolol - as needed- not all the time like an SSRI or neuroleptic- I rarely twitch. \n\nI was so happy about the propranolol that I have over a years worth supply now- it is that effective.\n\n\nPropranolol is a beta blocker- blocking the beta adrenergic receptors.\nEssentially propranolol blocks the fight and flight response. If you get scared you do not have the body reaction to adrenaline. You just feel relaxed. You do not feel the flighty scared anxious feeling in your body- you just feel relaxed and calm.\n\nIn times when I would normally be twitching a lot I do not twitch or feel nervous. I would say I twitch now maybe 1/25 times the amount I normally would.\n\nPropranolol is a heart medication for high blood pressure, but is used off label for anxiety, and tremors. It is actually a performance drug used by standup comedians, performers, and musicians.\n\nThere are websites online that have doctors that can diagnose you.\n\nIt is kind of weird how well it works. I thought I was hopeless and was considering getting a neuroleptic as these are often prescribed for Tourette\u2019s... But I do not want something to take all the time- just something as needed during social situations. And propranolol is perfect for me.\n\nIf you have questions you can PM me... Does it work when you do not twitch? I am not sure I understand... Would you explain I do not twitch I just escape or plug my ears. Do you still hear the trigger sounds? Do they still bother you? I hear the trigger sounds but they do not bother me anymore. I hear them all the time but I do not get the anxious tense nervous feeling- (which results in a twitching head/body normally for me) I just feel like a \u201cnormal person\u201d when I hear the sounds on propranolol. i get the twitches a lot too. i want to try this but ive just been so apprehensive towards medications lately. but this sounds amazing and ill definitely look into it, thank you so much for posting your experience, op Ughhh I wish it worked this well on me. It works, but only in that it takes the edge off. Maybe clonidine... Thanks for posting this I have a prescription but I have not been taking it regularly I will have to take it later in the day and see what happens. I just take it before social interactions- 20mg for 4 hours of social interaction for me... Might work for you... did for me... plus it is not an everyday medication- just as needed before interaction... medication is stigmatized, I felt the same way... I thought I was going to need Thorazine or something... now that I have the propranolol I am a different person- in a good way.. no more weird twitching that draws attention- I love it Ohh I will look into it! I take propranolol daily for another medical condition, and have noticed 0 change in misophonia symptoms since before starting vs. shortly after starting vs. now. Just a reminder to folks reading and considering trying that YMMV. That is funny because it is prescribed for tremors  It may be because my beta adrenergic response is strong which causes my misophonia where a different mechanism is causing yours. All I know it that it works wonders on me. are there any psychological side effects, and does it make your fight/flight response worse when you dont take it? It makes you a little bit tired, not really... I would say after it wears off the fight and flight is increased a bit for 3 hours\nBut I just keep dosing until I know the social situation will end. It kind of relaxes me in general knowing I have something that helps instead of feeling stranded as well.. there is research that shows propranolol helps get rid of painful stressful memories \n\nIt is used to treat ptsd Ok thx(:", "Extra extra sensitive to noises right in the morning? Is anybody else super sensitive after waking up? Once I was half asleep, not even up properly and heard a noise and almost had a panic attack??? \n\nIt is like mornings are the most difficult time of the day somehow, every damn thing gets on my nerves. Even sounds that are not triggers make me lose my mind. Like literally just seeing a family member or them talking to me or to each other. I thought it is because I am grumpy in the morning or something but it is absolutely not the case. Maybe I am just waiting for them to trigger me?\n\nI do not know if this is because everyone is up and about and making lots of noises and the brain knows it is the start of an another same old day. Or it is because the senses are actually extra sensitive after waking up. But my misophonia is at the worst right in the morning. \n\nIt is just really exhausting having such a stressful start to the day. I feel my blood pressure and heart rate shoot up. I feel numb and the brain is unable to focus on getting any work done. I am basically shaking and unable to calm down with anything whatsoever. I end up crying every single morning. Ughhhh I do not know what to do :( I am DEFINITELY far more sensitive to triggers early in the morning. It feels like a sensory overload. The clanking of utensils during breakfast prep, conversation and even the smells of food cooking has me so irritated. It is a lot. I am much better after I have a strong coffee OMG the smells of food cooking! And conversations totally yes. You have perfectly described everything I go through every morning. And SAME I am usually much better after I get my coffee. Thank you so much for replying, kind of relieving to know I am not alone. \nYou are right, sensory overload is the right term. My husband tried playing podcasts or music first thing in the morning recently and I was like \"mate......just..... absolutely not.\" I have made it pretty clear that I need low stimuli in the mornings and it helps.\n\nThis subreddit is so comforting in a way, like we have this affliction and it is shit but the symptoms are often so relatable. Best of luck! It is amazing you have made it clear to him...I am so happy for you!\n\nI know right, this sub is such a blessing. Thank you again\u2665\ufe0f Yep. I have taken to waking up stupidly early so that I can be the only one awake while I eat breakfast and then put my headphones in until I feel less sensitive to noises. Damn that is a great idea! But I am sorry you have to go to that extent. I think I am going to try that too, anything to maintain sanity haha. This is so me you are not alone Yes, i also have no idea how people can listen to loud shit in the morning it drives me insane For me it is because I sleep with my sister in one room. She already has made numerous sounds in the past like nail biting, eating something crunchy at 7am in the weekends?! So I am constantly on edge if I am half awake and she is completely awake. It is so irritating I cannot even relax in my own room. You wake up so angry and anxious, it is horrible. Luckily I am a deep sleeper so I do not always hear it. Ow yeah and she also snores sometimes, wohoow \n\nYou are not alone, I am sorry that you have to go through this. It is like being tortured without having done anything. The one thing that is keeping me sane is this subreddit 100% me. Every trigger I have is always something to do with the morning, except eating, and me being extra irritable in the morning pushes more and more sounds into the trigger category RIP", "How do you guys cope with parents who do not care about the fact that you have misophonia? (Possible trigger warning for anyone who experiences these triggers, also trigger warning for mentioning suicidal thoughts.) \n\nPost was removed from r/misophonia for mentioning suicidal thoughts, so I came here. \n\nBasically I do not have the \u201cregular\u201d misophonia. Mouth noises and the like still bother me, but my main triggers are certain animal noises as well as babies. Dog barking being the worst, crying babies being the second. Meowing, certain birds chirping, and a slew of other things bother me too. \n\nAnyway, I have been telling my mom for years how these sounds affect me and that I cannot be around them at all. She seems as though she understands, but then she goes and does something that entirely contradicts that point. (Example: Brings home a puppy the day after I tell her barking bothers me the most and can make me completely shut down mentally). Then she blames it on \u201cit is Satan he has a hold on you you have to keep praying or else this will never end\u201d. Guess what, I have tried praying countless times for this torture to end, but God does not answer me. So her tactic does not work. I am not here to debate Christianity, but apparently people have been praying for me for years now and I myself have prayed but it does not change anything. \n\nThe \u201ctherapists\u201d here are useless, I stopped booking appointments with them long ago because it felt as if I were talking to a wall and not someone who was actually trying to understand. There was no progress being made. \n\nI had to move out of my parents house because they kept getting more dogs and cats despite me telling them COUNTLESS upon COUNTLESS times how the noise those animals make bothers me. Hearing a trigger that bad makes me suicidal and prone to self harm, also can lead to intense panic attacks. I think they assume I am just being over dramatic and am trying to control them. I have attempted suicide a couple times because of my triggers, when my mom found out she handed me a bible and was really scared. \n\nI managed to move to a quiet home, but now my mom brings her dog here once in awhile and my sister brings her kitten who meows very loudly when it is not given attention 24/7. So now I am just laying in my room trying to drown out the noise. What they do is they bring a pet over, ditch it inside the house with me, then they all go outside or straight up leave and let the pet sit here and make noise and just expect me to look after it or something? I have absolutely no understanding of their thought process. Her and my dad are scared that I am going to kill my self, but whenever I tell them that it is the noise triggers that are making me this way they brush it off. \u201cOh, barking gives you panic attacks and makes you suicidal? That sucks. Omg. Anyway, want to come over to our house where we have multiple rowdy noisy dogs?\u201d \n\nI texted my mom just now and asked her if she could take her kitten home because no one is watching it anyway and all it is doing is sitting there meowing loudly. She just replied with \u201comg\u201d and that is it. Like she is angry with me. She thinks I am being emotionally abusive whenever I tell her these things, then she ignores me. \n\nSo. People with parents who do not care. Do you just have to come to some sort of mutual understanding with eachother? Do you stop discussing the hearing problem with your parents entirely because it does not lead anywhere? Is there any hope of having anyone even trying to somewhat understand? I have been trying to tell them for 5 years straight now and they still do not get it. They still put me in positions where they know I will be triggered. Misophonia has also ruined my past relationships with boyfriends, so I do not even try to date anyone anymore. They all think I am crazy. \n\nIs there any hope at all? There is hope. I am very lucky to have met my partner who is so understanding and respectful of my misophonia, which is still so unfamiliar to me\n\nMy parents are not quite so bad as yours at not recognising my misophonia, but often guilt trip me/etc when the topic comes up. They think I can just breathe or practice and it will go away easily, and often say \"You need to fix it, you will have sooo many problems later on in life\" as if I am opting in for this disorder.\n\nBut, try your best to set some boundaries. I leave rooms/etc with random excuses (need the bathroom, I forgot something, I need to call someone, I am busy etc ) to escape my triggers because it is easier then saying a trigger is bothering me. At least, you are not living with your family currently, which gives you a lot of mental room. l\n\nAlso, maybe have a deep think about why your suicidal, sometimes there is things deeper than your misophonia that is contributing to it. I found that I have incredibly harmful and negative self talk and narratives about myself, and have these \"stories\" I run through everytime a bad trigger occurs. It took me a while to build some resistance to these thoughts, but I still have very bad bouts of them every now and then, that spiral me into strong panic attacks and mild depression for a while. \n\nMaybe for your parents, just do not let them come with pets, and be strong about it. Maybe pretend you are suddenly allergic if they absolute refuse to respect your boundaries. Families are difficult and often forget over time that family members deserve the same respect we offer to strangers, and that our comfort with eachother doesnt mean we can do what we like. \n\nI apologise if my advice is not very applicable, but it is all I can offer other than sympathy and understanding. \n\nBut please do not give up, I promise it gets better. I find it is very much up and down with misophonia, it never becomes less of a problem, but slowly you learn coping mechanisms faster for each trigger. Thank goodness I found posts like this, I suffer from Misophonia, my biggest triggers are also Dogs Barking and Babies Crying, my parents have been trying to figure out how to fix it, but nothing has worked, and my triggers have been getting much worse over time, so I have to have headphones with me anytime I have to leave the house, although I actually love Cats, I hope you will not mind with this.\nNow my parents are thinking that I purposely made those 2 sounds my triggers and they keep telling me that I need to stop it, they also keep asking me when do I think I will get over it, I keep replying \u201cI do not know.\u201d since there is not anything else to say. yes that is pretty much exactly what I am going through as well. My triggers have gotten worse. I also bring headphones with me if I know there will be a possible trigger. When very noise kids come over, I lock myself in my room with my headphones blasting. My aunt came over with her newborn a few weeks ago and it cried/screamed the entire time. It was extremely triggering. I did not come out of my room the entire time they were here. My family might think I am rude for not visiting, but I do not care anymore. \n\nI do not mind cats, I just do not like the meowing. Kittens meow a ton, and it is really high pitches and drawn out, so I do not want to be around them. Adult cats meow still, but there are a lot of quiet cats that I can tolerate. I have met far more quiet cats than quiet dogs, which is why I avoid anywhere with dogs entirely. They always bark no matter what. \n\nI wish there was an answer. We do not deserve to suffer from this. It is even harder trying to explain it to people without them thinking you are weird/crazy. Last Year, I went to see someone about how to try to fix it, some of her solutions were to just try to breathe deeply when hearing a trigger, it was very hard to do, then she gave me an app called EASe that was supposed to have therapy music to try are train the brain, but that did not work either since I could not get myself to listen to it since it was not my music type.\nI hope a cure gets made one day because hearing my triggers makes it near impossible for me to function like a normal human being. That is too bad :( I have tried therapy too, but they did not understand what I was talking about. I went to an audiologist and she recommended that I listen to my trigger sounds on a speaker, so lowly turning up the volume over time until I get used to them again. I cannot bring myself to do it though. \n\nI asked another audiologist about what I should do, and her answer was literally just \u201cplay with some puppies if barking bothers you.\u201d That was her \u201cexpert\u201d advice. Ugh. \n\nPerhaps someday there will be a cure. Do you have any outlets or hobbies in which you can vent your emotions? I oftentimes find that I need to vent my frustrations in a non-destructive way. I play multiple musical instruments (ukelele, guitar, piano, mandolin, harmonica, etc.) Playing these can sometimes calm me down and can be a form of escapism. Unless I am very distressed and having a panic attack from a trigger, at that point I basically just hide somewhere and have a breakdown. \n\nIt is good to have something though that acts as an outlet. Another problem is sometimes I try to watch some YouTube videos, I find some channels that might look interesting, but in some videos their dog barks in the background, I always put a comment on the videos to edit the Barking out but they usually ignore me, so then I have to watch with the sound off and I will not even know what they are saying, I think it is very unprofessional leaving that noise in the video. Yes! This happens so often. It never used to bother me awhile back, but now barking bothers me in videos and on tv shows. I have a tv show I used to like watching but now I have to turn it down since in a lot of scenes there is barking in the background whenever the characters are outside in the neighbourhood. Sucks because like you said, I cannot hear what they are saying when the volume is so low. \n\nYouTube videos can be especially bad for this. So often I go to watch a tutorial, or even just a random vid, and there is a dog or multiple dogs barking in the back. I normally click off right away. I hate how I used to be able to tolerate it and now I cannot at all. Even when my family watches movies I get panicky, since in all the films they watch there is always barking. My parents watch movies at full volume too so it does not help. \n\nSomebody absolutely needs to find a cure for this because it is so godamn sickening. I cannot live life normally AT ALL anymore like I used to, all due to this stupid ass disorder. I have been depressed for years because I feel hopeless. I am not sure how badly it affects your life, but l my entire life evolves around this misophonia bullshit and I have no freedom. Feel like a ticking time bomb that is about to explode from utter frustration and stress. If I am unable to escape the trigger, then I get more stressed, for example: If I get on any kind of public transport (Train, Tram, Bus or Plane.) And someone brings a crying baby on, it always makes me wish that the people with the baby will get off at the next stop but they usually stay on there, and if I have to go to anyone\u2019s house that has a dog I have to be wearing headphones blasting music, but my parents think that blasting music would hurt my ears and always ask me to turn it down, which I refuse since if I turn the volume down it makes it more likely to hear my triggers.\nAnd last year I went on a holiday with some other people for a week, I was excited for the holiday, but unfortunately when I arrived, I found out that one of the families staying at the park we were staying at has a little yappy dog, I was wishing that the family would go home the next day, but they stayed all week as well, it makes me very impatient to get away from the noise. I do not even get why Dogs and Babies are never put on the noise ordinance list, Barking and Crying are just terrible noise, being stuck on an airplane with a crying baby, why is this even allowed? It is why I cannot travel anymore... too many dogs and children everywhere. I know that kids cry, it is what they do, but if your child is being fussy then why take it on some huge vacation?!? Babies are under a lot of stress when traveling, I have no idea why parents do it with young kids. \n\nAs for the dogs they are literally everywhere. Even just going to the store there can be dogs in vehicles parked outside of said store, all barking at me. Dogs are basically inescapable no matter where you go, since their owners think it is acceptable to drag them absolutely everywhere. Not all dogs are barking shit heads, but if I see a dog there is about a 95% chance that it will go into a barking rage as soon as I come within 10 metres of it. It is so irritating. Within the last year or two, on the local radio station where I am, there is an advert that comes on that has a man talking with a very annoying voice, that ad then became a trigger for me, every time it comes on I would always turn the radio off, why must they have annoying ads like that on?", "coping with misophonia at uni? TW for mouth noises/chewing!\n\nI started uni two days ago, and I have just moved in with a few flatmates. I have been trying to keep positive about the idea and not let my misophonia debilitate me.\n\nUnfortunately\u2026 one of my flatmates is already a really loud chewer. I ended up just immediately leaving the room because she was chewing a banana with her mouth wide open, smacking it around and making it sound so slimy and vile. I do not know the other one eats and there is two more people moving in later.\n\nI am terrified about explaining my misophonia to them, as we barely know one another, and I am already worried I seem like an ass.\n\nI use noise cancelling earphones (AirPod pros) all of the time as I am at the point where I get triggered by everything, and I panic whenever I have not got the comfort of earphones. However they only seem to work with everyday noises and do not block out chewing or slurping whatsoever, and when I am triggered, I am not just slightly uncomfortable, I end up wanting to get very violent with the person performing said trigger even if they are the nicest person I have ever met, and I occasionally end up hitting my head and crying for hours after I leave the situation.\n\nI am terrified and I do not think I will be able to handle the next year. I am already considering dropping out over my fear and triggers. Has anyone else gone through the same? One thing I loved about virtual classes was how I was not forced to listen to people making disgusting chewing sounds, smacking their lips etc. The transition back is not as bad as I imagined, and my classes got progressively smaller and easier to handle as opposed to the giant auditoriums of students having breakfast and coughing/sniffing right in my fucking ears. Needless to say, I can 100% understand wondering how to endure uni, let alone a semester. \nI never lived on campus either so I do not know how you are doing it rn, dealing with the habits of strangers/acquaintances in a residency. \nIf it helps, I religiously use deep brown noise to drown out a good chunk of sound, I suggest trying it out although it is not as fun as music, it has helped me cope many times. Whole lot better than white noise. I go balls deep and do 12 hours:\n\n I can relate. I even get stressed when a headphone falls out in case I hear a trigger in the meantime! \n\nI also have found that the masking noises I use eventually become annoying in themselves. It is tough is not it \ud83d\udc4d Have you found that the masking becomes annoying too after repeated use? My brain is constantly looking for triggers and annoyances. Not really, though I understand finding other sounds to focus on. This year I especially hate the \u201cpuh\u201d sounds when people whisper in their convos, it is as if they are spitting and it makes me want to fight lmao I started using a customizable white noise app on my phone and it is able to layer with other audio sources so if I get bored of hearing *just* my constant background sound I often also play music at the same time. I did not see the point of using a dedicated app at first rather than youtube or tracks loaded onto my ipod or music player app but it turns out to have several advantages (to me) :) a customisable white noise app sounds fantastic, I have played around with background noises before but they are usually only good to sleep with since they are like campfires/ocean waves and it can be really distracting. which one did you download? :0 thank you for the link!!! I will definitely try and make some use of it if I am stuck around flatmates who are eating. I have been looking around for some playlists that are just straight up white/brown noise. hopefully uni will not absolutely destroy me haha, pretending that miso does not exist is exhausting. I also have a small class of people so hopefully there will not be too many triggers in lectures. It really is a vicious cycle!! especially when you know that your triggers eventually get worse with age :( First off, I hope you have had a chance to calm down since writing this. i felt bad because you were obviously upset.\n\nThis would be a good thing to do in general. If you are going to have multiple people living in a house, it is important to have communication.\n\n(Also, FWIW, what your roommate did with the banana is just awful manners. I knew a guy in college who ate like that, and I honest to god could not eat with him, and I do not even have misophonia. It is just gross. So you are not having an unusual reaction there.)\n\nExplain that this is a condition you have. Point them to information about it. Emphasize this is not a complaint, this is a mental health issue, and you are working on ways to deal with it. I often find if you can provide information, and examples of steps you are taking or have taken to deal with an issue, people are more understanding and receptive. It is not a guarantee, of course, but it might help.\n\nYou could tell them if you leave the room when someone is eating, it is not that you are antisocial, it is that you cannot take the sounds. Do not make it personal -- I think (just my thinking, not any kind of theory) that often people take this kind of thing personally even if they should not, because it is easier for them that way. \n\nMy daughter has developed misophonia, also triggered by eating sounds, and she uses noise-canceling headphones and listens to brown noise during mealtimes. There are several \"colors\" of noise, and she says brown noise works better for her than white noise or music. You could experiment and find what works for you.\n\nWe have also lined up a therapist for our daughter because misophonia seems tied to anxiety issues, and she has those with the new school year starting (she is 13). I am hoping that if she can get some help with the anxiety, she might also get relief from the misophonia.\n\nSince you are at school -- college or university I am guessing? -- they probably have a student health office. Talk to someone there. If they cannot help, maybe they can point you in the right direction. This is the main app:  and then there is another one from the same developer called White Noise Market where you can download like millions of other sounds for it. The main app lets you make custom mixes, my go-to is a waterfall + rainforest birds! And still lets me listen to podcasts, music etc. I also use this free meditation timer to ping me every so often to remind me to relax any muscle tension:  My current annoyance is sibilance. Sh and Ch sounds \ud83d\ude40 It is amazing how we can adapt though. Keep up the good fight \ud83d\udc4d Foam earplugs allow speech to come through pretty well. You also need to not look at her. If she is a kind person, you will be able to have a conversation about your miso. \n\nWhite noise apps and active noise cancelling headphones --expensive-- will help you too. Hopefully she will understand that it is a true neurotype and not just you being picky", "I think I have misophonia For a little under a year, I have been experiencing what I think is misophonia. For me, it is mainly chewing sounds, looking at people who are chewing, slurping, the clicking of pens, or other repeated tapping noises. Luckily for me, my reactions seem to be a lot milder than for a lot of others. When I hear a trigger sound, usually it makes me pretty anxious. Sometimes it is bad enough I have to leave the room, while other times it makes me pretty angry and I have to remind myself the person making the noise is not doing it on purpose to trigger me. Fortunately for me, sometimes I can block out the noises if I let my mind wander or even listening to music just to have a background noise can be helpful. Since I have not been experiencing my triggers for too long, I am a little scared that it will get worse and to the point where I will not be able to block out the sounds anymore or be able to control my reactions as well. It is definitely gotten a little worse since I first figured out that I probably have misophonia. That sounds like mild misophonia. It becomes a disorder once it starts seriously impacting your life but if it is not changing much, it is a condition. Do not worry about it too much. There are coping mechanisms (as you said, music and distractions, etc) and ways to make it better such as hypnotherapy, anxiety medications (not recommended) and breathing exercises. Can you remember when it started? Usually it begins around age 12. I think I realized it was something when I was about 14 Checks out", "Co-worker in office repeatedly makes snapping noises fidgeting with whiteboard marker I am not sure if this is a misophonia thing exactly, but there is a person in the office where I work who often fidgets with whiteboard markers, constantly sliding the cap off and snapping it back on. I get tired of hearing constant snapping noises for hours throughout the day. Nobody else seems to complain about it though. Would it be reasonable to say something about it?", "Misophonia Job Board - Looking for miso-friendly job openings ", "I want to scream or cry or do something illegal I am just getting a regular oil change, just got off work and came straight here because I have not had the time or funds to do this any other time. I am sitting in the waiting room with hardly anyone else in this entire place, and this woman sits right now across from me, barely 2 feet away, and is aggressively popping her gum. She is not wearing a mask either so I can see her gum hanging halfway out of her mouth while she mindlessly pops and sucks on it. I CANNOT stand this noise. I am trying so hard to mask my discomfort but my body literally wants to twitch and shake every time. I try so hard to contain myself but the level of stress I am experiencing makes me want to beat this woman\u2019s face in with a coffee table. I am trying to casually plug my ears but I cannot plug both at the same time without being obvious and I was sitting here first so I should not have to move. Even if I did I am sure I would still hear her because I cannot block the noise of gum popping and chewing out. I am instantly back in high school trying to suffer through my classes while the girl assigned to sit behind me is smacking and popping. Or all the times my mother sat popping away during a car ride without a care at all of how many times I would tried to express that noise bothers me. I am 29 years old and it still causes me such turmoil. I have very few people in my life who let me express my struggles with misophonia, let alone anyone who would let me work out healthy and helpful ways to express my discomfort. Hey; just wanted to throw it out there- have you tried lithium carbonate (need a doctor's prescription)? It is really helped me with reducing agitated feelings. A few days ago I was throwing my body against a wall, hitting and scratching myself, etc and having violent thoughts. Lithium prescription has calmed me down a lot, though it is beginning to be less effective as my body is getting used to it. whoa really? please make a post! I want to take this moment to remind us all: when the brain gives us fight or flight, I highly recommend flight.  \n\nWe can always stand outside. Take an \"important phone call\"\u2122! Go stretch or something. There is never a great reason to torture ourselves or potentially feel the impulse to punch a gum smacker. If I am going to be on the news, it is going to be for something way better than a gum smacker. I do not have insurance or doctor/psychiatrist I see but that is something I would like to know more about. I have been there. A lot of us have, I assume. I am 24 and stuck living with my parents. My mom does not make the noises often anymore, but my dad does it for fun and she enables this behavior. I am currently holed up in my room because my dad made a noise to hurt me for his amusement, so my mom had to cook my dinner for me and bring it in. Of course, she blamed me and enabled him, changing the topic of the little argument that she and I had a few moments ago so that she would not have to concede that I was being victimized. On this note there is a new guy at my Local Game Store who annoys the shit out of me for fun at magic events. If he finds out I have misophonia, he is going to be the type of guy to push me to violence at a point of no return. The piece of shit coughed on me for fun the other day, all over my cards too. Sounds like a jerk. In my experience those types get what is coming for them quickly I am sorry you have to deal with that. I wish it was easier to get people to understand how awful it is when people knowingly trigger it.", "Does Making Your Own Trigger Noise Affect You? My trigger noise is sniffing. So it being the cold season, I am figuratively burning in hell.\n\nBut I was really cold at work today and my nose kept running and I would just sniff nonchalantly without being triggered...\n\nAm I the only one? I have not talked to many people with misophonia, this is my first time in a support-ish group. I have been so desperate to find anyone who understands.", "i love you apple (iOS 15 beta 2 lets you play background noises on your airpods)  OMG. I made ( the other day to ask about these, this makes that purchase idea even better! :) i have the pros and they are very good! Not like totally soundproof good but active noise cancelling combined with background sounds and music will not let any chewing noises in. Yeah they are expensive, but considering they improve your quality of life so much, totally worth it. If you have an iPhone or any other apple devices then it is a complete no brainer. They work together so well that I cannot even describe it. Yeah I am on the iPhone/MacBook combo so... I should just bite the bullet. In this moment, I am happy I switched to the apple side Will this work with other head sets and ear pods, not just Apple products? Yes. +1000 to AirPod Pros. Noise cancellation is fantastic. i am not sure if it will work with non apple headphones welcome to the dark side of the force now i only have to find a summer job to buy an iphone. Awesome. I have Apple Music so I already use it to listen to nature sound playlists sometimes(Also, Lo-Fi. Soooo much Lo-Fi.) but it would be nice to have it as a built-in iOS feature that everyone can use for free and is not tied to a track that ends at 3 to 5 minutes.

I am sitting in an airport, reading a book and waiting for my red eye flight. One guy is struggling to get M&amp;M\u2019s out of a bag, another has been crinkling his chip bag for upwards of 20 minutes and chewing with his mouth open.\n\nI am about to dig my headphones out of my bag. Send help. I am impressed you have tolerated it for 20 minutes and managed to maintain a sense of humour. I would not even dream of going to an airport without them plugged in, in my hand with something loud cued up. Airports and public transit. Open mouth munching????!!!! That is the worst sound ever. I have a special-needs sister who does not know any other way of eating (and literally chomps w/ open mouth even worse than my late grandfather bused to do) and I have to fucking flee the scene when eating out with my family and hide until everyone is done eating before I can come back to eat. Fleeing the scene almost got me in trouble when I once during a meal in a restaurant in Greece ran to the bathroom 3 times (1 time legit, other 2 just hiding) and the idiot restaurant owner fucking knocks on my door and nearly calls the police (parents barely calmed him down) because he thought I was shooting up! That is awful, I am sorry to hear that he was a jerk about that. And that is rough about your sister, especially since she cannot help it. Just remember that you cannot help it either, your reaction is valid. I feel for you! Yeah, thanks alot for the support. My parents promised never to go to that stupid restaurant again. Also, my father makes nasty mouths sounds when he eats even when I make him try to eat quieter (this is very hard for him). As for how I deal at home, I simply fire up the kitchen ventilator (aka \"jet engine\") to drown out mouth sounds while I hide in my room. For a very long time now I only eat in my room. On family holidays at my grandmother's house it can be so bad that even when hiding in her library I can sometimes hear mouth sounds if some of my louder eating relatives come (this usually happens when my narcissistic loud-munching idiot uncle comes and I have to blast loud music with my phone as an extra protection measure).

I eventually just assumed I must have either very good hearing, or a wider range.  Perhaps even, sounds were perceived differently in my head,   than everyone else.  I learned to live with it and hate it.\n\nI have been on Reddit for years, but only recently ran into this sub.  I found that there are plenty of people who may have it worse than me.   So  of course this made me feel better about myself and my misophonia.  I too share the same experiences where people assume I am just whining  or  tell me, \"Just ignore it.\"  But I do not share the incredibly wide  range of triggers as I have read about on this sub.  I realized that  just like  any other disorder, we all experience it differently.  We all  have  different triggers and different reactions.\n\nI feel if you get annoyed or angry that the neighbors dog has not stopped barking for 2 hours, that is pretty normal for most people.  If you  feel  like your the only one who hears the guy, standing 200 feet away,   crinkling his plastic water bottle non-stop, and it results with  emotion  and complete distraction, then yes you have a problem, and were  calling  it Misophonia.\n\nRecently my GF  wanted to go-to a pop-up thing for an old TV show.  We went and  it was  just you know, walking around and taking pictures of yourself on  pieces  of the set.  Anyway, we are just getting started when I hear  two women  behind me both chewing gum with their mouths open at the same  time.   They were behind me on my left and right so it was in stereo.   Now I  was not actively listening for these sounds.  I was not on the  hunt,  seeking an individual to be upset with.  It just, happens.  The  instant I  hear it my internal voice says, \"Jesus, here we go.  Fuck.   Why.  Why  do they do this.\"\n\nI give my GF the  look and she asks, \"What?\"  I already know she does not  notice it, she  does not hear it.  I tell her, \"The fucking gum smacking  in stereo  sound.\"  She is immediately turned off to me as she is  irritated by my  frequent complaints about these things.  Including  complaints to her.   These complaints of mine only seem to compound and  it appears as if it is  all I do is complain.\n\nI am the  kind of person who likes it pretty quiet.  I move around the  house like a  ninja.  I step lightly, close cupboards softly, and close  doors using  the handle.  All to minimize the amount of sound I produce.   My  girlfriend is the kind of person who does not notice any of these  things.   For someone who instinctively, without thought, naturally  closes doors  without slamming them, I grow frustrated when she does not  understand  that I have asked her not to slam the door too many times.   However,  after a few years, she does not slam the front door anymore.\n\nOur most common, nearly daily quarrel, is about eating chips.  For years   now, no matter how much I have complained.  She has no issue walking   into our quiet bedroom, where I am laying, opening a bag of chips,   putting them in her mouth, and crunching down on them just before she   closes her mouth.\n\nThe first thing   that happens is my internal voice says, \"WHAT THE FUCK!  WHAT THE FUCK   IS WRONG WITH THIS WOMEN!\"  My external response is simply a poker face   directed at her, along with a deep breath.  Her response is 50/50.\n\nIt is either an apologetic or hostile response.  Take your pic.  I do not   fly into a rage, immediately.  But if her antagonistic response   continues as I explain that all I want her to do is turn the TV on if   she eats and nothing has changed for years so why cannot you just not eat   loud chips in a quiet room, then I grow upset.  In return, she grows   upset, and now we are both fighting because, I am the one who has the   problem and I should learn to control myself.\n\n\"we are both fighting because, I am the one who has the problem and I should learn to control myself.\"\n\nThat does not make sense to me, only her, or anyone else that does not   understand, I cannot control my response.  If a war vet starts screaming   and hiding under the table because it is the Fourth of July, that makes   sense.  If everyone is pissed off that a baby has been crying for 20   minutes in the movie theater, that is understandable.  If the neighbors   dog is always outside and barks all day, it would make sense that   someone would be upset.  But as soon as I get frustrated or complain   that the editor decided to include the audible sounds of teeth on fork   noises and chewing and smacking during the dinner table scene of a   movie, I am the fucking crazy one.  I get it, it is natural, it is acting,   it is just a scene in a movie, relax dude.  NO!  WHY the fuck is Robert   DeNiro talking with food in his mouth during a movie?  Why do I have  to  listen to him bite the damn fork?  I mean is that audio picked up in  the  mic or did some asshole audio effects person actual pick that from  a  library and add it so it is more natural.  Fuck him.\n\nYet, I really do make good controlling my outward response to these   triggers.  More often than not I will keep it to myself for a very long   time.  Letting it go.  Eventually, if and when I do speak up, I am just   treated like I am a crazy asshole complainer.  They do not know I have   been letting it go for some time now.  Therefore when I am told to let   it go or ignore it, I am even more frustrated because, well, I HAVE  BEEN  IGNORING IT AND LETTING IT GO FOR A FUCKING HOUR.  But now I am  asking  you to please stop sucking your teeth.\n\nFor me it is definitely mouth noises.  Or any noise that comes from your   face.  Together with slammed cabinets and doors.  Loud phone talkers,   and people that walk through life whistling.  People that stomp   everywhere they go.  Mom and dad noises.  If you do not know what mom and   dad noises are, call your mom right now and listen for the strange   noises coming through the phone that are not words.  That is your moms   body making noises.  For me I sometime consider some people, noise   machines.\n\nMy uncle was this way.  Noise noise noise, everywhere he went.  Body noises, mouth noises, breathing noises...\n\nHe would bang and slam around everything he did.  Pots and pans, silverware, bang bang bang, boom boom boom.\n\nI once decided to play a game for a while.  I spent about 2 hours   counting the time between noises.  He was sitting at his desk reading.  I   do not think I counted past 10.\n\nAnyway, rage.\n\nNon of these triggers give me rage except one.   I have not mentioned it   yet.  My usual feelings are anger and frustration, it is an annoyance to   me.  I feel about biting a fork sounds, the same as a normal person   would feel about a car horn honking outside the house at 3 a.m.  A very,   WHAT THE FUCK ASSHOLE, feeling.\n\nRage.  It comes from yelling.  It comes from screaming.  I do not know if   Misophonia has anything to do with it.  I kind of feel like Misophonia   is common for everyday sounds, you know, like breathing.  I do not know   if it has any significance to my reaction to screaming and yelling.\n\nRage, pure rage.  Almost instantly.  It is as if I took a hit off of a rage pipe and within 2 seconds I see red.\n\nMy heart is racing, heart attack speeds.  My breathing is heavy, jogging speeds.  I am shaking.  I cannot help it.\n\nI ask, sometimes I plead with the person, \"For the love of god, please stop screaming.\"\n\nI will begin to repeatedly BEG the person to stop.\n\nThen the yelling and screaming continues.  It gets worse.  It is THE worse.\n\nI am now screaming and yelling too.\n\nYou know what I am screaming?  You know what I am yelling?\n\n\"PLEASE STOP FUCKING SCREAMING!\"  While all I see is red, I cannot catch my breath, I cannot feel my fingers.\n\nNow   I am scared.  I am ashamed.  I am embarrassed that I lost my control.   I  do not feel good about myself.  I am now completely exhausted inside.\n\nRage\n\nAnyway,   I found this sub and just wanted to write a quick one about myself.    Just to get it off my chest.  I mostly enjoyed reading about other   peoples issues and wanted to share the same. Wow. I am glad you found this subreddit too, cause it looks like you needed to get this off your chest immediately. Screaming is not one of my triggers, it is the first time I hear about that. When you said about that time in the movie or the other with the ladies chewing gum, I felt that. I heard the chewing. \nMy family acts like it is nothing and I just can \"ignore it\". I hope your girlfriend will understand what you are dealing with sometime. I do not understand why people do not hear it or notice it.  I always thought about recording chewing noises.  Then playing it back for people.  And explain that here, at the normal volume, this is what you hear.  Then max the volume and say, this is what it sounds like to me.  I know you do not understand that.  But I am not making this up.  It is just how it is.  Now, if you do not close your mouth when you chew, I will pack my things and move to the Arctic. The bit about hearing open-mouth chewing gum made me feel sick. Man did I feel that. \nReally evocatively written, and \"mom/dad noises\" put into words something I was not quite able to. \n\n\nHave you tried showing your gf any sites on misophonia? She might not quite realise it is \"real\". \nTV/music/YouTube/whatever on during *any* eating needs to be a rule. \nMy husband does not have it but he is really understanding. We use metal cutlery because he avoids biting them, with melamine or plastic bowls, plates etc.\n\n\nOne other thing I have learnt over the years is to bring the trigger up *before* I see misophonia red. That way people do not go on the defense (for making those horrible, horrible noises), as you are calmer about it. Calm-because-you are-not-enraged-yet and calm-because-you are-surpressing-the-urge-to-scream probably do read differently. \nI usually phrase it as a \"sensory processing disorder\" that is anxiety related. \n\n\nI have not got a trigger for people shouting per se, but I fucking hate it. It really scares me, but that is normal I think. Are you often exposed to it?\n\n\nI am also very quiet on my feet. I hate making house noises. My upstairs neighbour...is not. Swear she walks on her heels. Oh and she does love walking. Getting her money's worth for rent, maybe? Paces that fucking flat from when she gets in to when she goes to bed. I know where she is at any given time, can tell you what her fucking bathroom trip was for, for god's sake. \n\n\nMost of my triggers come from mouth noises too. I am crazy about birds and it made me realise it comes down to saliva, which birds do not have. My parrot eating a cracker was like ASMR to me, whereas a dog or cat would have me leaving the room. \n\n\nSilicone earplugs have helped a lot. They do not expand in your ear and hurt like any foam ones do (for me anyway, stupid ear canals). You can pop one in the side nearest people eating, and with background noise it is great. I use Putty Buddies - they seem to block more noise than Quires, the wax ones, and stay malleable longer than other silicone ones. Oddly enough these chewing, eating, smacking sounds drive me crazy but are sought after by one of my children.  They love those sounds and try to make them as often as possible.  I have to leave the room all the time. &gt;Have you tried showing your gf any sites on misophonia? She might not quite realise it is \"real\". \n\nI have heard the documentary \"Quiet Please\" is very good and available on Amazon Prime. I have been meaning to watch it. OP, might be worth showing to your gf. tldr but hope yous good I love you I am convinced any sounds can become panic inducing when you have misophonia. Things that did not bother me before, bother me now. Things that bother majority of misophonia sufferers, do not bother me. I suspect, in my experience, this comes from what might be the root cause of misophonia more than anything.\n\nI am not bothered by breathing, or chewing (unless it is mouth open). Whistling really kills me, and scraping of pans. My panic is induced only when I cannot make the sound stop, and I can typically alleviate the rising pressure in my brain if I can walk myself through the scenario, telling myself it WILL stop and to relax in the moment the best that I can. I feel now that I can keep myself from getting worked up at least from  the sounds that are not completely rage inducing.\n\nI have been using tactics people use to \"overcome\" OCD, it never goes away but it keeps you from giving into the panic and anxiety. I also have a lot of OCD related tendencies, so I believe this is pretty likely where it stems from, and I work on it with my therapist.\n\nIf you have access, I definitely recommend reaching out for therapy for whatever fits the bill for you. For me it was trauma, depression and OCD.", "Non eating sounds Bass, vehicles, loud neighbors Are these anyone else's Main trigger sounds?\nMy home is a prison and its all day long. Not just at a dining table or around people. I can be alone in my house and Im literally in torture due to the how loud everything is outside my home. I just feel like my triggers are constant and I am about at the end of being able to cope Yes these are my exact triggers.\n\nEveryone being home all the time these past few months has honestly affected my mental health.\n\nNeighbours playing loud music can make me feel physically sick. Thank you for commenting. Makes me feel not so alone You are not!\n\nIf it ever gets too much just message me.\n\nIt is even worse for me as my neighbour is a singer so that could start up at any moment, so loud!\nSo I am always on edge.

I answer the phone all day so I am not allowed headphones. I do have a radio on my phone that plays through the computer's speakers thankfully. And I wear earplugs. \n\nMy co-worker has pretty severe acid reflux/allergies in that every time they eat, they have to cough/clear their throat every minute for hours. I am normally okay with a cough or two, but this is constant coughing -- every 35 seconds , sometimes shorter. I dread lunch time because I know as soon as they finish eating I am going to have to listen to them cough for the rest of the day. \n\nIt can get pretty loud. It is mucus-y and guttural. And the most embarrassing part is that every time I hear them cough I jump in my seat and it makes my desk move. I know they can see it, and surprisingly have not said anything. But it is not just that. I am literally in a state of intense fight-or-flight with heart palpitations, sweaty hands, racing thoughts etc. waiting for the next cough so I can time when the next one will be. I feel like a lab rat being conditioned in a cruel experiment. \n\nIt got so bad a few days ago I had to go to the restroom and take a Xanax from my purse. It helped, which worried me. Because it is not a solution I can take everyday. I will get addicted to it. \n\n\"Tell them/tell your boss\" \n\n I cannot, nor do I want to. What can I tell them? \"Hey I get panic attacks when so-and-so coughs after they eat\" \"I am allergic to the sound of coughing\" \"I have this rare neurological condition you have never heard of and need you to stuff a sock in your mouth so I do not have to hear you cough all day\" -- that is not practical, and it will only lead the company to think I am a loon. \n\nI am trying to get started in finding a way to get into a new career so I can hopefully land a job where I can choose to work from home. Until then I have to endure this because I cannot quit this job. It is how I am keeping everything I have afloat. \n\nFor the record, I have acid reflux/LPR. I cough up mucus after meals too, but I take medicine for it so I do not have to. I have sympathy for my co-worker, but I cannot handle being stuck 4ft away having to listen to their dang cough every 15 seconds. What makes it worse is they will not even wear a face mask when sitting at their desk. \n\nI know there is not much advice you all can give me. But I just wanted to talk about it. It is bothering me big time. I am scared to go back to work next week. It is like on my days off I cannot even enjoy them because I am thinking about listening to coughing all day when I return. \ud83d\ude1e i know how you feel, although im younger than you, ive been in multiple situations like this at school. i have had to take exams in quiet classrooms with the teacher clicking away at the keyboard, or some kids coughing and snorting, especially at the end of the year when everyone is sick, its the worst and i could never concentrate because of it.\n\nagain im young, so idk what advice i could give, but if i was in your situation i would talk to your boss about it, see if you could move to another room? or use headphones?\n\nif you wouldnt want to do that, id probably look for a new job &amp; try to hold out in the office as long as i could.\n\njust know that you arent alone &amp; i totally feel you, i hope you get better&lt;3 Being pregnant and currently fighting with the EXACT same scenario (in which I am the one who cannot stop coughing- and my meds are not helping)- I feel badly for both of you. \n\nThe fact that they will not wear a mask and sit four feet away from you is an utterly unnecessary risk to be taking though, and should be something you could actually address with your boss/company's owner. Sounds really frustrating man. Hard for me to say much useful, but I have a nice white noise track that mutes out the things quite well:\n\n Thanks man. If only i could wear headphones!!! D: Play this loud enough to stop hearing them :x\n\nKidding. I really wish you the best. Things seem unfair in life, but hopefully you can enjoy others things aside from these challenges Thanks man. I appreciate your comment. Yeah, life feels unfair at times esp with misophonia. Sometimes I wonder if this stuff is happening to me on purpose to teach me something XD Yeah I feel the same. Some way I got comfortable with being a Miso. I can really appreciate it when it is really quiet. But life will sometimes put you in a noise spot to challenge your temper..\n\nQuestion. I wonder whether you are very good at picking up sounds in general? I sometimes like to hear wheels rolling on highways from far. Yes I believe I am. !", "New puppy and I think I need help. The new puppy has been scratching at the metal siding on the door with his claws to be let in (can barely type this). It makes an unbearable high pitched screeching noise. \n\nI have had severe misophonia to wooden popsicle sticks/tongue depressors, use of fingernail files, and the sound of teeth sliding on a fork ever since I can remember.  It has always gotten me extremely upset and I run out of the room. My family knows this and keeps this stuff away from me. We use plastic forks at dinner for example. \n\nThis puppy thing is a new sound to me and my emotional reaction has been extremely severe. I cannot go near the door at all. Even looking at the scratches on the door makes my teeth feel like they are about to fall out (does anyone else have this?!) I have been obsessing over this sound for the past few days even though I have not been exposed to it because I stay away. I can be in my room doing nothing or watching TV and I will think of that action/sound and freak out without warning or an identifiable trigger. It is like nails on a chalkboard but I am not even really hearing it?! It is almost like I am having flashbacks?!\n\nPlease help, I am very upset ... Not an expert, but it kind of sounds like PTSD. That and emotional support are all I have for you. Sorry. Can you cover the metal siding with a towel or some fabric? You are the first person I have seen in this sub who shares my \u201cmetal scraping\u201d problem. It is so bad I get goosebumps thinking about it. Nobody understands they all think I am just being picky. What do even worse is after I hear the sound I think about it my mind like tortures me with it over and over again for a few minutes. Do you ever get like that? Omg yes!!! Just reading your post made my hair stand on end as well.  My mind plays it over and over as well... just knowing I am not alone makes me feel a bit better. \n\nIt give me goosebumps, I have to turn my head away, and I have to protect my teeth with my lips.  I think a trigger for me is just feeling anxious overall, my brain can play the sensation on a loop the more anxious I am.\n\nDo you just avoid, or have you found anything to cope? This is a really great idea thank you! That is ok, thanks for your reply. I appreciate you taking the time to comment Yes! Omg I press my tounge against my teeth, that is honestly the only way I have found to cope. Putting my tongue between my top and bottom teeth and thinking of like a memory foam mattress LOL. From what I read online the only treatment for it is to be subjected to the noise over and over again and I am not down for that. Omg that sounds like torture!! I love your idea of thinking of foam... I have never tried that but I think that would help me! \n\nHow is it that the two of us have such a random problem that is so similar?! I itch the same coping and the same tooth-thing?!\n\nHave you found anything else that helps? I had my family switch to use of plastic forks at home (we got a really nice set that is dishwasher safe). \n\nDo you ever have the same issue with popsicle sticks?! So like eg eating a popsicle and then sliding the teeth against the wooden stick? Omg I can barely type that No, luckily I do not have a problem with the popsicle sticks, but I can imagine that is uncomfortable. Yea, I have never talked to anybody with our similar issue before either and none of the \u201cnormal\u201d misophonia stuff bothers me either(well sometimes when my dog is going to town on himself it gets under my skin) However, if the dogs are chewing on a bone the grinding noise it makes gets me. Also when I am unloading the dishwasher and my fingernails scrape against *ughhh the thought\ud83d\ude11* a dish, I cannot stand it, and FORGET about washing a metal baking sheet in my metal sink. I am definitely feeling your idea about using the plastic utensils, where did you find dishwasher safe plastic ware? Hey, there is a bunch of different ones if you search for them.

Are my coworkers the problem, or am I? I do not know what to think anymore. I believe 100% in taking responsibility for managing my own symptoms, but where is the line when you ask people to stop over and over again? \n\nI have two coworkers who talk on FaceTime, on speaker phone, for about 3 hours a day. One girl is remote, and the other one is here. It is a quiet office. The sound of the remote girl typing over speaker phone is making me want to crawl out of my skin. She also carries on their conversation while she does things like get up and make coffee. I can hear mugs clanking and all sorts of rustling. It is torture. \n\nI have asked the girl who is here to turn the phone down. She kind of did. The other girl\u2019s voice is much quieter, but the typing is just as loud. They have finally stopped having three way speaker phone conversations with their boss (about 50\u2019 away.)\n\nThey know this bothers me. I have explained in simple terms that I have issues with noise. I have asked nicely  multiple times. I do not want to be \u201cthat guy\u201d (even though I am a woman), but I cannot take it anymore. \n\nThe best I was able to do was get my boss to let me put on earbuds again. It helped immensely. I have white noise on loud enough to drown out the typing. But on the occasions when I cannot use them, or I can only use one earbud, I feel like I am going to lose my shit. \n\nSo, I do not know. Are they the problem? Am I the problem for not managing my symptoms better? Has anybody successfully resolved a situation like this? I would rather not quit with the way the job market is right now, but there was a day last week where I was ready to scream and walk out. I have managed to hide everything as well as I can, but it is torture.\n\nIt is a small business so there is no HR. The two of them have their boss, and I have mine. My boss caved on the earbuds, but I do not know how helpful he will be past that. This is tough. Surely them facetiming would be rude to anyone, not just someone with miso, and since it is a quiet area it would be understandable to be upset that they break the silence.\n\nCould you try \"gifting\" your coworker headphones/earbuds? Obviously not super expensive ones. By doing so you both \"win\" - she can still have her conversations, and you can work in peace.\n\nOther than that, the only thing I can think of is avoidance. Take your lunch break at some point during those hours to calm down, get different hours, work from home? You deserve to be comfortable in your work space; Just because misophonia is an invisible ailment does not mean it is any less important. I hope this works out for you! Thank you. It is been really hard, and I feel alone through all of it. I do not know if they do not understand, do not care, or both. \n\nThe funny thing is, they think it is unprofessional to wear earbuds at work. (Apparently being on speaker is a better alternative?) The other girl in the office says she always has some in her car. \n\nThose are some good ideas, thank you. The boss says no to working from home, but I am sure I could find a way to step outside for a second if I have to. It is finally getting to be nicer out. I am making sure I leave the office during lunch, and I do not take even a minute less than my full hour.\n\nI wish so badly that I could control this.", "Popcorn + Misophonia Convention + Survival Chance You know how they have misophonia conventions?

I have never seen any evidence or research to suggest that misophonia is connected to nutritional deficiencies. However, I think a holistic approach cannot do anything wrong in this case (unless you have been misled to believe this is a cure). It makes sense that when we are healthy, we are better able to cope with our triggers (or any stress that life brings). Worst case scenario, the vitamins do nothing, and it sounds like it possibly has helped somewhat since you are not self-harming.\n\n&gt;i get urges to stop taking my supplements completely since there is no effect.\n\nI think this is just part of your toolbox in coping with misophonia, but it is not going to make it go away completely.

My neighbors will start mowing their lawns ON THE WEEKENDS as early as SEVEN AM a lot of the time, and the only person I know with Misophonia is my dad, who has a much more mild case and learned to tune it out very easily, or so it seems. So, I cannot really explain it to someone IRL who will genuinely understand and be able to give me advice, because I have talked to him and while he is my father and I trust him, I do not want to burden him anymore or have a mini breakdown. I cannot sleep without earplugs, and every time I eat with more than one person, I will literally press down on whichever ear is clpsest to the loudest chewer, and fold up my earlobe, which I know is unhealthy and sometimes I do this and press down too hard on multiple occasions and it will start to hurt when I am not holding down. This has only happened a few times, luckily. Occasionallly, there are points when I already have a layer of stress and I will break down crying as soon as I am alone in my room or whatever after I have been triggered by one of these noises.

My main triggers are swallows and chewing sounds. I have had my dog Biscuit since I was 12 years old. He is a Maltese.\n\nFor 13 years, I never had any misophonia triggers or issues with Biscuit. He is always been such a sweet dog and I have babied him ever since he was a puppy. I was over the moon to get a dog, for more than a decade we did nearly everything together. He is 15 now.\n\nThe problem is that ever since my husband and I had a baby 2 years ago, every single one of Biscuit's sounds now triggers my misophonia very badly. His licking, smacking, eating his food, drinking water, even the sound of his claws on the floor. I noticed this change immediately when I brought my son home from the hospital after birth (I am guessing it was brought on by the dramatic hormonal shift of giving birth). I was very conflicted and confused because his sounds had never bothered me before. It is so bad, we are talking full-blown misophonia anguish. I have used my usual coping tools of having white noise/fan going in the house, periodically wearing my noise-canceling headphones, practicing mindfulness, deep breathing, etc. I did my best to be kind to him and to myself. This all helped to some degree, but the problem never went away.\n\nFor the past 2 years, I have found it extremely difficult to get close to him, pet him, snuggle, etc. I guess my mind and body are perceiving him as a threat because of his noises. I have forced myself to snuggle him and give him plenty of pets, because he is just a dog and of course it is not his fault that he makes natural dog sounds. He deserves love and affection. I have done my best to keep our relationship like it was before my son was born, but if I am being honest, for the last 2 years my dog has mostly been a major source of stress.\n\nFast forward to now, I am 6 months pregnant with our second child. I find myself getting more and more annoyed and angry at Biscuit for all of his noises. I have had some of the worst misophonia experiences of my life with this dog. I feel so conflicted, because even though I love my dog, I do not think I will ever have a good relationship with him again. Sometimes it gets so bad, I fantasize about giving the dog away and finding him a new home. I have never hurt my dog before, and I never will, but I have definitely imagined it many times after he makes a noise, and I do not feel comfortable with that. It is very difficult to not hate myself for this issue. I feel like my dog deserves an owner who does not have to force themselves to be sweet and affectionate to him.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel like I cannot give him away this late in his life. He is 15 now, which is the average life expectancy for his breed. He already has cataracts and arthritis. He cannot hear or smell very well anymore, either (although he can still run around). So he is not in a good position to be re-homed or go to a shelter. I also do not know if I could live with myself for abandoning my dog of 15 years.\n\nI am exhausted from the constant stress this problem brings and I am starting to feel desperate.

O.o I do not have many problems with yawning too, except when it is my stepfather How bad is it, dare I ask? I hate every single sound he can possibly make with his mouth, it is not about yawning in particular. But it is VERY triggering, to say the least I understand. I love and adore my Dad but some of the sounds he makes... My dad always yawns with the most infuriating \u201cha-ha-hummm\u201d at the end every single time and afterwards he always lip smacks. I had to hit myself in the ears just from imagining it.", "I do not know how to stop One of my coping mechanisms when I hear a trigger noise is to hurt myself. The biggest trigger of mine is when my dad clears his throat or coughs. It does not sound like any sound a human would make, and I think part of the reason why those sound he makes bothers me so much is because of one time when I was younger, he dragged me across the carpet in our living room and I got a terrible carpet burn from it. I screamed at him to stop because I could feel the friction of the carpet against the bare skin on my back as it ripped a quarter-size area of skin, and I was left in pain with a bloody and raw carpet burn. \n\nI locked myself in my room because I was so scared. I remember my mom would always tell me to call her at work if I ever needed anything, and she would be there for me. She is a nurse, and at the time she worked nights at the hospital. I was terrified to leave my bedroom to grab a phone to call her and tell her what happened. I was scared my dad would scream at me for bothering my mom at work. \n\nI remember my dad unlocking the door to my bedroom, and I cowered in fear because I had nowhere to run. I was scared he was going to get up in my face and scream at me. Thankfully, he did not. He just came to apologize for what he did to me and offered a hug, but I squeezed myself into a ball and whimpered as I turned away. It made me feel bad, but he hurt me. I remember him telling me not to tell mom, but I did not listen. \n\nI remember telling her and showing her my back as she gasped in horror. She took a picture to send to her mom, and I remember her saying, \u201cI do not care what you did, you did not deserve this!\u201d My dad is not overall abusive, even though it may seem like it. \n\nI believe it was this experience that may have contributed to my having such strong reactions to sounds specifically he makes. I see a psychiatrist, but I have never told anyone that I hurt myself as a way to cope.", "The savior ", "Train announcer at train station in my city the voice of the train announcer at Melbournes train station is so unbearable, the tone of her annoying Australian robotic voice makes me angry  (especially the 'Do NOT' part) i am worried about developing tinnitus or something because to block out her voice i have to wear my noise canceling headphones on the highest setting (even then i can still hear her) :(( her voice is unbearable once i got so mad i bit through a mask i was wearing. God I feel l, the bus announcer voice for my commute talks incessantly and has mouth sounds programmed in. There used to be one at Flinders Street years ago that sound like he was talking underwater. When you are using your headphones, what are you usually playing?  I ask because many times music just is not enough to block out conversations for me unless I have it up really loud, but I find that a good white noise generator blocks out things a lot more without being as grating.  I prefer \"brown\" noise personally, because it reminds me of ocean water while being uniform and staticky.\n\nIt seems just the right frequency to totally cancel speech, so I wonder if would help with this as well?\n\nJust a suggestion! MOUTH SOUNDS PROGRAMMED IN???? this ones at southern cross oh god that sounds horrible thank you! i usually play music on mine Right? Satan himself made this audio Pink noise might be more helpful. I am honestly unsure what each \"color\" noise is best suited for in terms of noise cancellation, but getting any halfway decent white noise app would give you the options you need to play around with different white noises until you find one that works best.", "My boyfriend is my biggest trigger My boyfriend sneezes. So. Much. Upwards of 3 times a day, he has what I call \u201csneeze attacks\u201d that seem to go on forever. This is coupled with constant sniffling and snorting to clear his nose. \n\nHe also smokes weed (which is obviously fine) and it makes him cough a *lot*. It is infuriating. He is also an avid coffee-slurper.\n\nHe also had ADHD and I believe this is what causes him to make these odd ear-piercing, spine-tingling, skin-crawling sounds at random. From random yells to shrieks to snorts to things I am probably forgetting, if he is bored or stagnant for too long, he starts making these odd sounds that trigger me beyond belief. It seems like they are related to his ADHD because this category of sounds is entirely removed from his sneezing/coughing/snorting, etc.\n\nWe have talked about this many times before. We have had countless discussions about my misophonia and his respiratory issues that cause his sneezing, coughing, sniffling and snorting, but it does not matter. Nothing changes, truthfully I do not think anything can possibly change because half of the noises he makes are not even his fault or under his control! \n\nI feel wickedly guilty for getting so frustrated with the noises - I know it is the sounds and not him and I have to constantly remind myself of that. I have desperately tried to control my irritability and I know he is tried to change or stop making the sounds he *can* control. \n\nI love him so much, and I do not want misophonia to control my enjoyment of life. I mean, obviously he is not the only person in the world that triggers me! *Sounds* trigger me, not people! I do not want misophonia to become a personality trait of mine.\n\nI am not even really looking for advice, though I would consider it if it were offered. Just someone who loves their boyfriend very, very much that needed a second to vent. So, if you got this far down, thanks for reading. I do not think you have misophonia, I think you just have a lot to deal with Er, I definitely do have misophonia lol. Like I said, it is not just him that triggers me, he just...makes a lot of frustrating sounds. \n\nI find these triggers everywhere in my life, from common to possibly uncommon, he just, unfortunately, happens to be the biggest one and hits a lot of my buttons.\n\nI will not go off and list all the reasons I know I have what I have/things that trigger me, but I definitely do. gatekeeping misophonia is not going to help any of us Precisely, thanks", "I feel like I have reached a dead end When I was younger, I went through a traumatic experience with my father. After that had \u201csettled out,\u201d I began to notice that it bothered me when he would chew with his mouth open. I did not think it was something anyone would care about, so I pretended it was not there. My depression and anxiety skyrocketed because of this, and I felt like there was nothing I could do about it. When I finally told my family about the sounds that bothered me, they did not understand. And how could I blame them? I barely understood it myself. All my life sounds have given me certain feelings, but I never really noticed it. I read a really good book series called The Secret Series that I highly recommend. I especially recommend it to people who have synesthesia. The more I read, the more I realized that I was feelings all the sounds around me. Like how pattering rain on the roof made my skin tingle and the sound of drums made my head throb, I realized that the wretched feeling I felt when my father would smack his lips and chew his food was a type of synesthesia. I did research and learned that it was misophonia. It was nice to realize I was not alone. But the more I researched, the more I realized that I may be stuck with this for the rest of my life. There was no cure, and there was not much research on it in general.\n\nMy mom was obsessed with trying to fix me, but I was just a broken toy that could never be repaired. The more she tried, the more I fell apart. The misophonia got worse, and I could not have a meal with my family without breaking down and sobbing. I was so ashamed. I still am. I am an embarrassment to my family whenever we are eating. To ensure that I do not have a break down, I have to listen to music so loud that I cannot hear anything. This created a huge rift between my family and me. I feel so paranoid when I am in public. I feel like people are staring at me, judging me. That girl, she is a stupid teenager that is too preoccupied with her music to even talk to her family. And sometimes I know that my father thinks that, too. No matter how many times I ask him to just try to chew with his mouth closed, he will not stop. Sometimes he will stare at me, dead in the eye, while he chews. I feel selfish for hating him, but I cannot help it. I know I should be grateful for everything that he does, but I cannot when he looks at me like that. Sometimes I find myself thinking that I will only achieve silence when I die. It pains me that I cannot be stronger, but I have been alone for so long. None of my family understands, and I am too ashamed to tell my friends. I just joined this group, but I am still scared and ashamed to share here, even if I know that it is a support group. I have been quiet for so long, and I just wish everyone else would be, too. You should never be ashamed for something not in your conscious control. This is something that is happening TO you, not something you are doing. It is not you are fault that you suffer from this.\n\n\n I would recommend thinking through what the best way to show them what miso truly is. Whether that be YouTube videos of someone explaining their experience, papers published by reputable researchers, etc. If they still do not help accommodate then try to negatively reinforce what they are doing. If your dad chews with his mouth open, leave the table and do not come back (if that is something you would be able to do). If he pulls out a bag of chips give a small huff and leave. I do not know if this method is the best but it has worked somewhat for me.", "Trigger upon Trigger upon ...

Alright this is going to be wierd. So I (female) have for quite a while now had this indicator of disgust, but now it has become attached to triggers that I find disgusting. I sort of feel it in my groin area, but not because I get off on it but rather because by parts are actively telling me that they do not find that appealing and would like to stop existing all together. I hate that. I do not want to think about any of that or be reminded of it when I get triggered by eating sounds at the family dinner and struggling to keep it together anyways. \nI was wondering if 1. Anyone else in the world has that problem and 2. If there is anything I can try and do to prevent it from happening. Tipps to stop finding triggers disgusting (even if that shifts it to another sensation) would be enough, cause then I could concentrate on things as to not be triggered anymore... just a heads up, might want to add a nsfw warning in the post :)\n\n(he/they pls, i am trans) you are not alone in this! i, as well as many others on misophonia subs, reported this symptom and it is obviously not well known bc well... it is private stuff. ah the world of unwanted sexual arousal, it is bloody awful. misophonia is stressful enough and adding this onto it just makes it unfair at this point. i do not got many suggestions on how to stop or subdue it apart from just enduring it. all i can do here is give my condolences, as for me it is gotten worse and has evolved into intrusive thoughts... not so nice ones. \n\nalso i get that it is uncomfortable to talk/read about this kind of stuff but we got to share all the knowledge we got so we can help each other out :P\n\nas far as i know there is no way to stop emotions from arising bc it is an instant reaction out of your control but from personal experience, without medication and some form of therapy (DBT and the such) not much helped me. but finding good distractions that immerse you into better emotions can be stuff like games, math (if you like math lol), writing... if it is turning into anger/rage then i highly suggest getting a designated violence object like a stuffed toy (if you want to stab) or wood plank (if you want to hit) to let your anger out on instead of your own self. anything that is an outlet to that emotion will help.\n\nif you are in a public place and you are seated, try crossing a leg or both and getting the heel of your foot and just press hard to get it away. standing... well that is tough. try to find a blind spot and discreetly, if you can, do the same but with a hand. \n\ni think that is it, as a minor i will not share my experience but i can relate and want to help so pm me if you want to talk ab it especially if it gets to the point of crying, here for u buddy &lt;3 Thank you very much for the extensive answer and also for the heads up, I was not sure if I needed the warning. It is good to know I am not alone, it feels very odd when you think you are... \nAlso thank you for offering further support, though I do not think I need it. My misophonia is very mild, I just have trouble dealing with it right now because I already have a high stress level due to exams. Thank you again and good luck in dealing with your own troubles! I get the same sensation. My psychiatrist told me it is because that level of frustration is so powerful that it can manifest elsewhere. Especially since that frustration/anger/rage has nowhere else to \u201cgo\u201d lol. Like, you cannot scream and yell, so it is trapped inside of you, thereby manifesting in a state similar to sexual arousal. It is totally normal! Do not worry. \n\nAs for tips, I got nothin. It is a pain to deal with, but it gets more tolerable over time. Alright, that confirms the previous comment with a little more medical backup, thank you!! I do not really have any advice but i just wanted to say I get the same sensation and i have my whole life!! I always thought it was just me lmao and it always confused me so i am just glad to hear i am not the only one with this experience \u263a\ufe0f Hey! First and foremost- you are far from alone in this. I am so glad that you are reaching out to our little community here on Reddit for answers, and I hope you find a solution that works for you soon.\n\nSecondly- What you are describing used to happen to me more frequently when I was a young child (elementary school aged), and does not happen to me very often anymore (no clue why this changed). Instead, it has turned into an intense (seemingly internal) itchy sensation all over my body that I just cannot scratch. Once (and *if*) I am able to get away from the trigger sound, it takes a few minutes for the itch to go away. Only playing music through headphones/buds and moving away from the noise seems to help get rid of the visceral sensation. I am hoping to find better solutions. When I do (because fingers crossed, you know?), I will update my answer here. Best of luck to you, and sending you comfort and joy. Oh wow, honestly, that sounds awful!! I have problems with my scalp inching so I 100% feel your struggle of an unscrachable and intense itch. I guess I will be sending all of that comfort and joy back, because it sounds like you need it. I hope you find a solution soon as well! If you feel as confused as I did/do, you might want to go through the comments here. There are at least two that so a big of explanation! Rage and sexual arousal are automatic, unconscious responses that are controlled by similar reptilian parts of the brain. That is why. There is no conscious thought, it is automatic like breathing and hunger. That is why it is impossible to control what is happening in your brain when you hear triggers.\n\nAnyway, the rage part of your brain that lights spills over to the arousal part.

I have been doing yoga in my living room to get through it. I do not really get out much because I am homeschooled it sucks I think I am becoming worse. It does not help that my brother is living here again and he is the noisiest person I know. Ouch yeah that would suck. Do you end up staying in your room a lot then? Well, on the bright side the rest of the world is also indoors for the most part :/ Yes, essentially all the time. I mean, everyone is spending all day working or studying anyway, so the only times we are together is at meal times and that is not a good time for me... So yeah, it kind of sucks. I do not mind staying in my room (I quite like it, to be honest) but I do get the impression that I am getting worse and I am triggered more easily. I can see getting triggered easier if you have to be around it more often. yeah I take my university remotely because of Misophonia. Going to school remotely is both a gift and a curse. I honestly would like to be public schooled because now I have misophonia and *no* friends except my awesome Church friends Hey that is pretty cool. Having someone is still better than no one.   \nTo be honest, you can go to public school and still have no friends. If you have a couple good friends, you are already socially ahead of a lot of people in public schools. Never thought of it that way. I am pretty introverted so not much would have really changed. Exactly. That was the situation for me anyways.\n\nAlso, it always seems like the grass is greener on the other side. Some people wish they were more social, some people wish they were less social and more focused on school work. The trick to a happy life, I think, is finding a balance between those two worlds. It is become a bit worse. I was living in my own apartment with a roommate but moved back home to help out since i am working from home now. \n\nAnd now being back it is just so loud. I feel like it is almost gotten to the point where it is more sensory overload? Before it was specific sounds and those still trigger me, but now it is just every loud noise makes me angry. It could be that i am just used to living in a quiet apartment and now it is all too much, i am honestly not sure. \n\nBut it is really killing me to work from home. I wish I did not have to be home to help out cause i would go back to my apartment, but my family needs me here to help. I empathize with you. If I had to leave my quiet place it would probably be jarring and stressful. Hope you are making it through this okay. my uni professors started online lessons and I do not know why but a few of them now click their tounge when speaking.

I censored them with spoilers, but be careful anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy initial plan for the PSAT was simple. I go in, I stuff in some earplugs, I work for three hours, and I leave. But earlier this afternoon, after I was given the student guide, I found out that the SAT explicitly bans ear plugs... And now I am completely lost.\n\nI am a sophomore in high school who is planning to take the PSAT in just two weeks. I know the PSAT is only \"practice\" and it will not affect me no matter how bad of a score I get, but just the thought of being stuck in a room full of triggers without my precious ear plugs... I would rather die!\n\nMy main trigger is sniffling. I recently got over my trigger for eating noises, but that process took two years, there is no way I will be able to get rid of my sniffling trigger in **TWO WEEKS!** The sound of sniffling just drives me up the walls... It is like the Chinese water torture technique, every little sniff only drives me more and more mad, and just when I think it is over, \"&gt;!SNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFF!&lt;**\"** I have never verbally or physically lashed out at anyone in my life, but one day, if my misophonia gets even worse, I might just do that, which scares me.\n\nTo make things worse, I actually want to get a good score on the test once I take the real one, and that is already difficult enough for people without misophonia, I would have to be a natural born genius to get a good score and get triggered for three hours at the same time!\n\nI have seen some other posts about problems like these, and the comments are mostly suggesting that they get \"disability accommodations\", but I am going to be honest, that idea makes me extremely uncomfortable. I am not disabled, self-proclaiming myself as \"disabled\" is utterly insulting towards people with real disabilities. And the only person who knows about my misophonia is my best friend, not even my parents know about it, how am I going to get my hands on a psychiatrist note!?\n\nAnd taking a test without ear plugs is going to be a massive adjustment for me, because I already wear ear plugs during tests in my normal classes. I have done it since freshman year, and I continue to do it today. Now that I am suddenly faced with a test that bans ear plugs, I am pretty sure my triggers will hit three times harder than normal.\n\nThis is just making me feel so hopeless, I think that no matter how much I study, my grade will ultimately be decided by how severe the sniffling in the room is. And I know for a fact that there will be at least five people &gt;!snorting mucus so loudly, so clearly, that I can practically feel the mucus slithering down their esophagus like a slug.!&lt; Just thinking about the torturous sound of sniffling makes me want to curl up in a ball and throw up.\n\nI just wish I could go into my brain right now, physically pull out my misophonia, toss it in the ground, stomp on it 17 times, microwave it, freeze it, spit on it, shit on it, stomp on it some more, attach it to a missile, and sending it flying all the way to the sun to make sure it never touches the surface of the earth again... But of course, I cannot do that. Misophonia does fall under the definition of a disability. Therefore you are protected by The Americans with Disabilities Act. This does not mean you are  any lesser than those around you. I would recommend taking advantage of the benefits you can receive with Misophonia. It may seem embarrassing but it is really not at all. I personally worked closely with disability services at my university and I can tell you it made 4 years of college way more bearable. The best trick I learned to getting over my own embarrassment was by talking openly about therapy and the help I was receiving with friends and family. You may be surprised about how understanding most people can be. Best of luck with whatever decision you make and hope you do great on the SAT! Good luck!! And may I ask how you got over eating noises? With respect, if misophonia is affecting your life and your ability to participate in activities this much, it is a disability. Being forced to work without your earplugs is *disabling* you. You may be interested in the social theory of disability, where the idea is that a society's lack of appropriate accommodation to an impairment is the source of disability, not necessarily the impairment itself. I wear glasses \u2014 without them my eyesight is so bad I would be disabled. But because my impaired eyesight is compensated for with glasses, I am not (not because of my vision, anyway). My misophonia on the other hand is impairing my life to such a degree that I do see it as disabling. I also have misophonia and a few other things that count as a disability.  Something important a nurse once told me:\n\nDo not compare yourself to other people when thinking about if it counts as a disability. When you read the definitions, do they apply to YOU?\n\nThen yes, you have a disability that should allow reasonable accommodation.\n\n\"But other people have much worse...\"\nYour accommodation does not take away from theirs.\n\nWhat about a person who does not have the use of their legs? If they thought \"well a quadruple amputee has it much worse than me!\" And chose not to pursue reasonable accomodations, their daily life would be a rampless struggle.\n\nAnd what about the quadruple amputee? \"Well someone like me who also requires a breathing tube is much worse!\"\n\nAnd so it goes.  There will always be someone with a more severe disability, that does not mean you should not be taken care of. See your PCP/pediatrician and get the accommodation. You do not need a psychiatrist. If you must, lie to your parents about the reason you are seeing the PCP. You could say something like you think you have a UTI and need a prescription for antibiotics. &gt; Misophonia does fall under the definition of a disability. \n\nIs it though? Would not it have to be something recognized medically?\n\nwikipedia:\n\n&gt;Although the condition was first proposed in 2001 by Jastreboff and Jastreboff, it has yet to be considered a diagnosable condition. Misophonia is not classified as an auditory or psychiatric condition, and so is different from phonophobia (fear of sound); there are no standard diagnostic criteria, and there is little research on how common it is or the treatment. Proponents suggest misophonia can adversely affect the ability to achieve life goals and to enjoy social situations. As of 2019 there were no evidence-based methods to manage the condition. Unless they have changed the act recently it is covered because the Act classifies a disability as a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity\u201d. So as long as you can prove Misophonia does so you are set. If youre required to wear a mask, use a buff, they hide earplugs Not sure if this is necessarily helpful but I would like to share my experience:\n\nI am a senior in high school and had to take SAT. I actually skipped the PSAT out of fear of exactly that. Just fear of overwhelming noises and I felt like not only would I do bad on the exam, but I may freak out or have to even leave the room, which would be embarrassing.\n\nWhen the time came to take the SAT, I knew I really could not skip it. I did deep breathing the morning of, tried to convince myself if I hear anything \u201cannoying\u201d to just stay calm and breathe. While I was taking the test, I was in a room with maybe 25-30 people. A few people made some coughing/sneezing noises and I felt myself get off track in my brain a little. I would have to re-read the passage or even totally stop for a minute and try to re-group.\n\nLuckily none of those noises were persistent- but, it was actually when we got to the Math section where I started to freak out. Hearing everyone is calculator button\u2019s going off quickly at different speeds, volumes, and even the noise of picking up and placing it back down..... it was awful. I had tears streaming down my face from trying to hold back the uncontrollable rage it was causing. I still focused on breathing- and even mentally tried to sing the lyrics of my favorite song in my head to focus on something else.\n\nI did not score half-bad. But I know I could have done way better if I had a quiet room by myself. My best advice is- claim it as a disability. Out of (pride i guess?), I tried to just \u201cman-up\u201d and take it normally, but ultimately it ruined my score and was extremely embarrassing. Those disability benefits are made for a reason, and you have every reason to use them. \n\nIt will not be the end of the world if you get a bad score anyways though. I do not want to scare you, as it was my own experience and it may be totally different for you. But, I would say try to get an accommodation in any way- whether that be a private room or allowed to use headphones or whatever. It may save your score!  First, like many people are saying, misophonia is a disability. I am just getting accomodations now, a senior in college, and I really wish I could have gotten them much earlier. So, please do look into getting accommodations. Also, do not look into going to a psychiatrist for misophonia (although please do for any other misophonia-caused issues) but instead to an audiologist. It is not a mental illness, it is a physical disorder that is best treated by audiologists. I have been to 3 audiologists now and all of them have had previous experience with misophonia.\n\nSecond, possibly try progressive muscle relaxation. It would normally take much longer to get it to properly work, but practicing for two weeks could make a noticeable difference. Let me know if you are interested in this and I will respond with more info/sources.", "Possible treatment - clonidine \u201cAkathisia is a movement disorder characterized by a subjective feeling of inner restlessness accompanied by mental distress and an inability to sit still.

I have not lived at my parents' place in almost 10 years now, but I still want to crawl out of my skin even thinking back. Sorry for formatting, I am on mobile and rambling.\n\nMy father is the most disgusting eater ever. He would slurp even the solidest of foods, chew with his mouth open, moan about good food, burp and fart as loud as possible, all at the dinner table. My memories of Christmas are full of rage and agony because I would always dread the dinner.\n\nApart from dinner time, he would randomly let one rip as loud as possible on the way to his room, in the living room, anywhere, just to spite my mother (they are divorced but live together, so much fun...). I would literally have to swallow back bile at how much that man would disgust me just from these noises.\nAnd then there are the more common things like loud TV, laughing like a maniac, snoring like a lumberjack...\n\nNow whenever I just remember any of this, it makes me see red. Sure, he is awful in many ways, but the noises, ugh... I would go as far as bet that he is the source of my misophonia to be honest.\n\nI am so happy to be out of there. I know how you feel, my dad does those things too... I am sorry that you are living through this difficult situation.\n\nI hope you can talk with him and make him understand your condition. If you need to vent and have nobody to talk to, I am here if you want! \n\nHope you feel better :\\^) Ah, thank you so much. Thankfully as I said, I live somewhere else now. However, we were never exactly on talking terms, and when my mother would tell him off he would just be louder cause he found it amusing. \nThanks to the pandemic I have not even visited the flat since last summer, but I sometimes just remember the struggle. I will have to go eventually, as my psychiatrist has an office in their town and is getting kind of unhappy with phone call meetings, so that fact sparked my ride down the horrible memory train.\n\nBut the same goes to you! If you ever need someone to talk/vent to, I am here :)", "train station announcer lady the announcer at southern cross station in melbourne australia is so damn annoying!!\nThis specific phrase she says \"please do not board the train at platform xx\" in the most irritating and whiny aussie accent\" makes me want to rip my ears off when i hear it its so very annoying I am glad that somebody else said it because I cannot stand the Ozzy twang either.", "Anyone else find this annoying? ", "Im afraid they will think I am a \"Karen\" Hear me out, lol this might be long. \n\nI have relatively bad misophonia that I have worked really hard to manage and can successfully sit through meals and endure chewing sounds ... most of the time. The sounds that also bother me are basically anything distracting (I also have add); my main trigger is mouth noises, anything to do with the mouth ugh I literally cant. But I also have an issue with \"neighborhood noise\", not kids playing or anything, Im not a monster. Unless its a basketball being dribbled endlessly, shoot the ball every once and a while! \n\nIts the sound of others peoples loud music and the barking dogs and the overly loud vehicles, sometimes all I need is to pinpoint where the sound is coming from and it helps me to move on. \n\nI fear my neighbors will think Im a Karen if I got over with even the reasonable request of not letting their dog bark for hours on end (consistently) or I ask them to turn the music down, during the day when music is permitted. Does anyone else have this problem? I dont feel like its unreasonable and at the same time can understand how it can come across.\n\nPlease tell me Im not alone in this! For what it is worth, I think this has nothing to do with misophonia and everything to do with just living in a neighborhood. You are not out of line to ask people to keep the noise down. \n\nDo you work from home? Or do some schooling? Because that would be a handy reason to have. I think people respond better when you can say something like, \"I am sorry, I am working from home and your dog's barking/music/etc. is a little loud. I have tried X, could you please keep him inside/turn it down?\" When you can be concrete in your question or answer, I think it helps.\n\nBut what kind of neighborhood are you in? An apartment complex, or a neighborhood with an HOA? There might be rules you can cite, or a committee you can go to if that is the case. \n\nI wonder if you could try some noise, like white noise or brown noise. My daughter listens to brown noise during meals because it drowns out the sounds that bother her better than white noise. But some kind of noise generator might help. Good luck. I am a stay at home mom, I do use white noise. I just hate feeling disconnected from my kids when Im wearing my headphones or ear plugs, also its important to be able to hear them if they get hurt or I need to break up a fight. My neighborhood doesnt have and HOA, my husband can ignore these things so much easier than myself. I want to crawl into a ball in the dark with headphones and he just sees it as a minor annoyance , mainly because Im annoyed so he is annoyed. City rules say I can make a barking dog log and submit it for investigation only after Ive spoken to/written my neighbors about the problem. You are def not alone. My main triggers for a while now is bass coming from most of my neighbors surrounding me . Either it is coming from their homes or cars driving by or pulling up to their houses. :/ you feeling the way you do is definitely not unreasonable . Our neighbors should take into consideration that others live around them and loud noises are a nuisance but I know that is easier said than done. I hope things get better for you. Hahaha, OH YES. At my former residence, there was a dog that barked 16+ hours a day, every day, for three years. I cannot tell you how many times I called the cops, made police reports, etc., and the results were usually in the form of various acts of vandalism on my property. I was made out to be a Karen. The guy was finally cited into court and made to silence the dog.\n\nWhere I currently live, there have been four dogs that have been severely problematic. One neighbor took great offense to my request to keep his goddamn dog quiet and off my property and the problem got worse. Thankfully they moved. Another neighbor is elderly and disabled and has a small yappy terrier that he just lets bark and bark and bark and I cannot even sleep in my own room because of it. There are two others that are less of an issue but I cannot go into my yard without being barked at the entire time. I am known as the neighborhood \"dog hater\" because I do not like incessant barking.\n\nBottom line is this\" they know their noises is irritating and they simply do not care. Making them aware that you have an issue with it will likely make them do it more, and you will become a target. It is not worth it. I swear, every time I go out to find the barking dog IT STOPS BARKING \ud83d\ude02 and then I cant pinpoint the house to make a report. Im supposed to go to them first to complain before sending the report in, I can talk to them in person or leave a note. Im going to attempt to report it without doing that so that I dont become a target for them. Its still happening, also its not nice for the pets. They were letting the dog bark on like 100 degree days and now its cold and they leave it out at night in the cold, its sad. OMG THIS. It took me more than a year to find one of the dogs that was torturing me on a daily basis because it would bark for hours but the SECOND I crossed the threshold onto my porch, it stopped. HOW? Talk about frustrating! saw an AITA where a guy uses a one of those loud foghorn things , not to silence the dog but to alert the neighbors to let the dog in \ud83d\ude02 my husband and I are contemplating it! For me, the air horn does work. At my wits end, I finally bought one last summer when the barking became so problematic that I was having dark thoughts about not being here anymore almost constantly. It was that bad. Sure pisses off the neighbors, but has given me some control over peace in my own home, and I do not think the dark thoughts anymore. Prior, the neighbor let the barking episodes go on for HOURS and I could not really function anymore. He would just sit there and ignore the dog. Now, the episodes rarely exceed 5 minutes, and the horn comes out if they do. Highly recommend if you have exhausted other options like I did. Yeah I am going to pick one up, you have convinced me UPDATE: I finally figured out where the barking is coming from! It is my Nextdoor neighbors, I know this seems obvious but I literally did not know they had a dog (they are newer neighbors and I never see them). I at least have an address for any formal complaint but I went over today and they brought the dog in. Recently my neighbors neighbor took down the fence between houses, that is when the barking started. My guess is they have had to star chaining up their dog to keep him out of their neighbors yard which explains the barking. \n\nAlso they are college aged so I am pretty sure I will look like a Karen no matter what \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I do not care anymore as long as the barking stops.", "Medication works  ", "Boss still feeling under the weather and triggering me--scared to go back to work and listen to it  I know this is so ridiculous and stupid but I have misophonia and sound sensitivity.

The easy way is to look up your area and Misophonia, but that rarely works. The middle way is to call them first and ask if they have experience. Lastly, you can find scientific journals documenting Misophonia, and contact those who worked on it for help.

I was so happy she understood, personally she does not do any of my triggers but having her help with it is amazing. I am still afraid of telling my dad though, he would probably just tell me: \"Stop exaggerating with that stuff, you do not have it\" or something like that. Congratulations!", "Fun times  Lol, I relate to this too much", "I have been homeschooled for the last three years because of misophonia and I feel like giving up. \n\n\n\nMy misophonia got so bad that I was trying to get sick on purpose just so I did not have to go to school and hear people snacking in class all day. I was even thinking of throwing myself down the stairwell balcony so I could break my legs and get some type out of school. I was in so much pain from people eating snacks that I jabbed pencils into my arm and cut up my arm with pencils to try to distract myself from the noise. My mom let me become cyberschooled.\n\nI hated cyberschool. The work was extremely difficult and I had 12 hours of schoolwork a day. The instructions were always very unclear, and even though I spent so much time on this stuff, I was learning nothing. \n\nI was crying so hard every night and wanted so badly to kill myself. My mom let me become \u201cunschooled\u201d. I was just trying to get to the point where I would not want to die every hour of the day. As soon as I was getting better, my mom started freaking out that I was going to be taken back to public school because I was doing nothing. I ended up passing that year because I guess the evaluator felt bad for me? (That was 8th grade) \n\nFor 9th grade, we got all these paper booklet curriculums. The cheapest ones were some crappy Christian curriculum. The English was extremely difficult. I was always the worst at reading in my class, even though I was in the gifted program back when I was in public school. The grammar was very advanced and I was very lost. The math curriculum was horrible. All it did was make me memorize long phrases that I did not understand and I did not know how to do any equations. The science and social studies was ok but really boring. Stress always makes my misophonia way worse. To avoid feeling suicidal, I would just skip schoolwork for the entire day. Not wanting to die felt good, so I would just skip the entire day again. And again. And again. And then I had half the school year left to do and only two months to do it in. So I would create insane schedules where I would do 18 hours of work a day. I would wake up at 4:00am and start, then get very confused and quit. It was the covid year, so everyone got a pass. \n\nNow it is 10th grade (currently) and I am doing the journaling method. I just do 40 minutes a day per subject for 180 days. I use no curriculum. Just learning from the internet sources and books. It was amazing. But my mom keeps freaking out. I had to do giant projects 5 months ago, apparently. She never told me about this, ever. I have to show all this stuff I did. I am in the strictest homeschool laws state, so I have to make a portfolio for the high school end of the year evaluation. So I look up how to make a homeschool portfolio in my state. I find a video where this lady helps her daughter in 9th grade make this beautiful complex portfolio. She is doing all these curriculums with no problem. She is able to write complicated essays and read lots of books, she is showing growth and improvement in math, being able to do more complicated problems over time. \n\nI am crying over this. I tried so hard to learn and do curriculums and I just cannot. It stressed me out so much. My triggers are so bad around human noises that I can barely talk to my mom more than a few sentences a day. I cannot have a tutor or cyberschool videos. I have to read curriculums but I never understand. I am in 10th grade and never finished a single curriculum. It is my 3rd year attempting geometry and I still do not understand. My mom says I am going to have to go back to public school if I cannot do it. I cannot go back to public school. My misophonia is making it impossible to do formal education. I know so much stuff, I just cannot read fast or do geometry. Why do I have to know this stuff just to get a job?? I want to drop out but then I will never be able to find a job. I do not know what to do. My goodness you poor thing! I remember the days suffering in school because of misophonia.. snack time in elementary, loud gum chewing in middle and high school.. I do not know how I survived all that tbh. \n\nHowever, you are situation is quite unique and may be beyond the help of a misophonia sub. I will whatever advice I can though maybe it will help. Have you considered therapy or something like that? They could formally evaluate you and say whether or not you are fit for school or certain environments. \n\nIf you *do* go back to public school, it is awful I know but not the end of the world. There is things to try. Like wireless noise cancelling earbuds (and a doctor\u2019s permission to use them would help a lot), or doing the \u201cif you cannot beat them, join them\u201d tactic like: chewing gum loudly yourself. It helped me sometimes. \n\nIf all else fails, please know that there is plenty of work out there that do not require solid education! Might be hard to find but it exists. Lots of retail, food, factory, and labor work may not need education. I know of some youtubers/content creators who dropped out of high school and never looked back (not saying everyone should do this, but it is another possible path). If you have spare time try and hone in on your talents (art? Writing? Music?) and practice them. You could make something of them someday!\n\nSorry if I do not have the best advice, but it is all I could think of. Definitely reach out to other subs or resources about this to get more answers. Best of luck \u2764\ufe0f I was lucky enough they enforced a no snack/ no gum chewing policy at my school. Some people got away with it but it almost never happened. Maybe there is a way to propose that idea? Thanks for being kind. I tried pretty much everything you mentioned back when I was in school and none of them worked. They school basically told me that they cannot help me in any way except to let me sit in the lobby all day, which is not learning. Thanks for listening though I would be hated by everyone and be called \u201cKaren\u201d. I see, I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can try to avoid school altogether but, I am sure your mom would need convincing. Maybe counseling/therapy would convince her that you are unfit for school but I know it can cost money to do that. Perhaps suggest it anyways, and also, it could help manage your miso symptoms too (can be hit or miss for us though). Sorry I could not help more, but hang in there, it is not the end of the world, I assure you :) I have been in therapy for two years Oh I see. Has it helped at all? Your miso or other things? Therapists I think can give permission for certain things, like if you are suitable for school or not. Or maybe doctors, I am not sure. I will have to ask her I had the worst time in school because of my misophonia. Luckily there were no snack/no gum in class rules but I live in the desert where allergies are god awful; and if you are not originally from here, you never really get acclimated to it. So for me it was constant fucking sniffing. I would be sitting in class during a test and all I hear is a chorus of sniffling and it made it very hard for me to concentrate. I felt like scraping out my brain and would dig my nails into my arms. The worst thing is that it did not end at home either...", "Talk to your loved ones about misophonia when you are not triggered. ", "my heart rate i genuinely do not know if this is the right tag for this or not. but does anyone else\u2019s heart rate skyrocket the second they are triggered? like i cannot hear anything but the triggering sound and my heart beating. people have tried asking me questions and i genuinely cannot hear the words. is that common? or even a symptom of misophonia or is that just my brain? \n\nAnd how long do people usually stay triggered after it happens? even if i remove myself the noise follows me sometimes it gets stuck in my head for over an hour repeating, which in turn the feeling will not leave my body. nothing seems to make it better. Yes, I can come back and edit this with citations, but there are studies that have measured physiological responses to misophonia This happens to me too! I also start to sweat profusely", "Does anyone associate certain people with triggers so much that *any* noise they make becomes incredibly irritating? One of my family members' eating sounds I just cannot stand. Smacking, slurping, all of it is just unbearable. I have noticed that with time, I now have an aversion to other sounds they make, which perhaps would not annoy me from someone else? Breathing, hitting a spoon against a pan while making soup, walking in shoes indoors, and so on. It is really pushing my buttons, and I do not know what to do about it. I was wondering whether anyone else goes through this? My brother has had tourettes from a very young age. His tics were mainly sniffing and coughing. It got less ober puberty, bjt is still there. So now every sound he makes, appears incredibly loud and triggering. On top of that he is a very loud eater and does not have a lot of social awareness when it comes to eating at a reasonable pace or always standing in the way and not moving.\nI definitely feel you with this. It is like being conditioned to finding this specific person always as an extreme. I have felt this way on a lower level, where one family member eats and drinks particularly obnoxiously. overtime just the noises they make with their mouth (heavy breathing, saliva moving around, tongue clicking, etc.) even their footsteps are kind of annoying if I have nothing to focus on. I just try to do whatever I need to do when they are around and avoid being confined inside with them so I do not develop negative feelings toward that person because I love them and they are a good person. It is irritating, I just do what I always do: Be as fast as I can and get out. Yes.  Misophonia is very personal for me.  Some people can make trigger noises and it does not bother me at all. Yes.\n\nI hate this cruel thing :-( I have projected this onto my mother. I hate it. I hate that my mither thinks i hate her. I hste misophonia. It fucks me up, it fucks me and my relationship with my family up. Its sickening. yep, it is gotten so bad that i get awful, *disgusting* intrusi7e thoughts about these two people. you see that 7 there yeah? i cannot type that fucking letter because of the association to one of the persons. it is too much. i had to mo7e class recently because i could not fucking stand looking at their face anymore it was so damn uncomfortable. my misophonia is a mix of autism and childhood trauma. I hate my stepfather. I worked in tech support with a guy that was very robotic in his customer service voice; we had a script to follow, and he followed it perfectly, but his voice and mannerisms while on the phone would eat away at me to the point where I could not get any work done.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that he was such a nice, kind, good person.  He lived to help other people.  He was just very very poor at customer service because he was painfully socially awkward, so I hated myself for getting so angry. Same for me, was wondering why ? yes, my mom- but ive noticed this sort of irritation spreading towards my feelings of others too. its heading towards the general public now, but it started with her. youre not alone on this Yep. Actually sometimes it is their personality that makes the sounds disgusting. It is definitely progressive though, like a snowball effect. Mine are part childhood trauma too. I am still trying to sort out the misophonia from the PTSD, would not be surprised if they are comorbid in a lot of people I relate to this a lot. And it scares me to some extent because the person might be literally just sitting, not making a single noise, yet my mind would be raging and the fight or flight mode would be triggered, with endless intrusive thoughts, by just looking at them existing. You said your best solution was to leave but the compassionate side of me does not let me. That family member of mine really needs emotional support right now because of stress and the pandemic. Also they really bond over food and I get triggered by eating sounds. Is there anything else you can recommend for situations like those? I think I sense a person's emotions (or my interpretation of their emotions) through their eating.  A lot of the time when I hear someone eating, it feels like they are expressing extremely negative emotions (usually arrogance, but also indifference, callousness, anger).  Sometime it is just pure disgust at the sound though.\n\nWith people that I like, my positive feelings toward them reinterpret the eating sound in a positive way.  But this is very rare.  It is almost always negative with most people. oh, I wish I could help but there is not much I can say, as I have no real solutions. I do try to interact at other times and if we are both engaging directly with each other or outside, it is fine. It is just the inadvertent noises they make when eating or watching a movie or something. If anyone else replies I would be happy to take those suggestions though. oh my god. i also feel the exact same!!!! idk why, but since a while ago, every single noise my best friend made (pen tapping, chair tapping) all became super annoying, but I will be fine if anyone else made the same noise!! So i keep avoiding her, but i dont hate her, just the noises she makes :(( Well then, it looks like you are eligible for swappityswap.

She does it bit by bit so I cant tell her to stop, as shes barely making noise but I just can hear it SUPER SUPER clear. Im on verge of tears biting my fingers most of the time. Until today, ive had enough. I got up, moved to the very front of the class and... I couldnt hear it. How glad I was. The lesson was so pleasant and I did my work well. Now tho... I am afraid. I am going to go and sit on the front tomorrow too, but... what if i hear it? What if i still hear the horrible sound? Im so anxious, i dont want to hear it. I know because i can hear my mom smacking across our apartment when my door is closed. I dont want to hear the smacking i dont want to hear, i want peace... please why cant people be polite why do you even need to chew gum... its not even fun... Bring some headphones or earplugs or whatever, listen to some bangers or my advice; listen to fans on youtube, the spinning kind. Compared to hearing her chewing it will sound like euphoria embodied. I do have headphones, I changed the seats because the horrible noise was getting through. Now I moved seats forward and............. I fucking hear it. I dont want to listen to music loud because I want to follow the lesson, so I might try the fans. Thanks bro Ah shit that sucks man, this is probably not the same where you are but in my high school you have the option of having every lesson on Teams (basically zoom), maybe that could be something to look into? I get that you probably do not want to bring this up with teachers or anything, but it is always a possibility. \n\nAnother thing you could maybe do is chew gum yourself, studies have shown that mimicking your triggers helps you deal with them, a sort of coping mechanism. I would say it is worth it to buy a bit of gum to avoid ripping your own hair of your head. Oh I wish, I live in a very small town so that is not a possibility sadly. I might try the gum thing tho, maybe its just my inner child being jealous that she has gum and I dont.

I sent him some articles about misophonia but idk if he is read them yet. I do not know how to get him to see that it is not about him specifically. They say the origins of misophonia through evolution was by memorizing sounds from things that would cause danger or harm. We tend to panic around those we spend the most time with because the sounds have been memorized. Then we get into the territory of PTSD-type experiences because the sounds are not just torturous at the moment, they linger in our thoughts for a long time afterward as well. And while we are dealing with the aftermath of the panic and bad feelings, we think to ourselves that we will do ANYTHING to not feel that way ever again. It often feels like they should have all the sounds they make memorized too, as it would be easier for everyone if they just did not make the sound in the first place. Once I realized this was nearly impossible, I have found better techniques to deal with them or even prevent them from happening. The thing that has worked pretty well with me and my partner is that I ask him to pay attention for that look of panic on my face, and then he asks me if it is misophonia or something else. It gives me a moment to gather my thoughts. It helps him understand that it is the sound and not him. We talk about it for a moment, make the necessary adjustments, and move forward. It is not perfect and does not work every single time, but the main factor here is his willingness to participate in a routine in how to get out of that situation together. I hope that helps! Same with my Family. They  just think I am an intolerant asshole. this is incredibly helpful! I had not thought of it that way. I am going to convey this to him and hopefully it will help us. thank you! My mom actually has the worst misophonia of anyone I know. I used to be the one to drive her crazy! I used to get mad at how she would talk to me, like \"jesus christ cannot you chew more quietly\" or give me a look. But now I am the one doing it to my partner!!! It is weird to be on the other side of it. It also makes me wonder what sounds I actually make that I am not aware of. Dump him.\n\nI could never be with anyone who triggers me and does not respect that I have misophonia. Duke University and Misophonia Education will be having a seminar on navigating relationships.

(TW for desc. of sounds and mentions of abuse) I have something called complex PTSD which is a different flavor of PTSD that can happen in people who experienced prolonged abuse (usually as children). It was sexual abuse, and the abuser was my father, who I now live with as an adult (lost my job, trying to get out, financially dependent). We all act like nothing ever happened.\n\nThe sounds he makes while eating have always triggered feelings of violation/disgust/rage in me. (TW for desc. ahead) Unfortunately he suffered a brain injury a few years ago. The injury affected his ability to control/coordinate movement, including the movement of his mouth. Now he smacks his lips even louder and makes unusual snorty noises. He eats with his mouth open and aspirates his food sometimes, resulting in a very wet round of hacking. His voice is also a trigger unto itself because his diaphragm and vocal chords are going haywire, making his voice very high pitched, whistly, and raspy. His mouth also cannot form consonants super well so it is slurred and wet sounding. Hearing these sounds triggers feelings of violation and anger. It is hard to not be genuinely angry with him for the sounds that result from his disability because, well, I am already angry with him for molesting me.\n\nI guess I am asking if anyone else here has a history of sexual abuse, and whether that interacts with their misophonia. *whom* I now live with Yes. The sound of fans and similar white noise causes anxiety and distress because my pedophile rapist uncle was obese enough that he always felt too hot, so he always had a fan blowing on him. Even in his truck he had a mini fan mounted in the dashboard. Yes. Sounds my parents make are the worst triggers. Followed second by romantic partners. I believe my miso is intertwined with my trauma. I was genuinely pissed until I noticed this was a bot.  ", "I keep contemplating suicide. I cannot stop thinking about how much I want to die because of misophonia. Everyday now, there is a new trigger. Everyday is a struggle to not breakdown and cry. I am tired of feeling this way. Tired of wearing headphones 24/7 and not being able to enjoy going out in public cause of my triggers. Tired of not being able to simply sit down and relax because I am so sensitive to the point I can feel very low vibrations caused by my trigger noises.\n\nMisophonia holds me back from my dreams. It holds me back from getting the education I desire. I cannot hold a job anymore cause if it. Now I cannot live in my apartment because I am triggered by vibrations. I cannot sleep at night. No wonder I just want to die.\n\nI just want help. No one around me seems to really understand or want to help. I feel hopeless like the only solution to this is death. I know I am being irrational. I have read about others getting help in here.  I just do not think anything like that exist in the state that I am in. \n\nIf anyone on here knows of some specialist that I can talk to, I would be very much appreciated. Misophonia is controlling my life. I am ready to have my life back to some normalcy. Im sorry if this breaks a rule I just do not know who else to turn to for help. This seemed like the place to post it. \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

My heart goes out to you. I trigger easily when people eat or chew gum. Has made wanting to even eat around people unappetizing and straight to flight mode. Have you considered experiencing with psychedelics to ease with it? This has helped me and please do not hurt yourself. I think you should do some research into mushrooms or lsd to combat this diseases mentally. Opposed to headphones or just leaving I highly suggest you use a helpline. Im sorry you are experiencing this. I hope healing comes your way. \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc95Reading this made me think about how my brother could understand the severity of my misophonia if I killed myself because of it..then he would finally understand because he never takes me seriously. I feel so bad for you because I know how you feel. Nearly everyone in this sub and the other misophonia sub report that antidepressants take the edge off. Also there is another treatment being studied that currently works well for anxiety and depression. I am hoping to try it myself once it is approved for misophonia. One last suggestion is CBD oil, which has the effect of helping to tolerate the discomfort of the anxiety and depression that comes with misophonia. My point is that there is hope for an effective treatment and until then, you can get some relief from antidepressants and/or CBD. I hope it helps you to know that there are a lot of us suffering with this (you are not alone) and that there are treatments you can begin either now or in the near future to help ease the pain. Hang in there! \u2764\ufe0f Please do not give up. I am 51 with misophonia. And misokinesis. It is hard but you will find ways to adjust over time. The best thing to do, in my experience, is get a lot of exercise(a lot!!), and a lot of sleep.\nPlease do not get discouraged. Please hang in there. I know how trapping and horrible that situation feels but there really are ways to make it better. Personally, when I was on the edge like this from my misophonia, SSRI antidepressants (lexapro for me) ended up being what saved me. If possible, I would really suggest giving them a shot because they are life changing. Having a therapist to talk to about your triggers and how they make you feel, as well as coping mechanisms, is also really helpful. I hope this gets better for you. Oh, love. I am so sorry. I suffer from misophonia and suicidal ideation as well. One of the ways I manage my reaction to my triggers is through a therapy known as Dialectical Behavior Therapy. One component of DBT is distress tolerance. Most of the course is actually online for free if you cannot access mental health care.  My heart seriously goes out to you, an I really feel for where you mentioned new and worsening triggers. I cannot stand certain sounds even if I am the one making the sound.  \n\n\nMy DMs are open if you need to talk, vent or whatever. Gods bless.", "I feel awful because my dog triggers my misophonia really bad I have two dogs but only one of them triggers my misophonia really bad. I love her so much and it makes me feel like a monster for getting so angry at the sounds she makes. She is constantly licking and making mouth noises. She is such a good dog and listens really well, so if she is licking her paw or her blanket and I just say \u201cCarmen stop\u201d she will immediately stop. But now my boyfriend is making it unbearable for me because he lets her lick his face or hand and I cannot stand it. I have to leave the room. Sometimes I will get really upset and cry and just beg that he please not let the dog lick him around me. she is a compulsive licker but I have trained her not to lick me, I do not understand why my boyfriend will not make her stop for me. He thinks she is showing love by \u201cgiving kisses\u201d but I honestly think it is bad for the dog to be doing anyway since it is a nervous behavior. I need to get him to take this serious and put an end to this. He just thinks it is funny that I could get so upset by a sound. And I should add that she is my dog, not his.", "Why is my misophonia getting better all of a sudden?  So basically I, a 13 year old female, found that my panic, anger and tears over sounds small sounds has a name; misophonia. For the past 4 years, I would have extreme emotional reactions to chewing, jacket rustling, clattering pots, bass sounds from music, and many more. A month after discovering the name, I decided to tell my parents I think I have it, to hopefully resolve the frustration and damaged relationships I have caused. They were super understanding and supportive, offering to buy noise-cancelling earbuds, and go to a clinic after quarantine. I think this explained A LOT for them.\n\nBut something I have noticed is how much better it is gotten after I told them. I did not know it could just go away like that. I still feel anger to chewing and a few other sounds, but to many less, and the reaction is not as strong. I am glad my tears and panic attacks and down to less, but I do have a fear;\n\nWhen I get tested, the results come back as negative. This means that my \"rudeness\", \"attention-seeking\" and \"over-reacting\" was all some selfish act. That there is not some explanation for my outrageous behavior over the past 4 years due to the smallest sounds. My parents will probably think I just made an excuse to save myself.\n\nSomeone please help! This is purely anecdotal, but maybe it will help your family understand misophonia better: I am 27 and have had misophonia and misokinesia (same thing but visual) since I was in elementary school. It has changed so much between then and now, and it will continue to change: it is gotten better, gotten worse again, gotten REALLY TERRIBLE, gotten a little better; I have gotten new triggers, and I have had triggers that stopped being triggers\u2014 a lot of the things that set my misophonia off are situational and based on how able I am to get out of a situation.\n\nConsider it a win that you have fewer sensory triggers! That makes sense because you have been given outs\u2014 whether it is your family understanding if you have to leave the room/cope in a way that feels hard to explain, having headphones to block noise, or whatever other supports you all have put in place. I am glad things are going well for you, but I just wanted to say that Misophonia cannot be diagnosed professionally right now. There is no test or results, and I think you should tell your parents that before they try to find a special 'Misophonia Clinic'. Just know that this is the way your brain is wired. You cannot help it and you are not being selfish :) Have you told them it is been better since you got this off your chest? I have had this my whole life (in my 50's now) and it has come and gone over the years - sometimes intense, sometimes mild, sometimes I think it is gone for good but then it comes back.  I notice for me it is related to stress, and also, someone chewing who is a person I am annoyed with, or am not able to express my true feelings to.\n\nAlso, try to remember it does not matter what other people think about your experience in your body. You are the expert of that, no one else can know what you feel or how you experience things. If you always talk about it like this:  \"when you do x, I feel y, and I need z, how would that be for you?\"  It is a way you can express what you need without the possibility of argument, because who can argue with your feelings? They are yours! And you get to set a boundary for yourself, which others can choose to respect or ignore... But if they ignore, there is a consequence (you do not spend time with them, or whatever you decide.)\n\nAnd if someone does try to argue, you just repeat your feelings, and your boundary \"I feel y when you do x, and I need z.\") Try not to engage in a useless argument over it. In the end, you just need people to stop chewing (or whatever) around you because it makes you miserable, they do not have to understand it or agree with **why**, they just need to respect it, which they will do if they care about you and your feelings. . Thank you for this. A lot of people tell me that I am overreacting and that it is just pet peeves. So many people do not understand or respect my boundaries with this and I am having a hard time explaining it to them. I will try this. Thank you. Good luck! And you can use this for pretty much anything in your life. I wish I had learned it at your age. \nI meant to use an example, \"when you are chewing, I feel a tingling up my spine and instantly feel a rage. It scares me because I do not control it, it just happens. When it does, I need to be able to leave the room and find a quiet place to just be. Can you let me leave the room without saying anything about it?\". And another one: \"When you say my reaction to chewing is a 'pet peeve\" it makes me feel like you are not listening to me, I feel hurt, I feel like you do not believe me. I need you to stop saying that. If you do not, I will not want to talk to you or hang out with you anymore, because I only want to hang out with people who believe in me.\"", "Anyone interested in discussing about misophonia?

I have been reading that the onset of misophonia is often at a young age. In retrospect, I may have had misophonia much earlier than when I actually recognized it as being a problem. I had noticed that I tended to get more irritated with certain noises than the average person but it was not over the top to the point that I would have expected that I had some type of a condition.\n\nIt was not until my late 30s that my misophonia became progressively worse. I began to notice that the sounds that made me very irritated before were now making me feel downright anger toward the person making the noise. In my 40s, I developed physical and vocal tics and, although those would also present for other types of tension, they would almost always happen with misophonia. I would seethe inside, build up tension and release it with the tics. I am now in my early 60s and it has only gotten worse.\n\nHas anyone else had this happen where the misophonia did not become problematic until around their 30s and then gotten progressively worse?", "Memes I made  I used instagram and forgot to crop bc I am not perfect I get that slurping is \"needed to enjoy it quickly even tho it is hot\" whether it is noodles or coffee/tea but geez I do not get it.  \nI like my coffee drinkable.  \nPpl throw away coffee if it is not hot lmao ever heard of iced coffee? /vent Why serial killers?", "Misophonia be like: Brother: *constant, loud sniffing, mouth breathing*\n\nMind: ARHRUGHRHEFHFHRHRFHRHRHFFHFHRRHEGFFY STOPPPPPPP\n\nMouth: Do you want a tissue? yes Followed by \n\n\"But I was not sniffing though...\"\n\nNah, you were. \"Babe you are chewing with your mouth open again, maybe if you took smaller bites...?\"\n\"I am NOT chewing with my mouth open!?\"", "Active Miso Support Groups?

It then progressed to any persons eating sounds. Then any persons coughing/sneezing etc sounds. And so on. But now, I find myself triggering myself?\n\nI cannot STAND the sound of my own eating, or other own noises. I always have to eat with a show or music playing loudly to avoid hearing myself. But if I hear myself even make ONE noise, I get totally furious and disgusted, and I have to completely stop eating. I have thrown out so much food, and I sometimes even avoid making/eating a meal all together because I cannot stand it. \n\nThe fear/digust/anger with everyone elses\u2019 noises has isolated me from eating or even being around any other people. But it is now happening with myself? How do I escape myself?? Is there anyone who can relate, and what do you do for it? This happens to me sometimes too. Some days I cannot even eat. \nI am so sorry you are dealing with this as well. I do sometimes if I yawn a little louder than I normally do. I get triggered by my own pulse sometimes. Anyone else? There is no other sound or noise that I or my body makes that bothers me at all except for this. My heart beat is always super hard?? Like you can easily see my chest moving with every heart beat and it is like I can hear it somehow. Sometimes it beats so hard my entire body shifts and I cannot focus on anything and it drives me insane!! Ah man im sorry you are dealing with this. Idk if the jaw movements would effect the sound in any way but what if you put headphones in while you eat? Blast some heavy metal haha. Maybe both the TV on and headphones in to tone it out the best you can? If eating a full meal would be too much at once; maybe try smaller meals or various snacks throughout the day so you are still eating something. Maybe for breakfast you could try smoothies, yogurt for a snack, etc. Foods that would not be too loud to chew? Hope you find something that helps :) \n\nI work from home so i always have my tv up super loud and my airpods blasting all day to avoid any possibility of hearing my neighbors stomp upstairs \ud83d\ude43 I commented this to OP as well but maybe you could keep ingredients to make smoothies or shakes for those days? Also Yogurt, applesauce, ice cream, etc. Any soft foods that would produce very limited noise that may be a little bit easier! May not be an ideal meal for a day but it is something :) hope you find something that helps! Definitely thank you so so much!! :) Sometimes. Usually when I am thinking about it myself its weird Sometimes I get triggered by myself. I usually just try to keep my mind away from my sounds, but since it happens to you regularly, I would try to chew a bit quieter or try to sneeze very softly. I really hope it helps and tell me how it goes! I do get triggered by myself, though honestly it is never been as severe as when I hear it from elsewhere.  You know how your voice sounds one way to you while you talk but if you record it and play it back it sounds really different?  It is like that, but yes, it does still trigger something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully you are not undereating due to this.  If chewing and crunching is an issue, maybe you can have like, drinkable soups and meal replacement shakes on hand, just to make sure that when this happens you can still nourish yourself?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you are able to find something that helps. &lt;3", "I need help, it is driving me insane I did not know I had Misophonia until my grandmother started sucking her gapped  teeth. She does it after she eats anything. And my Step Grandfather started living with us. He is a mucky eater, smacks his lips eating ANYTHING. Unfortunately I get super angry when it is a family dinner and I hear teeth sucking and lip smacking with throat noises. Does anyone have any suggestions to help? Without headphones. And my step dad is now telling me to mature I am sorry you are dealing with this. Whether it is misophonia or just these noises that bother you, it does not make the problem less real, or easier to deal with.\n\nThis might be useful: (\n\nThat site has other info that might be useful as well.\n\nIt is hard to suggest something without headphones. My daughter developed misophonia over this last year, and she is triggered by eating sounds. At meals, she wears noise-canceling headphones and listens to brown noise, which drowns out the sounds but allows us to have a conversation, we just have to speak up.\n\nMisophonia seems to be tied to anxiety or stress, so maybe you can go at it indirectly that way. My daughter is seeing a therapist about anxiety and misophonia, and the therapist is using a cognitive behavioral therapy approach. Perhaps you can find some exercises that help you relax and get control of your reactions. \n\nI do not have misophonia myself, but one thing I have noticed reading this subreddit is that a lot of people have defensive reactions when asked to stop making noises, etc. I know and you know it is not about *them*, but I think when someone is told \"This noise you are making bothers me,\" what they *hear* is \"*You are* bothering me,\" and so they react badly. \n\nI am not sure how to get around that, but maybe you can figure out a way to approach your family. Use some info from the site above, or from a government site like NIH. Be clear that this is not something you can control, although you are trying to manage it.\n\nGood luck. Thank you, I appreciate this. Talking to them is not even an option. One is mentally ill and the other has dementia. I will look at the link. Thanks again. You are welcome, and I am sorry, dementia and any mental illness is not easy to deal with at the best of times.\n\nLike I said, I do not have this myself, but I am learning a lot as we try to help our daughter. There is not a ton of info out there, but there is some. \n\nMostly I encourage you to remember: this is a condition, not anything you are doing wrong. You are not spoiled, you are not acting out, you are not immature. You are trying to deal with a neurological problem. I am sorry your stepfather was not more supportive, and I hope you can kind of tune him out. He is wrong in this instance.\n\nI hope you have someone else you can rely on or talk to, because this is a lot to do yourself. But it sounds like you can handle it. I try to handle it. My biggest thing is thanksgiving is coming up and if I cannot wear headphones (hence step dad telling me to mature) I honestly do not know what I can do to cancel out the sound. I constantly do \u201cpotty breaks\u201d during dinners. But the teeth sucking still goes on for probably an hour after dinner. You could show him an article about misophonia, maybe he is willing to listen then He is not, he claims it bothers him to. He said \u201cI just need to have patients\u201d. Very frustrating on both ends. Could you just woof down your food as quickly as you can and get done and get away from them? I could. Not great table manners though. I think I will just sneak the headphones. Not great table manners either. But what they do not know cannot hurt them right? My misophonia made me a world class speed eater.   I discovered it is a great way to get out of bad situations. Damn. This would bother the hell out of me. Yeah, pretty much. At one point I got so frustrated with the teeth sucking. I said \u201cDo you need some floss?\u201d The answer was no. But like ffs why are you sucking on them then?!", "How do we survive Some of the most common triggers are open chewing, lip smacking, sniffing, etc. But literally, everyone does them, and it is no one's fault. We cannot change the world population's manners. How do we deal with this? just endure it? how do you guys deal with people who say you are overdramatic or do not take misophonia seriously? Know you are not alone! I have the same triggers and resort to ear plugs and headphones when avoidance will not work. It is tough but take it one episode at a time.

Usually when I know it will happen, I plug my ears and rub them to drown out noise, but I had absolutely no warning before the ad started playing and immediately the noise over and over. I am so mad, I just wanted to calm down and relax. To make matters even worse, I also have OCD and when the ad played I hit my phone and it bounced off of my bed and onto the dirty floor, so instead of relaxing I had to go get something to clean it off while also trying to get the sound to stop ringing in my ears.

It started to get worse and worse. It gives me palpitations. I can stand almost any other noise (I hate some repetitive noises and the sounds of some letters, but not as badly as this, maybe because usually when people eat, they are done an hour later or less, or because I get to get away from those sounds, but I can get tf out of my house) but their voices. The thing is that I think that because of all the stress they have put on me for years, I am starting to hate other sounds because I just cannot rest well so i feel like my ears are more sensitive to sound. It is not that they cause me pain, it is that if I hear them, I just lose focus or cannot sleep. I am not sure if this is because I am anxious and sort of depressed and I just need to get away from reality but their voices bring me back, or if it is because I have a problem. All I know is that this is making my life miserable. I have not slept well in almost a month and I do not know what to do. They do not seem to understand that even if they do not speak loudly, what I need is silence (well, i cannot tell. Them to shut up) and I also hate the stupid TV noise even if it is not loud. Or their music. Or them distracting me from anything. I do not hate my parents. I have a great relationship with my mother and with my dad it is usually bad but rn is alright. It is just that I cannot stand how their talking or their music or TV even if at a low volume disrupts my whole life. They think I am being difficult, but I swear this makes me sick. Is this misophonis, hyperacusia, a consequence of my lifelong anxiety that was sort of under control, depression (I feel empty, I lost everything that means anything to me and I tell myself lies everyday to cope, which is why I say that I hate how those voices distract me and send me back to reality), stress, or what? Please help me.", "Need help with approaching my sister about her misophonia Hi, like the title says, I need some help with approaching my younger sister about her misophonia. She absolutely hates the sounds of chewing and loud eating and has been dealing with it as long as I can remember, but as of recent years it seems to have gotten worse. I used to have misophonia myself but was able to overcome it so I understood how she felt and was able to adjust (?) myself around her, and  I have tried talking to her about it before but she seemed to always brush it off.\n\nThe reason why I need help this time is because my parents have been constantly expressing their concerns about her but do not know how to talk directly to her (ESL parents). I am not sure how to do it this time because every time I try to talk to her about it she becomes unresponsive. My parents have become desperate and I want to help her as well because it is beginning to take an emotional toll on them.\n\nI have explained what it is to my parents but they still do not quite understand the concept completely and would end up confused when she would lash out on them or avoid/ignore them. Over time this resulted in her wearing earbuds 100% of the time with her music in full blast and never acknowledging their existence (which is another concern of theirs).\n\nSimply put, I want help to figure out an effective way to bring it up and offer her options in a way that she does not feel too \"attacked\". I will answer as many questions as I can! Kind of unrelated but she needs to stop listening to music so much ASAP. Or she might get hearing loss and TINNITUS and I cannot imagine smt worse for someone who already has misophonia... My parents and I have tried to warn her about playing her music so loud for long periods of time, but its just not going through to her :/ It is becoming increasingly difficult to get her to hear us out! You used to have misophonia and overcame it? not trying to be rude, but you do not seem to have a basic understanding of misophonia by making that statement.\n\ni suggest consulting the wiki for possible ways to help her\n\n( Sorry, I guess what I was trying to say come out the wrong way lol,, I meant to say that I used to have somewhat severe misophonia but wrote overcome as meaning that I was able to learn how to tolerate/manage it better! Apologies. Check out the documentary on Netflix called Quiet Please. My son has misophonia and I have done a lot of research about it but my husband and oldest son did not take it as serious. This documentary helped them understand it more.

We moved from the house we were renting for financial reasons; we all moved into our grandmother\u2019s house. We are a family of six now become a family of nine\u2014all cramped into in one, family-of-three-sized house. Needless to say, some of us are going to need to take some rooms as bedrooms that are not actually bedrooms. \n\nMy brother got his own room because he is in college. That is fair enough. I will not complain. I get it, I am lazy and he is not. But frankly, I do not see him coughing up any more rent than I am. And I believe I have a little better a reason to take a private room than he. \n\nThe room I call \u201cmy room\u201d is one half of a living room\u2014separated by cheap dividers with no way of locking shut or blocking out sound. My sister takes the other half. Every day, at around the same times, you will not find me in my \u201croom.\u201d Those noises drive me insane. This is a torture chamber for a misophone and I have acquired more trigger noises since we have been here. The smacking of lips and the infuriatingly soft gulp after the scraping sound of her chewing are beginning to drive me insane. I need that bedroom. I desperately need that fucking bedroom. But I know that I would be ignored, so what is the point in even asking for it? That is not a rhetorical question, by the way. I really need help with this.\n\nThis is a reasonable accommodation I am asking for. I am not asking anyone to stop chewing or swallowing their food. I am not asking anyone to change how they perform their necessary bodily functions.

Help! Hello! For a small back story, I am a 23 year old woman and I have had issues with misophonia for as long as I am aware of my surroundings (I have memories of this since I was 3 years old). My triggers are basically any sound or movement that becomes too repetitive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said. I have been in this job for about 3 months and everybody is really nice and calm but there is this particular co-worker that triggers me to no end. We are only 4 in the office most of the times and she sits right beside me. She is sweet and professional, (TW) but damn... she smacks her lips and she is humming all the time, she also keeps wobbling a pen between her fingers ALL DAY and dropping it constantly, she has very disjointed responses to conversations and repeats the last word of every sentence I speak. I had never met someone like her and I do wonder if this is soothing for her. I know it is not her fault and that she is not being malicious.\n\n \n\nIt is really hard for me, I am constantly tense, nauseous and distracted because of this and I do not know what to do. I have not been as efficient in my job and as dramatic as it sounds, it is because of the constant trigger. I need help because I really like this job and even though I have had misophonia for decades now, I have never been in a situation like this. Have you ever been trough something like this in the workplace? How did you cope? Any advice?  Earbuds saved my current job. My coworkers were so bad that I daydreamed about flipping my desk, telling everybody to fuck off, and leaving. I would have BAD anxiety attacks, to the point where I was having trouble breathing and trying not to bawl my eyes out. \n\nI got earbuds with a good hear-through feature, and then I turn on white (or whichever color you prefer) noise to drown out the background sounds that I cannot deal with. \n\nI also finally summoned up the nerve to tell my boss and coworkers that I had sensory problems that make me really sensitive to certain sounds. They now make a conscious effort to stop. It means a lot. I know it is my responsibility to manage my own symptoms, but oh my goodness having them on board helps. I am so happy for you. Gives me hope &amp; is kind of reassuring not all of us are doomed. Also kudos to your boss &amp; coworkers for trying to understand &amp; accommodate! It got to the point where I could not hide it anymore. I still struggle, but I am able to be here without wanting to crawl out of my skin. \n\nI strongly recommend anybody reading this try the different color frequencies. (White noise, brown noise, pink noise, etc.) I have found that different ones mask different sounds better. I have an entire playlist (titled \u201cI Hate People\u201d lol) of different options. Pink noise has been the best for blocking office noise for me. I tried all that at work too, but to no avail. This dude was SO LOUD I think because he might be partially deaf or something. That is the only explanation I can think of. So so so obnoxiously loud all the time. I tried talking to him, to my boss. You could hear him clear across the room, people I AM talking to on the phone would be like be like \"Is that Paul?!\" \"Yup, that is Paul\" \"He is so loud.\" \"I. know.\". Thank the gods that he transferred out of my dept. I think I would like to work in the one he does too, but definitely not while he works there. He is old and he really should retire. I have been in similar situations in the past.  I have a few ideas:\n\n1.  Could you come in earlier or later than him?  That way you avoid him.\n\n2.  This probably is not the best money advice.  Could you go out to lunch to avoid him?  You would not have to do lunch.  You could run an errand.\n\n3.  Are you able to take a break and get out?  Could you do a Starbucks run if they are 5 minutes away? Ha, customers say the same thing over the phone about my boss. \u201cTell him to be quiet!\u201d I will eventually leave for a wfh job. The volume levels are hard to deal with, but at least my trigger noises are minimized and can be blocked out now. \n\nI am so ready to sit in a quiet room in my house and always wear leggings as pants. I have been looking into soundproofing techniques. It is actually very interesting stuff. Yeah working from home for the past year has been pretty good for me. Aside from the kid upstairs who liked to run marathons wearing shoes indoors, who luckily has left and left me with peaceful wonderful quiet. for the most part. Quiet is so beautiful. I cannot make the change for a few more months, but I already cannot wait. The only honest conclusion I have been able to come to based on my experience is that, unless I can wear TOTAL isolation headphones and  have some sort of barrier blocking repetitive visuals, the office setting is not an option for me. Even with those accommodations, I am not wild about being tethered to a security blanket like headphones just to get through the day. It is burdensome.\n\nI have worked so many random jobs in my life and I suffered from so much stress during my office stints. It is just not worth it. Stress shortens you are life. Obviously everyone is affected to different levels of severity but take an honest look at your education and skill set while you are young and evaluate whether or not a lifetime of an office setting is even plausible for you.", "mmmm its Real New Trigger Hours k i meant to make a rant post about this like an hour ago but I got distracted looking at other r/misophoniasupport posts so ive had time to cool off before talking about this\n\nbut yaaay ive got a new fuckin trigger i guess.\n\nthe way my sister kisses my mom's dog on the head. such a wet and fucking bad sound. like.. why?\n\n\ni cant just tell her \"dont kiss the dog\" because. its just a display of affection. and its stupid to deny her that.\n\n\nbut i fucking hate it.\n\nthe dog came in my room and my sis also entered the room just to say hi &amp; then got distracted by the dog who wanted to be pet n such\n\nand we were chatting and she gave the dog a big ol smooch and i just died inside like a wet piece of tissue paper crippling to bits.\n\nfigured id just let it go bc hey its only one time and even though im dead inside its not going to repeat again within this interaction right?\n\nnaw she gives this dog another horrible wet smooch and then im like (internally) fuck it im out. its making me so fucking angry n,,, im trying very hard not to show it.\n\nso i just up and left my room quickly &amp; she noticed that i did it so briskly, and with such urgency, she asked if I was good and I was like \"yup\" trying to keep the interaction short bc I dont want to be in earshot of her when shes w the dog\n\nand of COURSE the dog follows me bc im goin fast and the dog is like \"oh running???? playtime?????\" and then my sis follows after the dog so im like, big awkward, bc im trying not to make it obvious that im avoiding both of them &amp; im also trying to seem as \"normal\" on the outside as possible (trying to just act like i wasnt just triggered) so im like hhhhhhhhfuck\n\nso eventually dog gets distracted by sis again and i flee to my room at a pace that the dog wont want to chase me at but omfg.\n\njust,,, internal seething.\n\nive never had a HUGE problem w the sound of ker kissing the dog b4.

I have had this happen before. Usually with visuals but it has happened. I end up waking up flustered and it has thrown my whole day off before. Does this seem to happen more often during times of stress? yes stress is definitely trigger for me. With that being the case, consider taking a walk or drive by yourself in a quiet area or use some sound canceling headphones and listen to some ethereal ambient music and give yourself a few minutes to decompress before heading to bed!

If this does not work out for you, the smoother the synthetic material generally the less noise its going to make.

So, I found this sub by pure accident, but it might be of great benefit to my kid, and I am wondering if you guys can help me help him...\n\nI have never heard about misophonia before, but when I read about some people's reaction to sounds, I knew it was relevant, but from what I gather, a lot of you suffer with the same trigger noises, which are not quite the same as my sons, so if I am in the wrong place, maybe you can advise me where I should go.\n\nHe is 12. His particular torture mostly (but not exclusively) is the sound and feel of certain types of paper. Particularly text book paper. We had years of him not doing certain homework, and having extreme reactions (sudden fury!) in class. Eventually he explained a feeling of physical nausea he gets when turning pages. It is even worse if it is someone *else* turning the page. \n\nAs far as touch is concerned, gloves have not helped, or plastic covers over pages, long sleeves are essential. I have no idea how to counter the sounds. \n\nAlso wood grain rubbing against wood (like his dresser drawers) I feel shit for all the times I fought with him to put his clothes away before he expressed how sickened he feels opening them. \n\nHe is a great kid, I love him so much, I am devasted that life has given him this to deal with (he is also strongly colour blind, but that does not bother him at all) \n\nIt goes a long way to explaining the temper outbursts that he has *always* been prone to, it is only now that he is starting to express it that we can try to do something about it. I worry for him, because as we all know, most of the world will not care about or understand this issue. \n\nSo sub, do you think my son might have misophbia, or something different? And what kind of ways can I help? Do you know if any of his textbooks have online versions? Most of them do, but that does not help in school, or if it is a workbook he has to write into. \n\nWe do not have a diagnosis to back anything up with, so I do not know how cooperative the school are going to be, but using a tablet instead of text books, or typing instead of handwriting could be a game changer for him. He just started in secondary school 3 weeks ago, and with all the Covid restrictions in place, I have not had a conversation with them yet. Would like to be armed with info before I make the appointment I wonder if he is on he autism spectrum It sounds like he might have something else going on - miso is usually just sounds, but he has touch sensitivity too. I would not venture to guess what the diagnosis might be, but for sure this all needs to be explored with your child's doctor and possibly a therapist. \n\nYou will also need to investigate special education services with your son's school to find out what accommodations they can provide. If you are in the US and your son is attending a public school, there are systems in place to help identify kids with special education needs and a process that helps to find out what will work best. My son was granted an iPad to take notes on during class last year, because he has difficulty with handwriting but he can type just fine.  (\n\nYou could get him a new dresser with those silent-close drawers. And try to get him to tell you what specific things trigger him, so that you can try to minimize them at home. But outside the home ends up being more about how he can try to cope with these unpreventable sounds and things that feel weird. I have a couple of family members on the autism spectrum, very high functioning, but one of them reacts to paper just like your son. \n\nI am not sure if he is ever been assessed but you might want to mention this to your doctor. And in case you are worried about a diagnosis: my family member with the paper phobia is well loved by his friends and family and is incredibly gifted academically - he just has a few quirks and now that we know the cause, we know how to support his needs :-) I do not think so, (though it *is* a spectrum, we all might be on there somewhere) the junior school he went to has a dedicated autism integration unit, so I feel like it might have been picked up before now, and there is a ton of boxes he would not tick for autism, though I am not ruling it out completely We have all got a few quirks!\n\nWhere I live, particularly my little town, is very autism friendly, and it is not a stigma here, so I would not worry about it too much, the only problem would be that due to 'you know what', accessing services is quite difficult right now. His school has a ton of support available, I am currently trying to get a picture of things so when I meet with the school, I will be able to explain his needs to them, even without a diagnosis &gt;investigate special education services with your son's school\n\nThat is next on the agenda. I am in Ireland, services are generally very good, I am optimistic about the schools help once we establish what is really going on\n\n\n\n&gt;get him a new dresser with those silent-close drawers.\n\nAlso a priority \n\n&gt;outside the home ends up being more about how he can try to cope with these unpreventable sounds and things that feel weird.\n\nThis is all pretty new I am hoping to give him some power over it now that it is acknowledged as a real thing, maybe not misophonia , but something tangible, and not just him being volatile over nothing.  What a time to be alive lol\n\nGood luck with everything - it sounds like he ended up with pretty great parents :-)", "I am new and need advice I am new here and really need support because my family does not understand and it drives me nuts. I am 97% sure that I have Misophonia. I have done research and educated myself ever since I was told that I might have it and I am pretty sure that I do. I started having trigger noises around the age of 12. Some of my trigger noises include chewing, crunching, slurping, and ESPECIALLY the sound of teeth scraping on a fork or plate. It is very hard eating dinner with my family because they make these noises EVERY SECOND that they can. Anytime I bring this up (which I do not very often because I know how it will end up, I also do not think that they realize just how much and how hard it is for me to say nothing about it) my mom makes fun of me and one day when I told her to \u201cplease stop\u201d (which is what I always say when I bring it up and I try to do it as polite as possible) she grabbed her fork put it on her teeth and continued to scrape them on it over and over until I ran upstairs with my eyes full of tears because I was so mad. When I bring it up to my step dad (which I try not to do anymore) he will start saying things like \u201cI do not understand\u201d \u201cwhat is the problem\u201d or stuff like that and then I will tell him that it is fine and never mind but he continues to make an argument out of it, that is why I do not bring it up to him anymore. When I bring it up to my dad he tries to stop which I really appreciate but lately when I bring it up he is been ignoring me. What probably hurts the most because I look up to her and want her approval so bad is how my sister reacts. When I tell her to please stop she responds by rolling her eyes, yelling at me and telling me how selfish I am. She was the one who brought up the fact that I might have Misophonia to. At dinner I will plug my ears and then when my step dad sees me plugging my ears he will either ignore it or start an argument with me. Everyone else will ignore it. It is very hard because I like to have conversations with my family at dinner but it is really hard when I cannot hear them. Its also hard to eat because I will have to time it perfectly. I understand how hard it must be for them but I just wish that they would ATTEMPT to stop or TRY to understand me yet the only person who does is my dad and he is beginning to ignore me about it. Anyway I am sorry this was so long. I left a lot out but it would be helpful if I could get some advice. Am I being selfish? Am I expecting to much from my family? How do I make them understand? Also is there anyway that you can get diagnosed with Misophonia? I have looked it up but I never get an answer so if someone could answer that that would be amazing, again I am sorry that this was so long but thanks for the advice!! First off, you are not selfish. Is it selfish for people in wheelchairs to ask for a ramp or elevator? Not at all. That feeling of being selfish is a normal reaction and completely valid, but know that you are not selfish. Secondly, Misophonia is self diagnosable. But there are some places that will \u201cofficially\u201d diagnose you. I personally found an audiologist in Wisconsin. I am sure plenty of therapists or Doctor at universities who specialize in areas like audiology, neurology, and etc who would be willing to diagnose you. Another way I made others aware of my Misophonia is by coming outta my shell and telling a lot of people. This was tough to do because I had hidden it for so long. But if you tell enough people, it begins to become normalized and less taboo. It is almost like becoming a spokes person for Misophonia. Let others ask questions and be real. Crying and laughing about this is normal and appreciated by others who know nothing about it. Lastly, family. Family is always the hardest. Personally I eat alone everyday (been about 9 years since I have eaten with my fam). I listen to music or watch videos as loud as I can. My family tells me when they are going to eat so I can go in my room and play music. This took me a while to do and my family still struggles with this. Self isolation is tough and demanding on the heart. But it makes the moments I have with others that much better. If it really does get outta hand with them not understanding, Misophonia is (I believe) protected under the ADA and you could treat it as mental abuse. I do not recommend this and I do not feel you want to, but knowing the options is important. Honestly, I think you got to pour your heart out to them. I am sure you already have, but I mean you got to give it your all. And f that does not work, then you got to get creative. Misophonia has made me see my father cry, see my girlfriends leave, see my enemies abuse, and see my darkest moments. But Misophonia has taught me soooo much. I have learned to love more than most. Learned to cherish the small moments. Learned to treat others with respect unparalleled. You got to have hope. And the light is not always bright enough at the end of the tunnel, so be your own light. Also, around the age of 30 I hear that most cases lessen. So that is cool too. Wish you the best, and know your never alone in this. Never. Hey my friend I read your post and I would up that percentage to the ole 100%. Congrats!\n\nSo from here on out it is all about mitigation. Earbuds, headphones, ambient music/radio, separation, whatever works.\n\nMaybe if you got just one advocate in your family it might help. How about your Dad? Do you think he would be able to spend an hour reading the posts in this sub? Maybe if he realized you are not making it up, it is real, people from all walks of life have it just the same, that you cannot help it?\n\nGood luck. It kind of sucks of course, but it could be worse. Thank you this means sooo much to me! I will take your advice and talk to my family about it!! Thank you this means a lot. It is always nice to know that there are other people experience if same thing and knowing I am not alone Hey! I hope you are doing better. I also diagnosed myself and I have problems with my sister since one of my triggers is breathing, she does not understand that I cannot stand it and *I* should be understanding since \"She cannot control it\" although there are $5 nasal drops that help with this... And she refuses to use them. I, myself, need to deal with something like that, the best I could tell you to do is to try eat else where or use headphones. Sadly my family is super religous and do not understand misophonia so I am not aloud to use headphones or go upstairs since family time is more important than a \"selfish\" request. \nAnd no, you are not selfish, disabeled people need wheelchairs, we need to avoid triggers. As simple as that. It is not our fault that we have misophonia and people should respect it.

I fucking hate having this thing, I have started despising my brother just because he keeps on triggering me and I am too scared to tell him why I am so sensitive about the noises he makes. Whenever I tell him to stop he starts doing it even more and tells me that I am not 7 anymore and I should deal with it. I cannot tell my parents as I know they are just going to say I am overreacting but It is gotten to the point where I can hardly be in the same room as my brother even if he is not triggering me. It is kind of weird, but recently just his presence has been triggering me and I feel like such a disgusting human being for despising my brother so much. \n   I can hardly handle doing this anymore, I usually just try to hide my emotions and deal with it but it is so tormenting that so started bawling just in the middle of the day because of my mom making a noise. I do not think I can just sit through this anymore and I feel like starting taking it out on myself just so I do not end up taking my anger out on others. How do I cure this thing? Is there anyway to make it at least a bit more bearable for me? find some pinknoise on youtube and play that through some headphones, it helps me out a ton. Now, I do not have great solutions except for playing music or white noise, wearing earplugs and secluding yourself sometimes, but I think it is important to remember that you are not a terrible person for feeling this way. I am %100 sure that you love and care about your family members. If your brother is doing this just because it bothers you, he is just fulfilling his duty as a sibling. You should explain your/our condition because it is unlikely that it will get much worse. You could try to spend half an hour around him each day, and gradually add ten to fifteen more minutes to your time spent together. I have only told one of my sisters, because my  Misophonia is pretty mild, and I do not want to make my parents worried about being too loud or laughing at me. If your brother continues to do this, I do not know what you should do but I am sure others on this site will. Just know this is not your fault and that everyone here supports you and understands. Educate them. Explain matter of factly, that this is effecting your every day life. Try to eliminate stimulants like caffeine, in my experience this heightens my senses and makes me much more susceptible to being triggered. Ask your family to please be sensitive to this but also ask how you can work as a team to help you, because you do not want to feel this way. \n\nMy husband and I have signals, if I am being triggered I usually try to calm myself first by doing some deep breathing and focusing on it. If that does not work I tell him that whatever he is doing is triggering me and ask how much longer he will be. This helps me because I know that if there is an end in sight I can make it most of the time. \nOtherwise if the trigger is so intense I excuse myself from the room and get busy doing something to take my mind off of it and he understands and will come get me when he is done.  It is crucial that the people in your life try to meet you half way with this, and I hope that educating your family is the first step to that. \n\nAnother tool you could use is the Misophonia Activation Scale. See what level you are at on a daily basis and share that with your family so they can begin to see what you are going through internally. \n\nHang in there! You will learn to find coping mechanisms but you have to seek them out. \n\n\n\n\n", "It is raining. It is been raining for days. WHY can I hear music in the distance??

It sucks and I will be honest I have not really found a way of telling people their sounds are making me want to kill them without me sounding like a nutter or really offending them. I generally try humour but sometimes Im so genuinely and physically angry, my voice reflects this and can come across as being sarcastic or rude. It is hard.\n\nMost of the time my only option is to either leave the situation entirely, or do things like tickle the tragus on the ear (that sounded so weird) that is closest to the sound to kind of subtly drown it out if you know what I mean? I have also pretended to have a REALLY itchy inner ear before. \n\nIt sucks :/\n\nDo not think your mums reaction to what you put on your phone was handled very well though. Why would something like that hurt her so much? I guess it depends on how it was worded haha I think it might have hurt her because it probably made her feel like her mom. When we would visit my grandmother, my mom would always say \"What are you eating something? Why do you have to make those sounds?\" Something like that. Ah. That makes sense. It is probablh something she cannot help, and maybe got a fair bit of stick for it as she was growing up.\n\nIf you have not already, just apologise to her, sincerely and then calmly explain to her that the noise thing is your issue and make the problem more about you than her. It will be OK :) I have apologized to her afterwards but I didnt explain my problem with those noises again. I know that she cannot help it, but I do not live with her anymore so that problem is solved. I live with my fiance and he knows about ny intolerance for those noises. He tries for my sake.

I recommend you actually sit down and talk to them and make sure you use the right words. Tell them it is a real disorder which you have zero control over and that there is not cure. You can tell them that it makes you feel trapped or like you need to yell or whatever it may be. Also make sure you let them know that it is noting personal against them.

It is not extreme snoring (my grandfather had sleep apnea and this sounds **nothing** like it), but it is enough to trigger me and keep me from sleeping. This past week, we have been unable to sleep in the same bed, and have had to take turns on the couch every night. So not only does one or both of us have to wake up in the middle of the night, whoever is on the couch does not get comfy nor great sleep. At this point, we are looking into sending him to a sleep specialist just to double check that he does not have sleep apnea, because, misophonia or not, we would need to treat that anyway.\n\n  \nWhat we have tried to help the situation:\n\n* Earplugs, both foam and those silicone putty ones. The foam put too much pressure inside my ears (I have small-ish ears) and aggravate my tinnitus. The silicone ones get covered in lint and catch in my hair. And neither really blocks the noise. My ears just focus on it and keep trying to hear it once snoring is heard. (I do not get why my brain does that.)\n* Wedge pillow. Husband likes to sleep on his side too, so he winds up sliding down to the bottom of the wedge, which means that when he rolls onto his back, it is pretty much doing nothing. He snores when he sleeps on his side, too, so it does not make too much of a difference either way.\n* Music. Works great as long as the radio station is broadcasting. The local classical and jazz stations both go off air between 1am and 5am, when the snoring is the worst. \n* Humidifier. Does not seem to affect his snoring.\n* White noise. This works fine in the summer, when we can blast a box fan, but the summer air could also be a factor. I tried running a reasonably loud fan at a low speed last night and it did not drown him out. White noise apps are not loud enough either.\n\nWhat recommendations do you have? As a full disclosure, we live in the arid Rocky Mountains, but when we lived on the east coast, things were not as bad. At the time, he also weighed less (he is a little overweight now and the pandemic is not helping) and was not taking sleep meds (now prescribed to him).", "Leaving holiday early because of misophonia I feel so awful right now that I am crying. I enjoyed everything about this holiday, the view, the activities, the people but I have such bad self efficacy to handle it.\n\nI made a post on a different subreddit yesterday, but in my fit of rage I asked my mum if I could leave early (change flights to a different day\u2014 it is free at least). I have really bad sound sensitivity, usually I can handle it but when it is time to wind down and sleep I just snap. So for the past few days I have hardly been sleeping because of sound sensitivity. Anyway, yesterday I was going to take a nap, positive that I could sleep and continue enjoying the holidays but my sisters would not leave the room and go to one of our friends hotel rooms just temporarily so I could try sleeping, just the thought of hearing the keyboard of my sisters computer (she was playing minecraft) aggressively click, and my other sister who was outside coming inside letting the light in and making a bang noise with the door drove me crazy and pushed me over the edge. I tried asking so many times if they could just please leave but they refused. In my fit of rage and to avoid yelling at them I texted my mum that I wanted to leave. So today I am leaving very soon and I am crying because I just really do not want to go. The problem is I cannot handle sleeping in the same room (it is a room with 2 double beds with 4 people in it) with my mum because she is one of my worst triggers. She is the opposite to me, enragingly loud, she is also a smoker so she is constantly leaving the room, opening and closing the door with a bang. And because she is an adult she only sleeps 4-7 hours a night, she is snores, sleep talks and sleep walks. Which means I am up late to her snoring and up early because she does not sleep. \n\nI just feel like I am crazy, and my mum makes me feel crazy too, whenever I have told her about this she tells me to \u201cjust sleep\u201d or tells me that maybe I only need 6 hours a night because she does\u2014 but when I have 6 hours my muscles feel weak and my head heavy and foggy and I feel so irritated.

While I have never been diagnosed, I check all the boxes. I have a \u201chatred\u201d of chewing noises, the noise that is made when people rub their nose with their hand, and the noise that is made when people clear the phlegm in their throats. Unfortunately for me, my ENTIRE family makes at least one of these noises. And all of them make the one that annoys me the most, eating really loudly.\nI do not even know how to handle it. I hate being home right now. I will be relaxing on the couch and then someone will sit there and eat and annoy the f**k out of me. I hate it. And they all make different noises that push my buttons in different ways. And, to make it all worse, my sisters make me watch a movie with them every night, and I cannot handle it anymore. I can barely hear the tv because of they incessant chewing and lip smacking. It is like none of them learned to eat with their mouths closed.\nMy oldest sister can barely sneeze into her shoulder or remember to wash her hands (both of which are very crucial in times like these). Luckily, she is learning to sneeze into her shoulder after I kept on reminding her.\nThen there is the nose rubbing/\u201cscratching\u201d as they call it. I use one finger to scratch my nose, they just all out rub their entire hand on top of it, or my oldest sister uses a fist under her nose. I do not understand it. It makes their disgusting scratchy sound and I cannot stand it. \nThen the throat thing. While it is very mild and infrequent, it is still annoying as heck. My 3rd older sister makes the sound. It is so annoying, but it is better than her other habit of just not covering her cough from before (she still does not cover her cough, but it is going away after almost FOUR months).\nI cannot even tell them to not make these noises because I tried once and my oldest sister got mad at me and my mom got mad at me for mentioning it.\nBut, my birthday is tomorrow, and I will have to go through a birthday dinner with them and a movie. I do not think I will be able to. Just thinking about eating with all of them makes me freak out because I cannot handle it. I am not going to pretend to know your family and situation perfectly (stories like this make me thankful that my family is understanding of my misophonia) but I would keep telling them when you get annoyed, sitting back and taking it is an absolute hell and it is not going to change anything.\n\nIf you have not already tell them about misophonia and that you have it and that might help them understand more, if they do not believe you you can get it diagnosed at an audiologist (at least I think, it is been about 7 years since mine). i used to have this problem with my family, although it was not so many triggers, just eating/slurping/gulping. i would reccommend talking to you are siblings one at a time, when you are calm and not when you have been recently triggered.\n\nyou have to understand from their side, they are being told off for something they likely not even aware they are doing!! so they get mad of course, and family is normally the least mature about these things bc we like to be comfortable around our family, and someone telling them off is not comfortable.\n\nalso, find reasons to leave when its unbearable. i usually use \" i left something upstairs\" \" i need the bathroom\" \"i need to call ___\" and leave for 30mins, until i know most people have stopped eating.

They will not let me have headphones Flesh-coloured foam earplugs then Sorry about the automod. You can checkout u/vsodi's reply now. First of all, good on you for trying to keep your mental health in check in light of the situation.  It is so important to remain rational and think things through.\n\nI have written some of my suggestions; remember that what works for one person does not always work for someone else.\n\n* Talk to a doctor and explain Misophonia if you need to. If you are in an area which has a doctor that is aware of or specializes in Misophonia, seek them out. If you can get a doctor to write a letter to your employer that might help your case for a \"reasonable accommodation\" like wearing headphones. \n* I would not try talking to your equals about it - that never works for me personally. People might be friendly and listen, but they will go right back to triggering you and you will feel betrayed. I have only ever had success talking to close friends about my problem. Some people have noticed that I get pissy when they start eating in front of me - I think the opening up to this type of person might work. Ultimately, the \"talk to the person\" strategy does not work unless that person is willing to listen and embrace the fact that certain noises are not to be made around you. \n* Check out some of the more discrete earplug/earphone options. You can get flesh coloured earplugs that barely stick out of the ear - if you have long hair they are completely invisible. Most of them are \"hi fidelity\" so they let you hear people talk, only everything is at a lower volume. \n* If money is not a problem, check out some of the white noise hearing aids they make for tinnitus patients. It looks like a hearing aid so I doubt any employer would have any issues with letting you use it. I have read about some people have success using these in their everyday lives. They blast white noise into your ears and end up drowning out some of the environmental noise. \n* My final suggestion is to rationally consider another employment opportunity elsewhere. *Nobody* on Reddit (or anywhere on the internet) is in the position to recommend that you quit your job for any reason, but it is something that you might want to consider as a long term option.   \nMy Misophonia is extremely bad and this turned out to be one of the only options available to me. I started looking for employment opportunities (inside and outside of the company I was employed) that boasted a quieter environment. Ultimately I found an opportunity to work from home and life has been mostly good since. Take what I am saying with a grain of salt - changing work environments is a big decision. I hope this part makes sense; sometimes people forget that looking for a new job is an option.\n\nWhatever you do, good luck. Hopefully you find something that makes life more comfortable.

My main trigger is coughing, with throat clearing and sniffling in the top 3. As you can imagine it is very hard for me to function in everyday life with these triggers. Most people's misophonia triggers are eating sounds, which-- even from someone without miso, seems pretty understandable and is more socially acceptable. Most couples can easily come to agreements and accommodate their miso partner (if they are not a-holes of course) by not eating near them. But what about triggers that people cannot generally prevent or help? \n\nEven though my brain has misophonia and is well aware getting into a relationship would probably make things worse, my heart still functions well and desires a partner very much. I want someone to go through life with! I sort of even want my own family someday. But when I think about the reality of my misophonia and how it would affect not just me but my potential partner and child I cringe and feel my heart breaking desperately. \n\nI know there is no cure for miso but oh man what I would do if there was. I would spend my last penny on it. The things this condition has stolen from me I will never forgive it for. This is not true. I have many of the same triggers - coughing, throat clearing, sniffling, swallowing, soft consonants, shushing sounds...it goes on. It has made it extremely hard to function in every situations. I often find myself getting upset at my husband's sounds, but he is a champion. If he hears something before I do he covers my ears for me, he adjusts his chewing if he sees me getting upset, he understands when I lash out. He does get overwhelmed by it from time to time (and I cannot blame him), but he is still here. Do not think that you will not find love. You will. The right person will love you the way you are and do their best to help. Thank you. Your husband is an angel! I totally feel you.

I could not subject anyone to the pain of living with me; I am aware of how annoying it is for my family to have to feel like they are walking on eggshells around me. Hugs. Big hugs. I am 24 and I am in the exact same boat, never give up hope.

They happened so fast that I was not able to pull out my earbud in time. I am very anxious right now because of it and hate the fact that the producers had to have those disgusting loud swallowing noises in the cartoon. \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14 just so unnecessary. In the UK we have dental adverts for denture cleaning products and they always involve someone biting into an apple at the end of the advert which kills me inside.  Honestly as misophonia gets more press those in media production will become more sensitive towards those of us that cannot stand these unnecessary noises.  Another killer for me is people talking with their mouths full in sitcoms, whygodwhy Is it season 1 or the new season? Season 1", "Dog Barking........aaargghh!  I cannot stand it! Everyone thinks it is a mortal sin, but I hate dogs. I am not kidding you when I say that neighbor dog barking contributed to trauma for me (yes, confirmed by psychologists). The fact that I could never anticipate when it would happen, and that the neighbors did not care that it bothered me even though it was right next to my bedroom... I was constantly stressed not knowing when it would come, and knowing that nobody gave a damn.\n\nSo, I completely understand. People should not own dogs if they cannot keep them from disturbing their neighbors, even without misophonia being a problem. It is just inconsiderate, poor training and laziness. You are not crazy, irrational or unreasonable. Even a person without misophonia would possibly think this is annoying, maybe not as much as we do but that is besides the point.\n\nFor the advice, as soon as you hear the dog or know when he goes outside out on headphones with loud music, you said he was outside for about 5 minutes so hopefully it will not hurt too much.\nYou also mentioned that you are waiting for it, I have the same thing, it doesnt always work but try to do something enjoy and preferably something that makes your brain work, when that feeling rises again. Watch a series/movie/documentary that is complicated, play sudoku or another brain game etc.\n\nReally hopes this helps! Definitely a trigger for me too.  Only headphones and low pressure ear plugs do any good. Dog barking is a big trigger for me. I take naps with my Bose over the ear noise cancelling HPs on. Just in case. And it is like ptsd. The fear of hearing it !", "Does anybody else have some seriously damaging trigger reactions? I have been having misophonia ever since I can remember, like I was 7 yo, but I feel like it is been getting only worse. When I was like 10, I would start telling my family members to stop doing trigger sounds, when I was 15 I stopped having dinner with them and avoided people who made these sounds, at 20 I would start feeling pain inside of my chest, head and arms. Now I am 22 and it grew into such a problem that I cannot encounter triggering sounds in public, because I literally look like I have tourette's syndrome, meaning I slap my head with palms and I start having tics in my neck and arms, sometimes even resulting in cramps, sometimes I even punch a wall and I am afraid my bones will not be able to withstand it one day. I am worried that in a few years I will start damaging my body (or even worse somebody else's body). \n\nI do not know what to do about it. I do wear earbuds often at home, however I keep losing my phone and earbuds somewhere at home, therefore I need to get out of my room often searching for these items while also having an incosiderate family that always starts searching for snacks when they see I do not have my earbuds in, so they can annoy me and then act like they are offended. \n\nAlso I cannot always have earbuds in. I am currently unemployed and when I will go to have a job interview, the interviewer might make a triggering sound, I will eventually slap my face, break my nose, it will start bleeding and what will I say? \"Oh, it is just my misophonia hehe, dw\"? Who is going to hire me with that?\n\ntl;dr I feel my life is over due to my misophonia.  i can tell you you are not alone with this one. not looking for pity but already as a 16 year old i have damaged my ears a lot but whacking them with all my might just to drown out the triggers even if it is stopped, it will still replay in my head. apart from instant reactions, after an episode of crying and hitting myself and if decided all is not better yet i will resort to other means of self harm. \n\nin public it can be an issue but i just embrace it. if they cannot accept me for who i am that is their problem. by hitting yourself you are trying to cope. you should not be made to feel shame or embarrassment by that. and yes, you may look like you have tourette's syndrome, but anyone with non-tourette's related tics share this fear of being perceived of having it too, and even then if a stranger is so nosy and curious to ask just tell them what you really have. \n\nto be quite honest i have gotten the rude stares, the high-brow, the rushing children away from me type behaviour but if you do not learn to accept it you will always fear it. for some it is easier and i am lucky to already have a high tolerance for people not liking or wanting to be near me.\n\nthough with interviews, i highly recommend you make a card (like a business card. awful reference but kind of like the joker had in Joker (2019) ) to hand over to the interviewer with a basic but informative summary of what misophonia is and how you should be treated no less because of it. you can prepare a little speech too if that helps. ALSO ALSO acoustic filter ear plugs will definitely help if you do not have them already. you can wear them and still hear the conversation but it will block out triggers, to how high frequency it can block out will depend on the brand. apart from that, do not apologise after each reaction to a trigger and treat it as if it is neurotypical behaviour lol, otherwise you could come off as \"annoying\" apparently, figured that out myself, and last but not least...\n\nyour life is NOT over due to your misophonia. just like anyone else who is neurodivergent it is just a little weight on the shoulders, you;ve just got to become accustomed to that weight and learn how to navigate life with it. and everyone has their own needs, and if no one can accept that, especially anyone close to you, and importantly interviewers that could have a spot filled with a hard working, amazing person that happens to be neurodivergent, then they do not deserve to know you, let alone have you waste your time on them.\n\ni wish you the best in finding a job and do not hit yourself too hard &lt;3", "Anyone else annoyed by cicadas? I have to play white noise every night and sometimes that is not even enough. Is it just me, or does it annoy everyone else? Does not even register with me anymore. I have live in the Midwest my entire life, I guess they are just regular background noise now. Same.  They basically are white noise where I am from. Annoyed haha haha what a funny word for how those little demons make me feel. I thankfully no longer live in an area with cicadas but when I did white nose was my only friend. Those fuckers would ruin my sleep and they are so gross too. Why do not more people absolutely detest cicadas with every ounce of their being? You are not alone in being bothered by those nasty bugs. Maaaate! I live in Australia &amp; my bedroom used to be by the woodshed, there were not cicadas but there were crickets. They would drive me insane. I would hear one stop/start over &amp; over as I was trying to go to sleep at night. Thinking when it had stopped I could finally get some rest, only for it to start again. My insanity would take hold &amp; I would run outside like an unhinged lunatic spraying Mortein in every possible nook &amp; cranny in the vicinity of my bedroom window. I would stand there for a minute watching them jump about slowly dying, and feeling like a serial killer, I would head back to bed. Lying down finally at peace, just about to drift off &amp; that lone bastard cricket would start again. Lie there with my eye twitching knowing I had used all the Mortein &amp; there was nothing I could do. Lack of sleep eventually exacerbating my misophonia to the point where I thought i would kill more than just the crickets one day. When I moved out it was bliss...", "Boyfriend cannot grasp my misophonia My (27f) misophonia is intense and as we can all agree, fucking annoying. My main trigger is the sound of chewing or sucking on candies. Of course being a human, and living with another human, we have got to eat! \n\nI have tried countless times to explain to BF (32M) how it makes me feel. When I get triggered I have got to leave ASAP. I go from 0 to fight or flight in just a snap of the fingers. Today he was sitting with me on the couch and he started eating, at first I was fine but he then had a very \u201cmoist\u201d sounding chew that triggered me and I jolted up and said, \u201cI have got to get go! your chewing is bothering me right now.\u201d As always he got defensive and I said, \u201cit had nothing to do with you, I just cannot handle it sometimes\u201d which then made him throw his hands up and say, \u201coh well then sorry I tried to hangout with you.\u201d He got a, \u201coh wow, nice\u201d from me and I walked off and slammed the door (honestly a bit harder than I meant to)\n\nI keep trying to explain to him that it is a sudden onset of FUCK I GOT TO GO when things set in. I get so damn angry and tense, like I am ready to throw their head into the wall if they do not quit. Usually when I get triggered by motion repetition I can get him to stop by not being over the top. But chewing? What am I going to say? Can you please stop eating until I am ready to eat? K thanks. It is just so frustrating. He came into the room to reiterate how bad I made him feel and how I did not want to hangout with him and how he tried to make me feel like he did with his petty comment. I sent him the link to webmd about misophonia so hopefully that can help him understand my brain makes me feel like I am caught in a fire. \n\nWhy cannot I just handle the normal human things. Damn brain and it is sensitivity. I know that you tagged this as venting, but I just figured I would give some of my thoughts. I think that my SO and I have living with each other figured out despite my Misophonia. Generally, we just do not eat together, and I know some people find that really weird and are not able to imagine themselves doing it. When my SO wants to eat, they go to a different room. It is a respect thing in my eyes because we both make accommodations for each other to have a healthy relationship. In your case, it seems like your boyfriend is not being as empathetic as he should be. In my opinion, you should not need to prove something to your boyfriend by sending them webMD articles; your SO should just respect how you feel. \n\nThose things aside, Misophonia is something that you should discuss and plan for. It is really not ideal to discuss it when you are triggered because your brain is not functioning correctly and you will not be reasonable; at least in my case. In my experience, it always works out better to talk to people about your Misophonia before it becomes a problem and before you are in a triggering situation. \n\nIt is all about compromise. My SO has things that they do not want me to do, and I respect that as well. Misophonia is one of those things that you have to compromise around in a relationship. Part of your compromise is being able to describe how you are feeling without being mean or rude (which we all know is hard most of the time). Also, it might be helpful to communicate that it is not that you do not want to hangout, it is that you do not want to hangout with food around. Again, explaining all of this outside of a triggering situation. \n\nI am all over the place, but this is just my random thoughts from living with my partner for many years. Everyone is different, so do not take anything I said too seriously. I genuinely hope you work it out even if I did not help at all. Break up \ud83d\udc93 he clearly does not care about your wellbeing This is not /r/Relationship_Advice where breaking up is the first thing that is being recommended. I would say break up. He is not a parent that you have an obligation to have a good relationship with. Thank you so much for your response!! Oof, that is a bit much I can see where you are coming from. Thanks for the input! I think I am going to try and stick this one out. He is been very understanding with my anxiety so hopefully he gets to the point where he can understand this too One of many red flags for me with my ex was that he knew about my misophonia--to the point of staying something to his friend on my behalf once--and still would give me hugs from behind while chewing then get offended when I bolted away.\n\nJust one of many ways he would disregard and/or purposely test my \"quirks\" and boundaries/wishes in general. Another sensory thing I have an issue with for some reason is my nails. I cannot stand to run my fingers over them \"against the grain\" from tip to cuticle; it can only be cuticle to tip lol. Often we would be holding hands or horse-playing and he would randomly force me to endure him literally rubbing them the wrong way until I could yank my hand free. Once that happens I have a compulsion to do it the right way as a \"correction.\" No matter how frazzled I got he would just laugh. Like he just laughed at my frustration over his new love for mechanical keyboards. Or when he would scratch our initials into the styrofoam takeout containers with his nails specifically because I hated the sound/feel. I always carry a pen and tried getting him to switch but he insisted...\n\nJust saying watch out for people that violate your boundaries and make you feel wrong/weird for having them. Especially when already discussed!\n\nEdit to add I am your age! From my experience if they are not willing to adapt or at least try to understand it in any sort of way, it will not work long term\n\nMisophonia itself calls the shots really. And i know personally I could not be around someone not understanding of it, just because it can be so bad when I get a trigger (ie very frequently) Oh wow! I have the same thing with my toenails. I start sweating if my toenails are touched, period. But I endure it for pedicures since I cannot do my own without dying inside. I am putting some serious thought to this. Thank you so much and am so happy you got out of that doodoo situation! I will bring it up again and reiterate how important it is. I still do not think he read that article. \n\nMy poor mom (her chewing bothers me the most) has learned to warn me when she is about to eat so I can vacate, or I would 100% let her spit her gum into my hand as a teenager haha. I get people forget, my mom will say, \u201coops sorry!\u201d If she starts snacking when I am on the phone. we will hang up and talk later. My husband has lived with me for nearly 15 years and still makes comments about it being 'pathetic' and still doubts it is existence. Everytime I react negatively to a sound, he acts surprised like \"why does that noise bother you so much godddd\". It bothers me in the same way that all those other noises get to me. It bothers me in the same way I have described to you for 15 years. Its as if he thinks that telling me not to be annoyed with something is suddenly going to make me not be annoyed by it. I think he is slowly getting it but it is not a hard concept to grasp really is it? He knows the name, of it, he could Google it if he wanted to to get a better understanding, but I doubt that is going to happen anytime soon. \n\nThe only time he really realised how bad it can get was when I was pregnant and literally sobbed and cried and had a tantrum because someone was using a leaf blower nearby (major major trigger for me). Damn!! I really wish I had the brains and the money to do a study for this and what parts of the brain it correlates with and if it correlates with the autism spectrum with sounds sensitivity (read a study that it might). Or if it ties in with anxiety or trauma. Day to day loud noises bother me. So many unanswered questions!! If they ever offer to do trials or studies on this kind of thing, Ill do it for sure! My first boyfriend I lived with broke up with me because we could not eat food like normal people together. I also said no metal cutlery scraping on plates. I cant help it! He could see me cringe every time he took a bite. if we made tacos we had to eat separate. I was heartbroken, but I get it. I am a weirdo and he always brought up why did not my own eating hurt me? IDK. my internal eating was on a different wavelength? idk why it doesnt bother me. it does not make any sense. my pain goes through my brain and sometimes into my spine. Oh wow!! I am very lucky that if I mimic the behavior, like eating with my partner it tends to not bother me unless they start smacking. Mine causes my upper body to tense up like I am ready to gtfo or go to the boxing ring with the sound. I was re-reading some post I have made. Felt like updating and saying I left him almost seven months ago! Best decision I have EVER made and reading back on my post of him makes me wonder why I stuck it out so long.", "A messy poetic rant about a hypothetical cure for misophonia ", "Counterintuitive reaction to a specific trigger? I deal with common triggers such as loud eating and slurping/kissing/general mouth noises but to a much lesser extent where only mild frustration occurs and I can usually just take a breath and move on. Over time I have discovered a worsening trigger in the sound of a zipper. This one triggers me to an extreme extent. It had boiled to a point where I literally cannot be in the room with my girlfriend when she is changing, or putting on a pair of boots or a hoodie, etc. I had finally broken down and told her what the problem was but did not know about the possibility of me having this disorder/condition until about a year ago. She has made tremendous strides to be supportive and I have done the absolute best I can to try to hinder my reactions as they have gotten to a point where I would frequently punch myself in the head or do anything I could to cause some physical pain to thwart the anger that I was dealing with, and I have gotten much better. However the problem still exists and it literally can flip an otherwise good experience upside down.  \n\nNow the counterintuitive aspect. The thing that puzzles me the most is the derived arousal from the sound itself. It bothers me to a point of intense boiling anger but also ends up resulting in slight to moderate arousal and I have no goddamn clue what to make of that. It is honestly very difficult to talk to her about it sometimes despite her understanding. It feels almost wrong and embarrassing and is incredibly confusing. \n\nI am new to this sub and do not want to overstep any bounds, but any thoughts or input or even advice would be incredibly appreciated. You are not alone. I found out it was not just me when I was filling out a survey on misophonia for a research study, and one of the questions listed arousal one of the reactions to triggers. I never named the feeling as arousal.  But when I read that I realized that is what it was. I do not know about you, but for me it is like I get the physical sensation \"down there\", without feeling turned on at all. It is actually very unpleasant and just makes me feel even more irritated. *look another edit: I ramble a little bit here so I apologize for that. Thank you for taking the time to reply! \n\nThis is 100% on point. I do sometimes have the occasional instance where there is more arousal than frustration which is when I really get confused. It is like a vicious feedback loop. I wish that my mind would just pick a side of the fence to be on. I have had both the fight and flight responses and nine times out of ten they are sheer anger. We had an instance in a department store where my girlfriend had been trying on some clothes and needed for me to help her zip something up, only for the shop attendant to brush past me and do it before I had a chance to do anything. The unexpected trigger had me in such a furious state that I was nauseous and slightly dizzy. I had literally left her in the store to go sit somewhere. Typing this up is even bringing that feeling back. That was one of her clues that this was a real thing, and I did not even have a name to put to it yet. I have gotten quite a bit better since then but I still have a lot of improving to do. I posted something similar a while back and someone said that the anger- and arousal-processing units of the brain are so close to one another that sometimes things get confused. There is literally nothing that I know that we can do about it. I am sorry, but just know that you are lot alone in this! Thank you for taking the time to reply. I am glad I found this sub. Not a lot of people that do not have this condition really understand when I try to explain it. If I even try to explain at all. The thing is that explaining does not really help anyone especially when we cannot put the finger on what is the problem. With my bf I found that explains the emotion triggers envoke is more helpful than anything else. Maybe they will not understand why your special triggers make you feel that way but they definitely felt that way before and know that one wants to avoid it.", "I cannot do this anymore \nTrigger warning/ they are might be done things here that can trigger some, such as mentions of suicide and forms of self harm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery single day im constantly triggered by noises all around me. Im filled constantly with anger and frustration and I have no way to let it out. I want to hit people so badly until they stop making the noise, but obviously I cannot do that so instead I am always biting my arms and scratching my neck. My family does not like it when I do this, but it is the only way I feel less angry. I hate it. So instead I punch the nearest object that will do the least damage, my family also does not want me to do this. So I try venting to my family when I hear someone making a trigger noise, for example: \"I hate jerks who blast their music right next our house, they are such assholes\",now I know I sound mean but when I am angry I just do not care, I just want someone to agree with me so I do not feel crazy even if they lie to agree. Instead they make me feel like I am in the wrong by saying \" Oh! Do not say that! They are not doing anything bad.\", I know that was not their intention but it still makes me feel worse.\n\nSo I cannot hurt myself, I cannot complain, I obviously cannot hurt others (after all they are technically innocent no matter how much they piss me off) , so what can I do? I ask my family and I get \"Just ignore it\". YOU THINK I HAVE NOT FUCKING TRIED THAT. I cannot ignore it I do not know why but I cannot! So I just bottle everything up until I explode, and when I do explode I am told not to bottle up my feelings. Its like I cannot win no matter what I do I cannot take it anymore! Im told by my family that they understand me BUT THEY DO NOT. They do not have to feel burning anger every day, they do not have to fight the urge to hurt someone just because they are tapping their fingers, they do not have to talk themselves down from commiting suicide just so they do not have to suffer another damn day of emotional pain. They do not understand, and there is a good chance they never will.\n\nI do sympathize with them though because I know it is not easy having to hear me tell them to stop making certain sounds all the damn time. And they get scared whenever I go out because they do not know if I will have a breakdown or not. But I now know that they will never I understand exactly what I am going through. My coping methods will never make sense to them. And for now I have no one personal I can confide to.\n\nI cannot live the rest of my life like this, I am either going to off myself first or end up in an institute.

So I have (20 F) been struggling with misophonia since I was about 10-12 yo, Mouth breathing and snoring sounds are what really drive me insane ... but I have noticed that with just my boyfriend those sounds do not bother me at all, he does not snore but he mouth breathes sometimes when he is sleeping and I kind of like it which is really interesting since I almost killed my sister once for doing the same.  \nis there anyone else who is ever experienced a similar situation? Yes. In fact, that is completely related with misophonia per se. The trigger sounds are frequently done by close people, like some members of our family but not all of them. It is very common only your father, or your mother, sister, girlfriend... I have friends who make chewing noises but It does not trigger me. It only happens with my father. It is always been my dad for me. Friends and other family members do not bother me. Yes! None of my boyfriends breathing or snoring bothers me. But ONLY if we are holding hands or cuddling to sleep. If I am touching them in some way. If we are not touching I sleep with my sound channeling headphones on. I mostly still do anyway since he wants me to get good sleep and be comfy. Headphones + cuddling = the best sleep ever!!!\n\nI also almost killed my sister when I was little, I would literally plug her nose and put a hand over her mouth cause it would make her stop for a bit after or wake up and that way it would stop LOL. As soon as I learned that was not right I stopped. But yeah, w my bf i can still sleep without any headphones if we snuggle Oh hey! same! Family and severe cases in public are bad, but my boyfriends does not seem to impact me unless I am already very very stressed. I will be an outsider here, but my trigger sounds bother me from anyone, even my bf. The only exception is animals, since they have no way of eating with their mouth closed. Humans have lips, so I do not get why they have to do such a sloppy sounds with mouths open.", "My boyfriend should not have to change anything for me ... but he does. And I can imagine it is probably frustrating. Lately one of my main triggers has been typing on a keyboard and with working from home I am very exposed to that all day from his keyboard. We have a small apartment so there is nowhere I can go to not hear the typing, so I usually just listen to rain sounds all day. It works, but it sucks. \n\nJust now I could not handle it and started crying. He came to me and asked if it was because of the typing and looked pretty upset. It is probably really frustrating and upsetting to know that something so harmless that you do on a daily basis hurts your partner so much. He even recently got a more silent keyboard because of me and it was much better in the beginning but it keeps getting worse. Now hes talking about getting another one even. I hate that he has to go through that and think of changing something he bought for a lot of money and that he really likes just because of me. I hate that I feel like this. Im so tired of suffering constantly. suggestion, maybe you all could get a small electric fan and have it running in his workspace or by the door/entryway to his workspace? That might be able to drown out your miso trigger. Could help with other triggers as well if you have any\n\nI know it is tough, stay strong. You will both get through this together and find a solution. Much love \ud83d\udc9c Thank you! Your response means a lot \ud83d\udc9a we xould definitely try the fan idea! Great for you both that he is understanding! I am sure you can figure out a solution. I have seen keyboards that are basically a light projection on any surface, I think they are called laser keyboards. Maybe one of those could work? There would still be tapping, but I would think a lot less and he could experiment with various surfaces. Oh that is so interesting! I did not know those actually existed \ud83d\ude02 but yeah it is definitely a good option! The thing is that I really did not want him to buy yet another thing just because of me. He really likes his current keyboard and he bought that one already because of me. I feel terrible that this is the case They are not terribly expensive. I got mine for less than 100$. I hated it at first because it just felt super, super weird but I got used to it very quickly. \n\nCannot really use it for any kind of gaming though, tbh, I mean one can try but it is just very uncomfortable and confusing, so if he is into that he might want to switch between the two; that is what I do. I should also add that it has trouble in super bright rooms. Oh it would be really bad for him then. He does a lot of gaming so not ideal and his desk is right by a window, so not really good for work during the day, which is usually what triggers me the most. Thanks for letting me know though!! You know, it may be a long shot (I could make a joke out of that considering the independent clause here but I am too lazy, but I go out shooting alot and theres these little earplugs we use, they are made of foam and they sort of expand and fill inside of your ear which makes it hard for any sound to get through. Have you ever tried a foam earplug? They really take the edge off of some sounds, and they are very cheap.  Just a thought. I never tried ones that work well tbh. I remember as a kid my parents had some lying around and they never really worked but maybe those just were not good enough haha ill definitely look it up, thanks for the tip!

She flat out told me that the first article that I sent, about 3 months ago, was \"too much to read.\"\n\nThis is the same person who will google \"sniffles\" if her friend has the sniffles, and read up on it so she can \"try to help.\"\n\nI am so done. I am seriously considering a divorce over it.\n\nShe slurps, sounds like a pig eating in a trough, bangs her mouse on the table, hums, sings (and it is SO horrible), acts like a little child, talks loud (but she is almost deaf, so that is understandable) and she always wants me to try to understand HER issues she goes through, but gives no cares about mine.\n\nI did not try to make your thread about me and my issues, but I just added it so you know I completely understand what you are saying.\n\nI despise everyone who acts like misophonia is a joke or something that does not \"matter\".\n\nHugs Yeah, that must be so frustrating. She might not realize what she is doing if she is almost deaf? But if she does I really hope you all work it out. I am just so frustrated. Her becoming deaf was something that happened about 9 years ago (before we met) so, I completely understand how tough it must be for her and I have really tried to understand it, although I cannot understand being in that position. I also know that she cannot understand being in my position, but I just want her to try to read some articles about it so she will know why I ask her to please stop making \"such and such\" noise or whatever.   \n\n\nThe thing that kills me is, it is been 20 minutes minutes since I sent the article to her for her to read.

Certain sounds echo in my ears and make me want to claw my skin off. I have found something that works sometimes, where I can rub my ears with hair between my ears and fingers and scream in my head, but that does not always stop the sound. It makes me physically shake and hit myself. Certain sounds include but are not limited to nail cutting, stretching, and the worst one is kissing.\n\nI discussed this with my mother and, exactly what I would expect, she decided to do minimal research to determine some ridiculous loophole so that she could avoid making any changes to help me at all. She has decided that this is the cause of a lack of vitamins, and I am incredibly worried about the meeting that I permitted my therapist to have with her. If she does not get through to her, then I might have to suffer with her genuinely thinking she can cure me with vitamins. She does not understand that it is not just \"discomfort\", it causes so *much* discomfort that it is physically painful and causes physical responses. I am worried she is going to try to cure me rather than let me get noise cancelling headphones or stop doing certain things around me. It is a struggle in my every day life because I am constantly filled with not only anxiety about sounds that I happen to hear, but also anxiety that *those* anxieties will be dismissed and labelled as \"harmless overreactions\". It is not harmless to me, it affects me more than I can even put into words and that frustrates me further. If you cannot put it into words, how can you explain to someone who does not experience this what you are going through in a way that will not make them brush it off? I know I cannot live in a bubble, but I cannot live hoping vitamins will help with this when I know they will not. I do not know what I need to be able to live with this and not want to claw my ears and skin off every time I hear a sound. I am new to all of this and my mother is too. I do think she is trying, she just does not know how or anything about this. My hope is that my therapist can get through to her that there is no cure, but I am worried things will get worse if she fails. My mother is also really dismissive so I know I cannot make her quieter.\nI think you really just have to save up for good noise cancelling headphones or ask a relative for one for your birthday or a holiday. \n\nAlso meditating might make handling noise easier. I think it also helps to just accept that a noise is going to happen and try to tune it out instead of stopping it. Usually when you try to stop someone from making a noise they do not understand and get frustrated and then you get frustrated at that on top of being frustrated at the noise.\nWhen we get triggered by sounds our first instinct is anger at whatever or whoever is making that sound , and we feel like they are the most inconsiderate asshole on the planet. I have found it helps with my own anger to try to empathize with whoever making the sound and think about why they are making the sound.\n\nNone of these are perfect solutions, but I have had misophonia for years, and it is mostly a minor issue in my life(even as a I currently live in the loudest place I have ever had the misfortune of being), so I hoped something I said helped you at least a little. Hopefully it will help. I cannot seem to tune it out though and I have tried; the best I can do is mash my ears closed while the noise is occuring but my mother thinks I am overreacting because I \"dislike romance and affection\" (I do not dislike romance or affection, she just rationalizes my dislike of people hugging me or the sound of people kissing like that which is really frustrating.) Well, if we could tune it out easily we would not have misophonia \nBut there are situations where avoiding the noise is not possible or practical so you might  have to try and tune it out and focus on something else\nI suggest besides asking other people with misophonia you look for established sources online that might have more objective ways to alleviate your suffering Also get a fan for your room that can help drown out the noise a lot I had one in the summer but my mother took it out in the late fall because I did not need it anymore. Luckily, it is starting to get a little warmer so I may have an excuse in a month or two. Look online for books on Misophonia. There are a couple of good ones on Amazon that lay out the neurological causes of this disorder as well as the effects and suggested coping mechanisms like using headphones, earplugs, fans, white noise devices, etc... Also, there is a therapy that is currently being studied to treat misophonia that involves stimulating the affected parts of the brain. Hang in there - I believe help is coming. I have lived with this since I was about 10 years old and absolutely refused to eat in the same room with my family at dinner. Everyone thought I was crazy. I am 58 now and praying to God that this new treatment will help me live my last 20-25 years of life normally. Lastly, congratulate your therapist for me because most therapists have never even heard of Misophonia. \ud83d\ude0a I will definitely check that out, thank you for the resources! I hope the new treatment helps you. I will be sure to do mention it to her! If you suspect you have it, it is highly like you that you do have it.", "Is intelligence inversely proportional to loud typing?  You can ask him to take it easy on the keyboard I have tried.

It was 20 feet outside my window. xD", "Flare Audio Calmer (Including Mini &amp; Night) Hello! I thought I would come in with some experience here, and an honest review, as I have not seen too many comprehensive ones on here. I will probably crosspost it, because I think some of these thoughts might have helped me when I was first looking at them.  \nAfter suffering with crippling misophonia, hyperacusis and auditory processing disorder for most of my life, I have to say I was really excited to try these. I got a pair of the originals. I really gave them a good go, but I could really feel them in there and tbh I found it really hard to tolerate them long enough to notice a difference - I have really small ears, and they were hurting me, quite a bit actually. I could not really leave them in long enough to notice any difference. So I gave up on them, and did not think about them again for a while. Was worth a shot, to me.\n\nI did not think about them again until I saw that they brought out two new versions - a 'mini' version and a 'night' version. I got one of each, as an experiment, as I am pretty desperate at the minute. Lockdown means everything is super quiet where I live and so even small noises are like gunshots to my ears. They arrived quickly, and well packaged - I am in the UK though, and they are a UK company. They each came with a little bag, and full instructions, really clear.\n\nFirst impressions:\n\nCalmer Night - they are really, really comfortable. They are soft and a bit squishy, like a rubber band, and they took a while to wriggle into place, but that might be because they were the first of the new two that I tried, I am much more comfortable poking them in now. I wore those outside mostly when I tried them first - it is a really significant memory for me as suddenly, I could hear so much clearer, instead of being overwhelmed by all the background noise. I tried sitting in a pub with my partner to eat - for the first time in a long time, I could really focus on him, and not on the surrounding tables of other people eating. I really, really like them. It is nice to feel a little bit more 'normal'.  \nCalmer Mini - They are definitely much more comfortable to go in, they are super small and once they go in, I cannot feel them there and barely need to adjust them, and so the audio experience has been really surreal for me. I am sat at home right now wearing them, and I am not at all 'triggered' by my usual sounds - my poor boyfriend eating, breathing, listening to music (even with his headphones on) , the phone vibrating or making any noise, or the sounds in a video game. Everything feels nice and chill. I keep having moments where I am looking up and around me, taking everything in. I am not wrapping my hoodie around my head or cringing from noises. It is going pretty good. Obviously it is only been a couple of days, but I can definitely tell these are working - it was an instant difference to me, unlike the original ones, which I could not wear long enough to work out if they helped or not.\n\nSome things to consider:  \nThe fitting of them is everything. I have really small ears and I think my ear canals must be shaped a bit strangely, because no matter how many times I tried to fit them with the instructions, I could not make them feel like they were not going to fall out. I found a technique, and I have not seen anyone else mention it, but when I put them in, I place them in, as per the instructions, but then I use the round, non-grabby end of a pair of tweezers to slot inside the open end of the bud, and very gently push them in, and 'back' towards the back of my head, gently using the side of the tweezers to press against the tragus part of my ear, to slightly 'open' my ear and the Calmer bud can slot in. When that happens, it pops in perfectly. If you have ever used a mooncup, it is an ever so slightly similar sensation :)\n\nWear time - I cannot wear them all day. They do ache after quite a while, so not sure if that is something that I will get used to. But for a few hours when I am sat in the house or at work with surrounding noise, my god, a sanity saviour. I work in film, and being able to sit in the edit with these on under my headphones, is delightful. Just being able to pop them in before I am subject to listening to mic pops and clicks. As an experiment, I tried listening to an ASMR video with them in, something that would previously make me scream or cry.  \nI cried listening to the first one. But only because I could hear new noises that I would not previously experienced as tolerable. I listened to a couple more.  \nYep, can see why those are a thing. Fun, when it is not horrible!\n\nThe 'ick' factor. After a while, these definitely feel waxy, and occasionally itchy after a super long time. I do not know if it is my system reacting to something new, but you definitely notice a slightly 'squelchier' feeling after a while. Weirdly this is more with the night ones over the mini ones, I wonder if it is because they are softer and maybe rub a bit more. In any case, I have a little pot to put them in after use and clean with water, because I cannot just put them back in my head after sitting out with wax on them.\n\nTo summarise:  \nI do not really enjoy not having these in, TBH. I love them. Because of the reasons I mentioned earlier, I am unable to have them in for all my waking hours (I do not suffer at night) and I really hope I can train my ears to be fine with them in. If I could have surgery to experience life like this, I would. I am glad to have both the Night and the Mini - I think I will keep alternating depending on the situation. For example, if I only need to wear them for a short time, I would go for the mini. I definitely think they are slightly better, possibly because they are firmer, they feel like they are holding their shape better inside my ear and (I know this sounds crazy) tunnelling the right noises into my head.  \nIf I need them in longer, I would go for the night ones. Still noticeably helping a lot, and I am hoping the waxiness goes away. I am nervous about pushing this new wax further into my head but I am keeping an eye on it, and trying not to use cotton buds - it feels waxy but you can get really obsessed wiping that all away and it is good not to, it is there to protect you. Try to resist the urge!\n\nI think if you can only go for one, the night version are good. Definite improvement. When they are in correctly you might find yourself speaking quietly at first as you get used to the new volumes going on in your head.\n\nHope some of that helps! Really happy to answer any questions if I can :) Thank you! I have been considering investing in expensive noise cancelling headphones but did not want to NOT hear things. I am going to have to look in to buying these for myself. Thank you for sharing this! I have been interested in these but being in the US, I was skeptical if it was going to be worth it.\n\nWhen you say you have tiny ears, do you mean like you always use the small size that comes with earbuds or is even that too big for you? They really were worth the shot for me. I am always muffling my head - the minute I feel a bit uncomfortable with noise I go from being a very confident, bubbly person to retreating inside myself completely, pulling hoods up, trying to hide behind my hair and squishing my fingers into my ears. It is really nice to feel just a little bit normal.  \nI do have some noise cancelling headphones for work, but without music on, they do not really help. And I do not always want music on. So these are very nice! When I want total silence, I like the Calmers on inside my headphones, and it is helpful for listening to my work like that.  \nI went for second hand headphones, if that helps :) The small size of earbuds is fine, but typically, I do not really like music inside my ears :) Things like my husband cracking his knuckles drives me CRAZY and makes me irrationally angry.  Would these help with that, and what kind should I get?  Thanks! It is possible that they might. I get immensely angry at irrational sounds (at the moment it is my partner\u2019s squeaky chair, yikes) and these definitely put those background noises in the background. I think I prefer the mini ones, hope that helps :)", "Low voice at work / computer keyboard clacking I am having a very difficult time with a co worker who has a low voice it drives me up a fucking wall and I get sorts of pissed off. Couple this with a room full of people typing away on computers and you have my version of hell. I am unable to use headphones at work being I talk with customers over the phone all day. I find myself plugging my ears and clenching my jaw in sheer hatred towards these sounds. My tolerance is going down every day and I do not know what to do. Any help is appreciated. ", "What do I do now? It does not matter where I am in the house but any sound my family makes travels right across it. Just now it was too much. My mom in the room right above me was talking on her phone. It is pretty late at night and she was so loud I could understand every word she said without focusing on it. I am so sick and tired of not being able to go to sleep or have quiet at night. I went to her and asked her **politely**, to talk a little bit quieter. I mean the phone was maybe a centimeter from her face.\n\nI was immediately yelled at for being disrespectful and interrupting and my phone and tablet were promptly taken away. I am probably not getting them back for at least a month. I completely rely on them for coping and do not know what I am going to do. I cannot fall asleep without music playing at night, and use it to calm down from the trigger stress during the day. Not to mention the other things I rely on it for, communication, alarm clock, etc. When I used this as a counterargument I was told, 'you should have thought of that before you told me that.'\n\nHonestly, I do not think it is fair, I have to deal with their noise every day and night and I was not even disrespectful about it. Please tell me I am not just being dramatic or being your basic teen. And now that she has my phone my mom's probably going to see this too so I might not exist tomorrow. Any advice would be very very appreciated. I do not think you are overreacting at all. It was unfair of her to take your phone, especially if it would be for a whole month. Teenagers are allowed to express their feelings and experiences, feeling comfortable in your own house should not be a privilege that you unlock when you turn 18. And honestly, if anything, it is disrespectful of *her* to be talking so loudly that late at night when other people are trying to sleep.\n\nThat being said, I also do not know what your mom's phone call was about. It could have been about something stressful to her, but it does not matter. She should not take it out on you and ground you for asking her to be a bit quieter.\n\nAlso if you are worried about her seeing this, perhaps change your Reddit password so she cannot get onto it on your phone. I am going through something similar and I also do not know exactly what to do, I am getting told to find something that annoys them a lot then keep doing it unless they stop,I do not really like that idea\n\n     But if ur able to talk to her when she is for sure level headed, or ask her this through someone else, to get a consoler or something because no one with half decent morals would approve of this situation, getting a consoler on ur side would not be hard as long as ur mom does not lie to her, so if u can get this family consoler thing then u have someone u can report to, someone that ur mom would would most likely listen to. Because they have the power to report their actions to other ppl. \n\n   I think the only good way for this to work out if she will not listen and still thinks that ur the one in the wrong, then having someone like a family consoler involved but that is just my opinion. if u do not want her to see this u can probably delete it. I have never tried to delete someone is comment on my post but if u cannot then just tell me after u read it. (Edit: idk why the middle is highlighted)", "(TW) Misophonia triggering other urges?

And my dad chewing, it is so gross and I have to eat in a different room from him.. I also hate the sound of babies crying but I think that is normal. My mom is certain I have misophonia but I do not want to self-diagnose. It does sound like it. If you try the deep breathing techniques, and acceptance techniques, and they work, it will not hurt to try them lol You definetely have it. When I discovered the term I did not want to self-diagnose but if you feel a deep hate for specific sounds then welcome to the group. It does sound like you may have it. The only question I have is whether or not singing and chewing cause you discomfort if it is not originating from your sister or your dad?

During my freshman year, I made very good friends with a person who did not have misophonia themselves, but completely understood me. They had a close friend with misophonia, a close friend I had the pleasure of meeting (god it is good to meet another, is not it?). Long story short, I drifted apart from both of these people recently, and there is no going back. Since then I have had no one else in my life who understands as well as they did. I have other friends who I think will come to understand the real mental exhaustion of misophonia, but I am (probably irrationally) scared that I will never meet anyone else who knew quite like those old friends. I dont know what to tell you. I am 40 and have never met another real life person with misophonia. I would be ecstatic if it ever were to happen.

There is one sound that makes my skin crawl almost as much as people chewing: the bass. For almost two years now, I have been trying to get it through my neighbor (right above my poor ears) that I can hear his shitty bass (he thinks he is a genius but he is no Dave Grohl) and that it is normal: vibrations go through stuff. That is how it works.\n\n\n\"But music instruments are loud! It is normal to hear them on an amp, even the bass, right?\" you are going to tell me. Thing is, now, he tends to play with the sound as low as possible. And I. Can. Still. Hear it.\n\n\nHe will not wear his headset everytime (\"it is heavy\" he says. Not a me problem, but whatever. I wear my headset everyday, every hour I am awake, so that I can escape the noise. But whatever.) and clearly thinks I am a dumbass.\n\n\nTwo years of having to remind him that we can hear him. Two years of \"dum dum dum dum\" with the same note, no variations. I am at a point where I just want to shove his bass between his butt cheeks, throw his amp out the window and screw his headset on his head. I know it is mostly because of my misophonia, otherwise hearing a little bit of music like that would not hurt me (stomach cramps, anyone?). And aside from listening to loud music, I do not know what to do. Moving out is not possible right now, and therapy by exposure clearly does NOT work. Guided mediation... Well, it will work as long as I have my earphones/headset on.\n\n\nI am at my wits end, playing against some clich\u00e9 cuntish Parisian (I promise we are not all like him) artist that thinks he is better than you. Even my landlord cannot do much at that point since the music is not technically loud. Right before him I had to confront the other neighbor (downstairs) because she used to party at like 3-5AM. I am tired. Too tired to even cry out of frustration. The only solace I have is that I know for sure the day we finally are able to move out, I will not ever hear him again, and I will send him a scathing text containing all the rage and hatred I have. Hearing someone else's Bass is the absolute worst. Have you tried explaining that it is a mental disorder and could also be linked to anxiety.  I talked to my doctor about it when I was getting meds. I am so sorry this is happening.  \nI will help you shove that bass up his butt though!!! He already thinks I am stupid, since an evening where my bf and I heard alarms 1nd strange noises in our building (we thought it was a burglar or something, it was really weird). When I asked him, via text, if he heard any of that, he called me to basically tell me \"he did not hear anything, perhaps he should get his hearing checked\" on a sarcastic tone. Add that to the fact that he may not even believe misophonia is a disorder, or that I am the one to blame for having a disorder, or even that I could just move out (I already got that answer from someone else, tbh) and you have the \"I am terrified to tell him about it\" cocktail.\n\n\nBut I will go see a psychologist soon, just to have a proof something is wrong. Then, maybe I will tell him.\n\n\nI will tell you when it is time to shove his bass up his butt! Well get revenge for everyone who has misophonia! Subwoofer against the shared surface, activated whenever he starts up. He needs to play it in a different location or run it thru headphones. That, or the police. Also, check out the badneighbors subs. \\&gt; He needs to play it in a different location or run it thru headphones.  \n\n\nOh, he just refuses to wear his headphones sometimes. \"Because they are heavy\" he says. I even told him that ***I*** wear mines everyday, all day long, and he just laughed nervously.\n\nAnd I am fairly sure that the volume is so low (there is a decibel threshold, around 80dB and it clearly is not that high) it would not count as a disturbance. :/ Ugh that is so annoying and frustrating! I am so sorry you have to deal with that. I have something similar. My neighbors from above me. Have a baby and the baby cries a lot every night and it is annoying but it does not affect me in the misophonia kind of sounds. But! They have a humidifier (I am assuming) they turn it on at nights (not every night thank god) but the humidifier makes this humming noise in the floor that I know it is not loud. My husband does not care about it obviously. It bothers the hell about of me. It makes me screen I hate it! The only thing that helps me is that I sleep with thunderstorms sounds and that is way louder but sometimes I can still hear it. It amazes me how sensitive our ears are to sounds when you have misophonia. Sometimes others cannot even hear a thing. It is crazy and annoying &gt;My husband does not care about it obviously. \n\nOmg my boyfriend is the same! Back when the bass was loud, he was pissed off too but now that it is so low, he is able to not pay attention while I am left seething in my corner.\n\n&gt;The only thing that helps me is that I sleep with thunderstorms sounds\n\nI have to sleep with earphones and binaural sounds to be able to relax a bit and fall asleep, so... Mood.\n\nIt truly is incredible how sensitive our hearing is! What amazes me is how we just cannot NOT pay attention to these sounds. They can be low as hell and I will still only hear them, not being able to focus on anything else, like it is... Idk, overwhelming? Yes, I have a protocol for neighbors like this. I ask them nicely ONCE. After that, I intentionally make noise to make them suffer, and when they complain, I point out that they ignored me so turnabout is fair play. But I suppose I could stop if you would stop. This puts me in a superior negotiating position, and I always get what I want.\n\nDo not do anything illegal, and do not communicate over texts, email, or other easily storable mediums. Attention to sounds is a survival mechanism built by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. That is why peace and quiet is a basic human right. You cannot just turn off what you have been built to do in your DNA. That is... Really well put. I did not see it that way! &gt; shove his bass between his butt cheeks, throw his amp out the window and screw his headset on his head\n\nDo it. And more. This is not enough. Jesus, that is sounds so IRRITATING. I hope you can move out ASAP.

At the minute I have bedrooms above me, right now is not so bad, the person is not in the bedroom overly much, without earplugs/headphones on, I can hear every footstep, bang, voice/coughing though.\n\nThe few neighbours before that, have been a complete nightmare, last lot all met up in the bedroom until 3-4am, stomping, laughing, dropping stuff, shouting and loud music.\n\nYou are right, it would depend on the building, and you could have a good neighbour, then a bad, or vice-versa.\n\nI am looking for a place right now, I personally will not take somewhere with someone above me, but then I would prefer no-one above, below, or beside :)\n\nWishing you luck! Thanks for the insight! Hope you find a QUIET new home :) Thanks, you too :) That sounds like my apartment. Except I have the joy of having my bedroom surrounded by living rooms. I knew when my neighbors kid learned to walk, I know when my other neighbor is drunk versus high. It sucks. My gf can sleep thru anything so I just use my earbuds and listen to my sleepy time podcast. Hi! I am sorry you have to live like that, I understand. You definitely learn a lot about your neighbour's lives, sometimes, things you really do not want to know\u00a0about :/\n\nOh, to be like your girlfriend. Must be bliss :)\u00a0 upstairs is always better I feel like triggering noises are somewhat inevitable in apartment living, but for some reason it is not as bad for me when I am above it. The same way that I have to sit in the back row of movies, or with my back to the wall at restaurants. To be honest most apartment sounds do not trigger me, but my niece is LOUD on the floor and I just do not know if that is as much a risk in a carpeted apartment vs a house with wood floors. My last apartment I was upstairs and the walls were so paper thing I could hear my neighbors talking a lot of the time and I do not ever recall being triggered by the apartment noises. Bothered maybe at times but not triggered. I live in the mountains by myself. Its great", "Sitting here wanting to cry because of my neighbour I am too anxious to actually go say anything to him, but I can barely go into my livingroom/kitchen because my neighbour (in an apartment, mind you) has a grandfather clock that sounds off every half hour. It is so loud I can hear it from my bedroom if I do not have white noise blaring in every room. I feel like I am going to vomit from the pain of wearing earplugs every day. Start with the landlord then. Read your agreement, I am sure there is a clause against it to support you. The neighbor will probably be cool with it, they did not realize it was so loud. My landlord is a crazy old man haha. I do not want to escalate things, I am just exhausted. This is why I do not live in an apartment. Ask the neighbor then. A grandfather clock in an apartment is inappropriate. I am sure they would be happy to help.

I recently moved back in with my parents bc COVID and they do not understand my issue. I actively avoid eating with/near them. They do not understand that I cannot just ignore it, and they are starting to get irritated with me. I told my mother that the sound was bothering me and she just made it louder as a joke and I burst into tears. My ears are so sensitive to the sound that I can hear them from the other side of the house, in my room. I do not know what to do - everything we do as a family involves food in some way. I do not want to be completely anti-social at home and I do not want to keep fighting about my trigger. Have a serious sit down and talk about it, showing medical papers discussing it.\nGive them descriptions, like how it feels line nails on a chalk board and how you cannot help it. You just need to be honest with them A lot of people lack empathy, so you have to explain it to them in physiological terms. Make them understand that the noise produces a physical response that you have no control over.  Do not talk about how you \"feel\" or \"feelings\".  People who lack empathy do not care about your feelings.  Talk about the damage it does to your body. They will never get it. Just move out", "Wow, And to think that my dad could not get any worse. Wow, now that because he thinks the speaker he put with me is too loud, he took that away too. What the fuck is this guy even?!", "My coworker will not stop loudly clearing his throat every two minutes or so for at least thirty minutes after eating. I do not know how to escape this and I am desperate. My coworker will not stop clearing his throat after he has breakfast, like he will go for at least 30 minutes straight VERY LOUDLY clearing his throat every TWO MINUTES or so.\n\nI cannot deal with it, today it was all too much and I had to leave the room and go cry in the bathroom for ten minutes. I hate having this issue, it makes my life so much harder than it needs to be...\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to cope with this? I cannot put on earphones because I would need to explain why I am doing it and that is absolutely not an option right now, I cannot leave the room every two minutes, sometimes I find myself crying in front of my desk or trying to hurt myself to distract my mind from the trigger. We have music playing constantly, and the speaker is closest to me, but this does not work for me because once I hear a trigger my mind hyperfixates on it and almost enhances it as much as possible until it is over.\n\nThank you for reading. I am sorry you are experiencing this. Have you tried reaching out to HR? I have heard of some Redditors who did &amp; were accommodated accordingly. \n\nYou may need to talk to him about it as a health issue? He may have laryngopharyngeal reflux which causes him to do this repeatedly, It can be treated too if he cares..\n\nFor me HR ridiculed me so i tried telling my sniffling coworker that i have a condition but she could not control her tic. Having a small fan at my desk at all times as a distraction did not really do much, could not use earbuds efficiently either, So i simply quit after 1.5 years.\nHope you find some peace at your workplace. Hang in there.. I do not think contacting HR is the move for me in this case. We are an international business, him and I are the only workers from my country, everyone else is in different countries in another continent, so there is a bit of a disconnect there.\n\nI may try to talk to him about it as a medical issue if it gets to it, but I really hope it does not because every time I have tried something like this I have sadly had a similar outcome to yours... It sucks.\n\nSorry that you had to quit, we really do not deserve to live like this, there needs to be more work done towards treating our issue or at least normalizing it enough that we can talk about it without being ridiculed because no one understands.\n\nThank you for your reply, sending you a big hug \u2764\ufe0f Ive been on the other side of the fence.  After eating id have to cough / clear my throat a lot for 30 - 60 min.  As the one doing it, i didnt notice how bad it was.  A coworker kindly pointed it out with the utmost tact. I think he said,\n\"I swear to god if you dont stop coughing after you eat, im going to make you rely on feeding tubes for all your future meals\"  or something like that.\n\nAnyway, after he calmed down we had an actual conversation that made me realize just how much i was doing it.  We set up a system so id eat my lunch about a half hour before he took his lunch break.  He never ate at his desk so he was away while i was coughing.  Meanwhile I spoke with my doctor, discovered i had GERD and some other digestive / allergy issues.  Started treatments and my symptoms are far better controlled.\n\nMorale of the story, your coworker might not recognize how often theyre doing it, and may be grateful for an alert, especially if delivered with some diplomacy.  Or they might get defensive and be an asshole about it, but i think itd be worth the attempt.\n\nEDIT:  Id tell them before they eat if possible.  Makes it more likely they will notice what you are saying. Can you get some discreet ear plugs? The cheap ones at the drugstore are pretty small. Might be able to discreetly insert them and take them out 30 minutes later without him noticing. If he notices you could say your doctor recommended it to help reduce stimulation because of migraines or something... Or another little white lie like that That is a very good idea. I am actually having jaw problems, which he is aware of, and this affects my hearing. So this is definitely worth a try, thank you so much!! Wow it is actually very helpful hearing the other perspective. It is true that he may react defensively about it, but hopefully he would realize what he is doing because I honestly do not believe what he is doing is normal... Will have to think about this, thank you so much for your perspective \u2764\ufe0f Sadly, you might have to plan an exit strategy and just get a new job.\n\nIn the mean time, could you step out for a bit while your coworker is making noise? Oh god this would drive me crazy I am sorry. I wonder if he has a throat issue? Honestly does not even have to be a lie. You could say you are easily distracted and need them to reduce stimulation. That is 100% true.", "It makes my blood boil! ", "Professor is irritating me. TW: smacking is mentioned. \n\n\nHi you all! I have pretty bad misophonia, without going into too much detail w trigger words here, I get triggered in pretty much any situation. \n\nMy worst trigger is smacking. I cannot deal with it and it makes me extremely anxious and stressed out. It even causes physical reactions from me. My professor has lectures online and I have to get through them and take notes, he smacks about every 5 seconds. I am not talking about light chewing gum smacking, I am talking about extreme mouth sounds when opening and closing his mouth. Especially when he is about to start the next objective. \n\nCan anyone offer advice? I am really struggling, luckily I only have about a month left of listening to these, but it is making my stress levels and anxiety levels skyrocket :( I literally dropped a class at the beginning of a semester because the teacher could not function without smacking a wad of gum in his mouth. Just wanted to say you are not alone and you have made it this far\u2026you should be really proud that you have been able to get through. Just push a little longer and you are done! What I do when I have to deal with noises like this -- that I cannot escape -- is to wear foam ear plugs and then then turn the volume up just enough that I can hear the talking.  Does this sound like it might work? That sounds like an amazing idea. Thank you so much, hopefully I can get some today bc I have an hour and 10 min lecture to listen to today lol! Thank you!! I appreciate it. I could not stand it when teachers had gum in high school so I completely understand. The struggle is so real . I am sorry you need to go through this. \n\nI also had a similar thing i had to go through 2 weeks of training at work alone in a room with an extreme tongue smacker, who was doing it on purpose once she realized sit annoyed mr. Damn. It is a tough one. I recommend playing white noise sounds in the earphones while listening to him. Tru to have it at higher volume than him talking. Try many sounds until you find the one that matches the frequency of The Smacking. \n\nGood luck friend sending love n patience your way I like the foam ear plugs the best.  They can be purchased at big box discount stores, big box home improvement stores, and online.  There are some that are sort of flared at the end that give a bit better results.  But, in general, they work well and are relatively cheap.  \n\n\nWhat I do with mine when they get dirty is put them through the wash with the whites.  That way, they get the hottest water and bleach (if you use it).  Then let them air dry.  Do not put them in the dryer with the rest of the clothes or they will get hard.  Which they will eventually, but by washing them you can extend the life of them a bit. And I sure hope you reviewed his ass. I have been out of college 30 years, and it was bloody fucking rare to encounter a teacher behaving so boorishly. I detest the smell of cigarettes, and I would rather deal with a prof who smoked. I dropped the class before a couple weeks were over so it would not have been fair to review him since I did not really \u201chave\u201d him as a professor for long.  But I agree, it is super unprofessional", "DAE hate when people talk over music? My mum does this **all the time.** I have explained to her before that it annoys me, i understand that she wants to talk, but nothing stresses me out more than her talking to me just as a song starts or  midway through to ask me a question. I guess it bothers me so much because I usually sing along, so I am focused on the words. And it can be explained with the working memory model which explains why it is difficult to take in several sounds at once. I think it is probably misophonia related though because it gives me a lot of anxiety and makes me feel trapped and suffocated.  I can relate. Especially when I am clearly into a song, relaxing and enjoying, and they try to conversate and I reply quickly and go back to listening and they keep interrupting the flow of the song and will not stop\n...just wait till the song is over to talk a lot pls  I do not usually mind when people talk over music unless I am trying to listen to it, but I *cannot stand* when two things are playing at once. I went to lunch with my mom a few weeks ago and there was obviously music on in the restaurant, and then she wanted to show me some video she found of Alan Cumming busking on the metro. The video was amazing but I could not fucking handle having a song playing while other music was playing in the background. I felt bad turning it off after like 20 seconds but my god. My friend always seems to take my favorite parts of songs as his cue to start talking and it drives me nuts. Especially when it is a song I am sharing with the group or just a good one playing. You are not alone", "I am not sure if I have misophonia I just do not want to be one of those guys that self diagnose and think they can use some mental illness to justify being a terrible person. I have heard about misophonia few days ago and I have been wondering since if it is what is making me so angry when I hear sounds like, people breathing, people talking through the wall, people whispering, and the list keeps getting bigger. I think it started when I was around 12 years old with people breathing, I had a friend with difficulties to breath and I could not stand it and I though I was a terrible person because I knew it was not her fault. Now I am 22 and I feel like I can hardly stand anything, I live in a dormitory and I can hear people talking in the corridor and I just want to kill them or jump through the window, I have to put the music in my earbuds so loud that I fear it might ruin my hearing. I had an exam yesterday and I could hear the teacher in the next room talking it was so loud I am sure everyone was annoyed but I wanted to get out of the room and go see that teacher to tell them shut up so badly. With all that I would say it seems obvious I suffer from misophonia but at the same time I am wondering if it is just my social anxiety, I cannot stand people so it seems fair that I cannot stand hearing them ? I am not even sure sometimes what is triggering me... And when I hear sounds I usually cannot stand but recorded, it does not do anything to me... \n\nSo I am not sure where I am trying to get with all that maybe it is more rant than a question, I just want to know if other people relate to that or their opinion from experience. I think I might talk about that to my psy next time I see him. We totally relate! I mean I do, but I have also read countless other posts about all the triggers you listed. \n\nYour sentiments are exactly why Misophonia needs more research. The struggle to understand what Misophonia is, and to isolate it from other disorders, is the biggest avenue for research right now. \n\nThat said, unfortunately, right now nobody can *officially* tell you whether you have misophonia or not. The diagnostic criteria is not agreed upon yet. So if you are going down the Misophonia route, it is likely going to be a self-diagnosis advised by a professional based on whatever research we have available.\n\nIf you want to do some research, a good and reliable place to start reading would be: \n\nHowever, the biggest distinguishing factor for most people is that sounds which are normal to others cause you a stress or anxiety. You will see people talking about this \"fight or flight\" response. Most of the time, it is with the sound of people eating, but I have seen people that have the same responses I have about people eating from other sound sources - perhaps just like yourself. Again, with the lack of information about Misophonia, nobody has a good understanding of where the line is.  I have heard people before have less of a trigger response from recordings as well. I have yet to read a study that examines why this might be, however.  Ironically, many studies use recordings to evoke the Misophonia response from subjects. \n\nBe wary of scam artists that label everything as Misophonia and charge you for \"cures\" and \"treatments\"! There are *no known treatments for Misophonia.* Many therapies also have mixed results in studies - this causes confusion even for professionals! \n\nOverall, I think researching what is out there can give you a better understanding of what Misophonia is, what the facts are, and how to start to cope with it.\n\nHopefully that helped! If not, I hope something helps! &lt;3 Thanks a lot ! I will look into it, I know not to trust everything I read on the internet but thank you for the warning I think it is a good possibility from reading your post. You sound like you fit the symptoms of misophonia, so at least take a breath and realize/remind yourself that you are not a bad person -- you have a condition. \n\n(\n\nMore specifically, ( with some thoughts on coping/managing.\n\nMy daughter (13yo) started exhibiting similar symptoms earlier this year. Here is what we have done, and I hope some of it helps you.\n\nSince she is mostly triggered by meal-related sounds (&gt;!chewing, utensils scraping!&lt;), we tried to eliminate or reduce those. I purchased plates and utensils made of wheat-straw to get rid of the sounds. \n\nNext, she wears ( listens to brown noise during meals. She says this drowns out our sounds better than white noise or music, and it also lets us have a pretty normal meal with her. We can have a conversation, just need to raise our voices a bit. \n\nI really, really recommend you try for some headphones, or at least the brown noise. That seems to be a big help to her. We learned that there is a \"rainbow\" of noise -- pink, purple, I think gray, and maybe more. You should experiment and see what works for you. \n\nI would also recommend sleepphones -- headphones that are flat speakers in a headband, made so that you can listen while you sleep. ( (although I do not have misophonia). These are not noise-canceling but it might be more comfortable to wear in your room, or at least a change from regular headphones or earbuds.\n\nThat was accommodation, and now we are working on coping. We took her to an ENT just to eliminate any physical problems.The ENT recommended a therapist. You say you are at school, so you might not be able to get to an ENT, but you should talk to someone at the student health center to get started.\n\nIt is true that misophonia is not an official diagnosis; our ENT gave us a diagnosis of hyperacusis so that we had something to work with for my daughter's school. I do not know that you can get the same, but it might be worth talking to someone. This allowed us to work up a plan with her guidance counselor, for example.\n\nIt also seems that misophonia is tied to anxiety/stress. Whether one causes the other or they are simply more likely to happen together, I do not know. With my daughter, I can see it -- if her stress level goes up, she is bothered by more noises, sometimes including breathing. With that in mind, we found a therapist for her who is going to pursue cognitive behavioral therapy. I am hoping that dealing with the anxiety may help reduce the misophonia.\n\nGood luck, I hope you get some relief. That sounds like misophonia. And 9-12 years old are where most people form misophonia. I can totally relate with the whispering, by the way. Even just thinking about makes my skin crawl!", "How to not internalize my partner's sensitivity?  Direct question but I am going to ask it. Do you eat with your mouth closed? If not please do so. This is a really really tough situation. \nI am sort of with the other commenter that if you can you should try to see if you can eat in a way that does not make noise. I do understand a little bit about eating disorders and understand that this may be a triggering suggestion depending on your specific experiences, so I apologize if it is.\nOther suggestions: \nfind a show that you are both interested in and put that on \u2014 the distraction could help. It will not help though if you eat much slower than he does and are the last person eating while he is trying to watch the show, so bear that in mind.\n\nOther suggestion, try to frame the necessity to eat as really important for you. At least for me, it helps when I understand exactly WHY a sound has to be made. Like a toddler or a dog eating will not annoy me because they do not know any better. It is harder for me to get triggered by people who are making a noise because they absolutely HAVE to, etc.\n\nHope this helps; good luck! And thank you for at least trying! What I try to remind to the people around me is that I do not find any of them disgusting (even if in the moment my brain thinks I do).\n\nIt is the sound and the sound alone that I have a problem with, no matter who makes it, so try not to take it personal because it is not, you are not doing anything wrong, it just happens that the sound your body naturally makes triggers an erroneous response in your partners head. You are not in the wrong for eating and it is your right to do so because well, you would die if you did not lol. Nobody has the fault in this situation, it is just a bad thing that happened to us. step one: realise misophonia is a mental illness that cannot really be helped or cured, only coped with.\n\nstep two: profit\n\nalso as another commenter mentioned, if you do not already chew with your mouth closed, make sure to make that a habit. that *is* gross, even w/o the misophonia. I have misophonia and have had an eating disorder so I understand both sides. One thing to realize that your boyfriend does not find *you* \"disgusting.\" He just has an aversion to a certain sound. We may have different triggers. His just happens to be eating sounds. \n\nYour boyfriend seems to have a decent handle on what coping mechanisms work for him. Continue to allow him to utilize these tools, but prioritize building up your own toolbox too. Recovery is hard, even without triggers at home. I really recommend mental health therapy if you are not already engaged in it, for you and him both, individually! Try not to think of it as disgust, try to think of it as his brain hearing the worst noise you can think of instead of normal sounds. I am not disgusted by eating sounds, they are more like nails on a chalk board or someone squeaking a balloon. I would want to die if I made a loved one feel the way you do. We would all turn it off if we could. Just think about how much he must adore you to have a meal with you even though there are bound to be triggers. I think he probably worships the ground you walk on if he is willing to have dinner with you. I just want to say thank you for being understanding and supportive of your boyfriend! I would suggest doing some activity while eating/having some sensory distractions. Nice scents, textures, maybe music. Or playing a board game, even. :) I do not have anything else to add, I wish you both the best \ud83d\udc9b I have friends and family members that trigger the hell out of my misophonia sometimes. It does not mean I love them any less or think they are disgusting because they trigger me.\n\nHonestly, I spend a good chunk of time worrying that they think I hate them or think they are gross. I do not! I understand that many of my triggers are things that people do naturally/subconsciously and cannot really help. I would imagine many sufferers of misophonia think the same way.\n\nOnly time we would think you are disgusting is if you eat with your mouth open. That is just gross. \ud83d\ude05", "I need somewhere quiet to live for a while (like a basement)- does anyone happen to have an unused basement/quiet room/attic?

Not sure where you live but in my country that would be distubing the peace.", "My story with Misophonia Hi everyone, I have struggled severely with Misophonia for almost as long as I can remember and just stumbled upon this community. I wanted to share a bit about my experience, and ways I have learned to cope.\n\nSome of my youngest childhood memories involve my two younger brothers playing with toys in the living room while I tried to read, or even play my own toys. The action sounds they would make (\"Pshh, pshh\", \"Aahhh\", \"Kshhh crash boom\", etc) as they played with figurines or cars would drive me absolutely insane. I was \\~6 years old when it first began really driving me bonkers. I would throw tantrums, yell at my brothers, lock myself in my room, or scream at my brothers to play with toys quietly. The mouth sounds imitating sound effects felt like they dug straight into the center of my brain and I could not focus on anything else. My parents did not understand, my brothers obviously did not understand, I did not understand, and this continued for a while.\n\nThen, the chewing started to drive me crazy around \\~4th grade and the start of middle school. My cousins had just moved in with me, and my older cousin was in high school at the time. I would come home from school 30 minutes before she would and my every day routine would be to come home, go into my room, lock the door and count the minutes until my cousin came home. Her favorite snack, every day, was a large bowl of cereal that she absolutely chomped on, slurped up, smacked around, and overall seemed to make extra efforts to be as loud as possible while eating. Sometimes I would cry, even if I could not hear it but just knowing she was in the other room doing that drove me insane. When i would tell her it bothered me, of course she found it comical and would then make efforts to taunt me and intentionally smack food at any given occasion.\n\nLater in middle school began the worst part. People started chewing gum, and gum has since come to be the bane of my entire existence. I would try to tell people in class that gum chewing made me incredibly anxious, enraged and frustrated, but again they found it funny and would chew even more intensely. Every day was a potential nightmare waiting to happen. I will always remember one day during Junior year when I stepped outside a classroom to prepare for my turn in a debate, then when I stepped back into the room all 35 of my peers were smacking gum and smirking. One of my friends had \"jokingly\" handed out gum to the entire class, and made sure to bring enough gum to do specifically so. \n\nI played baseball in middle/highschool and the chewing tobacco, sunflower seeds and gum were the most difficult aspect of the entire game. On many occasions my team would win a huge game, but somebody would be frantically chowing down on sunflower seeds in the loudest of manners right next to my ear during the post-game team meeting. The whole experience would be ruined.\n\nThere was a period where I stopped eating dinner with my family at the table because I could not enjoy myself while they ate. I would sit outside on the porch steps and eat the meal my Mom would have cooked by myself. The mere smell of mint gives me dreadful anxiety as I know somebody around me might have just pulled out a stick of gum. On a bus, if I even see someone is jaw clench as if a piece of gum might be in their mouth, I begin to panic intensely. \n\nMy response to misophonia is very severe. My heart races, I begin to sweat, my face turns red, I get very very fidgety. I feel as if my blood pressure increases, my thoughts become irrational and unlike my normal self. I have had visions of hurting people when trapped in gum-chewing circumstances for extended periods. I am typically a very calm, easy going guy and most of my friends could not even imagine what I look like angry. But misophonia triggers, specifically gum and food today, make me feel as if I am the Hulk and I could smash down an infinitesimal number of walls until there are no more gum-chewers left. \n\nI have performed poorly in several very important college courses due to gum chewing during exams or lectures making me not think straight or completely skip class/lecture due to anxiety.  School is not accommodating as it is not in the MSD-5 or whatever psych book they use. If someone offered me 10,000,000$ to sit in a room with someone chewing (not even smacking) gum for 5 minutes, I would scream NO before the question was even finished. Misophonia is on my mind in every single social interaction I ever encounter.\n\nToday I work in business and I get terrible anxiety before every big meeting or pitch. I am a very confident person and do not have anxiety of speaking or crowds, but I do have an incredible fear that somebody in the crowd or at the table will be chewing gum while I need to talk. How could I possibly ask a respected, noteworthy, influential person that I barely know (and am likely asking for money) to stop chewing their gum, during a high stakes conversation?  My company is small, but once we begin hiring people I might have to implement a no-gum policy in the workplace which may disgruntle employees. It is extremely, extremely, extremely difficult for me to go on dinner or food dates with potential or current partners (or even just friends). Thus, the situation will likely follow me until who-knows-when. Maybe one day I will become president and I will take executive action to ban all sales of gum throughout the country. Maybe one day I will retire on a lake house and nobody will be around to chew gum or smack food for miles. \n\n\\---------------------------\n\nNow on to happier things. The #1 coping method that is effective for me is background noise or music. I have learned to always, always always keep charged noise cancelling ear buds in my pocket whenever I leave the house. I typically try and take my bose QC35 headphones with me, but this is more difficult to carry around and not appropriate for all social situations. Sometimes when I am with a group of friends I will pop in one headphone and play music, and this helps calm me down a lot. My other coping method is to simply leave the area where a gum chewer or food smacker is at. My friends know if I ever suddenly bolt to the bathroom, that I am probably getting triggered and they understand. I have also been taking iron supplements, which are supposedly helpful but I cannot really tell any difference. \n\nI have never been able to share the depths of my experience with misophonia, and the whole story through childhood to today as a 24 year old man. The most difficult part throughout all of this is the lack of understanding from people without misophonia. Nobody ever gets how truly, truly traumatic the feeling can be. Nobody understands that the sound of chewing gum or smacking chips feels physiologically very literally painful to me. \n\nIt feels good just to share this here and know there are other people out there, more people than I thought, struggling with similar issues. If you ever need help, have suggestions, or anything, feel free to shoot me a DM. I will also be watching this sub pretty normally. Welcome here my friend, i am glad you stumbled upon a community where you (unfortunately?) belong &amp; can relate to. There is also r/misophonia (which is a bigger one) if you are interested.\n\nI am truly at loss of words here, what a rollercoaster.\nOn one hand your childhood memories are so relatable it is painful; others insensitivity or even worse, taunting, is very scarring. I personally think of misophonia as sort of a disability! It renders (at least me) literally disabled in many contexts.\n\nOn the other hand the more \u201chappier\u201d part is still kind of stressful but i am glad we have got some options to \u201ccope\u201d i guess.\nThanks for sharing... Chin up! Thanks for sharing your story. I am also new to this subreddit and finally decided it would be good to learn about other people dealing with misophonia. It is very comforting to know there are people who understand how real and debilitating it can be.\n\nI am glad you have some good coping mechanisms, as well as friends who you can be honest with about this. It is a lonely world when no one takes it seriously.\n\nWith that said, keep up the good sense of humor and best of luck to you :) Welcome", "Almost got sent to the Dean for listening to music... help. I really really really do not like my English teacher. There are a lot of reasons, but the most recent one is this.\n\nWe were doing independent work, the kind where you are supposed to be silent and work on your own. No group work, no lesson, nothing that involves me having to listen to other people. The girl in a row behind me is snapping and popping her gum. I wanted to pull a *Chicago* on her. So I put my earbuds in, set some music to play on my phone, and put my phone back into my backpack. I am not even on it; I am doing my work.\n\nMy teacher walks by and tells me to take them out. I tell her not to, and she replies, \"Do you want to go talk about it with the dean?\"\n\nSo I put my earbuds away and suffer for the rest of the period. Is there a way you can talk to your principle or someone higher up so that you can utilize earbuds or earplugs? You do not have to be confrontational about it or try to get your teacher into trouble or anything. Just say this is a specific problem that is being highly researched right now and that it affects you and for your own academic experiences negatively. Because of that, you need to block the noises someone might be making that triggers you. \n\nIt might also help to educate whoever you talk to by sharing a website that shows this is an actual problem medical professionals are researching - something like Duke\u2019s official site \n\nThis can help legitimize your issues.

I am 40 years old and have done a lot of suffering in silence my entire life and I have found that the more that I am vocal about misophonia, the more people take it seriously. If I could go back in time and be more vocal about it, I would. How old are you? What country? (I will assume USA unless told otherwise.)\n\nThis condition may not technically be in the DSM yet, but it is 100% a medical condition that affects our ability to function and learn in a classroom.\n\nPeople fought hard for the legislation that allows EVERY student to have a \"Free and Appropriate Public Education\" available to them, with the accommodations that they may need to learn as well as the rest of the class. Do not let their efforts be in vain -- we are the exact people they were fighting for. If your teacher or your principal gives you any guff about either allowing you to use your earbuds or instituting a \"no eating/chewing gum in the classroom\" policy, it is because they have lost sight of what education is about, and you and your therapist have every right to write a note and remind them. You have that ability, and that *right*, and it is not \"too much\" at all. A good teacher will just accept the note and quietly institute the accommodations, without calling you out or embarrassing you, and if that is not what happens, it is not because of anything *you* did, it is because you have a bad teacher.\n\nYou should absolutely, positively, speak to your principal and/or your teacher about this. You can start without the note, or bring it as backup if you feel like you want it. Heck, ask your therapist whether they think it is \"too much\" to ask -- I have found that therapists of any kind are really good at helping people parse out whether they are overthinking things or not :)  \"hey, can I tell you guys something? I have this weird thing called misophonia and it makes me panic when I am around gum chewing and pen clicking. I am pretty embarrassed about it but I cannot help it. Sorry but those are the two noises I cannot handle.\" - u/princesspussypie\n\n\n\nLetter to Friends, Family, and Co-workers:\n\n Stop worrying about what other people will think about you. That is their problem not yours. Your problem needs their help. Ask for their help.\n\nIf they help, great. \n\nIf they do not help, then they suck, they are Rats. Be the Dog, eat the Rat. If you can combat miso then you can easily handle a Rat. Definitely get your therapist to write you a note, it is about the only thing helpful mine did for me. Ask to be always be seated at the back of the classroom (so there are no triggers behind you) and permission to play white noise in class and during tests to block out background noise. Thank you! The only problem is that I am pretty short, so if I am at the back, I cannot always see. Haha I am pretty short too. Another great option is to sit next to a wall (on the right if you are right handed) so that if you hear your triggers you can lean on on your knuckles on your left hand to block out the noise discreetly whilst still getting work done with your right hand. Lol I hope that made sense. Thank you for posting these - I would seen them before but I finally read the letter, and then went to the website copy of the letter. And then I clicked away as fast as I could. Right justified text for that entire thing? Give me a break! I could not look at it.

I decided to sit in the middle of my parents who are really disgusting when it comes to eating. Or so I think. And to make things worst we were eating soup.i think is one of the worst foods in the world in terms of triggers. So in an effort to block out the noises I put headphones on and start blaring music. Which did not help but it was something I guess. They then proceed to yell saying I am going to spill the bowl on myself if I do not turn it off while getting even closer towards me as if we were not close enough. They have no idea that misophonia even exists and so when I say please stop and eat your food like a civilised person. They start laughing knowing I have not slept in days and I have been feeling really anxious with everything that has been going on in the world at the moment. So at this point I am regretting my entire existence. I try to not cry and just do what they told me to and just suck it up. \n\nBut you know what I am really over this and I want  to tell them everything but they still think I am their little angel and nothing could possibly be wrong with me and I am totally not crying myself to sleep over little things. What do I do, I need a therapist?? The moment I started telling people about my misophonia, was the moment I started feeling a little weight lifted off my shoulders. It is a tough topic. I am 21 rn and have had severe Misophonia since the 7th grade. It was not until late high school that I started telling people. My advise is to tell people right away, before it gets too late. You would be surprised how many understanding people are out there. But there are also some jerks who will abuse it. But they are far and few between. Also remember that people will f up here and there and accidentally trigger something. So be sure to tell people before hand that when that happens, to just let you do your thing, and move on (or however you see fit). Lastly, therapy is great. Therapy is not something to be ashamed of. I have gone to some therapy in college (it is free!). It was nice to finally vent. But sadly I did not keep up with it. Try your best to stick with it and find a therapist who will check up on you. We all live strange lives. Our lives are just a little different. You matter. Thank you so much, this means a lot. I am currently in 8th grade and I am lucky to have really nice understanding friends and I really want to say the same for my family but I do not know if I can and I feel really guilty just by saying that. But I will do my best to tell them and get therapy. Thank you. God I would love to see what you look like.

The prior tenants were still here when I viewed the apartment and I asked about noise, specifically loud music. They said there was none, and they would been here 4 years and both working from home since Covid. They had no reason to lie as far as I could tell, they would given notice with plenty of time so were not on the hook for finding the next renter. They also did not have a TV or stereo system, so I do not think they were just drowning out the music with their own noise.\n\nI have been here less than a week with three unbearable loud music incidents already. In the past my Avantek white noise machine + earplugs + Bose Quiet Comfort has been enough to block any apartment noise (aside from some construction). Not this time. I guess it is because of the bass. It is happened at 8 am, 8 pm, and afternoon, so seems like anytime goes.\n\nI am feeling shattered and extremely anxious. I work at home like many of us and I am extremely sensitive to loud music. Footsteps and doors suck but I find them bearable, it is the music and the anxiety around when it will happen and for how long and how loud, if I have a migraine when it is happening - all of that. It is better if I move to the bedroom, and then my headphones/noise machine/earplugs block it better, but I cannot do that all time because of working, not to mention the anxiety it is causing me. I do not even feel able to cope.\n\nI guess at some point I will have to speak to them, but in the past this has only made the situation worse and caused me more anxiety because of having to see the people when coming and going. I do not want to go through that.\n\nI am wondering if others have had success in talking to people playing loud music and how you phrased the complaint, and if adding any kind of speaker system to the noise-blocking mix helps, and which one. I only listen to music on the laptop or through headphones, so I do not know anything about speakers, but I cannot think of what else to do besides blast something instrumental so I can work/hear myself think/keep the anxiety in check, and if my downstairs neighbor complains then at least we can try to solve it with the upstairs as two instead of only me. I ordered the LectroFan which I think might be louder than my current machine, but I am not optimistic.\n\nOr does anyone have other techniques that have worked? Try talking to them and explaining, but do not get your hopes up. Take a look at the lease agreement first, see if there is anything about excessive noise or quiet hours. The realty company should hold them to it. If not, that is grounds for legal action and to get out of the lease if you have to. Unfortunately nothing in the lease about noise.

I have to either be in a restaurant or have music/tv playing in the background. Hearing people chewing annoys me, but I get more stressed out about trying to eat quietly. Does that make sense?\n\nI also have this thing where I get extremely agitated when I hear a noise and I cannot find the source of it. For example, I live in an apartment complex and sometimes I hear people talking outside, yet I cannot see them no matter how many times I look (no im no hearing things, I just think they are on the street level and I cannot see them from my window.

I had done some research on it about three years ago due to my own suspicions that I was not reacting to sound the way that others around me were. Certain sounds echo in my ears and make me want to claw my skin off. I have found something that works sometimes, where I can rub my ears with hair between my ears and fingers and scream in my head, but that does not always stop the sound. It makes me physically shake and hit myself. Certain sounds include but are not limited to nail cutting, stretching, and the worst one is kissing.\n\nI discussed this with my mother and, exactly what I would expect, she decided to do minimal research to determine some ridiculous loophole so that she could avoid making any changes to help me at all. She has decided that this is the cause of a lack of vitamins, and I am incredibly worried about the meeting that I permitted my therapist to have with her. If she does not get through to her, then I might have to suffer with her genuinely thinking she can cure me with vitamins. She does not understand that it is not just \"discomfort\", it causes so *much* discomfort that it is physically painful and causes physical responses. I am worried she is going to try to cure me rather than let me get noise cancelling headphones or stop doing certain things around me. It is a struggle in my every day life because I am constantly filled with not only anxiety about sounds that I happen to hear, but also anxiety that *those* anxieties will be dismissed and labelled as \"harmless overreactions\". It is not harmless to me, it affects me more than I can even put into words and that frustrates me further. If you cannot put it into words, how can you explain to someone who does not experience this what you are going through in a way that will not make them brush it off? I know I cannot live in a bubble, but I cannot live hoping vitamins will help with this when I know they will not. I do not know what I need to be able to live with this and not want to claw my ears and skin off every time I hear a sound. I am new to all of this and my mother is too.

I fucking hate this. My recommendation is to share that you are struggling with this. If they are the type to believe you about it then just think of things they might say and how to respond to it. If you think they will call you crazy and dismiss you then think about what it would take to convince them whether that be research from reputable place, YouTube videos of other sharing their experience, or something else. It will not get better until you take action to make it better, unfortunately. It will continue to get worst most likely so taking action asap is in your best interest. I know it is hard living with this but you are able to manage it, even if it does not feel like it right now. Do you have headphones/ earphones that are comfortable to wear and have decent volume or noise cancellation? If not, I would recommend buying some if you are able to. Fans have helped a lot of people as well. You will be okay but you have to do something to make it better. Im 16 and when I was younger I went through this exact thing, honestly you just have to tell them. After I told my family it took like 2 years for them to finally understand and we would have arguments almost every dinner but know they get it and i am allowed to eat separately from them with no issues. Best thing to do is to tell them to research it or show them things about it in the hopes that they will understand that it isnt you being rude or intolerable. I understand that it sucks but the one thing ive learned with misophonia is that you should not foce yourself to go through it if you are able to avoid those horrible experiences. I just told my mom and she said that it may be because I am on the spectrum I have ADHD but I told her it is misophonia and she said alright that is just a name for it. What do you do when you first start to feel it coming on?  If you can take a deep breath and hold it for a moment and then let it out slowly, and then keep your focus on your breath it may help.

I absolutely hate them but she yells at me if I try and get out of it. She says that I should expose myself to the sound of eating more and then it will go away. She is the type to think mental illness is not a thing unless it is depression. She is seen me break down and leave rooms crying and she says that I am just over reacting. I have been sneaking my AirPods into my ears and eating really quickly, but she still does not believe me. How can I get her to understand? I am sorry. This disorder is trivialized and seen as neurotic and weird and most people think we just have to \"not let it bother you.\" You have told her this sound is upsetting and have made an effort to help her better understand. We cannot make someone understand. If spending time connecting as a family is important as her reason to eat as a family, maybe offer to play a game or chat to make up for solo eating. Thank her for her meals and tell her something you liked about her cooking when you return your plate, offer to clean dishes.\n\nMusic playing during meals is a nice buffer; I still crave that social interaction during meal time so background music is pleasant to soften the sharpness of sounds. I keep flesh colored ear plugs in my purse but cannot eat while wearing them; but they help me cope. This comes across as a power play to me, like she feels personally insulted, but that is just what it seems like to me. \n\nRegardless of why, I do not think you would be able to explain it to her, you might have to get someone else to do it or preferably multiple people.  Someone already commented something similar to what I am about to say. But seriously get your family or you to initiate playing music in the background. Fortunately my family is very understanding towards me and my \"problems\" and if we are sitting down as a family or with have guests over and they want me to join, they make sure music is playing in the background just for my sake.

Shower, be triggered by the sound of water going down the drain, eat and be triggered by my siblings eating, relax.\nDinner time, be torn by the anticipation of the trigger of my father eating, of the occasional smacking of lips as he noisily drinks a glass of a beverage.\nThe cycle is, quite literally, driving me mad. I do not know how to stop it. I think you need to take a drive (or a bike ride). Long drives by myself have kept me sane. Driving somewhere random in my state and exploring. Gives me a bit of purpose, and a chance to get away. But be carful. Escapism is only bad when you are running away instead of running somewhere. Unfortunately, rides are not possible in my situation. Well the way I see it, you have a few things you can do. 1: Start strengthening your mind. That does not mean weakening the trigger, but rather giving yourself a reset. Meditation has helped myself a lot. (Specifically the leaf on a stream technique). 2: Listen to a bunch of music. But not sad songs. You do not want to bring yourself down. Play music that makes you want to dance. And then DANCE! Dance like no ones watching. I do not want you forcing yourself to feel happy, I want you to open up to the idea that you can and deserve to be happy. 3: Seek therapy or a trusted individual. Talk to someone about this. We carry a heavy load, and too often we get caught up in trying to carry it that we forget to ask for help. Take the time to reach out for help. It will only make you stronger. I do not know.

Does anyone else get triggered by certain songs or types of music? The obvious culprit is when an artist is singing in such a way that they make a lot of mouth noises (happens a lot), but there have also been a few songs that I find triggering for unrelated noises. What are your experiences with this?  I really liked this one song, but there were so many mouth noises I could not. The singer sounded like she was sloshing around spit or in the middle of chewing bubble gum. It was absolutely torture for my head and ears. Interesting enough music is the ONLY thing that does not bother me at all.

It has to be on, but only so it is a noise with the S and F sounds sparking through and bothering me.\n\nClapping, snapping sounds bothers me, but that is more a thing in YouTube videos, like when they list stuff and every item that gets put on the screen gets a snapping sound.  I cannot listen to any music with voice for that exact reason. Bluegrass drives me nuts. That twangy sound!!!! Yeah I can see that What do you normally listen to? If you particularly enjoy mouth noises, check out the first few minutes of the song 9:39 by Global Communication (but fair warning, there is high potential for audio triggers) Electronic/melodic stuff Thank you! I will check it out :) It is not terrible, but the twanging on acoustic guitar is somewhat irritating and it makes my hair stand on edge. I am much less triggered by mouth noises and more triggered by certain pitches. Theres this artist that I love called LP (check out her song called Lost on you), in some songs she sings in such a high pitch that I run to turn it off, but I love her music. I have been playing with adjusting volume, but it only helps so much. I used to really like one song until I started to get triggered by the beatboxing noises :(", " The Association of Personality Traits, Emotions, and Reactions to Annoying Sounds Hi, I really need help in getting responses to my survey on misophonia and would really appreciate it if you could respond to my survey. The title of the study is The Association of Personality Traits, Emotions, and Reactions to Annoying Sounds. The study is being conducted by Esther Rotlevi from Queens College, CUNY. The purpose of this study is to examine whether personality traits are related to the emotions and reactions that people show to sounds and sights that annoy them. You are invited to participate in this study. You are eligible to participate if you 1.) Are at least 18 years old 2.) Are fluent in English 3.) Have never been diagnosed with a psychological disorder 4.) Are not currently using any medications for psychological problems.\n\nYour participation is voluntary, and you may discontinue responding at any time. This study has been approved by the Queens College Institutional Review Board, and all data are being collected anonymously.\n\nIf you would like to participate please click on the link below:\n\n ( I would help and have viewed the survey but I am not 18 yet. :/ May i ask what the reason for not having/being medicated for a psychological disorder is ?

I have two roommates and one of them I absolutely cannot stand because of how much noise she makes. When she eats you can hear it in the next room over and the sounds of her chewing make me so angry that I have to put on music loudly and leave because I know I will snap at her. She also slams cabinets so loudly and drums her fingers against every surface it makes me so angry that I can feel the back of my neck get warm with anger whenever I hear her making noise. My saving grace is that she is moving out soon so its only a few months left with her but boy I cant wait for the day she is gone for good and I get actual quiet. Not long now! :) I had one like that once. I mean, HOW THE ACTUAL FUCK can one human make so much noise without speaking that you, a person whose hearing gets worse daily, can hear them three rooms down the hall with your door almost shut??", "How do I break dependency on my headphones? I currently live with my extended family and I will be moving out very soon. My bedroom is fairly close to the kitchen and there is almost always someone eating, talking, or coughing in there. I unfortunately had to hear it all. To help I started wearing headphones more often until it got to the point where I would wear them literally 24/7. All day and all night. I have gotten anxiety attacks over losing or breaking headphones. Its gotten incredibly unhealthy. As I previously stated I am moving out soon, my bedroom will be far from the kitchen and I will be living with less people, I wont need to have my headphones on all the time. The only problem is, I get bad anxiety when I do not have them on, even when I know I am in a situation where I will not be triggered I am still terrified at the thought of being caught off guard. Any suggestions on how I can solve this problem? I would also like to see if I am not alone in this. I would try to have white noise sounds or rain on the TV without headphones so you are less depended on headphones for now. When you move you can continue this and hopefully learn not to panic. Exposure therapy, the thing we all hate. Take small steps to start the break up. Lvl 1 - Wear your headphones around your neck or keep them in your pocket for as long as you can. Do this until you are not feeling panicky about it anymore. Lvl 2 - leave them in sight but not on your person. Lvl 3 - leave them in the next room etc", "I have misophonia  honestly, at this point, I am just avoiding all people and situations that trigger it and since that is not always possible, I carry headphones with me at all times and do not give a shit whether people consider it rude. I find that putting my earphones in and listening to white noise, fan noise, music, or other noise as I am about the house helps immensely with my misophonia. INFO: what triggers you? headphones. every day, all day. Anything like lip smacking, kissing, snapping or water dripping \ud83d\ude15 Earplugs are a godsend. I explain to people if anyone asks that is it is my issue, not theirs so it is on me to find a solution. They really are. \ud83d\ude0e", "ASMR!

These include close up whispering (regular whispering is nice, but it seems all the ASMR whispering on Youtube is just close up and inside your brain which is unfortunate), mouth sounds and mouth clicking. It seems like these triggers are in most ASMR videos and I cannot seem to avoid them. Any advice and is anyone in the same boat as I am? Thanks I am honestly not sure how I am able to enjoy ASMR with talking. There are some triggering ones that somehow do not bother me, and then there are similar ones that I cannot stand. I have no clue lol", "How do you handle it? I have recently joined here as I am working with an occupational therapist to try to manage my intense feelings and reactions to sounds of cutlery. I have got shivers and feel like crying even typing this. I detest the sound of cutlery and will not go into detail as I would hate to upset anyone who reads this post. Anyway, I mentioned I had found this group and she recommended I put a post to see if you guys have any tips to managing the actual intense reaction you get from hearing sounds you do not like?\n\nFor context, I am on a waiting list for autism referral and they are exploring my possible OCD. When I hear the sounds or even if I see the action without sound, I get an intense anger and have to shake/cry/cringe whenever certain sounds or visuals regarding cutlery happen. The sounds even hurt my teeth and jaw. This is stopping me from enjoying time with family, going out to eat, etc etc. I probably would not mind if the anger lasted a few seconds but it leaves me \u201cshut down\u201d and annoyed for a period of time. \n\nI did have a brainwave - I like pressure on my feet, so my boyfriend and I are going out Sunday to trial that he steps on my feet under the table when it is happening to see if it helps. I wondered if anyone had tips? Thank you in advance! Our daughter also hates the sounds of utensils. When we realized she had misophonia, I bought plates, bowls, cups and utensils made of wheat straw. I found them on Amazon, and they have been very helpful. They can go in the dishwasher and microwave, and we have had no problems with them. It does not solve every problem, because she is triggered by eating sounds as well, but it was a start.\n\nShe is also working with a therapist on her misophonia. Misophonia may be tied to anxiety and stress, and she did have some anxiety issues when school started up again this year. It is gotten better, at least in school, so that is progress. I wonder if you can get some help with your OCD and/or autism issues, if it might also help with the misophonia issues.\n\nGood luck! I have not met anyone who feels the same and struggled to find much online that did not recommend ear defenders \ud83d\ude29 I am absolutely high functioning and these are not practical when I am a nurse in my day job and have a little one, so need to hear! Glad to know I am not alone on this. \n\nMy sensitivities are worse when stressed, definitely. Will have a look on Amazon now, thank you so much! How do you manage to support her when in public I.e at restaurants? The feet-pressure thing is actually one of the tips I was given by a somatic therapist (other options: pressure on the arms or on the chest &amp; back). I like this too although I think I am too far gone for this to be my main coping mechanism at this point. \n\nThe thing that has been the most helpful for me recently is giving myself permission to avoid triggers as much as possible. I wear headphones literally all the time with white noise and sometimes also music/podcasts. It does get exhausting and I do not want to have to do this permanently, but I am doing this as a way to try to prevent my misophonia from getting even worse while I also work on addressing it in other ways (taking supplements, doing counterconditioning work, yoga &amp; stress relief, saving up for hypnotherapy etc). You are definitely not alone. And try to remember -- you are not the problem. You *have* a problem, but that is all, and problems can be addressed, even though it might take some time to find the help.\n\nFor meals, my daughter has two coping mechanisms at home. One is to use her noise-cancelling headphones to listen to brown noise. She says brown noise is better than white noise at drowning out the sounds that bother her. (I discovered there are many colors of noise; had no idea before.) The brown noise also lets us have fairly normal conversations, the rest of us just need to raise our voices a little. If she is tired of brown noise, she eats in another room. \n\nWe have not eaten at restaurants lately. We have gone to our mall for the food court, and to a Hibachi grill buffet -- both are large spaces that allow distancing, so we are a bit more comfortable eating at a place like that. However, she still brings her headphones to those places. I see no reason she should be uncomfortable if we can help it. It helps at both the mall and buffet that we are using plastic flatware and styrofoam dishes.\n\nHere are the links to the wheat straw items. We have had them for a few months now and I have found them to be pretty durable. They have been in the dishwasher and microwave many times. We still have regular utensils, because sometimes you need something stronger, but these do a good job.\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n( Oh amazing, I am on the right track. This is it though, I too feel that I am too far gone. Where I am from it is considered rude to wear earphones at mealtimes and things and I have started to tell people the things that bother me over the past couple years but I hate drawing attention to it. I need to start being a bit selfish I think and just do what I need to feel comfortable. Thank you for your advice! I am a day late to this but I would like to say I think you are right that you deserve to be a bit selfish. Remember anyone who claims that you are being \"rude\" is being far beyond rude and selfish themselves by asking a person to suffer for the sake of etiquette they have no reason to enforce. Wishing you well!", "Does emotion trigger a worse reaction? Is it just me or when are you angry sounds seem to be so much worse? Sounds you can tolerate before suddenly you cannot stand? Even to the point where your own breath you just cannot stand? I just wanted to see if I am the only one..... 100%. If I am having a bad day or extra irritable for some reason, sounds are so much more intolerable. A bad sound can make my bad day worse, versus a bad sound can seem meaningless during a great day. Me too! yes! EXACTLY Absolutely. Underlying stress definitely makes it seem worse. In my case, I attribute it to the autism spectrum. Thank you! I wanted to make sure I was not insane! It is just really hard explaining to people \u201csorry I am having a bad day I cannot listen to your noises right now\u201d. So I sort of wanted to make sure it was part of this Most definitely", "Triggered by his voice. Is that even a thing? My father triggers my misophonia in multiple ways. I cannot stand his chewing, mouth noises, lip smacking, way he pronounces some letters and, on top of all, his voice. \n\nIt is kind of ok when it is me he is talking to, but whenever he is talking to anyone else, i simply cannot stand listening to the sound of his voice at all. When we lived together, i always had to carry my earphones with me in case he started talking to my mum or on the phone. I can listen to his voice from far far away and still get triggered. I never read something like that on misophonia forums before (i just recently found out about miso btw. I always thought i was just a freak). \n\nIs that even a thing? Anyone also get triggered by a specific persons voice? I have started to be triggered by certain tones of voice, even some singers voices. I hate it, it really upsets me when it is someone I care about but I have no idea what to do about it. I feel you, does he have like a low/monotone voice? Yes it is and it is the case for many with Miso. Many find they are only triggered by their mom and many only by their fathers.\n\nCheck this link: (\n\nThere are more posts that you can find about it, but generally, yes. It is a thing. I wouldnt get triggered by a low, monotone voice, quite the contrary, those are my favourite. \n\nI do, however, get triggered by high female voice, esp those who are loud and barky by default. \n\nAlso I get triggered by people speaking in Spanish, there is smth about that language which makes me want to cut my ear off.\n\nThis has gotten a lot worse since living with 3 annoying triggering girls who ~~speak~~ scream Spanish  and their voices are fried, female like and sound like dogs barking.\n\nI am female as well but I have a low monotone voice and dont speak much. I really try to keep my voice in check, as I dont want to annoy others. Esp when on the phone, if I hear myself doing the fried voice I annoy myself lol. But I snap out of it quickly and return to my normal non-invasive voice.\n\nI had a few bad experiences with unapologetic females with scratchy voices and that added a big trigger to my misophonia list. It is just so unfair is not it? The man is so lovely and has never ever done anything bad to me. I just cannot be around him at all! To make things worse i am starting to get triggered by my husband as well. FML! Not really! He is very loud (probably misophonia makes it 10x times louder than it actually is though) \ud83d\ude05 I understand the struggle.  My own son\u2019s voice and laugh triggers me.  It is a heartbreaking and utterly defeating feeling to be triggered by the people you love most in the world. I feel the exact same with my father. It is fine when he is talking to me but something about his voice and the vibrations when he is talking to someone else bothers me. Wow, I have never heard of someone being triggered by the way a language sounds :O\n\nFunny because I am a Spanish-speaker, does one accent in specific trigger you or Spanish in general? Yes! It is my mom for me. I do not know why because she has a pretty sweet voice. And I do not have a problem when she is talking to me either. But when she talks to other people...well. \n\nHowever I guess it could be because she has a habit of talking extremely loudly- on the phone, to people, laughing terribly loudly. Drives me mad. I think the Spanish my flatmates speak is the most annoying. I dont have a problem with the language per se, but the way *some* people speak it. Yep. The sound of Sean Connery makes me homicidal. \n\nIt is not the accent..\nI have scottish friends. It is literally just HIM. I cannot stand his speech at all. \n\nSo yes. Is definately a thing.\n\nI also cannot stand this person's voice/accent and so I watch her videos on mute;\n\n\n(She does craft doll makeovers and I love her skills but cannot listen to her talk) That is so random Yeah well relationship is over. It will not get better. Is not all of misophonia \"so random\" though? Most people think our condition is a really strange fluke.", "Unemployed &amp; Trapped with deaf parents. UK.

I have faced all ghosting, lies, and the usual recruitment hell a job seeker faces. \n\nMy Father is deaf. Every day the noises in this house are abominable - I cannot escape. I am woken up, unable to sleep correctly, constantly on edge, disguised when I have to eat and feel sick, I end up shaking in rage, screaming into a pillow. The rare half hour the house is ever free, instead of attempting to record music (which is impossible when people are home due to constant noise and interruptions) I have now ended up screaming and shouting to vent the anger that has built up for years. \n\nI had built a sound proof room within my room, hoping this would help. But my Father bangs doors, cupboards, stomps, etc etc shouts for me rather than walking to find me and have a normal conversation. \n\nI had one job interview, a work from home role during pandemic. I was so worried and prepared so much for this role, I was hoping to use the soundproof room to show employer I had a great area to work from answering their calls. Had my own laptop, headset, tripod etc ready to go! \n\nRejected from the role, why, because of the fucking noises. Awkward, and horrid, sitting there polite and trying to smile and nod while they awkwardly tell me they cannot hire someone who has so much background noise where they live. \n\nSince then I have broken down, completely. Days I will not leave my room until this house is silent. I have become total insomniac as it is the only time I get peace. Am always exhausted and constantly sore. \n\nI am very angry. I am so angry I get migraines from the anger. \n\nI do not want to trigger anyone, but imagine you are woken up self deprived all the time. Imagine as soon as you have peace or a sense of happiness it is ripped away by this ignorant person, this impossible situation.\n\nSocial life is dead. No job, no money, no opportunity, no escape. \n\nThe few women who have been interested, put off because you are living with your parents and even if they get over that my father comes across as rude and uncaring due to deafness and just pretending he hears people. I am sick of repeating every fucking thing.

He has ruined my life. And nobody fucking helps, and nobody fucking even believes in misophonia. I get blamed, so it is all my fault. \n\nIt is my fault I am woken up by loud sounds all the time. It is my fault employers are not hiring. It is my fault house prices are too high to move out. It is my fault there is no hope. And it is my fault that I feel bad, so what the fuck does a person do now if they are not suicidal? \n\nIn my case, lie on the floor every day hoping they all fuck off and I can finally have silence and a few hours to just think and try and plan an escape. \n\nSorry for language and venting.

Just a note about the whole \"Ruining your confidence and happiness because you were independent and successful and now at 30 find yourself back at your parents house living in your childhood bedroom\". \n\nThat was me ten years ago. \n\nI had been sexually assaulted- was pregnant and ended up giving up my career, my home and my life(plus my health, which I did not realize at that time)- and thought my life was essentially over. \n\nExactly thirteen months later- my life was better than it had EVER been and despite everything- I was happier and more fulfilled and more content than I had ever been with all the success and independence and everything else that I would had for the decade when I was on my own... \n\nSo please understand that even the biggest set backs in the world do not mean your life is SUDDENLY over.

I am so sorry you are going through this.     \nCan you maybe write your dad a letter about how difficult it has become?  I mean, even when there is no deafness involved, sometimes it is best to communicate through the written word so you can get your point across just right, without interruptions.    \nAre there any friends relatives you could go to, even just for a while?     \nHow about volunteering? It could lead to a job, or new friendships, or at the very least-- it would get you out of your house (and out of your head).

Seems controlling.", "Rhapsody is so fucking triggering Rhapsody is this talent show that my school hosts. There are so many triggers and it is horrible. Right now there is someone cracking glow sticks and the sound is awful. And there is one person in the choir who is voice is the worst. Like, causing a panic attack bad. Then I feel like an ass for feeling that way bcuz she is autistic, but I cannot help it. Like I cannot enjoy the choir bcuz of her. Plus she sings along to the songs in gym and it is horrible. I am having a horrible time", "Fuck Tinnitus  Is tinnitus a common symptom for people with misophonia to experience ? Idk but I have kind of been experiencing it after I got misophonia. I would always listen to rain sounds or white noise, so I think it is related because your ears are more used to always hearing a sound, if that makes sense. Can add myself to the statistics:\nI have had slight tinnitus since some time in my teens. Enough to notice but not enough to make it unbearable. Most of the time I forget it is even there. Had misophonia since age 13.", "Research - LeDoux Lab Study at NYU LeDoux Lab Study (Started on March 1, 2016) at NYU\nThe goal of this research is to explore how the processing of auditory stimuli in the brain can go awry (leading some people to have aversive reactions to stimuli that most people consider innocuous).\nTo gain a better understanding of how these averse reactions are controlled by the brain, we are building on our research over the past 30 years.  We have shown that the brain region called the amygdala is key to such responses.\nOne area of the amygdala , the lateral nucleus, is involved in receiving sensory inputs and another, the central nucleus, controls the expression of responses. Over-reactivity to auditory stimuli could be due to a hypersensitive lateral amygdala or an over-reactive central amygdala.\nWe will study animals that show exaggerated responses to auditory stimuli and will record activity in the lateral or central nucleus to try to determine whether the problem is due to hyper-sensitivity or hyper-reactivity.\n\n\n", "just my luck ", "Noise Free America: A Coalition to Promote Quiet  ", "POV: you are a misophone scrolling TikTok *Hide videos with this sound*\n*Hide videos with this sound*\nEwww why am I being shown eating ASMR?\n*Hide videos with this sound*\n*Hide videos with this sound*\nUhhh I am only here for the memes...\n*Hide videos with this sound*\ndear JESUS why are you typing so loud?\n*Uninstalls app*\n\n(I swear it is like the algorithm knows I have misophonia and is doing everything it can to drive me bananas) THIS i had to delete the app at one point, i am not even active on there anymore Same omg, i have so many asmr accounts blocked.

Me and my dad eat breakfast at the same time every morning and I hate it so much. It is so bad that sometimes I just stay in my room until he is done eating and then I come out, although he yells at me for this and says I need to get out of bed and I do not wake up early enough and stuff. But it is literally because he eats so loud and just refuses to do anything about it. I will sit by him at the table with headphones on AND music playing and I can still hear him just as loud. And when I get angry he yells at me. The noise I hate the most is like clinking glass. And every morning he eats a little glass jar of yogurt and he spends like 5 minutes mixing berries and granola and stuff into it, and I get so mad about the noise and I just cannot help it. Today I got really mad about it and he yelled at me saying like \"This is my breakfast I need to stir my yogurt you can leave if you want.\" and other things of the sort. But it is not like I can just do that, because the kitchen table is also where I do all my work (I am homeschooled) and he is so loud I would hear it from any room except my own. And we already know what happens when I stay in my room, it gets used against me as being lazy and not doing anything. Oh man, I feel for you. My misophonia was also developed during homeschooling. Would you be able to start doing your schoolwork somewhere else in the house? Are your parents at all receptive to the argument that you are being distracted and not able to do your best work? The only other room with a big table I could work at literally connects right into the kitchen. Both me and my mom have asked my dad countless times if I can get a desk in my room but he says that there is not enough room. And my dad is not really receptive at all about it, sometimes he even goes out of his way to make more noise because he knows it annoys me. And my mom I do not think knows at all since she works most of the day and comes home late at night and then leaves early the next morning to go to work again. I am so sorry. \n\nMy daughter also has misophonia and is triggered by eating sounds. It definitely seemed to develop, or ramp up, over the last year and a half. She did virtual school at home this year, and adjusting to in-person school has been tough for her.\n\nShe uses noise-canceling headphone and listens to brown noise (videos from YouTube, stuff like that) during meals. She says it drowns out the noise better, an we can still have a pretty normal conversation. I am not sure if that would do anything about the clinking, but it might help with other sounds.\n\nCan you show your parents some misophonia resources? Like something from NIH, or Misophonia International, or the Mayo Clinic? \n\nMisophonia also seems related to anxiety/stress issues. Do you have any anxiety or stress disorders? If so, I wonder if you can address that and maybe get some relief on the misophonia as well.\n\nGood luck. Thank you, I told my dad about a website on a Harvard study on misophonia one time but I do not think he really cared. And about other stress disorders, I do not know if this really counts but I am a very paranoid person. It sounds like your dad is being really unkind, and also unfair about the desk. It is your room and if both you and your mom think it would be beneficial to add a desk to it, I am not sure why your dad's opinion about the use of space is the most important factor. If you do not mind your room becoming more cramped, why should he?\n\nDo you feel able to talk to your mom about the way your dad sometimes deliberately antagonizes you in a way that makes it harder for you to concentrate on/complete your schoolwork? It sounds like your mom may be an ally to you in some ways, and it could be helpful if she had a more complete picture of the situation in order to help you to improve it. I would think that counts as an anxiety/stress disorder, or at least problem. Can you talk to someone? An adult relative like an aunt or uncle? Or perhaps call your doctor, assuming you have one, like a pediatrician? You could even just talk on the phone I am sure they would understand if you could not get in by yourself. If you attend a church, could you speak to someone there? Even if you could not help help right away with the misophonia, you might get some guidance on other issues. Yeah he usually is kind of unfair and unkind, he grew up in the 60's and 70's so his vision of punishment and parenting is much different than to modern day parenting.  And my mom knows how my dad treats me and she is just kind of like \"Oh he is your dad he can do that kind of stuff. He is just teasing you to prepare you for people like that in the real world.\" I think I would be able to find someone to talk to, before I talk to an adult though I think it may just help me to first talk to friends or other family members closer to my age about it. Thanks for all the advice though. :( Some people do not take it as legitimate and never will, is what I have come to learn. It is incredibly frustrating. Could you perhaps get your breakfast and eat in your room? Minimises time spent in the kitchen. Might offend your dad but you could always try and pull \u201cwell either you be less noisy, or we eat separately\u201d. OP needs to print this thread out.  20-30 years from now when OP's dad ask why he never comes by to visit, he can send him a print out of the thread. The glass clinking really triggers me too. I completely empathize. \n\nIs there any area outside that you could go to do your work? Or could you ask about a lap desk since they do not take up any room? Or is there a library nearby you could ride your bike to or ride the bus to? Could you wake up and eat *before* him and do your homework after he eats his breakfast and let him know, \u201cI am going to wait until you are done eating so I can study quietly\u201d? Or can you prep your breakfast the day before and grab it quickly and go to your room to eat?", "My family does not get my misophonia :// I just found this subreddit and thank God cause I feel a little less alone now. I am pretty sure I have misophonia and the sound of eating and smacking lips drives me so crazy and to such a point of anxiety and irritation, I just immediately try running from the scene or blast music if it means drowning the noise. I tell my family this and that as someone with anxiety, it triggers my anxiety to the point I almost get panic attacks and what do they do? Not care. They do not care. I told my big brother I cannot be around him when he eats cause he is a loud eater and he takes it personally. I told my little brother I get anxiety hearing people smack their lips and he started doing it on purpose and starts doing it when I am annoying him or he wants me to leave. Right now, I ran out of my mom's room cause she was eating loudly and I got super anxious and when I tried to explain, she got angry and is currently giving me the silent treatment. They do not get how bad it is, it is not that I am being obnoxious or sensitive, I genuinely cannot handle eating noises. It feels like actual ice picks in my ears. I feel so bad cause I feel like I am being rude to them but at the same time, frustrated cause they do not understand and PURPOSEFULLY trigger me. It is like there is no getting through with them and I do not know what to do. Just hoping I can move out of the house after I graduate and be around others who understand. My family is the exact same. Even as I am writing this, my father is chewing on almonds and he sounds like he is eating fking ice cubes or something. And nobody understands why I get so angry when I hear it, I am just 'being sensitive'. You are not alone. Move out I get this. I do not tell people about my Misophonia because kids are jerks and they might try to  trigger it on purpose, and because I feel bad about telling people to chew with their mouth closed because this is how they eat, and it is not on purpose. However, you are just asking them to be more mindful of your feelings. If they cannot respect that, then try figuring out something specific that they hate and once they confront you, tell them that is how they make you feel. IDK if this will work but it is what I would try if I told my family and they refused to accept it, so do not take this too seriously as I am not a trained physchologist/ therapist.", "I can hardly function anymore My issue with words has become insufferable. I have been coming across one of them so often that I have been crying everyday. It is gotten to the point that I cannot even talk with my family or browse the internet without feeling apprehensive or angry. I am terrified of doing anything... because of words. That does not sound like misophonia. Maybe OCD or something? I would get off the internet though, it never did anything good for anyone's mental health. Go out for a walk. And maybe talk to a therapist.\n\nAlso make plans to move out. Do everything you can to make those plans reality.\n\nEdit: i looked at your post history and almost wonder if you have synesthesia or something. Maybe read books and especially poetry with words you like. Definitely try therapy, though you may need to shop around for a therapist that gets you. I have no idea what this problem is, but it is very frustrating. I have always wondered if it was OCD, anxiety, or simply because I am sensitive.\n\nSeeing that I have been this way my whole life, I believe this has something to do with it. When I was younger, I was diagnosed with TLE (Temporal Lobe Epilepsy), and as a result, stimuli have always affected me greatly, notably sound and words, both positively and negatively. Though, of course, there is no way of knowing unless I see a doctor/therapist. Oh dang, that is really interesting about the TLE. Maybe you should a neurologist, one that specializes in epilepsy. You could even be a case study honesty, which could be valuable for gaining more knowledge about sensory conditions.

Im so miserable...I am just like you and cannot even speak to her either without getting triggered. And when I cannot leave it makes the anger build up inside until I get home, where I just cry and hate myself. Im sorry your are experiencing this. I hope you find peace...somewhere, somehow. I appreciate you telling me about your experience, but I am sorry you have to go through all of that. I hope things get better for you.", "I think I know how my Misophonia developed and got worse So before all this coronavirus stuff happened I was just grossed out by my brother's chewing, that is it. It was close to mild since it made me want to get as far as possible from him, but it did **not** trigger a fight response, only a flight response. But then as soon as this pandemic hit, that is when my Miso got even worse. I started covering my ears, kicking my legs and react with rage once I heard someone eating their food, which was one of the causes that made my mental health get worse. What else made my mental health worse was because of all the nagging, arguments, etc. that I would be involve in, but since this sub reddit is Misophonia related I will save that for another time. Just something I wanted to share that caught my mind a few mins ago. I had to cut out caffeine because I noticed it made me angrier when I had a cup of coffee. I am still covering my ears and wear ear plugs and it is manageable along with having the TV playing in the background Not OP but my misophonia is definitely worse when I am hypomanic or my ADHD is bad. When I am already elevated, it is almost unbearable. It is hard to bring myself down from it.", "Transcript of The Misophonia Podcast Episode 8 with Marsha Johnson, AuD ", "I feel like I have a cold, ugly heart. I feel so guilty for being angry at my mother all the time because of my triggers. I feel guilty that I can never be in the same room as her because of my misophonia and misokinesia. I feel guilty for wanting her to know how bad it hurts me, because even though I feel guilty it is still so, so bad and painful for me. She is a good mom and all and I know that she does not do anything wrong, but my mind tells me otherwise. I feel mentally sick. She has never done anything to intentionally hurt me but I just feel so bitter all the time because after years of having both of these disorders, the triggers have become extremely abundant and overwhelming. It still hurts that she can continue about her day and not know what the trigger has caused me, whereas for me it can occupy my mind for an hour. I only feel at peace when I am alone in my room or alone and away from people somehow. At nightime when everyone goes to sleep and I finally have the house to myself, I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt for being the way I am and acting so aloof towards them. I feel like I have am so cold hearted for being so anti social and being frustrated all the time. I feel trapped in my own mind. Im sorry mom, I do not know why I am made this way.. I feel you, especially the feeling of \"trapped in my own mind.\"\nI do not have much to say other than I hear you and understand you, as someone who thinks all the same things everyday. God I relate so much it feels as if I wrote this Thank you for introducing me to the word misokinesia. That is precisely what I have along with misophonia. Wishing you the best. Same here.  It really sucks. It is like having split personality.  I hate the person I am when I am triggered. I am a caregiver for my mom who has early dementia and she is such a kind lovely woman but I cannot even look at her because her cheek-chewing and constant babbling to the dog and teeth clack and the sounds she makes when she eats makes me want to punch myself in the head until. I do not know what to do... I feel horrible and guilty and I know she does not understand why I am so cold. It is a really difficult situation, but yeah, I have to grit my teeth to be around her and I just wish she would shut the fuck up for like an hour and I might be able to hang out.. It is not fair to her.

Peace and quiet, right? Nope, NOW the other trashy neighbors two houses down from me are... wait for it... sitting in their car, in their driveway, blasting their subwoofers. It is been hours, so I made a non emergency call to the police because just fuck it. I just do not get it and I am at the point where I do not want to ever live by people again.\n\nHey fellow misophones, who is down for buying a plot of remote land where the nearest neighbor is minimum 5 miles away and we build our own community huh? Because I am fucking done with this bullshit. I am fucking done with the panic attacks because douchebag assholes with subwoofers think the entire neighborhood should hear their fucking music.\n\nThanks for listening to my raging Ted Talk... There are not words to properly articulate how hard I resonate with this.\n\nYou took the words right out of my brain! I was just thinking about how great of neighbors we would all be when I was reading a post last week. It would be a DREAM. No more constantly waiting/worrying about that first dreaded pulse.... people like this is why i want to settle down on a large farm. no one but me, husband, and the animals.

OP said 5 miles, not acres I am willing to compromise! you are right! Thank you for the clarification\n\nIt is so frustrating having to wear earplugs and headphones when I am out in the yard. Cannot even hear the birds sing anymore.  I feel like there is no escape from this. Hey, I am totally down for a desolate house! Let us do it! I hate the thump thump of subwoofers! I used to live in a townhouse and we bumped up our house purchasing plans by 6 months because our neighbors who we shared a wall with loved to blast music at all hours even causing our floor to vibrate. The constant thumping literally makes me crazy, I wish people would realize this is a trigger for so many of us and just turn it down. Even at our vacation cabin in the remote mountain town of Headwaters VA we have people in the valley with coonhounds who keep them outside 24/7.  Talk about a trigger.\n\nStill searching for enough acreage to be totally isolated.  2100 acres came on the market in the next town over for just under 3 million.  Maybe someday after we retire and sell everything we own we could afford something like it. If it is any consolation they will start losing their hearing around age 40 if they keep it up. I am 41 and I can tell I am a bit from always listening to music with headphones It is a horrific thing when the sound is not only loud, you can FEEL IT. And if you let them know it bothers you, they will all gang up on you till you have a fucking panic attack. I really have no good solution and I am so sorry. I identify with your pain and I hope you can find a sneaky but safe and appropriate method to get them back. I would play something gad awful like show tunes really loudly.

This was not incited by me (I have struggled with misophonia since being a teenager, but no one I work with knows about it). In the very least this suggests that someone in my building has misophonia and the university is willing to accommodate them. I am working up the courage to reach out and talk to whoever this is because I do not personally know anyone else with misophonia. Anyway, I wanted to share because it surprised me (many of my close friends and family who I have told about my misophonia have laughed at or ridiculed me about it), and it validates those of us who struggle with it.", "Licking noises Hi, I am new to the group and this is my first post. I have 3 cats which I love very much. However, their licoing noises make me want to throw them out of the window (for the record, I would not really, but that is what I think about in that moment). The sound of them licking themselves makes my skin crawl and it literally makes me cringe. It is a physical reaction. They wake me up at night with their licking and I have to chase them out of the room. The worst part is, I have not always had misophonia. I developed it when I was pregnant with my first child, and my husband thought I was making it up. It subsided after my son's birth, but it came back when I became pregnant again, and though I gave birth 3 months ago, it has not left this time. It is worse than ever. I feel really bad because my cats must think I suddenly do not love them anymore. I have not had this my whole life so I do not have any strategies, and my husband does not believe me or he thinks I am exaggerating. \n\nCan anyone suggest a coping strategy I can use for this? My urge is a weird one. It is Dialectical Behavior Therapy's 'opposite action'. I do this myself, because my big, wimpy nerd of a boikat bites his nails. The sound makes me cringe, but getting him for a nice long cuddle stops the noise and bonds us. If I cuddled my cat he would claw my face off \ud83d\ude02 Mine are maybe a little overly attached... My other two are like that! But they do not lick themselves too loudly. The one cat whose licking kills me is not cuddly at all. He is a sweetheart but he only cuddles on his own terms. With the other cats it is when they scratch themselves for a long time that gets me. Weird I usually just pick my cat up and move her to a different room but she is also become conditioned to either not lick when I am around or she stops when I tap her. Just tapping her side used to distract her from it but now she just stops and goes back to napping lol.\n\nFor the record, she grooms herself and has a beautiful coat. I am not preventing her from doing it. She just does not when I am around and since we are not together 24/7 it is easier.  \n\nOP, I would probably just close them out of the room when sleeping. Or if they have a room with all their things you could put them in there with food and water (our \u201ccat room\u201d is also our office) Definitely do not try to discourage cats from grooming; you will inevitably cause mental and physical health issues that can really take a toll.\n\nSince you have more than one cat, closing them out of the room while you sleep sounds like a good option. Make sure they have a comfy spot to sleep and then just stick with it.", "To people living in a household that makes your life hell I posted this exact same post around 7 months ago, but it is still important that people who have not seen it see this. This is just from what my experiences and thoughts about misophonia, but I hope it helps.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, the people you live with might not believe you. Or, maybe they just dont understand how bad it is. I know that a lot of people here live with their parents, and I also know what worked in terms of getting my parents to listen to me, so heres some advice. (Dont take anything here like a treatment/professional device, I am decidedly NOT a psychologist)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Dont mock their eating sounds - This isnt just not helpful to you, it also makes them super self-concious. They cant change it. You can ask them to stop, and get away. Also, this might contribute to them not believing you for some reason or another. They might do it to spite you.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Try to show them proof that misophonia is real - My parents pretty much believed me immediately, but definitely didnt do all that much to help. However, I see a lot of people here complain that the people they live with refuse to acknowledge it as a psychological thing, instead saying \"Oh, that is just a phase\", or \"They just want the attention\". Show them articles about it. Show them what it does to you. Show them that this isnt just some harmless thing, and that it isnt just being upset. This does psychological damage and should NOT be taken lightly.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Be nice about it - I saw a whole lot of change in how my family reacted when I stopped mocking their mouth sounds and started asking them to stop/wait before they eat so I can get away.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Wear earbuds around the house - This is the biggest thing. I basically never leave my room without them. Its unfortunate because I enjoy listening to people talking and knowing what is going on, but otherwise I risk insanity. I prefer not knowing what is going on. Get a good pair of earbuds and bring them around with you. If you carry them in your pocket, get a case for them or they WILL break, and quickly too.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5. Talk about it - You might need to sit down with them and tell them about how it makes YOU feel. I know its hard, I could not and still can not describe exactly what it feels like. But for most people its like a fight or flight thing. You go full panic mode. Also, talk to them about how with most people more exposure = more misophonia. The more youre exposed the worse it gets. This is why exposure therapy, something Ive seen a whole lot of peoples parents want to do, DOES NOT WORK IN MOST PEOPLE. Avoidance is the best bet we have for now.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6. Just know that some people are crazy or want to watch the world burn - There is a good chance none of thia will work if the people you live with are crazy. Im always open to have a discussion with you about it, if you just want to vent or want to find a way to get them to listen. Some people just wont believe you, others do it purposefully to annoy you, and if they dont listen, your only option is to get out of there as soon as possible while avoiding them as much as possible.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7. Remember us - We are all here to support you. My circumstances are good. Ive got people who support me, places to go to escape, and ways to block out noise. But some people dont have all that, and I want to help. So does most everyone else here.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope this helps with something. Again if you want someone to vent to/some advice Im happy to help. Just DM me asking to talk This is a wonderful post, and super good for those who might need some guidance! Lots of appreciation for you OP.\n\nAlso, random note, I am looking to buy some noise cancelling earplugs, I would appreciate any recs from anyone!! I am looking for earbuds that are good at blocking talking, so deep sounds that go through walls. I have heard NuraLoops have pretty good noise cancelling features as well as great sound customized to your ear, I personally do not have a pair, but I have been interested in them for a while Amazing post but my condition is unique.. I am living with a 7 year old from hell who looks like she was specially designed to torture anyone with misophonia. She triggers me on purpose cause she finds it funny, she knows how to bring me to a level 10 and if she wants to she will do it. Because she is just a 7 year old girl and shes not like my little brother I could not hit her to stop doing noises ( my brother has misophonia and I am 2 years older than him while my sister does not have it, lucky shit) and its hell to live with. I cant do homework at home, every hour I spend here and even at school is horrible because people dont know how to stop humming, chewing and tapping there is no escape from this shit.\nSorry for this little vent just needed to let it out. Get an air horn. Boop that muther every time she steps out of line. A seven year old can be trained like a dog with a clicker. You deserve respect. My mom would kill me if I did that, for 'hurting her ears' Well, later in life, when you are clear of that bullshit, remember that you deserve respect. Demand it. Thanks:) Your mother is not raising the kids. She can deal with your parenting or she can fuck off. Do whatever though I am just a reddit Thank you for this\n\nBut I disagree on the point that people cannot change their eating habits. My Dad ate totally normally for years and was an absolute stickler for table manners. He is an angry middle aged man and all of a sudden has started eating like an absolute pig: open mouth, eating with fingers, just everything in the book. I know he can stop because my mother has asked him repeatedly and he eats normally for two days, then reverts back. I honestly think some people just don;t care. Its possible, but it is genuinely difficult. Im pretty sure I make more noise than mosy people when I eat sometimes and Im not sure why. Ive also been told I am very loud when I drink liquids which can also be hard to control. I think what I meant by they cant change was more along the lines of cant change immediately Leave", "I do not know if I will be able to download my triggering lecture to speed it up. I am scared. First lecture in this uni curse. The professor is wearing a  Mic so close to his mouth that it picks up every little bit of his noises. I am dying. As far as I can tell it is to the level that speeding up would help, but I do not know if it will be uploaded after the live session. I will need to  suffer through this first one at least and  See afterwards if it is the entire semester. I was so lucky until now. Why did this one have to be so bad. Pleaseeeeee I am in the US and guessing you are not, so I do not know what accessibility laws or rules there might be.  Is there anywhere you could get a transcript, or does someone do closed captioning? Does your university require that things be available to people with disabilities? I am just thinking if there is someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, they would need access to the content as well. \n\n My friend's daughter has auditory processing difficulties, and she is been working on getting her school to make various things more accessible to students with hearing issues. Maybe there is something like that in your school? Thank you for your concern, you are correct, I am not in the us and my university is not required to do anything. Uploading lectures after the live event if fully voluntary, but they do it!! Thankfully I can just watch it back at whatever settings are most comfortable for me. \n\nI guess with an auditory processing difficulty I could get them to accommodate for that but I doubt misophonia would fit in any cathegory they would do that for... There is got to be an app or something that can convert it to text for you if your school will not do it. Maybe you could press play and leave the room or stick it in a box or something where you cannot hear it. I know those things do not always pick up the text perfectly but probably better than suffering through it", "My Entire Family and Friends Everyone in family chews so loudly and I just wish they understood.

My mother is the worst as she chews gum very loudly everyday. I have told some of my friends but they have yet to change their actions and I am not sure what to do.", "Hi guys, another washup from the tyranny of r/misophonia, plus a word of caution   This is off topic as much as off topic could probably be. r/misophoniasupport is a transparent place, but we are not here for witch hunts or attempts to segregate a community that is relatively at peace right now.\n\nr/misophoniasupport is for supporting people with Misophonia - not whatever this is. Please bear that in mind. Please try and keep posts about Misophonia and supporting people with Misophonia. This can be in the form of memes, venting, or discussion about Misophonia, but this is definitely not allowed. Good to see  you are also a moderator of r/misophonia\n\nIf you look at the messages I had sent before, I put my best effort into being respectful. I do not know what to do anymore. All I want to do is work on that website but I keep being silenced. I do not know what to do anymore, so if you could recommend the best course of action that would be appreciated.\n\nI am also not attempting to segregate a community, I am trying to bring light about what is separating it. I linked the post responsible for this subreddit being on the map, which was an insanely segregating thread. The community is not at peace. It looks at peace because attempts like this result in bans and removals. Okay, I will comment on this to clear things up a little, as I am only a moderator of r/misophoniasupport and have permanently unfollowed r/misophonia after the big blowout a year ago.\n\nThe initial reason why u/TelephoneMelon became a moderator of both subreddits is so she could help moderate posts on r/misophonia that would belong better over here on r/misophoniasupport. This happened after a blowout happened when a mod of r/misophonia lashed out.\n\nThe head mod of r/misophonia had this subreddit as a back up and asked for people to moderate it as a place for users to be able to be a little more relaxed with the rules than r/misophonia is. We were contacted that same day and spent about three or four days with each other, coming up with rules and a vision for what we want this subreddit to be.\n\nWe allow a lot of things here that r/misophonia does not. From talking about violence (as long as it is not directly harming or threatening someone/yourself) to straight up funny memes. And we have grown immensely in the last year because of it.\n\nThe issue with your post is not because it is threatening a mod of another group or that we are also being run by that mod and others, it is that over a year ago, we already hashed out this conversation.\n\nI understand wanting to bring things to light about why there are two separate groups because we want that too. We are even debating putting a wiki page about it in our sidebar or something similar. So if you would like to help or if you have any questions about how this subreddit is run, you are free to DM me personally, we just do not want to start drama for the sake of starting drama.\n\nThis subreddit was created for people that did not feel comfortable talking about their issues in r/misophonia last year, where the last I checked, they have a weekly post for. We are a lot more open about how often you can post and what you can post about.\n\nThat being said, while I found the points in your post interesting and I agree that there needs to be some transparency around it (maybe with that wiki?), I do agree that we are here for support for misophonia, not to stir up drama between two subreddits, especially when we are only here to try and help people work through their daily issues with this condition. That might not have been your intention, but both u/TelephoneMelon and I went through the drama last year and I agree that things are significantly calmer now than they were then.\n\ntl;dr: Your post did not get removed because we do not want people knowing the content, but because it is not on-topic for needing support for this condition.\n\nIf you want to help with the wiki or have any questions, you can DM me personally whenever you want. :)", "I am debating about returning home to help my elderly . Unfortunately, that would mean dealing with the triggers my parents cause. I was curious if anyone here had to move back home and deal with the various triggers of their parents.\n\nI will be kind and I would not list them all out.\n\nThankfully, I could avoid my folks.  Like all old folks, lunch is at 11 and dinner is at 4.  I usually eat later than that.  I would just have to deal with the occasional snacking issues.", "omfg, i hate this shit, and its my fcking fault i still need to get earbuds or earplugs, i could either blast music in my fucking ears or mute everything out. i dont have a phone yet, so earbuds would be pointless, where would i stream my music from. if i play my music on the computer my siblings hate it. \n\ni know i should go buy some ear plugs but i have this weird fear or going into a supermarket, and even if i go in, i worry imma get sick the whole time, and then i have this rule that  have to wait 2 weeks before going into another one, (that is unrelated to misophonia, sorry)\n\nevery meal i get so aggravated at my family, and they always tell me im being too sensitive or i need to get over it, literally my dad told me i need to \"fight back\" so it does not become a problem. like tf, it is a problem, i cant eat anywhere without getting so anxious.\n\nmy younger siblings are constantly purposefully triggering me, and when i yell at them i get in trouble.  i try to tell my parents its not my fault i have misophonia, but they say its my fault if i react. i cant ignore the loud chewing, i have to say something, i have to. idk what to do. i know i shouldnt yell at my dad for chewing loud or making triggering noises, its not his fault. they dont get it. my siblings think its fun to slap their fucking lips to anger me, bc they know ill yell and my parents will get upset.\n\nmaybe it is my fault im like this. nobody else seems to get bothered, its me, and no matter how hard i try, it doesnt go away", "My dads an asshole I woke up this morning to my dad asking me about the dish (that is right just one bowl) I did not wash. Mind you it is summer break and I am trying to get some sleep then because he woke me up I went back to bed, but I sleep on the couch, so I had to try to fall asleep to my dad eating chips and salsa and slurping his coffee. I cried, under my blanket and had such a rapid heartbeat. I honestly do not know what to do at this point. I tell him I hate misophonia and he says I am just sensitive. Every single time I hear his mouth touch a coffee cup he declares war on his own daughter.  Every single though of death goes through my mind, as does with many of us. It is only 7 am so I have nobody to talk to &amp; I really need earplugs. MY WHOLE FAMILY DOES THIS!!! I always have to hide and cry otherwise I would have to punch a hole in the wall. I have misophonia related anger issues and they trigger me every single fucking day. And they do not give a shit and when I tell them, they start doing it ON PURPOSE and LAUGH.\n\nWhy do people do this? Why does your own family do this? I hope it will get better for you. Sending love. I hope it gets better for people like us whose loved ones think it is jokes, I always just start listening to music but I still have not gotten headphones for this phone, (iPhones do not have headphone jacks anymore :/ ) It is not cool cause it is just awkward to explain it. My parents voices also kind of trigger me a bit too so that sucks. Just like with depression, all I can hope to do is go to the doctors and get diagnosed, so I can prove it. Hope your parents are not like mine because I was actually diagnosed with depression and anxiety and they told me to just eat more chocolate. \ud83d\ude43 \n\nAnd same, ugh, I had to steal some old headphones from my dad bc I lost the ones I got with the phone... They suck. And I have to keep them plugged in at all times so I do not lose the tiny adapter. I miss my earpods. :( \n\nAND my parents\u2019 voices trigger me as well. My grandma\u2019s does too because she talks when she eats and mid-swallowig so it sounds wet and nasally and disgusting and she refuses to swallow. My big sister lives with us, and she has depression, but whenever something goes wrong with my response (ex: I hit someone because they would not stop chewing in my face) she is does not see the part where the other person is in the wrong. It is so self esteem crushing when one of your favorite people does not understand you. I went to the doctor and they handed me a depression test, but I did not get to finish sadly. Awhhh, how so? I hope you get a diagnosis and prove them wrong. She says how I am exaggerating, etc. , I always have the high expectation of her to be able to understand my struggle since she has depression. My brother and dad probably eat the worst. Ugh my dad can crunch food that does not crunch. He can make eating bread loud. WHY? Idk. HOW? IDK. His jaw keeps cracking also. And my mom keeps eating salads. I am big mad 24/7. Punched a piece of furniture so hard I had a bruise... oops. Also it is sad she does not get your illness... She must know how hard it is so why be disrespectful? I usually just plain old cry or go to the restroom and punch the shit I can I honestly do not know. She is an asshole sometimes, but she never knows, I also hit my little sister for doing it once, I post about it frequently so I really do not know how nobody gets the point. I post it on insta, I talk about it in real life. My parents do not respect my sisters depression so the bar is set low for expectations. This might help\n\n Thanks! I keep forgetting, previous people have posted this and I just forget! Good luck my friend. I have supportive parents (thank god) but I have suffered needlessly because of this condition. I have scars on my legs and arms that should not be there. I have a bad history with school even though I love learning. I have problems with my adrenal glands because of how much adrenaline I waste because of sounds. Because of exposure to triggers over time, my miso has gotten worse. It is so very very real. It is not just being sensitive. It causes physical pain. Suffering in so many other areas of life. Who would fake this? It is so awfully embarrassing. I want anything other than attention because of this disease. Hell, even Shane Dawson knows it is real lmao. Sorry for ranting. Hope this helps you remember that this is real. You are not alone and never will be. You are so so so strong for just being here and existing every day. I am proud of you. Also, if you ever need someone to rant to personally pm me! he does? Lol, I know I am not alone I just wish more awareness was spread of disorders like these, there is definitely a lot of us,, most people who do not know about their misophonia probably do not have access to the internet or such, but I hope we find a cure one day ! He recently tweeted about having the disorder. And that is so true! I think way more people have it than we currently think, but it is just not recognized. It needs to be in the DSM!!! Omg at least we can say we share something special with Shane? Lol miso still sucks tho \ud83d\ude14 Exactly", "My \"friend\" found out about my misophonia and is now deliberately winding me up I cannot just avoid him as our friend groups overlap almost completely and I sit next to him in many lessons (forced arrangements)  \nWhen he learnt about it he immediately made lip smacking noises and tapping (two of my worst triggers) and generally being horrid\nThank you for listening to my rant and you guys are great for helping people He is a big bully. Simply put - that is abuse and neglect. He is a bully. Do not think anything better of him. Do not think that any compassion from you towards him is deserved. Compassion here is not a solid coping strategy.\n\nHe may not realize that he is an asshole despite your attempts. Get your real friends to back you up. Put him in his place. I suggest firing back with\n\n(\n\nOthers here do not think that an air horn is appropriate. I think it is better than laying them out on their ass. Or mace.

It is all fun and games until he gets a fork in the eye. Oh man this really gets my blood boiling.\n\nSo I have actually had pretty good luck by being over-the-top almost *aggressively* vulnerable with people when they try this shit with me. I will call them out right then and there, even and especially if it is in a group setting. Example:\n\n\u201cHey, you know I shared something with you that is difficult for me to be open about and you are basically throwing it in my face and using the information to actively hurt me. I would *never* do that shit to you.\u201d \n\nSeems kind of desperate but I am usually desperate to get them to stop and they should also know that they are being a huge prick. I do not understand why people do this and think it is funny. Like if someone told me they were battling depression I would not mock them and make cry baby noises or something at them. It is insane. I like this. I like this a lot. Please address this with whatever teacher or administrator is in charge of your classes and make sure that when you do you do not complain about your former friend \"bothering\" or \"harassing\" you- make sure you address the fact that you are being DESCRIMINATED against and that you need assistance ASAP so this does not impact your ability to learn. \n\nPlease speak to your teacher or instructor before your next class. Make sure they understand that this is a serious medical issue- and in the meantime please schedule an appointment with a doctor or a psychiatrist who can give you an actual diagnosis so that you have some kind of medical documentation in case it is not taken seriously and the teacher does not quickly and agreeably change your seat and do whatever is necessary to get you away from this situation. \n\nI am not even going to address the \"how do I make my friend stop\"- because this is not a friend. Anyone who would harass or torment you is not a person you need to try to continue to hang onto a relationship with. Please treat this no differently than you would if you were quadriplegic and someone was screwing with your wheelchair or your service dog- it has to be taken seriously and it starts with going about handling it as calmly and respectfully as you can before you end up blowing up in the middle of class and looking like you have a behavioral problem. I am a now retired police officer- \n\nIt was about 7 months into my career when I had to do something because one of my co-workers was actively clicking his pen in a ridiculously repetitive and aggressive manner for 40 minutes straight everyday during our pre-shift meeting. \n\nI excuse myself from the meeting when I was about to explode- and I approached him privately one-on-one as soon as the meeting was over. I had asked him before to please stop and I believe that it was an unconscious habit- so it did not start out that he was trying to bother me...\n\n... But I also knew damn well as the only female working with a dozen men- speaking up especially in front of the group was only going to cause constant harassment.\n\nHe was actually good about it- and said \"I really do not do it on purpose - please remind me if I am doing it because it is a habit and I do not even realize I am doing it.\" \n\nI offered to get him a couple of nice click-free pens to take notes- if he was serious about it. At meetings, if he began clicking away, usually a glance in his direction would make it stop- a couple times I actually slid him a pen that did not have the ability to click...\n\nBut then one day, someone not only noticed- but decided to call it out in front of the entire squad. He noticed my looking at the other guy, the guy stopping clicking- and obnoxiously he began clicking HIS pen- saying loudly \"what is the matter RedandBlue - that bothering you?\" \n\nI had no choice but to say something because he literally called attention to it in front of our entire squad and three supervisors. \n\nI ended up saying \"Yes. I have sensory issues that cause severe headaches from repetitive noises like tapping and clicking. I am trying to avoid spending the rest of the shift with a migraine.\" \n\nHe then actually blushed, apologized and stopped- but that is the thing; I feel like it is almost necessary that you mention the physical issues and that you try AT ALL COSTS to discuss the psychological aspect of misophonia with people who you KNOW will not be respectful. \n\nIt may seem \"fun\" to annoy or anger someone who is bothered by something- but if you mention a physical problem - suddenly MOST people will recognize they are being a dick and will stop. \n\nIf he had not- I would have gone to the supervisors afterward and explained the situation. I am glad it did not come to that. \n\nUnfortunately- I am very sensitive to the presence of cotton/cottonballs for the same reason. I am actually TERRIFIED of them because it gives me the exact same reaction as misophonia- even just SEEING them. Once that got out at work, I did have some minor issues with a couple of guys giving me a hard time; but ultimately, as long as they were just verbally giving me a hard time- I just let it roll off my back. The one and only time one of the guys suggested he take a handful of them from the phlebotomist (we were dealing with a DUI crash/blood draw at the hospital)- I warned my coworker with a dead serious face:\n\n\"Do you really think it would be a good idea to chase me around with a handful of cotton balls while I am armed? Because that seems like a bad decision on your part.\" \n\nThat ended it; but I definitely feel for people who get put in that situation. Time for new friends, fuck those faggots It is like making fun of someone with dyslexia... in English the word we have for that type of person is \u201ca dick\u201d It is ironic you suggest something that can cause hearing damage, tinnitus and hyperacusis onset in one blast in this sub. Well yeah make sure you point it away from yourself. Punch that fucker in the mouth. I swear I am the first one to avoid any kind of violence, but that is the limit. What he is doing to you is way worse than regular physical violence.\n\nIt is not only because of the Misophonia no more. He targeted you and you will defend yourself no matter what. You got this.

If you have autistic traits/symptoms other than sound sensitivity, then my guess is that you have Asperger\u2019s. Let me know when your results come out! alright, ill let you know when i find out! Good luck!  I wish this disorder was more understood by people. many of the therapists and psychiatrists ive met dont even know much/ any about it. maybe with time there will be more awareness, yeah? This is kind of misinformation. There is no \"Misophonia test\", and being diagnosed with Misophonia is impossible because it is not recognized as a discrete disorder by the greater medical community. Not sure what you are talking about. huh, then i was lied to. oh well There may be no test, but having professionals look into it is still a good idea.", "Certain sounds require context recently i have noticed that some sounds like water moving inside a bottle sounds the same as mouth smacking, but if i know that sound comes from the bottle, it does not trigger me at all. it is really weird but interesting, because maybe the sound does not even matter a lot, instead where it comes from is more important to our brains? That sort of thing happens to me too. I actually think of \u201cunknown sounds\u201d as one of my triggers. Im mainly triggered by Persons im around a lot, i.e Family. Less with people I only see once or twice a week, i.e Class mates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts really weird and annoying af Not for me. I have managed to trigger myself accidentally on many occasions. Exact, also when people scratch their eyes. It makes a weird sound, but as it is eyes it does not trigger me\nIf this sound was produced with mouth I draw and shoot :) Yeah, it is probably because you hear it more. It is the repetition that makes it a trigger I guess so yeah! I once was watching a youtube video and had this great feeling of anxiety and disgust. I could not bloody understand why but then the cameraman turned the camera around and he was chewing gum the whole time and I just could not identify it specifically. Yet, I still detected it with my misophonic ears.

Good times.  I would say it is been close to a year of suffering for me, yet I have decided to face it head on in these last few months. \nThe year before, I had new neighbors move down below. The previous ones had a beagle..nuff said.  The new ones were at least nice and train their dog, thank god for that. \nThe basketball is what really gets to me and I find myself pretty angry and anxious after a good period of this kind of noise. I was tired suffering.  Certainly had ideas of screaming out the window; but I would rather not be \u201cthat crazy neighbor.\u201d \nSo here is some things I suggest. \n\n\n I highly recommend you check out guided imagery from a lady called Belleruth Naperstak. Do not be put off by that crazy name as she is a godsend. The majority of her stuff is on Apple Music along with some on Spotify. She has it all, and it is helped me greatly. Still a work in progress, but her PTSD one is beyond soothing at the end of the day. She also has them for anxiety, anger, sleep; you name it. Not affiliated with her, although I wish I was! \n\nBinaural beats and noise canceling headphones are your friend.  Top of the line Bose have been with me since forever. \nPack that in with regular exercise and sleep.  If the triggering noise begins. Grab those headphones and beats. Or just watch some Netflix until it stops. \nMy favorite artist that helps calm my nerves is Nujabes :) \n\nDo not let this own you!   You are in control more than you think.  I just had a great sit down with some binaural beats after the basket ball began to bounce today.  , I already feel at ease after just 30 min of listening. I will be doing that daily from now on.  I also suggest quiet activities with reading and soft ASMR sounds to accompany you before bed. I love the rain/thunderstorm ones. It is all about management and forming good habits for your mind and body. \n\nI cannot emphasize a good nights sleep enough. Get to bed a bit early and relax with a novel. Light a candle, say a prayer if that is your thing and I promise you will feel settled even from that. Belleruth has a sleep imagery that is from the heavens itself. \n\nSleep Essentials for me:\nA fan\nEar plugs \nA decent blue tooth speaker with gentle sounds playing all night, I go with rainy afternoon or campfire. \nThis combination has helped me so much. \n\nPlease feel free to share your stories and vent. It is ok. Believe me I have been ashamed to admit to friends in the past. I have opened up to them in the last year; and have achieved a great support system which is Another tool to help manage this. You are not alone! Thanks for posting! \n\nI am definitely going to look up the guided imagery lady -  bonus that she sounds like a Harry Potter character lol Haha she certainly has a magical way with words and music I love Nujabes and since discovering his mixes have been using them to concentrate for a few years now. Same for the YouTube \u2018chill hop\u2019 instrumental live streams. Such cute animations to accompany them too!\n\nMy problem with headphones is that I have a tiny head! All the noise-cancelling headphones seem to be made for giant men. :( \n\nIf any small headed ladies have recommendations that would be a great help. :) I would look into noise canceling ear buds then!

Today I got home from work starving because I had been waiting HOURS to eat. I was dying to eat. But because my brother decided to eat dinner just after I got home, I must sit here and wait. Everyone else has absolute authority over the kitchen because I will be pushed out no matter what since I do not have a choice but to leave. Im jealous of him for getting to eat whatever he wants whenever he wants. I do not get that. I must wait for him.

This is my first time posting here! I have known for awhile that I absolutely have sound triggers. My mom sneezes too many times, my dad sneezes way too loudly, my mom also has coughing fits when she eats sometimes because it is \u201ctoo hot\u201d or there is \u201ctoo much spice\u201d or it \u201cjust went down the wrong pipe\u201d and even typing that out infuriates me lol. Sometimes I am also triggered when my boyfriend says \u201cuh\u201d too much, and I just want him to *spit out his damn sentence already.*\n\nI did some internet digging tonight because I noticed that another thing that sometimes sets me off is gravelly voices! Usually with men, sometimes my dad, sometimes my boyfriend, even that character on a tv show I was watching tonight. It. Is. Grating.\n\nAnybody else have that trigger too? Just curious and looking to feel less alone I guess! Yes, which is why I cannot watch House lol also the ss sound when people whisper.. I do too! I think it might be related to how much lower voices travel through walls. When I am sleeping and there is an animated conversation going on, all I can hear are the deeper voices and it really disrupts anything I was trying to do. You are not alone \ud83d\udda4 More recently I have found watching the show Superstore, America Ferrera\u2019s voice is unnecessarily gravelly and it is started to really get on my nerves. I am like, are you constantly recovering from Laryngitis??", "Cannot Stop Triggering Myself Hi all. I am new to this subreddit, and posting my own stuff on Reddit in general. Glad this place exists. I am happy to hear any advice or words of encouragement.\n\nI am 27 and have had misophonia ever since I can remember. It got worse when I started talking about it to my family at the age of 14. High school was a disaster because I started to notice that several of my teachers spoke in ways that triggered me. Pronouncing \"S\" sounds extra sharp, or just having dry mouth. My otherwise wonderful Latin teacher checked both boxes. I had a permanent pass to leave some of my classes. Nice to have some accommodation in a world that does not understand this thing, seriously, but it was humiliating. My grades always suffered.\n\nSomehow I managed to get a decent job where it is been mostly quiet since COVID, as it is usually just me and one other person at the office. But here is the kicker. For at least the past two months, I have had dry mouth all the time. I lose track of how much water I drink every day. I have cut down my caffeine intake. I only drink on the weekends, if I do. I never want to speak because I am constantly dreading the sound. It is that awful feeling when you know the person next to you is about to start eating loudly, except this is 24/7 and you are the guilty one. I live alone, which should have fixed a lot of things. I cannot escape myself.\n\nI sing. I love talking to myself to calm my nerves. I was even going to start experimenting with recording, and now I can barely stand the thought. This is my biggest nightmare, and for the first time I feel like I might actually go insane from the damage this is causing me. I feel like I am aging rapidly. I feel like I am getting uglier as a person in so many ways.\n\nI know I need to get to root of this problem. I am a type 2 diabetic (MODY) and I know dry mouth can be a symptom. But this has NEVER been an issue until the past two months. In any case, I am going to manage my blood sugar to the best of my ability. I am going to continue to use mouthwash/toothpaste meant for dry mouth. I am going to do SOMETHING to try and fix this.\n\nI do not know, guys. I never thought it would get so bad. I come home and I cry each day before working up the strength to lay back and do something that makes me happy. Things that make me happy could potentially trigger me. It is awful. I wish it would stop. I wish I could talk about it with people I love without making them feel helpless for me. I love life in general, but this is ruining it for me more than I ever thought it could.\n\nTL;DR  I have had dry mouth for at least the past two months, and the resulting sound when I speak is one of my worst triggers. I do not know how to fix it. I am constantly on edge and it is beginning to hurt just to exist. One thing you may want to try is aloe juice. I have exactly this issue due to Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome. It causes both dry eyes and dry mouth. If you can, let a doc know this is happening. There are swabs that are used for folks who have dry mouth but are not able to take fluids by mouth. Your doc can get them for you.The aloe has worked well for me and I keep the swabs in my purse. I really empathize with this one from first-hand experience. Thank you so much for the suggestions. Yes, you would definitely understand this sort of thing. I will be trying aloe juice asap, and I do have some doctor appointments coming up and will let them know. I really appreciate your input as well as your empathy! It is horrendous to deal with. So I try to help fellow misophones as best I can. Another thing I did was get a half gallon water container with double walls. The one I have is from The Coldest Water. I find I do better if water is 1. copious and 2. very damned cold. This way, I drink it without thinking about it or forgetting about it. This bottle was pricey, but so, so worth it. FFS!!! Trigger warnings, use them you idiots!! Excuse me? There is no rule that says you have to do that, just not in the subject. Also, way to make people new to this community feel welcome. We are all going through some bad shit. Wrong. Rule #3 literally says:\n\n&gt; In addition, any post that has a potential trigger for someone else, please use the associated flair as a warning and mark it NSFW for filtering purposes.\n\nIt is not my job to make you feel welcome. I am not your therapist or a support circle organizer or anything. I am just someone trying to literally survive and not die with misophonia. Way to make people feel welcome yourself, triggering them with your posts. I did not know there were bullet points, so I did not see that. Thanks for pointing that out. Like I said, I am very new to this. New to Reddit in general.\n\nYou are not new to Reddit. Surely you have seen rule #1 that says \"be kind to each other\"? Calling people idiots does not fix your misophonia. It just shows that you are unkind.\n\nI felt like dying when I made this post, so excuse my imperfections. It was not my intention to make you or anyone else feel even worse.\n\nPeace. Thank you again for your advice.

He does for like a few seconds but starts again. Yeah that is how I am when my mom picks at her fingers. I ask her if she can stop and she does, but a few minutes later she starts up again. She is been doing it longer than I have been alive, so it is one of those things that we cannot control unfortunately :( Ugh, yes! This is the worst.

Even seeing them chew or chew on nails is just as triggering.", "(Slight trigger warning) I need to talk to someone about this. # (Warning: VERY emotional vent incoming, possible triggers in post)\n\nI am currently a sophomore in high school, and I have had misophonia for about 3-5 years now. I do not know where it originated or how it came into my life, but my first real experience misophonia was in eighth grade, when I began to cry in the middle of a test because everyone around me was sniffling. Sniffling was my first trigger, and still my biggest one.\n\nI absolutely dread going to school every day. On the surface, I am an excellent student. I get straight A's, I take advanced courses, I always turn in my work on time, and I get along with everybody. But in reality, I am feel like an anxious, caffeine-addicted mess who cannot function in a classroom without ear plugs and Bluetooth earphones blasting white noise into my brain.\n\nI have to deal with the constant threat of sniffling sounds all day, the only time I have total silence is night time. But since I have to wake up at 5:20 in the freakin' morning, god forbid I stay up past 10:30 if I want to feel at least a little rested.\n\nI have been feeling cranky and irritable every day, each day more than the last. It has gotten to the point where I begin to despise specific people who dare to sniffle in my presence. I just feel like I am tanking through every day at school, just to relax for a few hours before the cycle repeats itself over and over.\n\nI feel absolutely helpless with this situation, nothing I am doing seems to be working. I have tried exposing myself to triggers, hiding from triggers, associating triggers with happy thoughts, labelling my feelings, repeatedly telling myself my brain is only messing with me, reading articles about misophonia, avoiding the subject of misophonia completely, exercising, eating healthier, cutting caffeine, drinking even more caffeine... I am done trying. Everything is just getting worse.\n\nAnd what is left after being triggered minute after minute is a dreadful feeling. The thought that I am going to have to deal with this constant agonizing feeling every day until I die. The thought that the rest of my life is going to be filled with hundreds of earplugs and white noise. The thought that I am forever going to be held back in life because my brain decided \"sniffing and chewing = bad\". The thought that I will never be able to do normal things, like go to the movies, or eat at a quiet restaurant.\n\nAnd the sickening fact that misophonia controls my life.\n\nI have no idea who to talk to about this. My dad has absolutely no idea I have these problems, my mom does not know how misophonia works at all (which I understand), I am not close enough to both of my friends to talk to about my emotional problems, and I do not know whether I should talk to my guidance counselor or not (Let alone know what their name is)\n\nAnd asking for a therapist is obviously going to freak out my parents, and possibly anger them. I do not want them to feel like they did something wrong. I am especially worried about upsetting my dad, he would feel devastated if I went up to him and requested to talk to someone.\n\nMy life would be perfect if I did not have misophonia. I hate myself for having it.", "Time to move to Germany? | Germany drafting law to give people the legal right to work from home  lol I just came from there", "Earplugs?

This week my Misophonia has been HORRIBLE.\nSo a few days ago I was watching a movie with my dad and my little brother was eating goldfish. Well, he kept on smacking his lips and moving the goldfish around in his bowl and it made me so angry it got to the point where I would glare at him and then angrily say \u201cAre you almost done with those?\u201d Or \u201cCan you eat those a little quicker?\u201d And he would respond by saying \u201cNo. I am going to eat them one at a time.\u201d And it got to the point where I was on the brink of tears and actually started silently crying. Then my little sister started getting these huge glasses of water and gulping them as loud as she can. I had a friend over a few days ago and my little sister was watching us play a game and she went to get some water and she came back up and was drinking it in my ear *gulp* *gulp* *crunch* (she was also eating the ice) I yelled at her. Not very loudly and I told her to leave. She glared at me and then stomped downstairs. This week I discovered new triggers (so fun) because my step dad has gained a new habit of always sucking the air between his teeth (if that makes sense) and slurping anything he drinks. He has not noticed how I react to these triggers yet and I know if I say something he is going to make a huge argument about it and I do not want that. Then today at dinner my mom started scraping her teeth on her fork (which is my worst trigger and makes me want to scream) and anytime I flinch she normally tries to stop which I am thankful for but today she had her back turned to me(idk if it was on purpose or not but I think it was) and then my step dad started eating and it was EXTRA loud for some reason today. It got to the point where I had to ask my mom if I could listen to music which I never do because I love eating dinner and talking to my family and hearing about their day (but I hate the triggers). Anyway I just needed somewhere to vent so thanks for that and if anyone has any advice that would mean the world to me. Try to play music in the background of dinner, do not know if it will work but it is worth a try After a week like that, I usually feel incredibly overstimulated to the point where any little thing sets me off and/or becomes a new trigger. Personally, when I am like that, I rewatched movies or videos that I know will not trigger me or listen to calm music. I then try to stim to give my hypersensitivity something to focus on. Sometimes I have to shut myself in my room for a day or two and not interact with people. It is kind of like fasting, in a way. Slowly, the tension goes away, and I feel like I can deal with triggers healthfully. That is what works for me personally, as I too cannot tell people around me they are triggering me. I am sorry all this has happened to you. Triggers are one thing, but being intentionally triggered is on another level of awful--it is cold-hearted. Please take care of yourself, and good luck", "I feel \"violated\" everytime I hear a particular noise. The noise that triggers me the most is sniffling.\n\nMy father does it a lot and it is so loud that I can hear it from my bedroom, we live in a very small apartment. It sounds like velcro ripping apart. I wear earplugs a lot, to the point that my ear canals become swollen and irritated.\n\nI do not have an explanation for this, but this noise gives me pain in my private parts. I feel a burn, as if I had just been touched by an unwanted hand, my legs clunch hard and I fall into a state of shock that lasts a few seconds. When the shock wears off, I run into my room and stuff my ear with the plugs. Sometimes, I bite my arms really hard to shift the source of the pain.\n\nI have been sexually molested in the past, but I do not recall my molester making that noise; also the molester was not my father.\n\nSo why do I feel sexually violated everytime my father makes that noise? That is actually super common with misophonia! It does not have anything to do with past sexual assault, although I am very sorry that has happened to you and I hope you are doing better now. \n\nWhen a certain stress threshold is met, it is common for people to experience unwanted arousal. I have definitely felt a tingle down there when being bothered by my triggers. It is a sucky feeling for sure, but a lot of us experience it. You are never alone. This sort of sound like a form of synesthesia. If you are not familiar with the term, look it up- maybe you will find some answers there! Even if it is not that, remember that misophonia is often categorized as being \"overstimulated\" which also sounds like it could explain a lot. Good look in your endeavors! Thank you, yes I am kind of doing better now, I am still going through therapy. Thank you for your response, you made me feel less weird. I looked it up and actually relate to most of it. I will discuss this with my therapist.  \nThank you for bringing it up", "i live a couple of blocks from a primary school just moved to a house rental less then a mile from the primary school in my town and the noise from the kids there is absolutely unbearable, i have Autism, misophonia and suspect to have OCD and my #1 most hated sound is the sound of children/babies screaming or crying i literally cannot stand it!! \nit fills me with fear and panic and i literally had a panic attack in my room because of it\nits the main reason (along with alot of others) why i would never ever EVER want to have them or live near them.\n\n.i have expensive sound blocking headphones but i put them on and i can still hear it, its going to drive me insane i cannot just move out because we are not very wealthy and we havent been here for even a week! idk what to do i really really do not want to live like this and my parents probably think i am overreacting \n\ndoes anyone here have any suggestions?? Ugh ya. I am so sorry. We recently moved to a house that is very very close to a lot of other houses. I feel u. \nI am trying all the tricks.

Have had miso for 30+ yrs...", "Coping technique turning out to be harmful? So I have been dealing with misophonia for a few years without knowing what misophonia was until recently. I came up with my own coping techniques for when I was on the bus or in public, but I am starting to realize that it may not be healthy in the long run. What I do is play rain sounds through earbuds to drown out ambient noise, but I have been noticing that I have been turning up the volume to a point where my ears hurt afterwards. This is definitely not good for my hearing, does anyone else have any suggestions to improve this coping technique? Headaches, sore ears, ear infections. I have them all the time. What I have figured out so far is each experience with condition makes the trauma worse and the condition seems to get worse overtime and faster if being triggered, i wish I could help you but I cannot even help myself. I feel like it will be months before I am in prison. Have you tried noise canceling head/earphones so you do not have to turn up the volume so loud? Although maybe we would be better off deafening ourselves :p I also use rain sounds, but I try to make it as quiet as possible but still covering up the trigger. I would suggest maybe each day turn the sound down one notch at a time? I understand the struggle though.", "Ice is basically my worst nightmare I have struggled with misophonia since I can remember. I have good days and bad, but lately what is been hurting me the most is when my brother eats ice. I cannot stand the noise of him sucking on it but what is the most painful is when he shakes it in the cup. When I see him pick up the cup my first instinct is to drop everything I am doing and plug my ears. My body tenses up, my joints lock and unlock, and my blood pressure rises (I already have a high blood pressure health issue). There is not really anything to fix it; I just needed to say it somewhere. Misophonia is so painful. My family members do not understand. My brother also has a habit of chewing ice occasionally. I do not know why he does it but thankfully he is pretty understanding and waits for me to put on headphones/leave the room. There is always an undescribable feeling of dread whenever I hear the ice machine though.\n\nMisophonia is a nightmare. for reallll. my brother tells me he enjoys chewing ice and making those noises, which makes it even worse. he gets on me for \u201cpolicing\u201d him too much because it makes it \u201chard for him to live\u201d. I do not know if he just does not realize it causes physical pain or if he just does not care. It sucks. misophonia is horrible I am thankful that my brother is understanding of my misophonia. I know I am already heavily disadvantaged in the world due to misophonia but at least my family is supportive and helps make it a little easier on me. I am sorry your brother does not realize how hard is is on us. Sure, it might be a little difficult to accommodate for someone with misophonia but it is so much harder to actually have it.\n\nIn short, misophonia is hell.", "I hate utensils  bamboo plates solved this problem for me and my girlfriend.

It would be so much easier. Or plastic utensils, that would be nice. Analogous to a family member eating yogurt out of a plastic container. Just wipe the effing thing out with your finger (much quieter than the 30 minutes of scraping with the spoon) and luck you dumb finger. Then be done with the damn thing already! Eat with Enjera! My brother is really bad with hitting the fork against his teeth when he eats. It is horrible. Literally the only person I have ever met that does that, so I know it is avoidable but I cannot bring myself to tell him to stop", "Miso and specific ppl Does anyone else experience miso symptoms exclusively to certain people? Particularly people they live with or spend an extensive amount of time with like parents or partners? I read somewhere that you experience stronger symptoms with those you love vs strangers. Granted strangers can still annoy me, things are much worse with my family. I remember exactly what annoyed me about my dad and my mom growing up. I even felt bad then and I did not understand that Misophonia was a thing until I was an adult and then everything made sense! \n\nIn my own little family, my older kids annoy me (and my husband) more than my toddler when they eat crunchy things. The older ones did not bother me when they were toddlers either. I do not know if it is because my brain is like \u201cthey are still learning manners, so give them a break?\u201d I have no idea. \n\nSorry that was a bit long lol I think it is all about the repetitiveness &amp; rate of exposure to the triggers. The more frequent we hear it the more likely it becomes a trigger. Our parents &amp; loved ones (coworkers too) may be the most we are exposed to, thus the most triggering... yep.\n\ni think because i grew up with them and know them and their habits so well.\n\nStrangers i can give them (and me, i suppose) a little benefit of the doubt.\n\nPartners... there is no frickin way. It is one of the first things i check about somebody before i start dating them. 100% deal breaker if they are an eater. Miso is a traditional Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and k\u014dji and sometimes rice, barley, seaweed, or other ingredients. Mine is specific to people I am already disgusted by. I could live with someone for years and love them and not notice anything annoying about how they eat or breathe. Then if they do something that makes me distrust them or lose respect for them, I will try to ignore it and act like it is no big deal, but I will start getting intense misophonia for sounds they make that previously did not bother me. After that there is just no coming back and I stop wanting to be around them at all Not exclusively but ye definitely harder to tolerate when it is someone you spend a lot of time with I love my roommate, but when she eats, I have to leave the room and scream into my pillow. YES. I have noticed that with strangers it is not really that bad. But people I love? Full on rage.", "Best dinnerware for misophonia sufferers?  I have heavyweight glass and handmade ceramic dishes, cups and mugs. The tone of the inevitable clinking is of a lower pitch and hence less irritating to me. \n\nCheaper, softer ceramics like knockoff fiestaware has the lowest pitch clinks of all. For me personally its not clicking on plates its the scraping sound on teeth. I have found plastic is better but I hate having to have plastic utensils. Good for you for recognizing and trying to help that really goes along way just to be heard by people your close to. You are an awesome parent for being so supportive. People like you make the world a better- Quieter- place. I personally always preferred plastic plates, but that is just me. I would ask him if the dishes bother him at all, personally I could not care less about that sound, I even like it when the sound they make distract me for a little bit from the chewing. Paper plates and plastic ware lol\n\nAre you eating with your mouth closed or open? Please eat with your mouth closed at all times and do not talk while you chew. That is manners Rather than asking outright if the sound of the dishes bother him (as to not inadvertently add to his triggers) just ask him if there is anything else you could implement to make meal times more comfortable.

Founded by Jennifer Jo Brout in 2008 and led by Dr. Zach Rosenthal, research conducted within this program investigates the relationship between auditory over-responsivity/misophonia, emotions, cognition and behavior.\nPrevious studies from this program have examined the effects of meclizine on pre-pulse inhibition (Levin et al., 2014) and the relationship between sensory over-responsivity and emotions in adult psychopathology (Rosenthal et al., 2011; Rosenthal et al., in press).\nIn addition to research, we are dedicated to developing, evaluating, and establishing best practices for providers working with patients who report having misophonia. The approach we are developing is multi-disciplinary and is done in tandem with patients and their families. The self-help component to this approach is a practical combination of proactive coping skills designed to help individuals identify aversive stimuli, and learn different ways to help calm the physiological and emotional over-arousal associated with that stimuli. The program also seeks to help individuals reevaluate and change ways of thinking about aversive stimuli that may act to acerbate.  The program teaches how to help calm the physiological and emotional responses to these aversive stimuli. Updates about this program will be posted periodically.\nDonate To Help Research\nCurrent Studies\nSensory Processing and Mental Health Study\nSome people respond to sensory cues in their daily environments differently than others. Problem with processing sensory information (e.g., getting angry when hearing certain sounds) can be associated with various behavioral health problems.\nThis study was funded by the Wallace Research Foundation and is no longer active. The study examines the relationship between self-reported responses to sensory cues (during childhood and adulthood) and various mental health problems.\nGeneralization of Emotion Regulation\nThis is a study about the ways in which people cope with emotional distress in their lives. We will be looking at ways to understand how to help people calm down easier after they become emotionally distressed. We are interested in how to do this both inside the clinic and also outside in the real world.\nInvestigating Antihistamine Treatment to Reduce Sensory Over-responsiveness \nHistamine, in addition to being a chemical that controls nasal and stomach acid secretions and itch responses also serves as a transmitter between neurons in the brain. We have found that brain histamine systems play important roles in sensory responsivity. In preclinical studies we have shown that a certain type of antihistamine treatment can help reverse sensory gating impairments. In an initial clinical study with people who have difficulty modulating their sensory responsiveness, antihistamine treatment improved sensory screening without producing sedation. This initial study was in people with general sensory over-responsiveness.\n________________________________________\nThe Polyvagal Theory \u2013 Stephen Porges\nPolyvagal Theory makes predictions based on acoustic properties. The Polyvagal Theory proposes that subjective responses to sounds are initially (before associative learning) based on two features of the acoustic signal: pitch and variation in pitch. The theory articulates that for mammals there is a frequency band of perceptual advantage in which social communication occurs. It is within this frequency band that acoustic \u201csafety\u201d cues are conveyed.\nConsistent with the theory, safety is signaled when the pitch of the acoustic signal is modulated within this band. Thus, a monotone within this band is not sufficient to signal safety. Moreover, the theory proposes that low frequency monotone sounds (e.g., dog\u2019s bark, lion\u2019s roar, large truck, and thunder) are inherent signals of predator and high frequency monotone sounds are inherent signals of pain and danger (e.g., shrill cries of babies or someone who is being injured).\n\n", "Costa Rica Will Now Be Good for Misophonia Refugees!

I storm off and cry, and it is hard to deal with. I thought my family was somewhat supportive until my dad's girlfriend (subtly) threatened to take away something I was really looking forward to because I did not want to talk to her about what was wrong because she was causing the trigger.  \n\n\n\"if you do not want to talk we will leave -thing I am looking forward to- for another time.\"  \n\n\nI might be reading too much into it but, yikes... I do not want to talk about it because it is hard and I do not want to upset her. She sniffs a lot and it was not a trigger before but it is been getting worse. She usually sniffs two times before sniffing, so coughs are starting to get to me now. I have told this to her and my dad, I tell them I know she cannot help it, but I still continue to be told 'she cannot do anything' about it and asked why I am storming out right after she sniffs. She did not even come to me when she asked what was up, she texted me. I know it is not that bad, but I do not feel good at the moment- to get something taken away because of something I cannot change is not fair to me... Know that it does get better, but the affects of the trigger tend to weaken quite later in life. And Misophonia gets worse the more you are exposed to it. So my advice is to get some quality earbuds, download musi(no audio adds), and cut out those who refuse to be considerate. I have met soooooo many people that have been willing to cooperate with me and make me feel safe. But I have met plenty who have deliberately refused to be considerate.  So I cut them out my life. Misophonia has ended relationships, grades, sleep, etc. I am not going to let a person\u2019s ignorance cause anymore harm to my life. I have had it since I was young and now that I am older it is gotten worse. I do have some headphones that work well if I have my music up loud, so I am ok there! They are both really considerate for the most part, but I guess at some point they just get sick of trying not to sniff or breathe/chew loudly. Family is a hard one. Especially when you know they are trying. And studies have shown that family tends to be where the triggers are the worst. Maybe if escaping is not the route you want to take. Coping could work well. Meditation has helped me a bunch. The leaf on a stream technique is my favorite. Just want to comment to give you the reminder/reassurance that nobody is entitled to your time and personal space\u2014 not even your family. Taking steps to manage your reactions to triggers is important too, but do it for you and for the good of your mind and nervous system, not to appease the people around you who are making the trigger sounds. Something that I do is take a deep breath, calmly walk out of the room (still holding that breath), and then once i am in a safe spot, release it and shake it out/tear some paper/do something physical to help get the stress off. Their comfort is not more important than your well-being. \n\nSome language that might help:\n\n\u201cWhen you withhold (thing to look forward to) in order to pressure me to talk about something that I have already clearly expressed, it demonstrates your unwillingness to empathize with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you hold things I love/look forward to hostage, it tells me that you care more about your feelings than my well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not storm out of the room because i do not like you or because I am angry at you, I do it because I have a sensory processing disorder, and certain sounds activate my fight or flight response. When i leave the room, i am de-escalating the situation for myself and everyone around me.\u201d I think the last response is really good. The first two are \"you messages\" that may make people become defensive instead of willing to listen. I hear that\u2014 thank you for that feedback!", "Finally no shared walls...and then...  My neighbor was blasting country music in their yard so loudly, it was painful.  I blasted Scottish bagpipes back until he lowered the volume.\n\nIt is been relatively peaceful since then.  The way I would bake so many muffins just to befriend all the neighbors to all call in noise complaints about him I do not understand HOW people think just blasting their music is okay. People in my city love to drive around with their radios blasting, and it seems as though it is the perfect hobby for when I am sittin in the car waiting for my parents to finish shopping. The icing on the cake? They cannot get enough of blasting their music just to sit in their car with it on for five minutes before they get out to do what they need to do. That is brilliantly passive aggressive, and I love it. I am triggered both by music and people talking loudly, particularly at night. My ex-husband and I lived three blocks down the street from a pub in a predominantly residential area. Every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night the people that worked there would stop in front of my building around 4:30am and talk really, really loudly. After about a month of being woken up and not being able to fall back asleep because I am too worked up we went up on the roof and egged them. A full dozen eggs. Urban warfare at it is best. Needless to say they did not stop in front of our house again. \n\nIf your neighbor\u2019s music is so loud that you can record it on your phone from inside your house there is a very good chance it qualifies as a noise violation and you can call the cops. There are limits on how many decibels should be audible outside your home and most smartphones have apps that can take a decibel reading. I had to do this twice before. The first time was my downstairs neighbor and the second time was a restaurant a block away from my apartment that was throwing illegal after hours parties. \n\nI am admittedly pretty ruthless when it comes to protecting my peace and quiet. There are acceptable noise levels during acceptable times of day that I suck it up and tolerate, and then there are people just being assholes. I have no patience for the latter.", "FUCK THIS I cannot deal with this fucking condition. Everyone is pissed at me constantly for politely asking them to be quiet. And if I do not ask they get pissed at me for glaring at them. Cannot fucking win. I do not know what to do anymore, maybe I should just lock myself in my room 24/7. Do not want to see more of their disappointment It is hard. Some days are harder than others. Have you sought help? I have had some benefit from talking therapies for my own triggers. I am not sure how I would get help for something like this. I do see a psychiatrist already for unrelated reasons but I do not think she would be able to help As you get older you will care less and less if people think you are weird for asking them to stop being fucking annoying. I remember being stressed af in high school trying to seem aloof when someone was sniffing constantly. I would get hot, break into sweats, and feel like I wanted to jump out of my own skin. \n\nThis was many years ago and now I do not care if I look like an asshole. If people understood how severely that shit affected us, they would not mock/scoff/be skeptical. Now I tell strangers that no one wants to hear them chew and crack their gum, and I tell coworkers who make sounds louder after I ask them to stop that they are being really cruel and I would never do that to them. \n\nIt always sucks, but over time it sucks *less*.

Go to a psychiatrist and ask for a prescription for inhibitors. There is still much to learn about this condition, but some professionals have already treated people. I am taking the kind of medication to treat OCD. They take up to 3 or 4 weeks to take effect. My triggers still bother and distract me, but at least the anxiety and flight or fight response have been reduced. It is not perfect but at least I can survive without panicking. Maybe... I feel like she would not take it seriously though I am already on medication for anxiety. It did seem to help slightly with misophonia for a short while, but then over time it got worse again. I feel like there is no solution to this. Thanks that is pretty reassuring actually. I rarely ever ask people outside of my family to stop making a noise, most I do is stare at them in an annoyed way each time they make the noise hoping they get the idea. To my family I only tell them occasionally and I try my best to do it politely but they somehow still think I am being rude and get mad. I do not know what to do about it, I put up with it most of the time and they will not even listen when I do tell them. It is her job to take it seriously. She may not have heard of it before, and go armed with some links of suggestions of places to find info to help her. \nWhat do you have to lose by having the conversation? I guess so but I am worried it will just sound stupid. I do not want her to only pretend to take it seriously. Prepare what you want to say and back up your experience with evidence.", "Summer School Triggers I HATE basically everyone in my summer school class. I am an ongoing junior who is stuck with ongoing sophomores. Luckily I have found the best table mates ( one who has ADHD and MISO! ) so they help me but,   there are certain people in my class who chew gum so loud I can hear it from the opposite side of the room. And one pops her gum so loud every damn time! They are immature and \"popular\" and are talking bad about of of our fellow students who wears a hijab. I need help. How do I tell them to stop without making myself a large target? My class is filled with my enemies. Not even joking on that part. Earlier l they forgot their gum after school on their table and my table mate took it so they are have to pay for another. I want to past this class without wanting to cry in class. There is been multiple times in the past week that I have wanted to quit. But I know I cannot. Help please :( I would talk to the teacher alone. Tell them that their gum chewing is really distracting you. I have, but the teacher could not do anything about it.", "Confronted my upstairs neighbor and now they are revenge stomping. What can I do now? First and foremost I just wanted to say that I am very grateful to have found this subreddit and to know the I am not alone. \n\nI have lived in this apartment complex on the top floor for a few years now and transferred to a downstairs unit due to my mom\u2019s health and our upstairs neighbor is a nightmare. They constantly play music all day until the crack of dawn. It gives me so much anxiety and I get furious. There are days where I cannot function because I am upset from the constant pounding. Their music is loud enough for me to hear the lyrics and Shazam it. \n\nMy mom and I have asked them to either turn the music down or keep it before 10pm. We have also offered to let them into our home so that they can have an idea of how their sound travels. Their music is not as skull-shattering anymore, but now they are constantly stomping randomly in the middle of the night which jolts everyone awake and scares the living hell out of us. \n\nOur leasing office is not of help and we cannot afford to move. I cannot wear headphones or ear plugs to bed because my ears hurt after a few hours and I can still hear the stomping over white noise. It is 3:17am and I just want to get some rest. Please let me know how I can help this situation. Thank you in advance! I am so sorry you are going through this, neighbors are the worst sometimes.. I feel like the same happened to me when I made complaints to the apartment office about my neighbors horribly loud dog that yaps all the time, and even freely ran up and down the hallway (it was supervised but unleashed by neighbor). I made two or three total complaints, office said they would do something. Not sure what they did but it was probably a minimal written warning perhaps. Well, ever since their dog has been louder and louder AND they have another dog now!! Both are screechy monsters that scream bloody murder especially when let into the hallway right before/after their walks. It drives me and my partner insane how loud they are. \n\nAnyways, I am sorry I do not think I have a lot of advice that you have not already tried. If your apartment office is doing nothing, you could call the police? Of course your neighbor may know who called them. But maybe they would take authority more seriously. I would also suggest looking for new places, but they are the ones that need to be punished, not you. And I am sure it would be hard to move with your mom\u2019s health. For how long the stomping has been happening? I am so sorry you are going through this. I will never understand why people get offended when they are asked to keep it down, and then purposely act like a bigger nuisance. \n\nI do not know where you live, but if it is the US, you are within your right to call the non emergency police and make a noise complaint. Explain your situation, explain you have already tried talking to your neighbors, and hell if you can record the noise or even make a noise log it might help.\n\nGood luck friend, I have been in your situation before and it sucks.\n\nAlso, is there any way to move to another unit within your complex? Sometimes apartment complexes will accommodate, but I do not know if they will in this situation considering they have not taken the initiative to do anything about your neighbors. Can you file a report for harassment? I would not be worried about keeping good terms with your neighbors since they are clearly assholes. Call the police and file a noise complaint. Thank you. I started compiling a noise log last night and I am going to see if I can record the noise. As of the moment, no other first floor units are available and the office is not sure when there would be one (we would need first floor for my mom\u2019s accessibility). Sorry to read this. Lived downstairs to some heavy ass heel walkers for a few years, and found that intense therapy and earplugs helped me.\nYou write that you have tried earplugs, but I am going to recommend looking for some earplugs that have a low expansion pressure anyways. I have been sleeping with earplugs for close to half my life and recently bought some cheap ones in bulk. They hurt my ears after a few hours as well. So I am back to the more \"expensive\" drug store ones, specifically made for sleeping; twelve hours and more without feeling a thing. After a while you will get used to them.\nSorry if you have already tried this. It is been constant at night ever since we have asked them to turn down their music. I am sorry you are also going through something similar. Yeah, if it happens again I will call the police and formally file a noise complaint. I have just been hesitant to because I am afraid they will get even more petty and bother us more to retaliate.\n\nEditing my comment to say that apparently my mom already has filed a report, but the noise has not gotten better. That is actually a great suggestion. I have just been doing the same with cheap earplugs, but they are a killer after a few hours. I did not consider how there are different expansion pressures. Thanks! Sorry you are having to live through this, it sounds to me like your neighbors are being very unreasonable. I hope it improves for you soon. You are living one of my worst nightmares for real- the spite stomping/music blasting neighbor. I would 100% find out the local sound ordinances and call the non emergency police number. Keep track of your calls and all encounters in a notebook to show your property manager. You do not even have to have misophonia to have your life ruined by assholes like this but it sure makes it extra hellish. I am sorry you are dealing with this. Having your home tainted with that ever present hanging cloud of waiting for the trigger sounds is just fucking awful. Im so sorry. I do not have much advice, but I also have bad neighbors. They straight up laugh full volume at 3 am. Like shrieking laughter I am glad to see your mom on top of things, but I am sorry there is still no change. However it is possible noise complaints may be low on the police\u2019s agenda, so maybe they have not come by yet? Oh and thank you, it sucks, but we are in the boat of *screw it let us move!* lol. Been wanting to move for years due to various reasons. (As long as my new job works out well..) Yeah my mom has already filed a report and I called the office about the noise log. It seems like the unit upstairs got to them first and lied about how we have been constantly banging on the ceiling so we actually got reprimanded :(. It sucks because we were previously the upstairs neighbors and never had any complaints so I feel like it is not THAT hard to be reasonable. That would honestly scare the hell out of me and make me think my place was haunted or something. I am sorry you are also experiencing terrible neighbors. Wo Ridiculous. I hate people so much I am so sorry you are going through this! Sister I have been there! I can tell you right off the bat that earplugs and white noise are not designed to block out heavy bass sounds like foot stomps on the ceiling. BOOM BOOM BOOM sounds will just cut right through like a knife through butter. Been there done that many many times!\n\nThe actual problem is the apartment community you are in being poorly insulated because the builders/owners are cheap and do not want to pay for it. So neighbors are exposed to a continual stream of ambient noise from other units. A spiteful noisy neighbor can make your life hell.\n\nThe other problem is the property management group or landlord who runs the community, which is planned around a revolving door of tenants. That is their business model, and they plan for people not staying long term. Many hike the rent every year and charge ridiculous fees on top of the rent. They are not invested in tenants staying long term, so they do not care if you are getting along with neighbors. They will only usually get involved in disputes if the problem neighbor is doing something really bad, like selling drugs out of their apartment or having wild parties every night. Other than this you are on your own.\n\nUnfortunately if this psycho is above you, the only option you have is to move or try and wait them out. Personally if I were you I would use your noise log to have a case with the management office to be able to break your lease and gtfo. That would be my focus going forward. They are not going to do anything about the neighbor. The fact that you have lived there already and have no relationship with them, enough for them to know you are not the problem, to me is the writing on the wall. Get out of your lease and find another place to live. You can do it!", "Got rid of my tinnitus - now my misophonia is out of this world I have had vascular tinnitus my whole life. When I became pregnant last year it became a whole new level of extreme, until suddenly it just... disappeared. Thought it would be back after birth but here I am, five months later and it is still gone. Not sure that it will last, but so far there is been no sign of it returning - everything's quiet. But that is the problem: I have never dealt with life being this quiet before. I have struggled with misophonia as long as I can remember, and now that there is no tinnitus distracting me, I hear ***everything***. It is driving me crazy.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips or experiences that could be helpful for me? The last thing I want is to be super anxious and angry without any \"visible\" reason, especially now that I am a mom and I want to be a calm and comforting role model for my child.", "I think it belongs here aswell  I think it also belongs on r/aspiememes I should have edited the image with \\*trigger sound\\* on that puching arm, so it makes more sense here.", "Lord, give me strength to make it through these two weeks. My husband and I are visiting his family for Christmas. Only problem I have is that they have four dogs. I am in misophonia hell. Dogs are my biggest trigger because all they do is lick. When everyone sits down and settles in the living room, the dogs all lay down and immediately start to graze on their bodies.   \n\n\nSo, for the majority of my vacation, I have been hiding in the bedroom because I CAN NOT stand being around the dogs and their obsessive licking. All they do is lick themselves. When they are not licking themselves, they are slurping water. I cannot say anything because I know I will get the usual, \" that is what dogs do? How else are they supposed to clean themselves and drink water?\" I think it is so selfish of me to expect these animals to not do these things yet when they do it, I literally want to take the nearest sharp object and ram it into my ear so that I do not have to suffer listening to those awful sounds.   \n\n\nI want to be deaf. This condition is a fucking curse and I want to be deaf. I am sick of always looking like a crazy person or a dog hater because of my misophonia. I always feel like I have to be silent about my triggers because dogs are sacred and their comfort will always trump mine. I do not hate dogs. I am a huge animal lover and I desperately wish that I could be around them but the sounds they make drive me absolutely insane. I try explaining my condition but I am met with, \" Everyone hates those sounds but we deal with it. \"  \n\n\nSo now I seem like I am being a rude, anti social asshole because I feel trapped in this bedroom to avoid the triggering sounds made by the dogs. I cannot fucking win.  I want to be out there with the family but my stupid brain has to be wired this way. I am not choosing to be this way. It is not something that I can just ignore or get over. Even if I put earbuds in and listen to music, I see the dogs head's bobbing up and down as they obsessively go to town on their bodies with their tongues.   \n\n\nI feel so ridiculous getting so bent out of shape about this but it is seriously ruining my holiday and I feel so guilty for not being able to simply ignore it like everyone tells me to.   \n\n\nSo here I am, sad and laying in bed while I listen to my family laugh and have a good time in the other room. I feel so isolated. Omg I feel you!! Dogs are one of my biggest triggers too. So bad that I had to rehome my big dog. I miss him so much. \n\nBut anyway- I know exactly how you feel. I hate visiting family because I cannot escape triggers without looking like an antisocial asshole. I cannot bring it up because I look crazy or dumb, or like you said they will say \u201ceveryone hates those noises\u201d. They just do not understand. \n\nAs long as your partner understands then you do what you have to do for your mental health. If that means hiding out in the room then so be it. You have a health issue, just because they cannot see it does not make it any less real. Maybe your partner can make up some excuse for you. Such as you have a migraine or something. Bose or Sony noise cancelling wireless headphones. They are a lifesaver!\nYou do not have to be playing anything for the noise cancellation to be active and I would bet it will filter out most of the licking noise. My husband is my champion. He just went and sat his mother down and brought up everything there is about Misophonia. He explained to her that it is a very real condition. I feel a lot better after he did that. He also made a point to explain that I do not have anything personal against the dogs. I feel a lot better now and they are going to go out of their way to curb their dogs excessive licking. \n\nI am sorry that you struggle with these triggers. I would love to have a dog and I miss having one. But it would not be fair to the poor dog to have an owner that becomes distressed at every sound they make. Sorry, it sucks for sure. I wonder if your husband can put on some music or something to try and mask the sounds? My husband is my trigger- argh. I just try to never eat when he is These past few days, I have also been considering driving a sharp object into my ears. I feel like an asshole for thinking that going deaf could be a blessing along with all the difficulties. That hit close to home.\n\n\nI see that you mentioned that your husband talked to his mom. It is awesome that he is so supportive and understanding, and I hope it will make things easier for all of you. I was meaning to ask if being open about it with the family was an option. Also, can you hang out with them in a room or outside, somewhere the dogs do not go? I also love animals but have similar problems and I try to go places where they do not go if things get too much.\n\n\nHave strength and take care!", "Misomatch Has anyone ever heard of this site, i am not promoting it just seeing how well know it is.\n\nI only just made a acount but it seems well made", "Music During Meals Question: Does playing music in the background during meals help anybody else out? I know it makes it all the more bearable to eat with my family when I turn the radio on. We do not eat with out background noise. Even like holiday meals. I do not live with my parents but they know now that tv or phone is being turned on for music.  It helps a little just having something to focus on Background noise is a necessity for me to stay sane. I cannot mentally or physically take it when someone is chewing in the silence, I will get so overwhelmed with anger and stress. If I am at home, the tv is on. If I am at work in the break room, I have earphones on. It is just my life now, lol. TV or music, and face away from your triggers! For me that helps a lot, especially since I am lucky there is a coffee table right next to the dinning table, so I sit there and can still converse whilst almost  completely forgetting my triggers. Yes for more than a year that i use music and it really is life saving. Without music its unbearable. Yesss! Big time. Or eating with a loud TV, eating at a loud restaurant, etc. I recommend headphone splitters + video games, music, TV show if you are in a relationship The problem is when it comes to a partner/family member who snores. Holy shit is that anxiety inducing. That is something that needs to be nipped in the bud from day one. Snoring would be a relationship ender for me.

I hate gulping.\n\nI started crying when my brother tossed a bag of bang-pops at me. I yelled at my family when they set off fireworks. I wanted to attack my brother when he kept snapping near me. I seriously considered jumping out of a car when my dad was chewing gum. Any time I bring up being uncomfortable with sounds I am only taunted by more of the sound, told I am too sensitive, or the person is clearly upset at me for even saying anything.\n\nI do not know what to do anymore. I am not as bad as a lot of people here, I know that, it is just getting worse recently it seems like.", "Ok, so I think I have figured out a potential cause of my problem. I might actually have been de-sensitized to my trigger stimuli. So now what I need is to re-sensitize me to my trigger stimuli. ", "How are you liking the quarantine with misophonia? Personally isolation has helped me focus on my homework much better as school is the place the most triggers. However, now that I am home with my family there are a lot more family meals. I want to spend time with my family, but eating sounds are my worst trigger. I often nap through dinner, work on homework without taking a break to eat with them, or say I am not hungry just to eat the leftovers later and not have to deal with trigger noises. A few times I have been able to eat with them by using AirPods playing white noise, but the best solution for me is to just eat by myself. Does anyone else have a similar situation? For me, this pandemic is bigger than all my issues and hangups with misophonia. I would gladly go back to hearing my coworkers eat in our open office if it meant the world would go back to normal. Yeah, that is a good point. If only misophonia was the biggest problem right now. It is horrible. I need to spend the whole day with my stepfather eating and speaking with a thin pitched voice. Going crazy. So many different sounds at home that I never noticed before are now triggering me I hate it.\nI am now stuck in a house with my 3 sisters who do not know how to eat like normal people. Every meal is full of lip smacking and other gross eating noises that they just HAVE to make. I no longer have anywhere to escape because I do not have school or track practice. My only escapes are in the morning when I wake up earlier than everyone else, and my daily runs. But those times of bliss silence only last for a few short hours before they all come home. Someone freaking save me please! It is gay my upstairs neighbor thumps around. Fortunately I have my trusty headphones and thunderstorm sounds. Same. The stress is not helping. I have a family member with a cough that will not go away (not COVID). I hate this condition. I am with two kids who chew loud af and click their tongues It is horrible. I take care of my older mother, and she knows my biggest trigger sound is throat clearing. She somehow manages to fit 2 or 3 into every 30 second interaction, and sometimes even when looking me in the eye. It is almost unbearable. I have a colleague who does not know how to chew with his mouth closed. And he eats at his computer desk instead of the lich area every single time. I do not miss it. Hating it. My family is constantly making noise, and if they are not working or grocery shopping, they are home. Driving me nuts...Also, I think that brown noise works better for drowning people out, just FYI. At least, it works better for me. The overall situation is absolutely terrifying, but in terms of misophonia, quarantine has been an improvement. I live with one roommate who does make triggering sounds now and then, but we are not constantly hanging out, so it is not so bad. I had a lot of colleagues who made triggering sounds and wanted to get food/drink together, and my earbuds broke a while ago and I have not been able to afford a replacement- so not having to deal with that now is pretty nice in terms of daily life- I think it is actually helped my mental health a bit. Looking at the much bigger picture, though, this is obviously a very bad situation, but I guess this is a small silver lining. I had to be rushed home from my uni home and I am struggling to adjust to everything and the constant trigger noises that is now causing physical symptoms to manifest because of stress. The uncertainty of the time I will be here makes me feel utterly trapped. Oh man. I see you. It is helping my misophonia in that I am not exposed to triggers at work (I am a graduate student, and I share an office with 3 other people, who are lovely and actually not that loud, but we keep our office door open for some reason, and so I listen to professors loudly talk to students all day). BUT. Being stuck at home is starting to wear on me; I live in a basement suite, and on my bad days, the sound of my landlord walking above me is enough to set me off (I literally had to go sit in my car for an hour today because I was cracking). I am doing a lot of mental work towards trying to ignore the sounds, trying to tell myself that it is not their fault that they are stuck at home, I bought AirPod Pros for the noise cancellation, and I got my partner to hang up towels in his room to 'noise proof' his room because he is a call centre employee and has now been moved home. I recommend walks; it is the only break I get and it is a good reset. I think the important thing for us to is to be easy on ourselves and not push ourselves more than we need to. Its weird. I had just gotten out of the hospital, making big progress with misophonia. But now I know once everything returns to normal, most of my progress will be diminished and I will have to retrain my brain. I also just moved in with my boyfriend before hand. Thankfully he is quite understanding about it all. I am trying to use this time for other things now like writing and growing self-love.

Thanks! :) That is very sweet of you to say! Thanks a bunch and have a good day! Honestly, this year is going pretty decent in terms of school, but that is because I go to a different school for half of the day, and they have different rules.

I constantly have to move to find a place where there are none of my tiggers. Not even my dorm is safe place for me because the walls are so thin. I definitely need new headphones to focus since mine do not do good job at being soundproof. Hellooo. I have had misophonia for as long as I can remember(I am 17) and my parents (especially my dad) are my biggest triggers. I live really far away from my school (about 2 hour car drive each way, so 4 in total) and am stuck with them in a small confined space that I cannot get out of. I have apple earphones but I can still hear their (triggers) even if I crank up the white noise and music to the max. My triggers involve breathing, and it is not like I can ask them to stop breathing Yknow. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day. I have been dealing with Misophonia for as long as I can remember. I have always been told all my life that I am being too sensitive when I react to sounds, and I did not know misophonia was even a thing up until a few years ago. Communities like these are a great thing to see, because it is not something that gets talked about as much as it should, so seeing people so dedicated to this makes me really happy. I work in an open office as a graduate student in the hard sciences. I decided to go back to school as an older student even though undergrad nearly took my sanity due to misophonia. I do not have any noise cancelling headphones and am on a grad student budget. Listening to someone click their pen at this very moment :/ I have had misophonia for as long as I can remember. I have always been mocked for it, and I have ended up in therapy for anger issues associated with misophonia. A new pair of noise cancelling headphones would help me dramatically at work. Hey guys Im finnish so big L here, cause its not classified at all as anything,\nBut I used my phone as a micro phone, and put it on my teachers desk, and had white noise + a speech jammer, and made me only mostly hear my teacher which was a blessing but it annoys others near me cuz theyre very loud. I know i wont get these cuz finnish, but i woudl use it with that btw luck to all of you guys! :D I wish you good luck! My misophonia started for me when i was like 9-10. Just wondering did ur parents talk about u being annoyed by something when u were a kid like even younger then u can remebr? My mom used to tell me that if it got to loud or there were \"bad noises\" when I was a baby, I would scream until she either plugged my ears or made the noise stop. Ok so seems like there is two tipes of misophonics, because my misophonia started at like 9-10 yo but thanks for the info Hello, long time misophonia sufferer here, and a parent of two young \u201csensory seeking\u201d children. I would love anything they may help me be a better and more supportive parent, because my bad days are REALLY bad. Thanks so much for doing this! I currently use cheap over-ear headphones that I had to buy quickly to replace my old ones. Did not have much cash at the time so the headphones are pretty shitty. I have to have them on full volume in order to cope and that just gives me headaches :( So new headphones would be much appreciated! ive had it for over 20 years (but did not know what it was back then), it really has made life a struggle. I do not go out much anymore, maybe some headphones would help?  my daughter also has misophonia, but she does well with earbuds. i have had miso from about age 8. misophonia has greatly impacted my life, from relationships to even my education. i do not have a pair of noise cancelling headphones, which is especially hard for me seeing as my roommate likes to eat chips. i usually blast music in my earbuds &amp; hope for the best, but my tinnitus is also a huge concern lol. but thank you for helping so many people by creating this subreddit to help support fellow sufferers !! &lt;3 I have struggled with misophonia for over 20 years. Did not know what it was for a long time. Even while in-patient they did not know what it was. Misophonia severely limits my ability to be in certain public situations. I would love to have a decent pair of headphones to help me get out more. Thank you for this sub and for this contest. I have 10 siblings (yes, you read right, 10) and live at home until I leave for college in 6 or so months. I cannot stand to eat with my family because they never stop chewing. I ask them to chew quieter or stop chewing and they ignore me or chew louder. I am hypersensitive to these things and can pick out someone chewing from across the room and all of a sudden all of my attention is diverted towards their chewing. I cannot stand it. hello! i have just recently started to really suffer from misophonia. my two main triggers are the sound of my brother and my grandma\u2019s voices. hearing them speak, especially to each other, makes me so unbelievably irritated and sad. i have to blast music to drown them out, and since my brother is up late hours, i cannot sleep at all. i would really love to have a pair of noise-cancelling headphones to make it a bit easier to deal with! \n\ngood luck to everyone else entering! :) I have had aversions to certain noises all my life. I have said for a long time I would appreciate to just plain lose 50% of my hearing. The headphones would be good for this summer while they build a light rail nearby. I have got misophonia so severely to where I cant get a real job and was a major reason for me to drop out of school. So many visual triggers just developed when they want to, like as of late just my mom being on her phone. She doesnt tap her nails on the phone often but she does and that is enough to make me very uneasy, and that is just a milder one. It has completely ruined the relationship I have had with my grandma because she likes to click her nails and she sniffles 24/7.\nThe past few years I have gotten into birds allot and I really love them, I have a female cockatiel but It didnt even cross my mind that she could become a trigger and she has. I have had birds for almost 2 years and it is now becoming a problem and I dont know what I can do. I am really worried I am going to have to get rid of her. \nThis shit just keeps getting worse, I am a 21 year old man and all I want to have is a normal life.\nI have a big fan that stays on 24/7 in my room on max speed to try to get as much white noise as possible, and used to have 2 at one point. I would love some new headphones to aid me in coping with every day life. I have suffered for years and it makes all close relationships a constant struggle. Working in large groups of lads is a big struggle - the macho banter prevents me from talking about my sensitivities for fear of them being used against me. Work can be borderline torture at times. A good pair of headphones would help me greatly. Nice of you to do this giveaway as I am sure anyone commenting here is fully deserving. I have suffered with misophonia before I even knew it had a term. I remember as a kid feeling like I was going to explode inside out when I heard my family members chewing, or later on when I heard my teachers typing on their keyboards during exams. \n\nI work in an office setting now, with a coworker who plays obnoxious music out loud (and will not use headphones), and another coworker who whistles and taps constantly. &amp; When he is not doing that, he is chewing his gum or his food driving me to the farthest edge. \n\nI also travel a ton for work, so I am always on edge on airplanes, being so close to others for extended periods of time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost people do not get it, unless they have misphonia. My husband always tells me to 'just ignore it' as if that is even possible. These headphones would lower my cortisol, and give me peace of mind in my work and daily life. thank you! Hi! I have had miso since I was 8 years old, and have struggled opening up to family, partners, and medical professionals. I often feel isolated and alone when I try to keep my panic at bay in class. However, I am trying hard in my own way to persevere! Headphones will help me cope with the stress I face 24/7 in school and at my apartment :) I remember a time before I turned 12 when I was completely indifferent to minute sounds. My sister and I decided to share a room with a bunk bed. However when I turned 12, I suddenly started to notice my sisters snoring and small insignificant noises. I was stuck in that room with my sister and the longer I slept in the same room with her without any escape, the worse the feels of anxiety around my sister got. I started to get annoyed by almost any noise she made and it strained our once close relationship. I told my parents about how I was reacting to my sisters eating and snoring. I was taken aback by their reply, they punished me severely and told me I was crazy. Misophonia became an everyday part of my life and it started to affect me at school and with more people than just my sister. Once I came to college, it became so bad my sophomore years that I could not attend class and I started to have panic attacks if I tried to attend class. I had to drop all my classes and take time off class. I am taking classes again now and I am trying to finish my degree. I wear normal headphones in class , out in public, and at home due to loud neighbors to use white noise in order to cope with misophonia. It is hard to hide them and my hoodie + hair can only hide so much. I have been desperately trying to find cheap noise cancelling that I can afford on my budget but it is proven difficult to find. I recently discovered the technical term \"misophonia\" and have been trying to incorporate DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) into coping with it. I also am dealing with borderline personality disorder, and I believe that this treatment can aid in misophonia. Specifically practicing a loving kindness meditation and trying to empathize with the other person instead of hating them for producing annoying sounds. I also am working on being assertive and communicating effectively to express my need for quiet. I am also seeking other means of solving this problem - for example at work I have access to a white noise machine that I can keep on my desk which has been helping. Finally being mindful of how I feel, and journaling my experience will also help me cope with misophonia. I currently use my earbuds and brown noise videos on YouTube to cope with misophonia. One of my family members that I live with is just constantly loud, one will not stop talking at you even if you are not listening and she plays super loud videos on her phone while also having the TV volume up high, and the last one is always either playing loud videos or insisting on repeating commercial jingles over and over, repeating a word over and over, talking in a high-pitched voice or an accent...usually saying a word, name, or phrase from certain nationalities in the most stereotypical accent he can, or insisting on pretending to have a Scottish accent when he tells his dogs to stop barking...or humming, whistling, or just making lots of noise every time it gets too quiet for him, which is apparently every second that he is awake. The dogs are the least irritating ones in the house even though they bark all the time! The only reason I hate it when they bark is because I know he is going to start doing that stupid 'Scottish' accent again... My triggers started around age 11 or 12 when I started noticing that my dad would eat very loudly. Eventually I got angrier every time I heard him eat, and over the years I just stopped eating dinner with my family. I have not really told my family about it and I think they feel like I am being standoffish not joining them for dinner. But it super stressful to be subject to those noises and feeling like you cannot escape. Now I am living with my fianc\u00e9e and she is a very quiet eater, but still find myself stressed when she eats. I have discussed this with her and let her know it is not her fault in any way but I cannot help how I feel either. She tries to be super accommodating and works really hard to not make noise, and I feel terrible to put that kind of burden on her. It does help to be eating at the same time as her, as I am less focused on her eating. Still trying to figure out different and better ways to cope", "The Martian Such an amazing movie but i dont understand how they managed to fit in so much EATING YES I KNOW I HEART MATT DAMON WITH MY WHOLE HEART BUT - The audiobook is WAY better than the movie! And NO chewing! :D Chew chew breathe chew explain some science concept exhale chew breathe smack blow out of nose for no reason at all, explain more science...I hope people do not actually eat like that. I have met some bad ones, but Matt is pretty bad in that movie. IDK WHY", "Roommate constantly triggers me, I do not know how to cope anymore My misophonia has been worsening a lot over time, especially when it comes to a specific roommate of mine.\n\nI have *never* seen or heard someone eat as loud as he does. He chews exclusively with his mouth open and smacks his lips almost cartoonishly. He is constantly talking under his breath, or talking loudly in his room to friends or himself, and has his TV's volume up very loud as well. Basically half the things he does trigger me, and so whenever I am awake and he is in the house it is a never-ending barrage of being triggered.\n\nI have tried explaining these things to him, and he *says* he will try and work on them or keep it down, but that lasts about a day if I am lucky before it starts right back up again. We have tried making arrangements (if I am in the living room and he comes up to eat, he should eat in his room to avoid triggering my misophonia. If he is already in the living room/eating, I should stay in my room.) but he does not respect them. He knows what misophonia is but still seems to take everything personally, and acts like me or my other roommates (one of whom is his sibling) reminding him to be mindful is a personal slight against him. And I mean, with how he is been acting, it sure is starting to be. He is blown up at his own sibling twice over this. I cannot just move out (it is a long story but I am disabled + subsequently on a very limited income + have nowhere else I can be) and I do not have the opportunity to leave the house when he is here very much, so often I feel like I am trapped. Recently him triggering me has started to cause me to dissociate and go mute, and for lack of better term I just feel trapped in my body. I cannot move, I cannot speak, the only thing that exists is the triggering noise in question, and when it is a constant barrage of noise, well, I can barely function. And it is not just during the day, either. He stays up until anywhere from 1 to 3 in the morning, always making noise. I never get an escape.\n\nI do not know what to do about this situation anymore. I am at my wit's end. I have a noise machine going on in my room pretty much constantly to try and mask the noise coming from him (his room is right above mine) but sometimes it is not enough, and other times the noise from the machine itself becomes overwhelming and brings me into sensory overload. When I am not in my room, I usually have to have headphones on, but even though they are noise-blocking sometimes even *they* are not enough to keep his voice out (and I do not want to turn the volume up so loud it causes me hearing damage, and again it, too, becomes overwhelming)\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? What, if anything, helped you? I am really struggling. Im sorry, I am disgusted by loud eaters because of how easily they can not be. Just eat slower, smaller bits and keep you mouth closed. Seriously. Loud eating is a choice I am really sorry you are having to deal with that. That must be miserable. I have some ideas, and I do not know how practical they are, and you may have already considered them, but here goes.\n\nFirst, you are not wrong. What this guy is doing is rude, and it has nothing to do with misophonia. I do not have it (my daughter seems to, so we are aware), but I would hate it too. Making too much noise is the same as invading someone is personal space, and it is rude. He sounds either self-centered or maybe just clueless (trying to be generous), and I think he would be a bad roommate for anyone.\n\nSecond, can you talk to your other roommates and maybe switch rooms? If you can get another roommate(s) as an ally, perhaps you could both/all speak to this guy. He sounds like cannot be pleasant to leave with, regardless.\n\nThird, is it possible to get to some kind of cognitive behavioral therapy? This is what has been recommended for my daughter (she is 13) . I know it might be hard to find someone, as I know therapy and counseling are crowded now, but it might be worth a shot. I am hearing a lot of ads for a service called ( maybe it would be worth looking into?\n\nYou say you have nowhere else to go, but I hope that is not true. Is there a doctor you could speak to? Some kind of health department that might be able to help you know your rights and options? I am unfamiliar with all of that, so all I can think of is keep talking to people. Call your doctor, tell them what is going on, and see where they can direct you. Or maybe your county has a sort of social services department you can try. The first place may not be the right place, but they could probably direct you on.\n\nFinally, I do not know if you have told this guy how serious this is. I mean, he may not believe you and there will not be much you can do. But if someone told me, your actions are leading me to a sort of dissociative paralysis, I would pull up and try to make some serious changes.\n\nGood luck. What an ahole. I do not have any advice other than maybe earbuds, I am sorry :/ You cannot expect other people to be silent 100% of the time, not be able to just relax and chill with friends ever etc... If I had a roommate that made me feel like i could not even EAT i would be pretty annoyed too ngl. I am not expecting him to be silent 100% of the time. I literally avoid him when he is eating. But when it is 11 at night and you are literally yelling so loud I can hear you on another story of the house, I think the problem surpasses me.", "I used to love asmr, now I cannot stand it. I swear, every video has some annoying background noise or someone is stomach rumbling. It makes me see red. I honestly think I went too hard into asmr and now it does the exact opposite of relax me.\n\nNot to mention asmr honestly seems to make people fucking stupid, and stupidity just pisses me off. I like a lot of ASMR, like sand cutting. But when people start like popping gum or licking their lips into a microphone, I am like nah bro, so I just avoid it now. Sand cutting? Sounds interesting, I will check it out. Yeah, there is a bunch on Instagram! If you cannot find any, let me know and I will send some profiles your way. Yeah, there is a bunch on Instagram! If you cannot find any, let me know and I will send some profiles your way. I hate instagram's interface, I am sure there are plenty on YT. What do you mean that it makes people stupid? I love ASMR, it is extremely relaxing to me. I listen exclusively to Gibi ASMR. I could put on my headphones and just stare at a wall listening to her for hours. Though I can totally get why lots of people do not like it especially if they have misophonia. I hate asmr eating sounds it makes me feel like I am going to explode. Lip smacking, mouth sounds is the death of me . In some videos where asmr artists talk , somehow their microphone is so sensitive, so the sound of them talking (like the tongue clucking  \"myak\" sound before every word they say) it multiplies that feeling tenfold. But I found  different, I do not get irrationally angry listening to her talk, unlike most asmrists I know of.  That made me feel so good listening to her.", "Misophonia with family that does not care Hey. So I experience misophonia with sounds that I regularly experience, so most of my triggers are with my family. The main one is chewing, which makes meals together unbearable. I can usually mask their sounds by constantly chewing fast, which means I have to eat fast and finish my meal quickly, leaving me exposed to unmasked sounds for the remainder of the meal. I try to escape this by leaving early, and this does not sit well with my parents. I try to tell them their eating triggers me but they brush it off. It all came to a head today when it got so bad I tried to leave, and my dad forbid me from going to my room. I tried to stand over at the sink, explaining that their chewing really upsets me, and my dad shouted at me saying I am rude and criticising how I eat fast, looking down (seeing them chew is another trigger) and bolting off to my room. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? Should I save myself the torture and risk my dad's anger by trying to leave meals quickly; or should I grit it out to appease him? It really is torture, and I do not know how to explain to them how bad it is. Today I said stuff like \"I know this might come off as rude, and it is not directed at you personally, but I get really upset when I hear chewing sounds, so I would prefer to avoid that.\" How can I make them understand if they do not accept something as simple as that? I am so sorry you have to go through. The truth is, people who do not want to understand it, will never understand it. If you cannot handle it, then go. What do you prefer, getting yelled at or having to hear those disgusting sounds. I know what I would choose. No matter how much evidence you are going to show them, they are not going to believe it. Or at least most of them. \n\nYou can maybe explain it like physical pain, for example having immense earpain or a headache when hearing those sounds. Maybe then they can sympathise with you. I wish you the best of luck, do not forget that you are not alone in this. Would they be willing to watch some or all of Quiet Please? That helped my family and friends understand much better. My mom and brother said they had no idea it was as bad as it is after 30 years of me having the issue. Can relate, my parents also get mad when i tell them i hate the sounds they make, non-misophonic people dont understand misophonia at all.\n\nTelling my parents doesnt help it, so im trying to learn meditation Same thing here. Im a female with long hair that covers my ears so I put in ear buds (any type) and play light rain sounds to mask out the surrounding noises, but i can still hear conversation. This helps me tremendously. Just leave.", "According to my mom, my reaction to chewing is just my \"bratty\" behavior. A few days ago my family were all eating at the table, and I came downstairs after having a mini breakdown from my mother's talking with mouth full (ironic how she says to have good manners). I started frowning from disgust a bit and then you know what happened. Later, I tried telling my mom search up \"I do not like chewing\" on YouTube and on other websites but she REFUSED. And instead of doing that, she decides to say how I just searched up on the web and thought I was suffering from that, when really it is just my \"bratty\" behavior. That made me EXTREMELY mad, and the fact that she has a problem with her teeth yet my disorder is \"bratty\" behavior. Because I could tell her that her complaining about her teeth is just so that people can feel bad for her (true). Also yes I did search up on the web about my behavior, but I actually LOOKED into the symptoms of Misophonia before making a conclusion. The next day my brother told me to just \"ignore\" the chewing, yeah right as if it is sooooooo easy! \n\nConclusion: My parents were NOT prepared to raise children with disabilities, disorders, etc.\n\nTL;DR: Instead of searching up my symptoms on the web, my mom claims how my Misophonia is just my \"bratty behavior\" Sounds like she is gaslighting you Oh yea, if I was her child, then my literal cramps in neck from hearing trigger sounds and involuntarily looking like I have tourette syndrome are also just being rude or bratty behaviour. \n\nI wonder how acceptable it would be for her if you kept scratching on chalkboard with nails each time she tried to socialize. I feel your stress. My mum gets angry when I point out her loud noises and politely ask her to stop. She does not call me bratty but she does get really defensive. I now just stay away from my family when everyone is eating and eat my own meals in my own room. Which sucks because I miss family meal times but my misophonia has gotten so bad from being stuck in doors for 9 months because of lockdown! Sorry this almost turned into a bit of a venting session haha but basically just wanted to let you know that I completely understand your frustration and it is not nice when people do not try to understand or help (especially when it is our own parents!) She may be doing this on purpose as a power play against you.", "Avoiding seeing my new house out of fear of neighbor noise! Title. Just bought a house and we r getting keys tonight. It is closer to neighbors than I would like but could not afford the half a million to be spaced to my liking. I am deathly afraid of dogs barking nearby, car doors, voices, traffic etc. I am basically too scared to tour my new house. We do not move in for another week.\nI am paranoid I will hate it because of the closeness of neighbors and associated sounds. I have already started looking at white noise generators. Any advice or just basic support out there?\nMy biggest triggers are ppl clearing their throats or coughing but pretty much also any random loud unanticipated sounds... You did not tour before you moved in? Virtual tour (Covid) and the rest my wife pretty much took care of. Too late now, but rural living is where it is at. I do not understand why misophonia sufferers live in close quarters and in apartment complexes and such. I live decently far outside of town, I have a river, several acres, a huge house (3000sqft) and the next house is about 80 yards away. \n\nWe have a small city about 25 minutes away and can be in NYC in just over 2 hours. \n\nWe paid around 200k for the house and property. 80 yards is 73.15 meters", "Music is my passion, but misophonia getting worse A couple years ago, I began to hate buzzing. Buzzing is a pretty normal sound to hate and I rarely heard it day-to-day, so I did not really pay it any attention. As of this year, I began to hate electric guitar sounds (especially with distortion) because I would hear buzzing. So I stopped listening to music with guitar in it; but that was fine because I was not really into rock anyway.. Now I cannot ignore this anymore. It is gotten so much worse in the past few months, I cannot listen to certain synths anymore without having an immediate, disgusted reaction to the \"buzzy\" noise that my ear picks up on. It is becoming harder and harder for me to make music, especially because I make EDM (synths are a fundamental part!). I am afraid my dreams of being a producer will be ruined by this stupid aversion to buzzing sounds. Just curious, have you ever noticed a difference between mono and stereo buzzing? Maybe try some type of channel filter or an eq to target the frequencies that create the buzzing. I am also into music production, so i am trying to think if ways you could get around it. Will post more info if i find other methods. I am able to tolerate stereo noise in general far better than mono noise because it is spread out I found a solution! Yesterday night I put an air filter in my room and it creates a white noise sound. Coincidentally, the white noise seems to dull the frequencies that my brain cannot handle when I am listening to or making music (even though I wear headphones). My discomfort is completely gone and I am able to make music again! The noise is very thick/warm sounding, I am sure you can find a replica on youtube. It is crazy how the brain works. Would love to know the science behind why I am no longer hearing the buzzing.", "Lithium carbonate helps with violent/self-destructive thoughts, agitation Just wanted to let you guys know my lithium prescription has helped prevent self-harm due to stress and misophonia. The misophonia is definitely still there, but I do not feel the need to be violent. I would recommend asking your psychiatrist about it if anxiety/stress from misophonia or sensory issues is making you want to self-harm, etc.  \n\nEfficacy seems to be decreasing each day that I take it, so not sure if I will need a higher dose (and I will need my blood checked every 2 weeks, unfortunately), but I think it works in part by slowing down the 'excitatory' system in my brain. Instead of wanting to get violent when I have sensory issues, I am now like \"oh, I notice this going on around me, but do not feel like reacting to it\".\n\nThought I would put this on Reddit in case it helps someone.

Desperate for help Hi, ive been using weed to help take the edge off for the last 4/5 years probably. I recently quit (over 2 weeks now) because my habit was becoming out of control and i was smoking all day and spending loads each month.\n\n This last week or so my misophonia feels like the worst its ever been.

The biggest downside is when misophonia affects me at work. I hate not being able to focus on my work and being stuck in a triggering environment for 8 hours a day. Not every job I have had has been bad, but a few have, particularly when I have worked in labs or offices. I have a Biology degree and most of my experience has been working in labs, so those are the highest paying jobs I can get. I just got a new job that I start in a few weeks, and I am nervous as hell. I have no idea what my work environment will be like, how many people I will be working around, etc. What if I start my first day and my coworkers make triggering noises? What if there is not enough background/white noise to drown my it triggers?

For example my mom, when she talks, her \u201cs\u201d sounds are extremely piercing and loud and this is only emphasised with music/white noise. \n\nI cannot live like this much longer. I never have a good day, I am never not on the verge of rage induced tears, or feeling uncomfortably overheated and miserable. Just looking at my moms face (moving - licking lips, biting lip, smiling etc.) from a distance can start to trigger me. I have tried asking her to try her best to stop making unnecessary noises that CAN be helped, but she always has excuses as to why she cannot help it - I am old, I am tired etc.  Yet she acts like a kicked puppy when I am distressed by these noises, asking if it is her who is bothering me. I just feel pretty defeated at this point, but it will probably get better with age and once I move out. Hopefully.

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/misophoniasupport) if you have any questions or concerns.* I have similar experience. i think some people can get unsad if its not alone. so here I go.\n\nFor me it is gotten hard to do anything too. If I am not home alone I cannot hear because tv in other room is my main trigger. I make pink noise at the higher volume to which I cannot hear as much as possible, that being that I can hear nothing.\n\nSo when a tv is on, which is whenever someone else is here, I cannot have my friend over, bc who wants to try to communicate to a deaf person, which sucks because I only have 1friend, watch youtube videos without subtitles, making it very boring a lot of the time, listen to music, beatbox(i have since gotten worse and worse because of this stupid disorder, I can basically just do a liproll now), record videos, this is because it stops the pink noise from my phone.\n\nI used to use an app called Donnin Audio Editor to play pink noise while doing anything because it does not stop that app, but it does not work like that on this phone. It makes it too quiet.\n\nI cannot skate with my friend, which this was the only thing keeping our friendship together. This is because of people playing music at their house. And just thinking about it I want to kill the word music. It is so peaceful word for what it does to me. I hate it so much I just want to kill it and I will some day. I will use my hands or a knife maybe.\n\nwell I hope you do not evolve for bad coping mechanism like me. I do not cope with it i just do stuff to make it feel better when it is bad. but it isnt drugs. similarly. You say you have had this since you were 8, but have you had a doctor check your health to see if they find a cause? Being 15 means your brain is changing rapidly so even if you were checked before you may have enough symptoms to finally get a diagnosis by now.", "like a switch it is incredible, just hearing these noises makes me instantly start shaking and crying. sends me straight into panic mode. it is hard to believe i am human sometimes \u2013 i feel so weak. i need better coping mechanisms, but i just feel so defeated all the time. i am finally going to looking into those fancy earplugs and stuff tho.\n\nwell, since i am already here, i will just keep going.\nit really sucks that i allow myself to start associating people with the sounds they \u2013 apparently \u2013 involuntarily make. it makes me feel such incredible guilt for my feelings. it is hard to put into words. i guess it is basically what i already said, i feel defeated. woe! woe i tell you!\nalso, in case some poor soul actually read this, i am so sorry. i am done here now. good day.

I got that friend request when I was shopping somewhere with my community hab worker.\n\nI also got an email saying someone tried to access my paypal account yesterday. I think it is the same person that got into one of my accounts online before.

You can get larger places, often an entire house for less than the price of an apartment in a city or suburban area. Please do not take internet strangers\u2019 idiocy personally. We all know the internet is a toxic place a lot of the time, and everyone has to deal with it. Good luck though", "Classmates decide it is funny to chew loudly to trigger me So we were in class and we just had a lunch break. You know, to eat? Anyway, this one student (and by the way, most of my class knows about this because I just cannot handle my reactions sometimes, giving dirty looks..) decides to eat something crunchy af and the teacher does not even say anything. I look at him with like \u201ctf is you serious??\u201d And you know what they do? Yeahhh start munching harder and laughing. \n\nI got up, went somewhere else, cried for half an hour and said to the teacher that I was not feeling well and went home. Because I was wayy too anxious that in the following lessons, they would do the same. And I do not have the mental capacity to handle that. I am so sad, I am still tearing up as I write this. Why cannot people be more considerate? Why cannot they put themselves in other peoples shoes? I know this is not well known and I understand if you do not get it, but why fuel it? I truly hate this world, I am already clinging onto life with a rope as tiny as a hair. Beennnnn thereeeee 10000000x. I feel you!!\n\nPeople are fucking ridiculous. The good thing is when you are an adult you can just cut cruel people out of your life bc who needs that! So it gets better in that respect. I know how much this can hurt sometimes, especially when you are still in school. But I think the most important part of living with misophonia is to try to be able to control yourself and your anger. The worst part of having misophonia is definitely during school, having to sit in class so close to other people. The only advice I can really give is to bite through it and use whatever tricks you can to minimise your pain. Just please do not do anything stupid, you will get through it and you will have a thicker skin in the end.\n\nAlso, that guy either did not understand or was just a dick. If it is the latter, try to give the bugger the least of a reaction that you can. Thank you so much, it is good to know that there are people like me in this world. And I can control it to some extent, the most I will probably do is give them a nasty stare for a couple of seconds. I am trying to hold that back too but it is like a reflex. I also get tics when replaying some triggers, I have never had that before. Do you have that too? \n\nAnd yup I know I should not give them any attention as I am very good at ignoring people, except with misophonia unfortunately Thank youuu, sometimes I feel like smacking their soul out of them. You would think that most are now starting to grow up and not act like a child anymore. Age has literally no value, experience does. That is what I have learned over the years. And you are right, but I am still going to go to university for quite a long time (that is if I can make it lol, I cannot even find the motivation to do anything) and I am afraid it is going to get worse there Oh I know how you feel: i have been in the exact same situations before. The best thing to do for me is to genuinely just go away, get headphones that are noise canceling, etc. Also only tell close friends about misophonia, other people are not going to care and are almost always assholes about it I think it is important to ensure that you do your best to keep others from discovering it. That person may have been a jerk but ultimately people who are not doing it to antagonize are not really doing anything wrong and they do not necessarily need to change or stop what they are doing.\n\nI recommend seeking therapy and doing some research on self-soothing techniques. They do not fix it overnight but if you keep practicing them you will notice a difference over time.\n\nI have had my fair share of hardship dealing with this condition. You deserve to be happy and I wish you the very best.\n\nKind regards It is difficult to wear headphones in class, I usually do that in other situations. And I have kept it a secret for a year but it just got so much worse. I did not even want to tell my close friends cuz they would not understand either but I am really at my limit I really wanted to keep it a secret from everyone and I did for a year, but it got a lot worse. And I perfectly understand that people should not adapt to me, they can do what they want. I am not asking that. I am just saying that first of all, eating in class is not even allowed, and second of all, you can do that without purposefully irritating me. \n\nThank you so much for writing this and I hope you are doing better now. I hope I will be able to find my happiness back one day That is bullying. I suggest you go to the guidance counselor and initiate getting switched out of that class. That sucks a lot. Do you have anything that can help you deal with stress? Misophonia gets a lot worse when you are stressed, so if you can reduce stress in general, then misophonia becomes easier to deal with I do not know what helps me\u2026.I am Already a very anxious person when it comes to presentations or school in general. And some days I feel like I am floating, like I am in a dream. I have noticed that my misophonia is worse but it is an annoying cycle: I get anxious if there is a possibility that someone is making noises, I get more anxious, I hyperfixate on the soud without wanting to, and then get more anxious\u2026.\n\nDo you have any advice on how I can calm down that stress? Because I have not found anything that works I am not a professional but I can tell you, based on my experience, I wholeheartedly disagree with what that person said. \n\nCompounding the stress of everything that comes with misophonia AND a \u201csecret\u201d that you must protect or else people will take advantage of you will only exacerbate misophonia. Remember, more stress = less ability to handle triggers.\n\nYour post said \u201cventing\u201d so I did not give you advice in my other comment, but this has made my life livable again:\n\nLet everyone know about it (in an appropriate context). For example: if someone is chewing obnoxiously or sniffing a bunch or something, let them know you suffer from misophonia and briefly explain what that is. Offer to get them a tissue. Ask them to chew with their mouth closed etc. If they continue or do that thing where they do it MORE and laugh, hit them with this: \u201cwow.... I just shared something kind of vulnerable and you are throwing it back in my face and tormenting me with it? That is really cruel. I would never do that to you.\u201d Say it in a disappointed tone in front of everyone. Fuck it. Make them feel stupid because they ARE being stupid. There will be assholes that get defensive, but most people are like \u201coh shit sorry dude.\u201d \n\nNo shame in this shit. Misophonia is already so isolating. Do not burden yourself with a secret too. That is true, last year I kept it a secret and it really stressed me out. Part of the reason that I did not do it this year is because it got worse, but I also said \u201cfuck it, I am the one suffering, not them. So why make an effort to keep it a secret?\u201d I had already accepted that no one would ever understand it. Because even my best friends said I was overreacting or they just forgot about it almost immediately. I do not blame them but I expected more from them as they are my best of friends. But I have learned that everyone is so selfish, no matter how much you befriend someone. \n\nI just did not care about keeping it a secret anymore, but I also really hate talking about it with others. Because usually when I talk about it or want to explain it, I get really teary. And I like to keep my image of this emotionless person. I really hate taking about my weaknesses, and I feel really guilty when I do so. My friends technically do not know anything about me because I just cannot open up. But I do understand why they said that it is best to keep it a secret because there are some nasty jerks who do not have any sympathy and they like making fun of other\u2019s weak points. This world is very cruel Well, dealing with stress is a bit complex, because it is different for everybody. I really like art, so I try to draw whenever I feel stressed (also whenever I am stressed, my hands get \u2018nervous\u2019 so I give them something to do then). Or listening to music, that helps me too. All of these things are hard to do during school, so I try to do them whenever I can and as much as possible, so I am already less stressed when going into situations where people start making noises. So you could try to focus on a hobby you have, maybe \n\nI get it 10000000%. I remember feeling exactly like this for way too long. The teary explanations to people who do not appreciate the weight of what you are really unloading, the \u201cfriends\u201d who do not take it seriously... the repressed emotions in an attempt to be this strong unemotional front... I resonate with all of this. \n\nIt is easier said than done, but I feel like I really became that badass I was pretending to be when I just accepted that I am emotional and I am willing to admit it. It is HARD in the moment to confront someone about their cruelty openly and cooly - but it makes your life so much better in the long run. It is easier in the moment to grind your teeth, repress your emotions, go cry and pull your hair out in the bathroom but it is awful for your mental and physical health.\n\nI think people like us are simply \u201cdoomed\u201d to have less friends than the average person, but the friends we do have are considerate, thoughtful, and QUALITY people. You know... the kind of people who do not say shit like \u201cwell if it bothers you so much, just do not listen!\u201d Okay, I like drawing too! I am going to try and do that, thank you so much! Exactly, at least we will be able to see the true colours of people immediately, not after a long time of thinking \u201cwow I did not think they would be that rude\u201d \n\nAnd you are absolutely right, I really hope that one day I will be able to embrace it. I think I am like this because a lot of people around me see crying and stuff like that as a weakness. Also because a lot of those people think that women are weaker than men and I do not want to hear comments like \u201csee, even you that was supposed to be emotionless is crying, all girls are like that\u201d I know it sounds so dumb, but I absolutely hate it. But I know that I just do not need to care\u2026 Nothing you say sounds dumb haha. I literally feel like I am talking to me when I was younger.  It all makes perfect sense to me.", "I cannot sleep because my dad is snoring in the next room what do i do  Do you have any headphones?

Now that I have been sober this thing has come back and HARD. I have to constantly clip my nails or I will have actual fear of the scraping sound. It made my life very difficult. I have to wear gloves while doing the dishes and when it comes to washing cookie tray. FORGET IT. Just the thought of the metal cookie tray rubbing on the side of my metal sink scares me. I am not typically someone who is fearful. I could walk out in the woods at night by myself and be fine. This is my only real fear (besides roosters...long story) I am aware that it is irrational.

Google says it gets worse without treatment...how tf does one even treat something like this.", "Video games make me nuts sometimes Excessively loud stepping/running noises drive me crazy. I hate when there is too much background noise. I am playing through the Mass Effect Legendary series and the ship sometimes makes SO much noise. Going into the menus has just like crazy bass noise like you are sitting inside a dryer, to where I am in the bathroom and I can still hear it and have to come out here and mute it. If I pause the game to make dinner or something I have to mute it because it is just like **WUBWUBWUBWUB**. Cyberpunk 2077 was really annoying because every 15 seconds when you are in any of the menus there is this stupid whistling noise. I hate it! I feel you. Do you know if those games have an option to turn the background noise? I love Animal Crossing but could not stand the background noise, thankfully there is an option to turn it off. Most games just have music, effects and dialogue volume. I have seen a couple here and there that allow you to like turn on and off footsteps and things. I also almost always turn off the game music and use my own just to avoid any repetitive crap. Yessss I immediately thought of Cyberpunk when I started reading this. My husband would have to mute it when I was even in a different story of the house.\n\nThere is also an area in Assassin\u2019s Creed where insect noise is really annoying This is why I love Zelda breath of the wild, the sound track is just so soft and peaceful paired with the game being really good that is why it is my favorite Yes! Also much more natural and little to no repetitive sounds.", "My dad's house = misophonia nightmare I used to stay at my dad's often, but after recent family events, I prefer staying with my mom in her apartment. In my dad's house, I can hear literally everything and it drives me fucking insane. I am generally a very easygoing and docile person, and I think this is the only place where I feel like I turn into some kind of devil bitch.\n\nMy dad and brother's rooms are absolutely peaceful (and warm!). Mine is ice cold and I can hear every little sound and step. My room is underneath my dad's, and he is a relatively big guy. When he walks, it is not just creaking. The floorboards sound like they are fucking SNAPPING, like wood splitting. When he tosses and turns the bed creaks so much. And he has trouble sleeping so he is always up at odd hours, I would say I have memorized what times he gets up, but the fact that he gets up at least 5-10 times in the night means 5-10 times more fucking sound. And he is always leaving the TV on when he sleeps so I hear the mumbling sounds of people talking on the news and on commercials and I want to tear my hair out. It always HAS to be someone with such a deep voice that I think I feel vibrations. He has a coughing issue too, and it is very loud and phlegmy. And I can hear it. I can also hear all of his conversations when he is on the phone and I can hear him open his bathroom door, his toilet flushing, his sink/shower running, when he drops something (seems to always be a GIANT FUCKING BOWL), etc.\n\nAnd I do not know what this means about the house, but when someone opens/shuts a door with a decent amount of strength in any part of the house, my door fucking shakes violently and it sounds like someone is shaking my doorknob. This terrified me the first few times because it reminded me of a burglar/ghost. I am pretty used to it now, but instead of getting scared I just get pissed even more sometimes.\n\nI love my privacy. But it fucking sucks when it comes with the price of having to hear everybody's business in every corner of the house. I get so annoyed that I just dip back to my mom's, where ironically (apt complex) it is a thousand times quieter. I have to blare white noise, brown noise, green noise and any other color noise to get some sleep at my dad's, and even then it fucking sucks. Because I still do not get enough sleep, I still hear him walking around and shit at 4:27 am or something and the noise does not block it out. The noise I play is not really optimal because I just want fucking 200% silence. I cannot study ever here, I cannot study with music either btw bc I lose focus.\n\nI do not bother explaining misophonia to anyone for any accommodations because who the hell believes in it lol. But oh my god I fucking hate sounds so much. I get chills all over my body and I start to itch and I fucking LOSE IT. He does not really believe in my little brother's OCD so how the fuck would he believe in this. Thanks for reading  Got To start somewhere. Mention it, tell him how it makes you feel, send him a link to a resource or something so there is some tangible evidence it is real... and ear plugs. My parent's place is a nightmare of sound too and my dad is CONSTANTLY making noise. Nasal, congestion, audible sighs that ring throughout the hallway, flatulence, murmuring and grunting to himself as he watches tv aaaallll day...\n\nOnce he made burgers, we all started eating, and he moaned so damn loud I almost threw up... I had to stop it immediately cause it was fucking gross and, to my surprise, my mom stood up for me and mentioned how certain sounds upset me. She was even visibly upset from the whole thing. \n\nMy dad does not make noises any less now that he knows, but I can at least audibly object and get some frustration out without him being completely confused/ concerned.\n\nBut yeah, playing music out loud helps (or in headphones/ ear buds obviously) when ear plugs cannot.

This is kind of long, but I  really really need some advice. \n\nI met my girlfriend in early November, and we have dating since December. I have not been in good relationships in the past, and being close to people is already hard. But she has been so supportive and the relationship is going well. I have told her about some of the heavier things in my life, as well as serious issues like my PTSD. She has been understanding through all of it. She does not know about my misophonia specifically, but I told her I had a sound sensitivity. I wear earplugs most of the time and she was chill and supportive when I showed them to her. I just have not told her my triggers. My biggest one is tongue clicking, and a lot of people do it when they speak. My girlfriend does it sometimes, but since I have my earplugs I can cope. The problem comes in when she does it to call her dog or when I hear it on the TV. When I am tired or upset it is harder to use my coping skills, and I have been hiding my outburst from her. When I get triggered I usually punch myself in the head repeatedly until the pain dulls the sound. It is not fun to watch, and it can be very disturbing. When I have been triggered around her I usually \"go to the bathroom\" and find a quiet place to hit myself and cry. I hate hiding, and I am scared I am going to get caught, which would make this super awkward. \n\nThis girl is one of the best things that has ever happened to me, and I do not want to lose her because I am crazy. I just do not know how to tell her. And worse than that, I am scared that when I tell her she will not want to be with me anymore. It may be easier to present the misophonia to her as something that is kind of tied in with your ptsd. Especially since she is already accepted the ptsd. I would still recommend you try to have your outbursts in the bathroom, since you said yourself that it is disturbing to watch. But if she knows that is why you are going to the bathroom, she will not bother you, and she may be able to provide support/comfort after. If you have been able to open up to her about some other things you are going through, I think you could take that same approach with your misophonia. She sounds really wonderful and supporting, and talking a little more openly about your triggers could maybe even benefit both of you! It could help her understand your sound sensitivity a bit more and help you through the rough times. If she is aware of your trigger sounds, she may be able to minimize how many of them she makes around you. \nI know it is hard to open up to a partner about this for fear of coming off as \"crazy,\" but I really think it is the best course of action for both parties. In my own experience, my SO has been very supportive and it is been being around him much easier because he knows not to make certain trigger noises around me. Good luck!!! Realizing I did not really address how to go about it. In my experience, it is easier to talk to people about my misophonia a bit more clearly when I am not hearing and trigger noises. That way I can express myself more clearly without being clouded by anger or exploding at them if they are making the sound. Maybe try and find when you are feeling calm, and just bring it up like \"Hey, so you know how I wear those earplugs? I actually have this thing called misophonia...\" and just explaining it from there. You got this!!! Since people often think \u201coh, sure, lots of people think chewing with your mouth open is gross/rude\u201d and then it is hard to explain that it is debilitating. I explain it using OCD as an example. Plenty of people overuse the phrase \u201cugh I am so OCD\u201d or \u201cI have such bad ocd lol\u201d, and all the while there are people who truly, medically, have severe ocd where their day is hard to get through compared to the average person. There are some good websites and articles now that do a good job explaining, so I would maybe lead with that too? Please hang in there. Thank you for your advice! I did tell her about my big triggers, and she said she would work on not making those sounds around me! I did not tell her the specifics of my breakdowns, but I did tell her that it causes me a serious amount of distress. Thanks for your help :) Thank you so much! I talked to her about it recently and using the earbuds as a segue made the conversation feel natural. She was very supportive, and she is working on not making those noises as much. I am so grateful for her, she gave me unwavering support when I felt like no one else could. Being honest with her made our relationship better, and now I am more comfortable around her. Thank you for your advice, I really appreciate it! Thank you for your help! I did take your advice and after I explained misophonia a little I showed her an article. She is studying psychology too so she understood the condition better after reading about it. She was so supportive when I told her, and I am so lucky. Thank you again :) You are welcome! I hope it continues to help you and everything is good for you and your partner Thank you so much \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c I hope you have a great day :) That is so good to hear!! It always feels like a huge weight off your chest too. I am glad she is studying psychology! We need more psychologists and therapists in the field who are aware of this condition so we can all start finding answers. Omg yes when I was talking she was just quietly listening and nodding and holding my hand. She told me that we would work through this together and that is when I started crying. She is such a kind person, and I am so glad she is going into psychology. I just know she is going to change so many lives for the better. She already changed mine. Thanks! You are welcome.

But less so with those closer to me \n\nIt really does. \n\nIf you do not mind my asking, how old were you when it kind of just.. hit you? I am not sure how else to phrase it. I was 13/14ish. I feel like it is because it feels personal. They KNOW the situation but choose to be obnoxious with their habits. Sometimes yeah it does..  I agree. Even though my mom does more than any other human would to try and avoid my triggers, she triggers me the most. Even though my brain knows she is not doing it on purpose, my misophonia tells me \"she should know better and she knows it bothers me so it is extra hurtful.\" Or something like that. I am still trying to figure it out myself. Since they are closest to us, they do it the most often. When they do it often, we get exposed to it the most often compared to other sounds. Mhm! This condition causes our brains to push the worst thoughts into our heads and there is not much we can do to stop. Because when our triggers are happening rational thought finds its way out the window. This is a different sort of answer, but I feel it could be very close to the truth.\n\nMisophonia seems to be a condition where my reaction, at a very deep level, is connected to attribution - the meanings my brain attaches to the perceived source of the noise, and what judgements I might make about said origin, and its intentions (if it is possible for it to have any; obviously a wind chime has no intentions).\n\nAt a young age, my parents taught me that chewing loudly or with an open mouth is rude, so I learned to be just a *teeny* bit offended (i.e. however offended an average person would be) by any chewing that produces sound. My brain took that little bit of information, and ran with it - harder, faster, and longer than a normal brain would. This turned loud chewing, and all gum chewing (the sight of gum, too) into my biggest triggers by FAR.\n\nI have a working theory of my own, but the gist is that thoughts that were initially voluntary, like \u201cthis person is so rude\u201d or \u201cI know THEY know that drives me insane\u201d, slowly become habitual. The negative feelings I get as a result of subconscious judgements about the sound\u2019s source eventually can occur all on their own, skipping the step where I attach meaning to the noises in my head.\n\nMy closest family have always bothered me the most too. In light of my above experience, it is for a few reasons, I think. First, I KNOW that they are fully aware of my triggers. When they trigger me anyways, my \u201cmiso brain\u201d can assign a lot more fault and negativity to the situation, probably making it more intense. Second, I know the mannerisms of my closest family and friends. After a while, so much of what they do - their cough, their footsteps - is predictable. Because of that, my brain can pretty much anticipate all the non-triggering things they will do. That way, when a trigger gets mixed in, it is so obvious, such a departure from the \u201cperfect little script without that sound\u201d I was playing through in my head, that I react more strongly.\n\nI would not be surprised if being triggered by the same person over and over again also somewhat tires the brain out. If I was triggered every 2-3 hours by the same person, I would probably have a little voodoo doll of them sitting in the back of my head 24/7, and a lot of built-up anger just waiting to be reactivated once they did whatever it was again. Strangers do not cause that problem, because everything is unpredictable, in a way.\n\nI have been working on retraining my brain to re-cast the negative or angry thoughts I have about a trigger into *plausible* positive thoughts that provoke empathy in my brain. Plausible was important to me, since it is my own brain I am trying to re-wire, and I need a non-zero probability in there for it to work. For instance, if my brother was eating loudly near me, I would try to convince the empathetic part of my brain that he would just found out yesterday his wife had metastatic cancer, and was fighting tears the whole time. A very unlikely event, but enough to trick my brain into using some alternative circuitry to process the experience.\n\nI have been trying this little technique for around 2 years now, and it is taken the intensity of my reactions to around a third what they were. That is for gum. I have actually sat down for a few meals with others - so long as they are carefully chosen, and the food item is known.\n\nSorry for the long-winded response. It is just what is helped me, and I know some experiences are totally different. No need to apologize I glad you took the time to type it all out. \n\nI am really glad that finding something to empathize with helped you so much! I will definitely give it a try next time I am near a trigger. \n\nWhile I can sit through some meals without issue (as long as I have my ear buds and the restaurant is a bit loud). I am not sure if I will ever get to the place where I could willingly sit down and eat with others even with everything known. Because even then there is that nagging voice just building my anxiety up before the meal even begins. So cudos to you!! You should be so proud of yourself and how far you have come!  My best guess is that people closest to you are your triggers because they are around For most of the time. This sounds terrible, but for me, I find myself able to actually let my anger out when lets say, my sister sniffles. All of the emotions I have to keep in during the rest of my life let loose at that moment because she is family. This condition is the worst!! I do not mind you asking :)\n\nI was about 5 years old when i started reacting to the sound (and sight) of people eating. I am almost 50 now and did not even know other people had the same thing, nor that it had a name, until i was about 30.\n\nStill waiting for therapy to start.... hopefully we can all find a way out of this sooner rather than later! I know right??? Yes! The empathy thing helps so much in situations where you cannot escape. I will think from extremes like making up a life story or simple like \u201coh they must be so hungry from having an exhausting day and did not even realize how loud they are being.\u201d\nLately even a sink of dishes being cleaned triggers me, but instead I think \u201cfocus on how sweet and nice it is that my so is just trying to help out.\u201d Yes, yes, yes!! Only the people I love bother me. And that is the cruelest part of misophonia to me.", "Misophonia is ruining my life I just had a huge fight with my mom, again.\n\n\nI know I alienate her when I ask her to please stop the noises (not going to describe them because I do not want to trigger anyone); and she gets mad, but what else can I do?!? Literally, please tell me\nSuffering in silence is unbearable, and when I hastily leave the room she also gets mad\n\n\nI have tried explaining to her again and again what it is, but I do not even think she wants to understand\n\n\nToday she absolutely blew up and told me that she cannot stand me anymore. It escalated in kind of a \"fight\" where I tried to explain once again that it was not against her personally, just the noises. I was sobbing and begging her to please understand \n\n\nShe said it offends her greatly and that I make her life hell\n\n\nI just cannot take it anymore, it makes my own life hell and now also that of my mother; which honestly I kind of knew already, but hearing it was difficult\n\n\nI have no hope for a cure and am honestly thinking of just ending it all, I do not want to keep living like this\nI have suffered for years and it just gets worse and worse, the list of triggers grows and i keep getting more sensitive to them\n\n\nSorry if this is a jumbled mess, I cannot really think clearly atm\nAnd I know I probably sound young, but I am 22 (still a student and not enough income to move out) and English is not my native language I sent you a message. Unfortunately it is against sub rules to provide any type of treatment past general coping. I have been there.  It was my motivation to move out.  Are you of age when you can move out? I think it is natural for people to get offended when you say their noises are annoying/upsetting/enraging, but your mother is being _SO_ dramatic. She is taking something that is upsetting to you and making it about her, which is just plain selfish. Without knowing her or anything outside of this post's context, i detect some hints of narcissistic tendancies. Maybe check that out to see if anything lines up and then you have some tools to cope. The r/raisedbynarcissists 'About' section had some links to get started. Yooo if you have got any treatment ideas I would love a PM too :) It is not a cobloaf though!! The only problem in life that cobloaf cannot fix! **Do not do anything or take anything without first speaking to medical professional. If we think anyone is recommending something dangerous, or attempting to scam others by offering paid treatments, you will be banned. You have been warned.**\n\n**Please be aware:** There is not any proven \"treatments\" or \"cures\" for Misophonia. We do not even have official diagnostic criteria for Misophonia. What works for one person could be dangerous and fatal for another person. Also, be cautious of scam artists (Tom Dozier and the \"Misophonia institute\", for example). If someone is offering you a guaranteed treatment or fix for Misophonia in exchange for cash, you should seriously question their motives and seek the advice of a medical professional.\n\nStay safe people.\n\nEdit: Feel free to message the mods to sort out if something falls under rule #4. We are very reasonable. You are enough exactly as you are right now. Take a breath. When you start to feel a trigger, take a deep breath and focus on your breathing. Try not to get defensive when your mother yells. Let her yell...does it really matter if you respond? Does it ever change anything? No.  Just let her yell until she runs out of steam. Then ask her if she feels better, and when she says yes, tell her you are glad because you love her. She will have no fucking idea how to respond to that. It really does not matter if she understands you or not. You know the truth. hey I would love a PM too please if you have got a decent treatment method Nah like the mod just posted, you cannot be going around with treatments. The only advice I can and will offer is going to therapy! I can tell you about my experience in therapy but that is it. I find it really unhelpful and unproductive that any time someone has a fight with their parents they are immediately directed to that sub and their parents armchair diagnosed with narcissism.\n\nWhen I lived at home as a teenager, my mother frequently triggered misophonia and misokinesia attacks in me, and I in turn stressed her out with my reactions. I understood way too late that her messing with her hair was a soothing behaviour, and that having me interrupt and criticise her for it only increased her own stress. If I kept this up and extended it to other sounds and movements she made, it would have been a matter of time until our relationship went up in flames, *and not because she is a \u201cnarcissist\u201d.* \n\nWe all have our own issues to work through and burdens to bear. It is unfair to expect unquestioning support and accommodation for our misophonia, while not affording similar consideration to those around us and their own quirks.", "Triggers trigger me more when it is first thing in the morning  I have noticed this, I think it goes back to what I have observed in myself the last few years \u2014 the more tired, hungry, dehydrated, emotionally exhausted etc. I am, the worse I get triggered. Yeah, I guess it is like if something is already irritating the hell out of you that is just going to pile on to it.", "Very close to giving up After years of trying to convince those around me that I cannot \"just ignore\" triggering noises and being told that all of this is \"entirely my fault\", I finally managed to get help from a therapist. After about half an hour of talking I was told that it is very likely I will not receive any help due to misophonia being very uncommon and the fact I am at low risk of self harm or suicide (which to be honest is becoming less and less true by the day). I cannot think of anything else I could do to convince people that this is serious and I am thinking of just giving up trying at this point. Anyone else had an experience like this with a therapist, and what did you do? Thanks. I do not think it is \"very uncommon.\" Regardless, there are researchers and professionals out there who empathize with this condition \u2014 some even have it themselves \u2014 people who would at least take you seriously and try things to help. Is this the first care provider you have spoken with about misophonia? First, if you are really thinking of harming yourself, please call 1-800-273-8255. That is the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. You can also ( and chat with someone online.\n\nI am really sorry you are dealing with this with not a lot of support.\n\nNext, frustrating as it probably is, you should try to find another therapist.  I do not buy that it is \"very likely\" you will not get help -- there are a lot of therapists out there and there may not be many who specialize in misophonia, but there are some who could help.\n\nFor what it is worth, anxiety seems to play a part in misophonia. If you have anxiety issues, perhaps you could tell a therapist about that. My daughter seems to have both anxiety and misophonia, and we found one who will use a cognitive behavioral therapy approach. Alright, I will see if I can try that. Thank you! Tell your therapist I said they are a dick! I went to an OCD therapist and that really helped, I would suggest looking into that type of therapy! Maybe would not go that far haha, she seems really lovely but obviously just does not know much about misophonia to take it seriously at all. It is yeah, it just feels a real kick while I am down to finally get some help and be told it is likely I will not get any help after all. Alright, thanks! That is a very understandable reaction! But also, this person clearly does not know anything about misophonia, including your treatment options, because that is just not true. Just off the top of my head there are people working on this in behavior science, hypnotherapy, occupational therapy, emdr, eft/tapping, ocd treatment, somatic experiencing, polyvagal techniques, audiology, pharmacology... I am not suggesting that all of these avenues will prove helpful to you; some people find them helpful and some do not, but at least there are possibilities to explore and people who care enough about this problem to have made it their life's work. If you need help finding someone who is familiar with misophonia, I would be happy to share the resource list I have been compiling with you. What kind of therapist did you see?  Just a regular \"talk to me about your feelings\" therapist, other than venting about misophonia related frustrations, is not going to be able to help with much here.  A specialized kind of therapist might be able to help.  Maybe DBT or something like that?  I once went through a stint of occupational therapy and they had me listen to this very particular classical music that was supposed to over time kind of train my brain into responding to sound better.  It did make a difference for a while.  Not permanently, but it did make things better for long enough that it mattered.  It was all about sensory response training.\n\nPeople did not believe me or take me seriously for the first 17 or 18 years of my life either until misophonia got published about in the NY times and publicly given a name.  After that, I mean, it is still hard to get people to understand, but that is where the good progress started.  I just try to explain the difference to people as best as I can, and even though I do not necessarily believe this next part I say it anyway to try to relate to them better, by saying something along the lines of \"I know how ridiculous it sounds and I know you would not normally notice something like this... yadda yadda... I get that it is weird to you but it is real to me so please just try to have a little sympathy and help me out\".\n\nOther than that, what has always seemed to help the most is sharing content.  People who do not believe me or do not get it, I can point them in the direction of that NY times article, or a clip from when Kelly Rippa talked about it, or any number of memes briefly documenting the experience, or I think there is a buzzfeed video out there of someone yelling at her friend chewing with her mouth open.  Anything like that.  I will share a piece of media that can explain it better than I can.  OMG!  Like, ask anyone if they have seen \"A Quiet Place\" because SPOILER WARNING FOR THE MOVIE, I feel like when those monsters hear the ringing from the daughter's hearing aid and flip out, that is EXACTLY what having misophonia feels like during a trigger sound to me.\n\nAlso being able to explain to those around you who do not get it that it is not actually to do with your hearing, like, your ears most likely average, it is a mental issue.  It is the way our brains process hearing these sounds that should just disappear into the background... it is a brain issue.  Clarifying that difference has helped me get people to come around too.\n\nI have little misophonia printout taped to the back of my computer at work to prompt people to ask me about it and that has worked a couple of times.\n\nLastly I would say try to find someone or someplace around you that maybe has some kind of department that is studying misophonia?  A doctor who is at least heard of it.  Look up hearing specialists and ENTs and hospital research departments and medical college research departments and maybe you can just call or email and be like \"does anyone there know anything about this?\" and if they do then maybe you can see them and they can provide you with resources and perhaps even a doctor's note that you can keep on file that basically states \"Hey, this is real, take this person seriously when they say they have it and need help with it\".  If you need a private office at work or to take a test in a separate room at school or something like that, just having a doctor's note that says \"yo, this is legit\" can help a lot!\n\nBest of luck. I agree.  \"Well you are not harming yourself so clearly this is not real\" is basically what it seems like they told you.  That is very irresponsible therapizing!  Misophonia can ABSOLUTELY drive people to that point. Two things. First, either ask that therapist to elaborate on whether they think they could help you or ditch them. Find a different therapist that actually gives you some hope. Also, go to an audiologist. They can give you sound generators (hearing aids that play white noise), and it should help people around you understand that this is a real medical condition. \n\nSecond, it sounds like you have lost hope of your misophonia getting better. I was in the exact same mindset until I read \"Understanding Misophonia: a Conditioned Aversive Reflex Disorder\" by Dozier. I was astonished at the number of possible treatments there were that genuinely helped other sufferers. The book is a little outdated, but has lots of good information and definitely restored my hope.", "Tinnitus anyone  I mean, I would rather hear ringing than people eating. :/ I have tinnitus too, and honestly, I thought everyone had ringing in their ears until I was about 20. If it is really loud I can see how that would be bothersome though. I have never been bothered by mine. True, it flares big time especially if i am tired or anxious, the times I really cba with it the most. Hell yeah! I just learned a few days ago that not everyone has constant ringing in their ears.

Coincidentally that is the one I just picked one up. Right now I keep my fan + \"dreamegg\" on 24/7 and it works surprisingly well. Dreamegg has several different white/pink/brown noises. Honestly the fan probably does most of the work but since I got the white noise machine I have been triggered a lot less, not sure if it is mixing lower/higher sounds to block out more, or just placebo. Good luck! I was planning to leave on 24/7 as well. I ordered this one, too. Thank u for post. I have had one of ( for 18 years since I was a baby and it works like a charm. I have an older version from 2002 that looks very similar and was before this current brand bought the model from Brookstone. I highly recommend it. It is not wireless which is the only downside but it is still amazing and I sleep with it every night and turn it on to drown out noises from all over. Thx. Makes sense. I do not feel as crazy for thinking two may be better... I have ordered the dream egg and the Dohm sounds like a fan (which I thought could be a bit louder but I only plugged it in for a minute and have not tested yet) so a combination may work perfectly. I use the Honeywell HPA300. It is not necessarily made for noise cancellation, but it has three settings and a \u2018Turbo\u2019 button lol.

How do i stop it? Plz read the whole thing ..... \nSo it started a few years ago i started to get mildly irritated due to chewing by others.And at that time it was manageable. Then my mum got her wisdom teeth removed and after that she started chewing a lot more \"disgustingly \" if i may(im not saying mu mum is bad) and while i was still able to tolerate it , it has started to become a major problem in last year. Whenever i see her eating anything my focus instantly goes to her chewing and that really liquidy sound of food getting \"chewed \"(i getting shivers even writing it).Now whenever she eats i have to go to another room and focus on something else really hard or get under a thick blanket and still if if dont keep moving my head to make sounds near my year i can still hear it. Whenever she eats i get really angry and angry to a point where i once punched my own ear so very hard that it hurt for a few days. I become extremely violent when she chews. And now its spreading. When my dad eats he has a habit of snorting and he also chews with mouth open and that also is starting to drive me mad. And at least my sibling stopped doing it but now i hear sounds from even inside her mouth when she eats and i know she cant do anything about it since even i make those sounds when i eat and it still makes me uncomfortable when she does it, i feel like a hypocrite. Is this misophonia?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do i cure it, Im still 16 i dont want to become a psychopathic asshole in my life. And while my parents are supportive they think that im just over reacting and while my dad still tries to control it when i point it at the dining table but he tends to forget it the next day and mum  cant do it cuz she has some jaw problems i dunno...  Also they sometimes get angry if i end up reacting offensively. Is there a way to cure it ? I cant ask them to give me fancy headphones for this. Also i end up saying wrong things sometimes when i am irritated by the sound that hurt them. Like recently when my mum started eating something i visually reacted she asked me to go in another room, i got angry and ended up saying that she deliberately was eating in front of me which was not the case..... How do i cure it?? plz help As of now, there is no cure. Try earplugs. They have helped me in some situations. hah, i wish i could stop it too From what I have read white noise therapy is the best way to slow it or even prevent it from getting worse. It is believed that those with Misophonia either have trouble creating white noise or cannot produce it at all (By produce white noise I mean convert the sound of that which surrounds you into background noise).  So I would suggest meeting with a specialist who deals with Misophonia and perhaps they can give you more details. I have had some doctors suggest hearing-aid-like devices that consistently produce white noise. This has supposedly helped many people. Personally I just use noice cancelling ear buds and play white noise or music whenever I am in public. Best of luck and never forget that you are not alone with this condition. First off, try taking a deep, calming breath. You are not an asshole, and you are not making anything up. Misophonia is a real condition. Unfortunately there is not a cure, but you can work to manage and cope.\n\nFWIW, this does sound like misophonia. My daughter has been exhibiting similar symptoms for the last few months. Misophonia is kind of new, but seems to have some relationship or correlation to anxiety, and I know my daughter has some anxiety issues. She is 13 and the start of this school year has been rough.\n\nHere are a couple of articles to give you some info:\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n There is more info at that site, I hope some of it helps.\n\nFor quick relief, if you can, get some noise-canceling earphones or headphones. My daughter is triggered by eating sounds, and she wears the headphones at meals and listens to brown noise. There is a rainbow of noises -- white, brown, pink, purple and probably more -- and she says brown noise works better than white for drowning out those noises. Another color of noise might work better for you.\n\nIf you need help at night, look into sleepphones. I have ( They are not noise-canceling but they fit snugly.\n\nThere is help, and I hope you can find it. As all of you use told that there is no cure to this I will try to check out the headphone thingies all of you have mentioned. Thanks for the advice This sounds a lot like my misophonia. I talk to a counselor on the Better Help app, they are not necessarily trained to treat misophonia but they can help with coping skills, anger management and stuff like that", "No Triggering Words in Titles *Is* a Rule. Support Each Other, Respect Symtoms You Do not Have.  There was a post by a community member expressing concern about triggering words in titles. For a community with the word \"support\" in it, I was appaled to see people breaking the number one rule: be kind to each other.\n\nBeing triggered by words associated with triggers *is* a symptom of severe misophonia. If you are going to insult that, get off this page please. What happens if triggers are dropped in the text though (rather than title)? they would still be triggering.\n\nI understand where you are coming from but I do not quite get how this is not counterproductive to venting, asking for advice or trying to relate to others. \nI am just afraid it would make this &amp; r/misophonia subreddits complicated &amp; heavily censored.\n\nMaybe we need a new flair? Like trigger naming or something Hey, so I am the mod that wrote that rule back in the day, hopefully I can clear a few things up. \n\nI made the distinction between post body and title because we have the \"trigger warning\" flair and the spoiler mechanism to hide the post body if it contains something triggering. My intention there was to prevent people, me included, from casually scrolling through the feed and seeing some abrasive onomatopoeia in the post title. I am not going to write an example here of course because that would not make sense. \n\nWhen I wrote this rule, it was not to prevent people from venting if they want to. I was trying to make a compromise between people that do not want to see that in textual form, and people who do not mind. \n\nI guess my thoughts are, if I click on something that has the \"trigger warning\" flair and get triggered, that is more or less my fault. But if I just scroll by something in the post title, then that could have been avoided. \n\nI agree though, I do not want to steer people away from venting in whatever way they want. So, I do not see us putting in a rule to remove onomatopoeias in post body. Is this vagueing about my comment earlier saying I do not think it is unreasonable to expect people to be discussing triggers in their posts lol? \n\nEither way, I agree with the comment above re: introducing flairs. I still do not think it is super realistic to expect people to avoid talking about their triggers in the titles of posts in a vent sub but a TW flair would help mitigate some of it. Nah, this is not about you, sorry you thought it was! People should be able to talk about their triggers. Mention they are talking about it in the title, flair it with a trigger warning, just do not put the word in the title. Gen question, is there a situation the trigger needs to be in the title? I generally read every post, but sometimes I miss them. Can you report or DM me the posts that you are talking about? \n\nI am a little confused with this whole thing because I did not see any posts breaking this rule. Exactly! It can mention there is triggers in the title, a flair would be useful, but there is no need to name the trigger in the title. The post can still be about it, and those wishing to avoid it can. Oh phew lol. Weird coincidence ! \n\nI think that it is more that, without the trigger in the title, would not pretty much every title be something like \u2018Do not you hate it when someone \u2019? Like I feel because of the nature of this affliction, it is pretty much always going to be about one trigger or another. I am having a hard time imagining what an effective TW system for titles would be when everything is about the triggers, you know? \n\nI dunno if this makes any sense, today is not an articulate day :( You say that it is a rule, yet I have seen countless posts with triggering words in the title that are *not* being taken down. The mods need to up their game on this. Hey, I am a bit confused by this because I read every post as best I can and have not seen any posts with triggering onomatopeias in the post title.\n\nCan you report or DM me the posts you are talking about please?", "Product designer looking to talk to people with misophonia or hearing reduction Morning!   \n\n\nI am a product designer at a hearing wellness startup and I would love to speak to a few people about a new feature we are building.

In general, I stress over anything and everything, and it is pretty crap because of how frequently I cry in class and nobody really knows how to fix me.\n\nFor the past few days (maybe a week or two), I have noticed that my misophonia has been causing me more problems than everything else. I have had strong feelings of anger towards specific noises for two years, but back then it was not as bad as it was now. Back then, it was just a few noises that would irritate me, and when I would tell person to stop, they did. Back then, I did not feel like murdering the person who was making the sounds. Back then, I did not end up in tears once every week. \n\nNow, however, it is just been getting worse and worse. Classmates would make these noises that I hate having to listen to, and when I would ask them to stop, they would still continue. One of my friends does it a lot when I am sitting next to her, and even she has continued doing it when I tried to make her stop. And the fact that they do movements that freak me out does not help either. I hate having to watch them do these things that irritate me so much, just because they are in my field of view and they do not bother listening to me. It is gotten to the point where it completely overwhelms me, and I break down crying. \n\nI have a temporary solution to hearing these noises, and I think others will have the same thing or something similar: music. Whenever I can, I plug my earphones into my ears and play music on my phone - I have collected a lot over a few months. A lot of it is helpful at blocking out the surrounding noise, and most of the time it helps me relax when things become too much. My friends, though, think I should not use my earphones every day or that I should at least turn my volume down as I play my music pretty loudly. I cannot just do that. The songs I listen to are really special, I guess.\n\nThe reason why I call it a temporary solution is because I was informed that listening to music actually makes misophonia worse. A quick Google search will direct you to hearingcenterdallas.com, where they state, \"Blocking out sound actually makes the misophonia worse. The trigger sounds become much more intrusive - perhaps even more trigger sounds develop - and earplugs are worn more frequently.\" Knowing this, I do not really know if I should continue using music as a way to cope. The sounds, as I have mentioned before, have actually became worse, and I think this is the reason why.\n\nI have explained this to my father. He is told me that I definitely need help with what I am going through, and has recommended that I should get noise-cancelling headphones. My mother, however, thinks otherwise, and believes that they would be unnecessary. She has more power than my father, and so the decision is up to her. She refuses to buy them for me. Honestly, I think the headphones would actually help me more, as I have worn them before and I really do think they could help me in my situation. Hell, I might even get permission to wear them in class if it ever gets to that. She does not want me to have them though, and I do not know why, so I am still going to suffer anyway.\n\nSo, ultimately, I have no way out of this situation. If I keep using music as a way to deal with it, it will just keep getting worse and worse. If I keep having to deal with the sounds, I am going to have to prepare myself for many more crying sessions. I know that if this keeps going, I am going to start being afraid of the people around me and be even more afraid of school itself. I have no idea what I am supposed to do.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk. &gt;\"Blocking out sound actually makes the misophonia worse. The trigger sounds become much more intrusive - perhaps even more trigger sounds develop - and earplugs are worn more frequently\"\n\nI am not sure I agree with this statement. I do not think any actual lab research has been done on this particular point, so this statement might be based off of the experiences of a handful of individuals who may or may not have been in a controlled environment and who knows what other factors were involved. I would recommend you exercise caution when researching Misophonia as there is a lot of misinformation out there that has no actual lab testing to back up the information; some of them are actual scams. \n\nPersonally, I use headphones all day everyday. I work in an open office and without them I would probably die, they are a fact of my life. I have used them since I started this job 3 years ago - **my Misophonia has not gotten any worse in that period of consistent use of headphones.** \n\nFor me, what makes my Misophonia worse is refusing to calm down after I experience a trigger. As soon as I got into meditating and learning how to control my emotions better (Misophonia related or not), I can let go of my sadness/anger when I experience a trigger. I found that listening to music all the time I was not coming to terms with my problem and the fact that I am going to be triggered from time to time; It was not the music itself making my Misophonia worse, it was the fact that I was not admitting to myself that I have this weird problem. I guess I am trying to say that I personally believe that headphones and music are okay to avoid triggers but you also need to learn how to handle the emotions that are produced when you are triggered. I know, easier said than done. \n\nAlso, I had a point when I was younger when my Misophonia got bad, then it got better as I grew up and my emotions kind of stabilized - hopefully it gets better for you too as you get older. I saw a couple of psychotherapists which probably contribute to my outlook of Misophonia too - all unwanted behaviors can benefit from simply being aware of what they are doing to you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;So, ultimately, I have no way out of this situation. If I keep using music as a way to deal with it, it will just keep getting worse and worse. If I keep having to deal with the sounds, I am going to have to prepare myself for many more crying sessions. I know that if this keeps going, I am going to start being afraid of the people around me and be even more afraid of school itself. I have no idea what I am supposed to do.\n\nThere is always options - life always goes on. No, there is no way out of Misophonia, it is something that we all need to learn how to cope with in our own ways, unfortunately. I do not personally think that listening to music to block out triggers is going to make your Misophonia worse, unless you convince yourself that is what it is doing. I would recommend giving some meditation a try for a few weeks a half hour a day, or however frequently you can. It really helped me control my Misophonia induced rage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, If you want to talk more there is always someone here to talk. I hope that you find something that helps, whatever it is, headphones or no headphones. Let us know if you decide to get a pair though - I would be interested in hearing what brand/model you choose. You NEED noise-cxl'ing headphones, what is your mother's deal? Your father needs to handle this.\n\nYou should be wearing earplugs - they do NOT make miso worse, they give relief from it. The only thing that makes miso worse is miso itself, and not having tools to help you cope.\n\nYou can adjust earplugs too, so that you can still hear what you need to (pulling them out a certain amount).\n\nI also rec seeing a doc about anxiety/depression meds, preferably a psych.\n\nI have had miso for 39 years and I know what you are going through. My miso has gotten much worse since I was your age. Being exposed to trigger sounds does not make them less hellish, not in my experience. Obviously this varies from one person to the next, but I have definitely found that headphone use has made me more sensitive to triggers. My reasoning is that because misophonia is basically our brains working overtime detecting 'danger', when you block those sounds out it tries harder to detect them. And unfortunately in my case, it succeeds. But it is a catch-22, because I cannot cope without headphones, so I just end up wearing them more and more. \n\nI would say you are right about meditation and learning to manage those emotions though. It is hard work but does seem to be one of the more helpful approaches. I would believe that choosing to block out sounds will increase your sensitivity. Some people say that they do not experience this, and I think they probably do not use their medium of choice as frequently or for as long as needed to notice a change. But it is of course possible that for some people, their sensitivity is not affected. Mine has been, but even though it has increased, I would much rather have greater control over my emotions and immediate mental wellbeing than make sure my misophonia does not get any more sensitive because of it.\n\nAlso, over ear headphones will less disturb the people around you.", "Does anyone else hate how everywhere you go there is always someone who is unnecessarily loud and whose normal talking voice sounds like they are yelling? Everywhere I go there is at LEAST one idiot who everyone can hear, whose normal talking voice sounds like he is yelling or talking unnecessarily loudly. It makes me want to do them physical harm.\n\nI think that is the rudest, most obnoxious thing when people act like they are the only ones in the store/restaurant.\n\nIt is often a person talking to another person they are standing near unnecessarily loudly, as if they are 100 feet apart. Or it is a small group of teenagers literally shouting as loud as they can when talking to each other. Then you have parents with unruly kids running all over screaming and knocking shit over, while the parents do nothing. \n\nI am also regularly in restaurants and stores where some asshole is blasting some loud, stupid Buzzfeed video or talking into his phone like it is a Nextel. \n\nThey should gradually begin enforcing noise ordinances in public places  in all aspects (exclusively for LOUD people, not normal speaking voices) IKR, for me its the mindless whistlers.

My grandmas in the hospital and I went to see her yesterday after school. As soon as I get there my uncles clearing his throat, aunts talking to me and clearing her throat, grandpas coughing while talking to someone on the  phone (loud hard open mouth cough) and I cannot fucking STAND it. I tried to deal with it because I wanted to see my grandma (she was out of the room for a scan) and eventually put my earphones in blasting music. Aunt kept clearing her throat, asked her if I gave her a drink if it would help stop that and she said yes. Later a few hours pass, grandma came back in her room, we ate some food, etc and she gets moved to a different floor. We all come to see her and guess what? Heres my fucking uncle literally clearing his throat every few seconds. And I got so annoyed, triggered for lack of a better word (no word can explain how irritated this makes me) to the point where I had to leave my grandma and go home because he would not fucking stop clearing his throat. Then as I am saying bye to my grandma, he has the nerve to flag me for being too loud while he is on the phone, I wanted to do something, bash his head in, push him out the window idk. It made me really upset that I cannot even be there to spend time with my grandma because someone else is ruining it for me. he does this every time he visits etc when I think it is obvious I have a problem. I have asked my grandparents to talk about this with him (because he would not give a crap if it came from me) and etc but I am not sure if they have and he is just does not care or if they just have not bothered to. But at the same time I sometimes feel like I am acting entitled for preferring if family members that see me struggle with this daily could try and not make those sounds or suppress them a little bit. My neck hurts because I have been kind of snapping my neck back in a way (it is something I do when I hear my trigger sounds over and over) Doesnt matter what I hit or bash my head into or how much I burst into tears because Im still going to have this bullshit condition. It gets to the point where I have violent thoughts towards my uncle (sometimes other ppl) sometimes myself I see a psychiatrist and etc but they have no experience with misophonia. And fluoxetine does not do miracles. It is a day later and I still hear his throat clearing in my head. And my family puts on a front like they give a shit but they do not. I was hoping I could see her today but of course he is coming today too. I am sorry, friend. I feel for you. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9b thank you\ud83d\udc9c Omg the throat clearing! That is one of my triggers. My dad used to do it all the time when I lived at home. Like I do not understand why someone just lives with that? Obviously there is something wrong if you have to clear your throat every 6 seconds! Why are not you looking to fix it??\nDrives me insane. You do not have to explain how these triggers make you feel, it can drive you crazy. Do they not hear themselves? It must be like a nervous tic, or they have a form of Tourette\u2019s, do they not have self control? Feel bad, hoping you get time with your grandma all by yourself It is like my TOP trigger. Nothings wrong with them they know they do it My main trigger, too. Im sooooo sorry OP. I am sorry OP. This is one of my triggers, too. You did the right thing by leaving when you had had enough. Hoping you get to have some alone time with your grandma soon. Throat clearing is one of my top triggers.  If someone does it once, I can handle it.  When it is repeated and a regular thing, I cannot be around that person.  You could ask him to give you a few minutes alone with your grandmother.  That would not be rude or unreasonable.  Then lock the door when he leaves. OMG that is my life.  My father.  How does someone live with that?

I know it cannot be helped but my dog licks himself a lot. There is nothing wrong with him, he is not in pain or have any medical problems. Not only is licking but his chomping and the tapping of his nails on the floor. Yes his nails are fine. I have a hard time having dinner or sitting by her in the morning when she is slurping her coffee and loudly eating her cereal. I also have a hard time sleeping at night because I have to sleep with my parents dog for the same reasons I will mention.

We have 8 dogs on the property, and they all have their own unique barks, but this one dog\u2019s bark just really pisses me off and I do not know why! Her bark is very high pitch so maybe that is why? Sometimes, she wakes me up by barking when she goes out to potty in the morning, and I end up waking with this feeling of rage, and I cannot help it, or stand it! I hate that I cannot control this feeling, and I do not hate the dog either. I just cannot stand the sound of her bark! How do you stop this feeling when you hear certain sounds? I wear ear plugs to bed every night and I can still hear her bark through them! It is so frustrating! This is not a current problem anymore, however, now that I have been waking up very early, but I would still like to know if there is a way to cope with the feelings I get from hearing certain noises like this! I feel like I am going crazy sometimes! Thanks in advance for any advice! You have my sympathy, and I am sure you have the sympathy of others who do not reply. \n\nMisophonia-like reactions come in many different shapes and sizes. It is not hard to imagine a dog's bark being a Misophonia trigger. I would say you are in good company here. \n\nI do not think earplugs cut it for a lot of people, especially when they are trying to sleep and their neighbors are making noise, or in your case, a dog barking. I frequently recommend  ( (or a similar, less expensive, option) to mask noise better while still having a comfortable sleep. I think that you need something that plays music or ambient noise to have true isolation from a sound that is triggering a Misophonia-like reaction. Unfortunately, sound makes it through your skull and into your eardrums even if your ears are plugged. This is especially true for deeper and louder sounds.  I have personally tried white noise machines, carpets on the walls, and the best earplugs money can buy, but none of them are able to completely isolate me from my neighbors. Right now I have some Bose QC II's and they work perfectly to drown out my neighbor's bassy music. I run some instrumental music through them and keep the noise cancellation on high. You do not need super expensive earbuds or headphones though, I made due for a long time with a cheap pair of $60.00 wireless earbuds from Amazon. The key is the combination of noise to distract and the sound isolation you get from having something plugged into your ears. Lookup the Cocktail Party Effect - you can exploit the brains ability to tune things out by giving yourself something else to focus on, like music for example. That is generally the idea I am getting at here - hope it makes a bit of sense. \n\nBesides \"equipment,\" you should try to keep as calm as possible. Try not to anticipate the noise. If you are laying in bed waiting for the sound to happen, you are not going to get much sleep and, for some reason beyond me, the sound is going to hurt much more when it does happen. Try to let go of the sound after it is over and do not anticipate it happening. As someone who has really bad Misophonia with apparently everything, this is the best thing I have done to improve my quality of life. A simple change in thought pattern can go a long way to reduce long term stress. Misophonia should not kill you when you are in peace and quiet. It does not happen overnight, and meditation can help, but I think that learning to chill out is important for living with something like this. \n\nAnyways, good luck. Hope you find something that works for you. If you find something that really helps, please share it us :) Wow! Thank you for the very detailed response! That, itself, was very helpful! \ud83d\ude03 I will try to keep all that in mind, and I will definitely look into getting better earplugs! Also, I think I am gunna try the white noise, but maybe I will just play it on YouTube from my tv for now. If I can find a long enough video, that is! XD \n\n\u201cYou have my sympathy, and I am sure you have the sympathy of others who do not reply.\u201d\n\nThat actually means a lot to me, btw! :) I always feel like no one read my post if I do not get at least one comment, lol. \n\n\u201cA simple change in thought pattern can go a long way to reduce long term stress. Misophonia should not kill you when you are in peace and quiet. It does not happen overnight, and meditation can help, but I think that learning to chill out is important for living with something like this.\u201d\n\nYou are very right and that makes total sense! However, I have no idea how to make myself chill when I feel this way, and I think that is the hardest part. Avoiding hearing the sounds is obviously easiest, but when I cannot avoid them I will be powerless to make the feeling not happen! I am also completely surrounded by people who cannot control their own emotions, so that does not help. I feel like the phrase \u201cstuck between a rock and a hard place\u201d fits here? \n\nLol, thank you again for the reply! I really appreciate it! I will try harder to change my thoughts and focus on other sounds from now on. Keep sharing if you have more to share, and I will try to remember to share what worked for me in the future! \n: D Hello, I really do not think you have misophonia because I have never heard of any one with only one trigger noise. But I do understand that the noise of the dog might make you feel literally insane. White noise is always good. Wish you the best tho, and I hope for you that you really do not have misophonia and it is just this one dog. :) Thank you! And sorry for the late reply! I think it is just the one dog. I have not noticed it with anything else so far, at least. I am actually feeling much better lately, since I started waking up earlier. At least now I do not have to worry about being woken up by her barking anymore! XD The rest of the day she is pretty quiet. She just hates being left outside to potty by herself lol. Listening to music helps me a ton to at least distract me( do not blast your ears even if it is tempting) You could also ask a doctor if it is interfering with your ability to function normally (some doctors have not heard of misophonia)(mine jumped to ocd but ruled that out quickly) The vast expanses of the internet is a great place to start though", "What should I do about this situation at work?  I used to work in an office area all by myself (it was HEAVEN) but my job hired another person and they are going to be working in the area with me next week. I have been panicking everyday about what this could mean for my misophonia and social anxiety, and I am sure most of you understand. \n\nI have a radio on all day when I am at work, it is a volume rather loud for most people but very comfortable for me especially with earplugs (I wear those too but hide them under hair bands). I am worried the new person will complain it is too loud and my boss will force me to keep it off or take it away from me (they have threatened to take it away in the past when I first started working there). \n\nAnother thing is, there will be no walls or barriers to separate us. I have talked to my boss about my concerns with the new person being able to see me eat my lunch and answer the phone (social anxiety) and they said he will not be able to see me past my monitors but I know he can still see me, his desk will be just 5 feet away from mine. I even asked if they could get me a desk shelf-wall thingy and they said no. So I have been panicking over that as well. \n\nI will not list triggers (I know they are not allowed) but I am so worried this person has allergies or some health problem that will cause me to be triggered all day long for 9hrs a day. I work 37 hours a week and 37 hours spent in a constant state of fight-or-flight will make me lose my mental health real quick. I am not looking forward to this AT ALL.\n\nI know the obvious answer is find another job, but the thing is the job I have right now is the best I will ever get with no college degree. I do not have many co-workers and it is with really nice people and the boss loves me. But I cannot tell them about my misophionia because I do not think they will understand (they are older people). I cannot wear headphones because I have to answer the phone. I have thought about asking if I can find some headphone that takes calls and plays music at the same time. Does anyone know where I can find those? \n\nI have been searching for work from home jobs so I can make extra income so I can limit the days I work there if this person turns out to be a total trigger person, but it is not a guarantee. Help me please! If *any* anxiety is interfering this severely with your ability to function and quality of life - professional help is an absolute necessity. \n\nI 100% empathize with your situation. Offices can be hell. But instead of panicking over how you are going to get around potential obstacles and triggers or how you can ask others to accommodate you, perhaps seek solutions that help relieve you of this albatross altogether.\n\nAddressing the stress and anxiety in general -* with the help of a professional *- would be my first step. Misophonia triggers just do not hit as hard when the rest of your house is in order. \n\nGood luck! I feel for you. \ud83d\udc9b Thanks so much. I do take Klonopin for emergencies but I would really like to try an SSRI but serotonin syndrome scares me. :-( Unless you are taking two medications in a large amount known to cause serotonin syndrome together, it is very unlikely you will have it happen to you. I am not going to remove this comment because it only tiptoes the line of \u201cRule 4: Do not be a doctor\u201d, but I do want to note that anyone reading this should take care to talk to their doctor before looking into medication reactions from others online.\n\nWhat works for someone else or what someone else reacts to may not have the same impact on you. This applies to a lot of things in this sub. Yes, I meant that OP\u2019s doctor would have this in mind while prescribing any sort of SSRI; that it is a worry OP can pass to someone with more knowledge. Thank you. I figured as much, which is why I kept your comment up. Just wanted to clarify! Happy holidays Thank you! You as well! :)", "Corn starch? I am wondering if this is part of my misophonia but does anyone else get an almost unbearable, creepy-crawling-like feeling when touching corn starch? Like someone is trying to push on your funny bone but all over your body? Oh yes. I think starches and gums feel terrible. As bad as (or even worse than) touching pilled polyester blends. Yes!! I forgot about polyester and nylon. Thank you This is sensory processing disorder, which misophonia may or may not be related to brain wise. Many of us have both, at least! \n\nThis is a note on the connection: ( Omg I HATE synthetic fabrics!!! Yeah! I even hate the sound too, like squeaky and dull at the same time somehow Excellent information, thank you so much! Is that what is freaking me out? A sort of low-frequency sound that I do not even realize is happening? Hmmm ... well, damn. Did not think of it like that. Thank you!", "This is going to be a loooooooooooong year An extremely quick back story. So me and my husband have recently moved in with my mother in law to try and save up for a deposit for a house.\n\nMy husband already drives me crazy when he eats. He crunches things so loudly.\nNow I have got his mother to add to the mix. Shes a lovely woman, do not get me wrong but, oh my god. She is currently eating an apple and I am about to lose my mind. I do not know how to describe this but I hope you get what I mean. You know when someone breathes in while they eat and you can hear them breathing in? It is that, along with slurping. It is making me so angry. It does not help that I am also having to listen to children's tv because the grandkids are over.\nShes also the kind of person that has to do a running commentary of everything on the telly. Aaaaaaaaagh. I am keeping it together so far but it is only been a week \ud83e\udd74 Is having a moments silence too much to ask for? Ahhh, I feel you so much! I do not even have a room alone so it is really hard to even go to a room wth no people. I even hate it when some people speak to me because I can just Hear their saliva in their mouth, it is absolutely disgusting. No one understands me and my whole family kind of just makes fun of me for it, to the point where I cannot eat anything in front of them because I do not want to be a hypocrite. I only discovered I had misophonia this year, but I feel like I have it so difficult with it. I cannot stand breathing either, it makes me want to stab my ears. \n\nMaybe you could really have a talk with them? It may not always work, but at least you have tried. Also, you could try explaining it as a physical pain. That way they can understand it better.\n\nWe are all here for you! Respect, I bet they cannot even live with it for a day lol Omg I am so sorry. We need to be recognized. How are we not?! So frustrating!!! Oof. My sister was eating an apple the other day, and the crunching and slurping combined is just-NO.", "Dealing With My Neighbor's Truck  My next-door neighbors have two big, loud trucks but one of them is a lot louder than the other. The engine is so loud that it literally makes my room rumble. And this has been something I have been dealing with since last year. This particular truck would wake me at the worst times, ranging from 5AM to 9AM and sometimes the guy driving it would loudly rev his engine on purpose to trigger me. It is gotten to the point that I cannot even look at his truck without getting irritated, especially when it is parked right outside of my window.\n\nTo try to cope with it, I have two white noise machines in my room and since that is not enough, I have to listen to rain sounds with noise-cancelling noises. It helps but sometimes, I wish I could go a day without needing these things to deal with it. For anyone wondering if I have tried talking to my neighbor about his truck, I have not bothered because he is the kind of person who enjoys being rebellious and obnoxious(He will not even wear a mask, for crying out loud). Apparently, the whole neighborhood has issues with him too and no one has done anything about it, which is honestly discouraging. Even my mom claims there is nothing we can do about it. I am rarely in a good mood because of this person and his truck that I want to know if there is another way to cope with this. Since you are not the only household in the neighborhood affected by this, could you report it as a noise disturbance? Repeatedly revving an engine at 5am is unacceptable. No, because he usually does it in the afternoon. But he still does it in the morning Go slap his ass and tell him to stop I should have been more specific, I meant to say he usually wakes me up from 5AM to 9AM but sometimes, he will rev his truck in the afternoon or leave it on idle for at least 10 minutes before shutting it off. And to the person who suggested I slap him, what good would that do? Depending on where you are located, your town may have laws regarding noise ordinances. There may not have any, but it is worth looking into. And, if enough neighbors complain about the same person, it could make authorities do something.\n\nI hope this was helpful in some way! And my apologies if it was not.", "What is your common reaction to triggers? Mine is crying and I hate it so much. Duplicating, or some sort of angry outburst/exclamation, aggressively covering ears. There is also a self harm impulse in there that I have buried deep deep down. \n\nIf I were trapped in a situation where I could not leave or cover my ears I would cry too. I usually just get extremely irritated and cannot focus on anything else.  I will turn and look at the source of the sound (usually my unfortunate friend sitting next to me lol) and if it keeps up, I have to leave the room or I will start telling people to cut it out.  And apparently people do not take well to being asked to stop doing perfectly mundane things.\n\nIf leaving or getting them to stop is not an option, I will do whatever I can to mask the noise; shuffle around, tap on things, be as loud as possible without becoming a bigger nuisance so that I do not have to hear the trigger sound. Level 1: Try to not hear it, try to relax.\nLevel 2: Try to make the sound stop.\nLevel 3: Leave the situation altogether. Does not matter what the situation is.\nLevel 4: Soundproof earbuds from the furthest distance manageable.\nLevel 5: Complete panic escape. Run far away until it stops and I can come back.\n\nIt really sucked at my youngest brother's High school graduation this year. There was a speech given by his favorite teacher that lasted 15 minutes. The catch? He smacked his mouth, sometimes multiple times, before LITERALLY every sentence. And I mean the actual definition of literally. There was not a single sentence he did not start with at least one trigger. For FIFTEEN MINUTES. And I could not leave. I could not use earbuds. No means of escape. I almost cried. Definitely bit myself. Did that a bit over a week ago really bad at my other brother's birthday. hitting something or myself (i need a physical outlet), being verbally abusive but not saying it to anyone's face, if it is unbearable i scream and/or have a meltdown. emotion wise it is the usual for most of us; anger/frustration, disgust, hopelessness Pain in my left eye (was born with strabismus). Tend to shut down and try to lie down. It starts with irritation, that builds more and more until I either leave the room or do a violence. I get really tense and seize up when there is an especially bad trigger, and can get really short-tempered when it happens Sudden rage and intense irritation - a lot of yelling and with continued noise triggers (ex: my upstairs neighbors play music and all I can hear is the continuous bass above my head), I have physically punched and kicked things around me. It is not cute but it is what happens. It is the exact same for me, I cannot stop aggresively turning around to look at the source of the sound (my coworker most times, in my case) like that is going to change anything lol! I tense and jerk, almost shrinking in on myself for a split second it is so weird how defensive people get when i tell them they are chewing too loud. maybe grow up and stop eating like a 3 year old", "My sister is being such a twat about my misophonia. This is just a lil vent.\n\nI have had it for years and only told my family about it a few months ago when my sister was eating frikin Pringles all through the show me and family were watching together and I lost it. She knew I had a problem with chewing and but thought I was being dramatic, the priss looked right at me and started chewing loudly on purpose just to piss me off. Just today she followed me down the stairs eating, guess f*cking what, Pringles and chewing them in my ear. I wanted to slap her so hard but I do not want to hurt my  family so I had to try my best and keep it under control. Anyways she then offered some to my mum (her chewing is by far the worst in the family and my sister KNOWS that) and my mum started eating them when I was about to have a conversation with her. So I had walk back upstairs and wait til they had finished because if I had tried talking to my mum I would have gotten SUPER snappy. I have told my sister what misophonia is but she does not understand she just tells me to \"get over it\", \"stop being so dramatic\" and just today she said I was crazy. \n\nI could vent about my other family members but then this would be super long. My older sister at least understands which I am grateful for. I am really sorry for what you have to deal with. It is horrible when family/friends will not or cannot understand.  \nMy wife is a big asshole when it comes to this and it has me to the point that I want to live by myself because of it. She burps ALL the time, really loudly. She crunches pretzels and gives no fucks. I ask her to let me know when she is going to eat stuff like that so I can put my headphones in. (We live in a tiny one bedroom apartment where the living room and kitchen are all the same small room and the bedroom/bathroom are in the next area.) I can never get away.  \nShe has also said that I knew that she liked to sing and hum when we got together, so she should not have to stop......ok.....and she knew that I like to keep things clean, and she is a freaking pig, so what is the point? I have asked her numerous times to please wait until I leave the room/go to work/go to bed/whatever but she just does not care. She has also told me that it is \"convenient\" that I \"all of a sudden\" have this issue when she wants to sing (she is horrible at it) or hum. I told her this WAY back when we were talking as friends.  \nSorry, I did not mean to use your post as a vent area lol...it sort of just came out :(  \n\\*Hugs\\*  \nHopefully the loved ones in our lives will start to understand. I have been dealing with Misophonia (had no idea there was a name for it until about a year ago) for about 47 years. It is exhausting!  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*EDIT - Typos nah that is ok lol, I understand completely, telling someone with misophonia to just ignore it or get over it is like telling a depressed person to stop being sad. It is really upsetting when your loved ones do not believe you. Like it is a real thing, if they care about us they should look it up. I do not know what you did in the past to convince your family that Misophonia is a real thing, but something that helped me a lot was sending my mother a link to the official Misophonia support group. That link went to the symptoms page of that website and explained what it does to people who have Misophonia. \n\nI also suggest you use earplugs when people are eating around you, it may not be a nice looking one, but it can help a lot. I prefer eating at restaurants or cafeterias compared to dinner tables. The outside noise usually drowns out eating noises. \n\nI am sorry you are dealing with this, my father was and still is very unsupportive. You are right in recognizing that while you hate the noise, they cannot help it. Everybody chews and breathes (stuff that triggers my misophonia) and I have to modify my own reaction, i.e. leave the room etc.\n\nEdit: I remember I talk about misophonia/misokinesia (I have both, lovely) is that it is a neurological disorder that causes the limbic system to activate my fight or flight response, I do not have a choice in the matter. This hopefully prevents people from thinking I just find it as an \"annoyance.\" lil psychopath Yeah I much prefer eating in restaurant's too, when I eat at home I have to wear my earphones when eating with family and it is usually when we are watching TV so not only can I not hear the show (there is subtitles but still..)but my ears start to hurt when I have them in too long and they are usually pretty loud because if they are not I can still hear them. I have to sit out there too or else everyone gets angry. Bro, this is beyond being a twat. This is just being disrespectful and an undecent person.  I am quite sorry, but, this is so toxic. Like actually. Gee I can sympathise. My wife\u2019s eating and sniffing turns me into a lunatic. I have dinner with loud music on or eat quickly or pretend I need the toilet for the duration of dinner. It is fucked is not it. I cannot understand why I have to \u2018just deal with it\u2019 please blow your nose and eat quietly. I can detect a chew from anywhere in the house. Mornings I wake to \u2018sniff sniff\u2019 my teeth grit and I feel like bludgeoning something/someone. Yes it is exhausting and it ruins a day. \nStay brave you are not alone", "Good Friend is an INSANELY high trigger Hello all. This is somewhat of a vent and somewhat of an invitation for advice from people in similar situations and what they do! Any input on solutions or remedies greatly appreciated.\n\nI am new to my disorder and up until just months ago just always thought i was \u201ccrazy\u201d and never have/would say anything to others. Been silently suffering since I was a kid. \n\nOne of my good friends whom I hang with often drives me totally nuts every time we hang out. She is CONSTANTLY fidgeting in one way or another (tapping or stomping feet, running hands through her hair, tapping fingers on things, etc) \n\nOr making noises with her mouth such as \u201cspitting beats\u201d if that makes sense lol and always doing that \u201ccloke clack\u201d thing with the tongue and roof of mouth. Constantly making \u201cinstruments\u201d out of any available object, books, bottles, cups, cans, anything she is in possession of at the moment.\n\njust about every time we listen to music she begins to tap along or make noises in some way and it is a totally different rhythm sometimes and all i can focus on is the outside noises. \n\nAlways shaking leg/foot as well. I mentioned running fingers through hair, but it is so constant i cannot event explain it. She has long waist length hair and literally ALWAYS running fingers from the top of head to the bottom, undoing tangles or just simply running the fingers. like 90% or the time her hand is messing with her hair. Even if her other hand is involved in another activity. it drives me absolutely CRAZY!!!!!! i have to turn my body away or completely leave the room.\n\nThe worst is when she starts making a \u201cband\u201d out of her body when really feeling a song, and stomps the feet, POUNDS the chest with a fist, and makes noises with mouth. it is like she was sent straight from\nhell to TORTURE me. \n\ni want to scream and rip my hair out.  but i never say a word and it has serious effects on my mental well being. i just feel like a crazy person and do not know what to do. i love my friend, she is great and i enjoy spending time with her. she has no idea of my disorder or maybe that it even exists. \n\nHELP!!!! She probably has ADHD. yep probably Why do not you tell her? Might help, I have done it many, many times. What I have found out is the earlier I tell someone about a trigger, the less awkward it is.  Sometimes, they are even understanding and try to stop doing it. i just do not want to come off as a bitch, especially for those that may not understand. how do you usually go about telling someone? Honestly depends on type of the relationship with the person. But I just usually explain my issue (miso) and try to get them to understand. \n\nPlease note that many people will take it as an attack on them/offense when you ask them to stop smacking their food and/or chew with their mouths wide open. (I am getting triggered just writing this)\n\nObviously, people who I am closer with, understand the severity of my misophonia and are usually very understanding.", "What should I do? Guys I have misophonia , the sound which trigger me is \"when someone get cold and then they take deep breathe to get there  bulgum right into  the nose again\" I do not what I am saying (I do not how to explain that sound) . But the real problem is I bought the lecture for my studies and every single fucking teacher make that sound after saying 5 words . I am so frustrated , no I cannot stop watching lecture they are important but my misophonia do not let me watch I could not concentrate or anything else I got to angry (just like I am right now) .\nWhat should I do in this situation?\n\nSorry for bad English This absolutely sucks and I can feel your frustration. Do you happen to have a friend who can give you notes from the class? (I know its not the same as being there but it could be useful?). If the lectures are recorded, do they have automated subtitles you could use? Or I am sure there is some sort of program/app which could create subtitles/convert the audio into text? I am really sorry your in this situation but I hope these suggestions could help!", "Has anyone been affected by the noises they make?    My main trigger is chewing or snoring sort of noises, so primarily sounds from other people. However, no matter how disgustingly I try to chew (sometimes it helps block out other people), it never bothers me when I make noise. I can only think of when I am having a really hard time sleeping and my nose is blocked or something, so I am making a weird rasping noise. Then, I absolutely cannot stand the noise I make. So, have any of you ever been triggered by noises *you are* making? I personally cannot stand my own chewing anf generally all sounds that revolve around eating and drinking, although my response to that is a lot milder compared to when the sounds are caused by others. I need to have background noise at all times when I eat, when I am alone preferably with headphones on. I hate it when I chew too. Sometimes my nose gets stuffed and I have to open my mouth while chewing and it is absolutely disgusting For me it shifts depending on how sensitive I am feeling at different points of the month. I am most triggered while PMSing and right after I wash my hair. These are times when my own noises affect me, further driving me crazy. When I was younger I could hear this buzzing noise in my ears at night and sometimes my heartbeat. It would keep me awake at night.", "Feeling like a burden to boyfriend He knows of my condition and trys so hard to stop chewing loud or breathing loud but it does not help. I feel so bad about this because sometimes I feel like I am too picky? \nIf anyone has advice or ideas to help not feel like a burden to him, anything will be appreciated. My husband and I deal with this all the time, now that we have been together longer he knows when something will set me off. Typically I am triggered easier when my anxiety is high. \nI put a headphone in with noise to block out the chewing, that is the best that can be done other than leaving the room. \n\nMy husband now complains that I have given him a complex, he still loves me and I catch him eating crunchy things in the spare room to spare room! \n\nAlso , old school tactic, I take a bite when he does so I do not have to hear him. Thank you very much, I will try the headphone tactic! I second the headphones, but I also suggest experimenting with different types of noises.\n\nMy daughter is triggered by eating sounds, and at meals she wears headphones and listens to brown noise. She says brown noise drowns out the sounds better than white noise or music. It also allows us to have a conversation with her, we just needs to speak up. There is a spectrum of noises, and one might work better for you than others.\n\nShe is also seeing a therapist. She has some anxiety issues, and misophonia seems to be linked to anxiety and stress. The therapist is using a cognitive behavioral therapy approach. I do not know if you have any issues like that, but it might be worth thinking about. Ah okay thank you very much! I will look into the Brown noise approach.", "I will never get to play board games like other people do. I will never get to play board games like other people do, and that is a little sad. I wish I could go to board game cafes, but my Misophonia holds me back. I wish I could play DND with people, but nobody wants to play without food, or at least take some breaks to eat separately. \n\nI feel like I have some sort of social disability. I come across as weird and antisocial, but I really do like hanging out with people. \n\nPeople associate tabletop games with eating and drinking; nobody except Misophoniacs would dream of playing a board game without some sort of food or drink. \n\nMy life is pretty good, but this is one of those depressing social consequences of having Misophonia that I think some of you might relate to. One idea is hosting a board game night or having people over for a game. Having people at your place or being the host provides a very acceptable way to set some rules like what you listed in your post. It is not that you can never play board games, it is more that you have to figure out how to make it work for you. Have you checked out any of the online D&amp;D options? I bet if you post over in  r/DungeonsAndDragons someone will have recommendations. I have posted online a while back, but did not get any replies. You are right though: I should try that again. There is no reason why I could not try and play online. Thank you. This is true. I suppose the idea of someone coming into my quiet place gives me anxiety too. I worry that someone will complain about no food, or I would have to explain my Misophonia to people in my life who do not know about it as a justification for my weird eating rules.  These worries might just in my head.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are right, it is a place that I have control over. I could set rules that I am comfortable with and only allow people in who agree to those rules. I will have to give it more thought. Appreciate your thoughts.", "Signups Open! Misophonia Podcast Season 5 nterview slots are now open for season 5! There are still some slots in September and October so please grab one because they are going fast. I still have a few more amazing episodes left over the next few weeks and then I will begin season 5 with some pretty well-known names in the misophonia community. \n\n(", "Dr. Jane Gregory (Oxford) on the Misophonia Podcast \ud83c\udf99Just released a new episode with Dr. Jane Gregory, a clinical psychologist and misophonia researcher at Oxford University... who also has misophonia herself! We go over too many things to list in this almost 90 minute episode, including therapies she uses in her practice, the misophonia research she is conducting at the Department of Experimental Psychology at Oxford, and of course her misophonia life story. Part of her work centers around the S-5 questionnaire to measure misophonia. We actually go over my results from the questionnaire and you can follow along with the chart posted here and in the show notes!\n\nHear the full episode wherever you get podcasts or the website:\n\nApple: \nSpotify: \nWebsite: \n \nLinks:  \nsoundslikemisophonia.com This is amazing, thank you so much for posting! Super cool that a researcher at an institution like Oxford is working on misophonia. Hopefully we are on a road towards it being treated as a legitimate problem rather than the current state of affairs.", "Career path  YEESSSSSS! I specifically chose a job where I am alone 99% of the time. Could not function otherwise \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  There is few sounds in my job:\n\n-Some therapists apply oil too vigorously and it makes that awful squishy smacking sound \n-People get the sniffles , a minor annoyance \n-Clients like to put a mint in their mouth before the appointment but it never has time to dissolve so they end up chewing the hard peppermint candy during the massage. what do you do for a living? An office manager for a small clinic. I have worked it office settings where I had to blast white noise just to function.. no bueno  Remember when bagel chips were created? Worst chip ever invented in the history of chips.", "My boyfriend\u2019s dog licks herself!! I have dealt with extreme rage in the past with my dad\u2019s sloppy chewing sounds. I found ways to work around that thank god. \n\nBut I am going on a second month in a new relationship, and he has a lab who licks herself constantly and her paws as well. I try to nicely tell her no, but it will go on long enough I feel tears coming on. And do not get me wrong, I LOVE DOGS! I love her so much, and I have two dogs of my own. I do not want to reprimand her, and will never take my anger out on her. I just am trying so hard to contain this anger, what should I do? I do not think it is fair to me to hide how I feel, and knows I suffer with BPD. I think I am worrying for nothing, please help... She should not be licking her paws. She probably has allergies. Give her some Benadryl for the allergies in the meantime and take her to the vet.\n\nShe might also have a food allergy, you can talk to the vet about that too. Preface...I suffer from pretty severe misophonia (not unlike most people here) \n\nI have a dog that loves to lick herself, like most other dogs.  I know she has no concept of it being infuriating, so I have actually used my dog to help me learn to cope with the misophonia. \n\nI have had my Izzy since she was a puppy and she is almost 7 now, so she is very well trained. She has learned that when I snap my fingers it is time to listen. \n\nBack to the point... As soon as she begins licking it is all I hear and it is all I can focus on. I have promised myself when she starts I will give her at least 5 seconds to do what she needs to do. After all, dogs licking is normal, right? \n\nAfter 5 seconds, or longer if I can, I snap my fingers and she immediately stops and makes eye contact with me. I then say stop and she listens. Stop is a common command I use with her.  \n\nI do not see why you could not implement something similar with your boyfriend's lab. Dogs are smart. Obviously I have a leg up on you because I have had her since she was a puppy and she practically goes everywhere with me other than work. \n\nGive her a few seconds or whatever you can stand while using your coping strategy then redirect her somehow. Talk to your partner about what commands he already uses and figure something out. \n\nThat is the best I have. Hope it helps! How about a cone? Maybe you can use it to teach her not to lick. My partner has a dachshund. Apparently licking is the core of their existence. Not just her dog, but the entire breed. She licks everything all the time. She leaves a trail on the floor like a snail. There does not need to be anything for her to lick up. She licks anyways. She licks the air as if there was something in front of her. It is one of the reasons we do not live together yet. When I sleep over, I have to wear ear plugs because she insists upon being in the bedroom. Point is... I feel your pain. But also, as already mentioned, there may be a solution for you. The paw licking is a sign of a problem most of the time that can be resolved with help from the vet. They would never let me do that, I will talk to him when he gets home about what I can do. I have never talked about it", "A quiet place Back when the movie \u201ca quiet place\u201d came out, my boyfriend suggested we go to the movies. I do not see ads often so I had no idea what the movie was about. Boy, what a mistake that was. Imagine an almost completely silent movie with everyone munching on snacks and popcorn all around you. I went running out of the theater after about fifteen minutes! I thought you guys could relate. It is funny to think about now. the cinema certainly was not a quiet place then \ud83e\udd23 When I went to see rise of skywalker it took me 3 different trips to finally sit through the whole movie, fuck movie theaters, I am glad that was probably the last Star Wars movie to show only in a theater for at least a long time. Most theater chains in the US offer Bluetooth enabled headsets for the hard of hearing. They can help drown out noise from your neighbors. Probably not enough for an absolutely silent movie, but even background music can override popcorn most of the time.\n\nYou do not have to explain why you want them or pay extra, you just ask for them when you get your ticket. They have been a game changer for us. Cannot understand why people would eat f\\*ing popcorn during movie. Cannot they just watch and stay quiet. the reason I do not think I will go to a cinema ever again, even after the pandemic I forgot how much that bothered me as a kid, between the previews when it was silent and you could hear everyone eating popcorn or ice moving around in drinks. Made my skin crawl. Nowadays I usually pick movies that have been out for a while or are not that popular so the theater will be mostly empty I generally do not like going to the cinema any more. Your reason is the main reason for me, as well. But generally seeing people using their smartphones and hearing them talking to eachother all the time is pretty annoying. I have not been in a movie theater for more than ten years. I worked for movie theaters for years and somehow forgot all about these. Who knows when ill next go to the movies, but ill definitely try to remember this! My favorite theatre experiences were when working for a family run chain, we had to preview movies thursday nights to make sure we assembled the reels properly.  So it meant watching movies alone or with 1 or 2 other friends.  Was fantastic. Ever since, seeing movies in the theatre seems like a waste of.money.", "Sometimes the world just seems so loud... I wish I could wear headphones all the time I agree", "I am done My mom really thinks I hate her now, because I do not like her and her mother\u2019s mannerisms. I do not know how to explain it to her, I cannot explain it to her. She says that one day I will shoot her, that I am racist to my own kind, that I learned all this from the \u201crich white boys and the criminal black kids\u201d. That all this time she spent just to raise a piece of shit. She told me to get out of the house if I hate her that much. I am not allowed to take meds, I am not allowed to seek a therapist because that is only for white boys in movies and \u201cI am making it all up and that I enjoy it\u201d. I do not hate her, I love her so much words cant even describe it. \n\nI am done trying to solve this issue. It is eaten away at my life. I cannot sit next to them anymore without plugging my ears in, not in the car, not at dinner, nowhere. I avoid them entirely now just because of this stupid fucking thing. \n\nI want to kill myself. I have lost the last connection in my life that matters. Honestly I already have a way to do it, why fucking not. I feel like such a piece of shit. I will call the hotline or whatever, guess I will give it a shot anyways. Hang in there, life does get easier. Try headphones and please take your own wisdom and call the suicide hotline or text. You matter and your mother loves you.\n\nText CHAT to 741741 to reach Crisis Text Line  \nYou will be connected to a trained Crisis Counselor from Crisis Text Line.  \nCall the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255  \nYou will be connected to a crisis worker from the Lifeline. I know she loves me but I hurt her too much. I heard her on the phone after I wrote this post. She was calling me a \u201cvile piece of shit\u201d over and over again and said I was faking it to her as well and that I learned it from the gays and the white boys. She is the world to me, that cut deep.\n\nI am not allowed to wear my headphones btw. She told me I need to man up and that she will purposely use my triggers agains me. I am going to go crazy. Thanks so much for linking me to resources \u2764\ufe0f. I have texted the crisis one just now to give it a shot, honestly talking to anyone other than a racist and homophobe would help. I find it mind boggling how she manages to blame other races and sexualities when the problem is coming from me We can still love our parents and not like who they are as people, practice breathing deeply and meditation. Those are both things your mom cant regulate, although Im sure shell try. At one point in my life I took up running as an excuse to leave the house, which worked for me as well. Im so glad to hear you are reaching out to the resources available, that takes true strength. Its gotten worse :(. I reached out to her, she is ignoring me, she will not even talk to me. I asked if  I should go do the recycling and she simply kicked a piece of garbage at me. She bitched about it to my dad and he is screaming at me. Fuck this, I do not see a light at the end of the tunnel. There is a light, today is only one day. Give her space and time and continue speaking with the hotline. How old are you?  If you are in school, could you get a PT job after hours to get away from them?  I cannot get a PT job because I have no transportation and no time to hold one, I have alot of honors classes so my free time is nonexistent. I am not allowed to travel to far places on my own either Reading your comment and follow up - I am sorry that your mother\u2019s behavior to you is abusive.\n\nWhether or not you have been \u201cdifficult\u201d because of being triggered by sounds or actions, there is no justification for calling you a piece of shit, ignoring you, saying she will trigger you on purpose to distress you and throwing garbage in your direction.\n\nIt seems that your mother has her own mental issues going on here. And I just want you to know those are not your fault. And the way she is treating you is not your fault.\n\nIf you cannot get away from the situation, seek help, or even wear headphones, you are right that the best thing to do is engage with free resources like help lines for support.\n\nIt is a really tough situation - but it will not be forever and it will get better. Your mom has WAY TOO SKEWED view on racism, so I do not trying anyone is able to explain misophonia to her. She seems to have a few boxes of personality types and she wants to fit every person into those few boxes and she does not have one for misophonia (in fact she has only 2, black and white lol). \n\nYou might think I am trying to put you into even more despair, but I think this will give you some hope: Doing everything for your family is BS, be a little more selfish and just wear those damn headphones with them. They are torturing you, so do not even think about feeling bad for avoiding their trigger noises. \n\nAlso still loving her for what she said? That seems like just trying to appeal to others irl, because everyone says it and does not even question if it is true. You do not have to love your mom if she is abusive and this much inconsiderate. I am not telling you to go into full hatred mode, but cmon, you do not have to love her since nobody loves being tortured. \n\nGive yourself a break. People will fuck you up and then say it is your fault. You are semi-forced to expose yourself to your trigger sounds for years and then your mom says it is all you. \n\nSo avoid her, wear headphones, do not talk to her and if you see her going nuts, ignore her even more, if she continues, she will only harm you and that is an evidence for abuse. The answer is clear and simple, once you get out of that hellhole, your life will be much better. You are not a vile piece of shit, she is. I am also taking honors classes, honestly, maybe cut back on one or two classes to get a summer job and save your sanity from stress, and have a friend drive you to that job if you are an upperclassman. Otherwise, hang in there and wait until your 18th birthday, get all important documents like passports, SSN, birth certificate, etc. and GET. THE. FUCK. OUT.", "My parents want to send me to summer camp again and I am really trying to convince them otherwise. I know it is a ways away but it is already causing me so much stress. Every year my parents send me to camp during the summer but the last three years it is been absolute hell. I was saved last year because of lockdown but I have to go this year. My misophonia has gotten dramatically worse over this past year and I really do not think I can handle going. I can barely handle getting through the day at times and at camp, I do not have any privacy or places I can go to calm down. I am not allowed to take any technology (which is fine) but music is my coping device. I cannot sleep without it and being tired really accentuates my reactions to triggers. If I do not go my parents threaten to take away my technology which I use for music, again taking away my coping mechanisms. I have told them about misophonia, and how I cannot really control it, but I do not think they completely believe me. They still say I have to go and tell me it will be fun and I will be glad I went. But I know that will not be the case. I am also going to be very busy this summer with school and such.\n\nHow can I convince them to not make me go, and let them see my side of things? I know summer is far from now but I think if I do not start convincing them now I never will. I really really do not think I will be able to handle it, please give me advice. Sorry for the long vent. There is two options I can see here. One being that you convince your family. Two being that you try and get the camp to accommodate you. The first one is tough but doable. One way to convince your family may be to lay it out then them straight. Be honest and open your heart to them. If this camp is not an option, tell that to them. Explain your pain. Plus, give them other options, like other things you could do this summer. Another thing you could do is ask the camp to accommodate you. I have done this myself as a camp counselor. I ate with the directors and main staff with music in. I kept my phone on me at all times for emergency music. People let me know when they were going to eat so I could either leave or put music in. This option is easier than it sounds, but there will still be times you will have a reaction. And that is okay. With severe Misophonia myself, I can sympathize with your stress. But the experiences I had that summer far outweighed the few reactions. But again, if you truly do not want to go, do not. So again, I recommend opening your heart to your parents or contacting the camp director. Misophonia is not something to be ashamed of, it makes you stronger than you can even imagine. You just may not know it yet. Thank you so much, I will try that. Summer is not far, it is 3 months away.\n\nNot sure where you live but the world is still battling a global pandemic and the war is far from over.\n\nHere in Canada we are mostly in lockdown, and sounds outlandish to hear these plans of sending kids to summer camps. Summer camp is basically parents spending money on their children for kid vacations. But if you do not want to go, then it sounds like they might just want you out of the house for their own staycation. \n\nCome up with an alternative. Go stay at grandma's house or with your cousins for a couple weeks instead. Thanks for the suggestions, but it would not work. The camp is church-sponsored so it is free and they really want me to go because of that. I can try the second one but I am really broke. Have you tried them, do they work well?", "Silence Is it just me or are you triggered by silence. Like if everything is realy quiet I cant cope. Mabey its what you can hear in silence. I am not sure if it is ever been truly silent, I do think it is the things we can hear in the silence. If the room is quiet while we take a test, keyboards keys clicking, the occasional pencil scratching, and sniffing all bug me ceaselessly. Maybe it is because you can expect a trigger at any time? I feel uncomfortable in silence because maybe I will focus on people talking outside or just things that I normally can ignore. For me, some background sound makes me feel at ease ,because even if there is a possibility of a sound being made, I am still protected you can say. I start to hear my body, heart thumping, ears hissing. Still I enjoy the silence, no sound no vibration.", "My amazing niece is helping raise some awareness. She has known about my misophonia since she was very small. She is in college now, and is doing a pretty serious term paper on it, and also plans to do more to get this on the radar for people at her campus. I just wrote her a bit to add from the perspective of a misophone.\n\nThe more people do to get understanding to be there, the more awareness... the more hope for those of us that live with this. I just wanted to offer a tiny spot of goodness. So many people have families that just do not get it, do not care or worse. Maybe once misophonia is more understood, people will take on board that this is serious.\n\nLove and quiet to you all. \u2665 WOW, your niece must be amazing, does she suffer or is she doing this purely of wanting to do somthing She does not have it. But sure has seen me struggle, and has seen people be insensitive. She is just really good people. We would need more people like her in our world That is wonderful, kuddos to her! That is awesome. :)", "Anyone had success with Somatic-based therapies, or EMDR, or Brain Spotting?? Hey there, Miso community. I have been in talk therapy for YEARS surrounding my misophonia and while it is been helpful on several fronts, I am wanting to explore more body-based treatments. Seems that some of what we experience in response to triggers is similar to a PTSD or Fight/Flight/Freeze response... and wondering if EMDR, brain spotting or more somatic therapies may be helpful. There is SOOO much coming out now about brain plasticity and the ability to re-wire neurological connections. Surely there is some hope for us within that area of research and treatment.\n\nHas anyone had any success with EMDR, brain spotting, or something similar??\n\nThanks so much! Sending you all peace of mind and an open heart. Sadly I do not know if any such treatments are available for misophonia, it is still relatively unknown in a lot of the medical world too. Slowly it is becoming more known. Anyways, whenever treatments like that become available I certainly want to know. I will be the first in line! My Son has worked with Dr. Hatch in Utah. We have found that his exercises to help re-wire neurological connections ARE working for his misophonia.\n\nWe still have a couple months worth of exercises but like the direction things are going this far. You can ask most therapists to do EMDR with you. Granted, its more for traumatic experiences, so it would probably be better to use EMDR for a particularly terrible experience involving misophonia, but no gaurantee it can help in severity at all. I have done several sessions of EMDR for processing trauma. It was POWERFUL, my brain just...shifted. It was stronger than most drug trips I have been on honestly, but felt 100% safe and controlled. Since moving, I have not been able to find another therapist in my area who does EMDR but I would absolutely do it again for the miso. It might not work for everyone, but the way I am wired it absolutely helped me with the ptsd. What kind of neurological exercises is he doing?", "TW// i have been feeling overwhelmed and decided to draw how it actually feels to live with misophonia ", "A got assigned to a college suite with a kitchen I did not want, should I ask to be reassigned? So this is hard because I have already found a roommate who has the same major as me and does not drink/do drugs plus has similar interests to mine. We get along and I do not want to just ditch and play roommate roulette hoping that whoever I get is not a complete jerk.\n\nThat being said I will also have two suite mates I know very little about. Plus I would have to pay an extra 2k a semester for a kitchen area I really do not want (as some of my most triggering misophonia sounds are food related and I do not plan to cook as I will not have time anyways).\n\nI am honestly annoyed at the college for this because I payed my room deposit early so I would get priority choosing and then they dump me here.\n\nIf you guys recommend I switch do you know any good ways to break the news to the person I was supposed to dorm with? \n\nThanks You need a letter from your doctor specifying a single room without roommates or a kitchen as a disability accommodation. Colleges cannot balk at the ADA. \nThank you for your response. Do you know how I can go about doing this? I heard getting an actual diagnosis is pretty rare since most doctors know little to nothing about misophonia. The diagnosis is not the key thing. The key part of the letter is that your doctor says you have a disability that would impact your ability to be successful at school, and that a single room is a necessary accommodation. You can also have the doctor include quiet test area, noise canceling headphones, or just earplugs. We asked our family physician to write it, he did, and it is on file with the college. Done and done. Oh damn I literally saw my doc today for my annual physical, I coulda asked them :/", "Cannot tell my dad about my triggers So I live in an Asian household where respecting parents is a huge thing and speaking out against them in any fashion is really looked down upon. I have been able to talk to my brothers and my mom about my triggers, but I cannot mention it to my dad because if I tell him that the sound of him chewing or sniffling bothers me, I know he will take it as a personal insult and get really upset. My response is to usually to leave the room if he is chewing or sniffling really loudly, and he is kind of catching on but he does not know the exact reason that I leave in such a hurry. He is getting upset that I just get up and walk away for \"no reason\", but he would also be upset if I told him that he is the reason that I am doing it. I just feel like I am stuck in a pickle bc no matter what I end up doing, I know it is going to offend him :/\n\nAlso, I know that I should be able to tell him about this without fear, but it is just so deeply ingrained in me to not directly call out my parents (especially for things that they cannot control) that I would just feel  like the bad guy. \n\nIt is a disability if it disables you. If you were deaf, in a wheelchair, blind, whatever, he would care and would do whatever he can to help. You cannot carry this alone, you need tools and you need support. To get those, you must ask. You are at an advantage in that you can have your brothers and mother with you when you talk to him about it. Let him know what has helped, and what he can do to help. He should prefer that you tell him instead of running away. \n\nAnd most important, you have more courage than anyone you know. Nobody could deal with your problem with as much courage as you have. Never fear honesty. Thanks for the encouragement and the advice! I appreciate it :) Just remember that there is no shame in asking for help from people that have the ability to respond with help. Respond Ability. Their Responsibility.", "idk if you all have seen this but there is this YouTube ad for krystal that features &gt;!a woman loudly whispering while someone crunches on food in the background!&lt;. absolute nightmare, makes me yank my earphones out every time. unskippable ads are pure evil Pro tip: have sound on mute when you click on a video. Unfortunately sometimes it is unavoidable as we are busy doing something else so yanking the shit out of our ears is the only survival technique left then lol. oh that is a good idea, im going to start doing this lol I just looked up the ad on YouTube, thank god I do not get these ads... Crunching sounds are not even a trigger of mine and I still cringed into the bottom of my chair\n\nGetting a triggering advertisement before opening a white noise video is the worst, I hope Krystal goes bankrupt.", "How do you handle upstairs neighbors, without moving? Just like the title asks. I am at my wits end.. Loud fan, white noise machine, ear plugs, music, noise cancelling headphones, list goes on I am sure. \n\nOther options include talking to your neighbor. The only thing on that list I have not tried is the noise cancelling headphones.. not sure how much they would help for the price, and also wearing them 24/7 while at home would be the only way to get complete relief, which is impractical.  I use the airpod pros. Noise cancellation + music. It is my number one way to combat triggers and very much worth the price. Easy to pop in and I really do wear them all day. Other cheaper options exist too.\n\nSometimes weed and drinking help take off the edge for me. Not sure how else to help, there really are not many practical options in this case. Best of luck though  Backing up the Airpod Pros. Convenient, weigh nothing, and have really good noise cancellation for such small earbuds. Those with memory foam tips are crazy good for what they are. I also have Sony WH1000XM4's which have better noise cancelling, but are over the ear headphones and can get hot/cannot really move around as much with them. But I have found both to be essential to blocking out upstairs noise that would typically get under my skin. I just wrote a note to my upstairs neighbor yesterday, and we are now working things out. It never hurts to reach out!! Just make sure your note is straightforward and upfront enough to get your point across, but without being rude. Smiley faces help. The last place I lived at had annoying upstairs neighbors also... I wrote them a note and they made me cookies and left them at my door the next day!! It is worth a try!", "Any advice on helping an SO learn to eat more quietly? First time posting here, I hope this is the right place.\n\nMy SO chews with his mouth open sometimes and will kind of smack his lips between bites, and it drives me crazy. Normally we watch TV while we eat dinner so the noise is offset by that, but there are still plenty of times we want to eat around each other *without* the TV on. Sometimes he will want to eat in bed and I end up either kicking him out of the room (which makes him feel bad) or just trying not to notice it (which makes me feel resentful). Sometimes I can hear it even if he is in another room, which also sucks. \n\nWe tried having me remind him when he was eating with his mouth open so he would make a conscious effort to stop, but that led to me being hyper-focused on his chewing which was counterproductive. I have also asked him if he can try to eat more slowly/be mindful while he chews, but he does not think that will help. I am just having a lot of trouble finding resources on to help adults learn to chew with their mouths closed, and I really do not want to continue nagging my SO about this constantly. Just eat seperately. If he is not a clingy co dependent guy he will understand. Sorry, that is not an option for me; I like cooking and eating meals with my loved ones too much for that. I would not let him eat in the bedroom.  That is how you attract ants/bugs into your bedroom.\n\nDo you know if he is taking bites that are too big?  That is what caused my sister to smack her lips when she was growing up.  You might look at that or if there is a mouth/dental issue that causes this.\n\nI would either try to teach him to slow down and eat like an adult and not a toddler. Purchase a cattle prod that you can poke him with every time he eats without manners, it will send out a small electrical current every time you prod him with it...he should learn pretty quickly \ud83d\udc4d DO YOU WANT ANTS\n\n\nBECAUSE THIS IS HOW YOU GET ANTS\n\n\n\n\nArcher reference for anyone who does not know I wish I had advice for you, but I can only offer sympathy because I am in the same situation. My SO has permanent nasal issues to where he can barely breathe out of his nose and thus he always eats with his mouth open. It is horrible. I have coped by turning on a podcast while we eat, or at the very least focusing on making a conversation that involves decision making so I am adequately distracted (\u201cwhat should we have for dinner tonight\u201d, \u201cwhat should we do over the weekend, \u201cwhat should we do about this issue\u201d etc. Then at least I get breaks while he talks! \n\nGood luck! We love them but man it is upsetting. I position myself to the right of my SO and then put an earplug in my left ear. With the TV on, I do not hear any chewing or smacking noises! I use subtitles while watching tv, but we usually use subtitles anyway so NBD. Try it out :) I understand, and I suffer with Misophonia, and unfortunately the only solution is to not eat near him or to just deal with it. Just dealing with it will cause resentment. It is been a long journey with my SO.  She is not an obnoxious eater by any means but my irrational response to normal eating sounds has caused us to have conversations about it. So, my advice is that even if they eliminate the obnoxious stuff, it wont be enough do you need to figure out a team response when living with someone. I have tried to be very open and honest about how I recognize that it is irrational and I know it, but so uncontrollable that I cant find the words to describe it.  She gets it and we manage around it.  No chips and salsa together, music while we eat, she doesnt eat the crust on pizza.  I feel bad but she is a saint to doing what she does.  We have joked about her salsa and chip and popcorn nights when I am traveling for work.  We manage, I try my best to deal, and she contributes the most. It sucks. Thank you, this is actually really helpful. I think you are right that a team response would be best; having an open conversation and then setting boundaries based on what we each think we can do to help could make the subject less touchy. Have you considered using earplugs while eating? I have been using those during 'social meals' (parents back in the day) since I was around 20 or so (early 40's now). I occasionaly pop them in discreetly when I am over at my SO. Curiously, I never minded my own chewy sounds, thank Darwin...\nI have to mention we don 't live together though as in happy-together-apart :-).  I love to hear about a supportive SO who really invests time and effort into their partner. I think that is awesome. This also speaks volumes about how important transparency in a relationship is, especially about things that are complicated and can be hard to talk about.", "How to drown out or cancel deep bass sounds Has anyone had success drowning out or better yet canceling deep bass sounds.

Y e s, its still a trigger, one of the most common. Yeah, with misophonia you will usually just have a few specific trigger sounds that set you off really easily Even though misophonia is literally defined as \"hatred of sound\", you do not hate *all* sounds, just some specific sounds (or you may even have some sounds that only make you upset in certain contexts). \n\nThe sounds you mentioned are pretty common trigger sounds, and getting angry, enraged, or even aggressive is a common reaction to trigger sounds in people with misophonia. There is a beeping sounds at my supermarket, like a truck backing up. It is not as bad as Chewing/eating sounds, but very close.", "misprounounciations ", "This is me, i guess this is us! It is sort of comforting hearing this by a comedians perspective!   Omg and i just adore him even more now\u2764 Yes, he is great!", "I hate this. Why me? I cannot even have a normal dinner with my family. I have had it for a couple of years now, it started off with my moms sniffing, yawning, and coughing, and crunching on hard foods, I would get so fucking angry and irritated whenever I would hear her do that so I would mock the sounds and she would get mad at me for mocking her questioning why do I do it? I have never told her, even up to today. Then it got even worse with me getting annoyed and so angry with my dads sniffing, chewing, and coughing. I also mock his sounds too and get extremely frustrated. This sucks so much and it is running me and my parents relationships as a young teen, is there any other way than mocking them?? Explain what misophonia is and ask her to watch Quiet Please documentary. Try to just leave the room instead of mocking. If you can afford some good noise cancelling headphones, buy some asap. Thank u, i will keep that in mind. I also forgot to mention that I only get these triggers from certain people? like I really angry when my parents or little brother sniffs, but not some of my friends or other family members \n\nBe honest. \n\nAsk for help. I feel exactly how you do. The only way I can control myself is by jamming a finger in the ear facing my mom, or mimicking her noise, because I can drown other people out myself, but I literally, physically cannot chew or slurp or munch or whatever it is louder than her. My parents do not seem to notice too much luckily. I do not really know what you can do, just try to explain your situation and try to drown them out by concentrating on your own chewing without going over the top. I am fairly similar. If my friend yawns or scratches themself, for example, I may get mildly annoyed for a second but rationalize that they have no idea how it impacts me. When my family does it, it immediately causes me to get overwhelmed and want to self-harm\n\nMaybe it is repeated exposure? Like, at this point your parents should begin to understand that it bugs you, yet they /never stop/. Like how listening to a baby cry once is alright, but having to listen to it every day may drive you crazy. I hope your parents understand if/when you decide to tell them!", "Misophonia Guide For Doctors | Misophonia International ", "Airpod Pros are a game changer! So I have had some Bose QC35's that never could help me deal with my noise triggers in the real world due to the bulky size. My mom got me some air pod pros for my birthday and they are a next level game changer so I had to share with you all. The battery only lasts about 4 hours but the noise cancelling is actually better then the Bose QC35's over the ears. If my neighbors choose to blast music I no longer hear it with these in.  The small wins in life are major wins.\n\nI hope someone else finds relief with these as I did.\n\nBest wishes! I have the regular AirPods and I bought them for school since I am living in a dorm with a roomate and they work wonderfully for me! I mostly have issues with small noises (picking nails, whistling, tapping) so they have been great for me since they are not entirely noise cancelling so people can still get my attention if needed! Thank you for the recommendation!! Lately I have been thinking about buying noise cancelling headphones", "My brother's chewing and jaw clicking Every night around 12 or 1 a.m. my brother eats. And of course he wears headphones, so God forbid he does not re-watch one of those stupud YouTube videos. Since he cannot hear himself eat because if the headphones, I have the feeling he chews even louder. The way he breathes in the food, the chewing, slurping... and the clicking of his jaw (our dad has that too. It clicks every time they eat)! I just want to (at least) scream at him. If I can leave the room, I do. Or put my headphones on. If I cannot, I push my nails into my hand and try to concentrate on my breathing. The sound is unbearable and makes me angry.\n\nThen, when he is done, he wants to start a conversation with me but I am still trying to get over the sound of him eating. He asks me why I am angry and I say he is imagining it.\n\nI have tried to tell him that he eats too loud for me but he does not get it. He points out that I am a loud chewer as a joke every now and then (I am not).\n\nHe just finished eating for tonight. What a relief! My step dad does the same thing when he eats, the smacking, the breathing, the jaw clicking. It drives me so crazy and I just want to scream or sometimes I even want to smack him. I feel you. My brother does it only when he has headphones on, which is basically whenever he is eating alone. It makes me furious every time I do want to smack him but, you know, I should not so I will not. Should be legally allowed though.", "Need to get this off my chest I am a teenager and it is just so hard to deal with all these sounds. My mom used to never really cough so much but starting last year she is been coughing a lot. It is not because of covid or anything but because of her allergies and chronic cough. I understand she cannot control her cough, It is just that it sounds so bad when she coughs and she never covers her mouth with her arm, instead she covers her mouth with her hand. And my dad does not even cover his mouth, he just coughs and it is so loud. Same thing with burping as well, like my family would burp and it would be so loud. And all that just bothers me. Whenever my family chews food I cannot stand the sound of it because they never eat with their mouths closed and all I hear is smacking. Especially my dad, he smacks so loud all of the time. And whenever my family is eating, they always lick their fingers and then go touch stuff without even wiping their hands with a paper towel, or they eat something that is shareable like chips or nuts, lick their fingers and put their hand back in the bag, and it is like at that point I do not even want to eat it anymore because they have already put their wet hands in the food. Whenever we have dinner at the kitchen table I do not even sit at the table anymore, I just sit at the bar and eat with my headphones on so I will not hear them smacking. I have tried telling them like can they stop smacking so much, or cover their mouths correctly, or not lick their fingers, but they just ignore me, or say get over it, or look at me like I am crazy. I have never told them that misophonia is a condition because I feel like they would just say I do not have it or not take me serious. I just needed to vent here because I have been feeling this way for longer than a year but have never been able to talk to anyone about this because no one I know has this feeling. This condition has just given me intense anger at times to just feeling low because I feel like there is nothing I can do. I am currently 16 right now and the only thing that would just completely free me from this feeling would be to move out when I am older. I love my parents and my sister, they are good people, and I am grateful for my family, but this is just something that bothers me a lot. It felt good to get this off my chest and if anyone could offer some support or give advice that would be greatly appreciated. Please no negative comments and only constructive criticism towards my family, as I love them dearly. Thank you to anyone who sees this in advance. I hear you, this hits home for sure, you are not alone. I am glad I am not alone. We will get through this together You are allowed to love and appreciate your family and still be frustrated. You are allowed to feel whatever you feel based on your situation. You are having a reaction which is one of the most human things to do, even if other people do not react the same or do not understand why that was your response. \nIt is tricky when it comes to chewing. For me, I feel like asking people to chew differently is too controlling and an unfair request. I am not sure if that is true or if it is reasonable to ask, to be quite honest. However, it IS reasonable to ask them to cover their mouths properly or not put their licked fingers back in a shared container of food. I do not know what to tell you about the chewing/licking/coughing noises because I am still trying to figure that out myself. But, separating yourself when you need to is a good step. I am not sure if this is realistic for you, but maybe you can ask them to separate a portion of food for themselves rather than eating out of the communal bag. Or, maybe when you get a new bag of snacks, you can separate a portion for yourself and ask that they keep that bit for you. Separating it in some way means they do not have to change how they eat, but you still can enjoy some of the snack too. If you are crafty maybe you can make people their own individual bowls they can use or even just make yourself some fun bags with your name on them for stuff you designate for yourself. If you are the one to separate it or make it easier on them in some way and still allow them to do what they naturally do, it is not unreasonable. This is a really difficult thing to deal with and it is very hard to understand how it can be so bad when other people don t experience the same thing. I do think that they could be more respectful about this issue as they should be able to see how it makes you feel, plus you are telling them how you feel. Maybe you just need to repeat yourself or be more direct. You do not necessarily need to name misophonia, but just describe how intensely it affects you and try and help them understand you are not trying to be a brat or inconvenience them, but that is important to you. Maybe you can write it out or draw a picture or try and find a comparison they could understand. Everyone has pet peeves so maybe use one of theirs as an example and just say this is your pet peeve but it is more than an annoyance for you and is really disruptive. I am not sure what you have already said, but it sounds like they are good in other ways, so maybe they will be more responsive to a confrontation and further explanation instead of something passive. It does not have to be mean or aggressive, just very direct. I am sorry. I know how hard this is. I hope there is something in here that helps, but we hear you here and we understand.", "Question about Misophonia  Hello  all, I had a question I wanted to ask, but it requires a little  context. Whenever I listen to, and sometimes read poetry, and listen to  some rap (At least what I have listened to and read) I feel  uncomfortable, repulsed, and I feel the need to find a way to mute the  poetry (such as leaving the room or taking off my headphones during a  Zoom meeting). I cannot remember when I started feeling this way exactly,  but I do know that this is something that has popped up over the years.  I am not sure if this is misophonia at work, but what I have felt seems  similar to what I have read about misophonia. I am perfectly fine with  listen to music and reading the lyrics, I actually enjoy listening and  singing along to songs that I enjoy. However when it comes to poetry,  and some rap, I find the opposite to be true.\n\nNow  to my question, is what I described something that has happened to  others who have been diagnosed with misophonia? Or has anyone else  experienced what I have or something similar? I have tried searching  online, but I have not found anything that matches what I have  experienced. Thank you for taking the time to read this. i cannot say for sure if misophonia is what you have, i am not qualified to determine that. I can advise, though, that if you experience anger (more severe, rage), irritation, disgust and anxiety (which are the emotions exuded from \"trigger sounds\") then it very well could be. just because your trigger is not common does not mean it is not valid.\n\nthough it could also be Metrophobia, assuming it is the aversion and not the fear kind of phobia. it very well could be both but with misophonia there is specific things about the disorder that are at play, with Metrophobia it could just be refined to poetry and the like. \n\nif i were to suggest or pick which one suits this situation i would say that if there is no other triggers except poetry and all alike then Metrophobia, but again i am not qualified to say if either one is the case. i hope you get to the bottom of this and that my view on this helped :) &lt;3 I am like this over certain words, for example the word \"low-key\" written down or spoken. Are there other triggers you have beyond this? While I have not yet been triggered by poetry, there are some people's voices that have a certain melody to them that is triggering for me. It is almost as if they would be reading poetry, but that is just how they speak with a kind of repetitive intonation of their sentences. I have not noticed a particular person's speech pattern affecting me like poetry does. There was a time when I was younger when I felt this way towards more common triggering sounds, such as tapping, humming, and whispering. But that was when I was in a classroom and trying to pay attention, or when I was reading and it was quiet. Thank you for your reply! I did not even know about Metrophobia. I am not sure which it might be, if it is either at all, but seeing you say that just because it is not common does not make it invalid makes me feel better :) I was/am worried that maybe I am just overreacting since it does not seem to bother anyone else that I know the same way.", "Need help :( Currently going to a school and a guy I sit next to in my RPE classes is constantly chewing gum + sniffling constantly (I can also hear him swallowing his spit so loudly it is disgusting) I do not know what to do. We cannot wear headphones in class and even when I block my ears I can still hear him, no one next/around us seems bothered by it, only me. I am not sure what level of school you are in, but I am assuming it is high school or the equivalent.\n\nMy daughter is 13, in 8th grade, and has misophonia. We took her to a specialist, who agreed she had it but gave us a diagnosis of hyperacusis, partly because misophonia is not an official diagnosis, while hyperacusis is. Having that background, I was able to speak to her guidance counselor, and the counselor drew up an accommodation plan, which included her ability to put on headphones, to leave a class if necessary, and similar things.\n\nI do not know if you have a diagnosis, or if you can get one, but I think that would be a good first step.\n\nRegardless, I think you should talk to your counselor or equivalent and explain the situation. If nothing else, it seems to me you should be able to change your seat in that class. Do your parents know about this, and can they support or advocate for you? I know it can be frustrating, but there is help out there, and you may have to work to get it, but it will be worth it if you can. Thanks for the advice :)\nI am actually in England so whatever the equivalent of college is. Ive been talking to my parents about seeing someone to help me and hopefully my school will allow me to do the things necessary for me. I hope so. I do not know what the rules are for accessibility in England, but I would hope they have some. \n\nAt a US college, there is usually a health/medical center, so perhaps you could start there if you have something similar. They might not be able to help you directly, but might be able to suggest a next step.\n\nCan you at least speak to your teacher for that class and change seats? Most likely, my RPE teachers really sweet so hopefully she will allow me to move around.", "Neighbours I am tired from the constant irritation from sounds that I spend hours trying to ignore. Physically tired, I am literally like falling asleep from the exhaustion. I cannot afford headphones, the current ones I have only partially blocked out sound.

I have mild misophonia, there is a lot of noises I can still tolerate. But the neighbours are making it hard just to be alive here, I cannot focus on anything and feel like crying. They are also a\\*\\*holes and not the type to listen if you were to ask them to tone it down. I hate it here man.

But on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays they will often be doing this until 5am or later. \n\nI cannot sleep when this is happening. Often I will listen to music to drown them out and give myself a headache with the volume. I have earplugs too, but they do not seem to do anything. Does anyone have any tips?

I keep finding myself choosing what to do with my time based on other people eating. Whenever I hear my dad start popping popcorn in the microwave, I know I have about 5 minutes to stop whatever I was doing and shut myself in my room with everything I am going to need for the next half hour, however inconvenient that is. I choose where to eat dinner based on where other people are not. I have to make sure to choose the first opportunity to get food as soon as I am hungry in case the kitchen becomes a no-go. Just now my mum started eating an apple, and I was planning to work on something in the dining room but I had to put down what I was doing and go hide out in my bed. It is not too major but it is still an inconvenience, and I kind of hate having any part of my life revolve around this bizarre condition. I think you would really benefit from noise cancelling headphones. I have a pair but they do not block out much if I am too close to the noise In situations like that, I will often put a white noise or pink noise track on repeat.  Sometimes there is a sweet spot where the bad noises are blocked out, but I can still hold a conversation with someone (not if they are the one eating of course lol). Oh that is a good idea. I think I will try that My daughter is also triggered by eating sounds and uses noise-canceling headphones and listens to brown noise during meals. She says it drowns out the sounds for her better than white noise, but yes, there are so many colors of noise to try.

I am seriously considering trying Lexapro but I am so scared of side effects. \n\n:( You do not have a dumb brain! I relate to this a lot. Thanks for sharing and sometimes it is good to just vent it all out. I cannot speak on medication, but if you feel trapped and completely miserable then you definitely need a change of some sort. But definitely something to discuss with your doctor because of side effect possibilities. Have you tried getting noise cancelling headphones? Or even just listening to white noise/soft playing music to the point where you can still participate in conversations and hear people talking to you? Either way I am here to talk if you need to! Best of luck &lt;3 Yeah I have been taking small headphones  to work with me and I play brown noise. It has helped me a lot. But sometimes I cannot hear when someone dings me on the phone because I also wear earplugs underneath already (I wear earplugs 24-7)\n\nThank you for reading my vent &lt;3 and your kind words. I appreciate you I see... That sounds rough :( and I am sorry that work is this way for you. For what it is worth I do not think you are a bum! I am fairly new to this thread and even misophonia in general. Always suffered from it but was not until a year or so ago I learned what it actually was. Even my phone thinks I am spelling a word wrong when I type it. A lot of people think I overreact or am being dramatic. It sucks. I hope you figure something out that works for you. I cannot stress enough though to ease into medication and speak to a professional before taking the leap. I am not anti-medication or anything but I am a firm believer that things effect people differently. What works for some/ safe for some may have differences with others you know? You are very welcome and feel free to message me any time if you need to vent! Thank you so much I appreciate you so much. I feel you 100% we need more awareness and education on this condition. The auto misspelling thing bothers me too. Like it makes me feel like our condition is not real.", "at me wits end ", "Bullying? I work in an open office environment, with only a few walls dividing up some of the floor where I work. I have noticed over the past few months that whenever I move between view of the walls, there is this girl who works in that area who coughs from time to time. Earlier this week, she coincidentally walked in front of me when no one was in the area and coughed. I do not even know her. Is this just a nervous habit for some people, or is it a way of satisfying their crave for attention? Anyway, it is annoying, and I do not have time for people's BS if it is the case, but I would just like to rationalize the situation for future reference so I can handle it better whenever it happens. habit cough, aka nervous cough, is a tic that arrives from anxiety. i doubt you are being harassed by a girl who does not know you, or your misophonia triggers.\n\nwith misophonia, you notice and analyse sounds a lot more, especially in a office environment. i would hope this is a huge misunderstanding. I figured as much. Never really got the purpose of nervous coughing, as from what I have observed, it just worsens the mood of the situation and the people involved. As for habit coughs, since that is more of a health-related condition, that is understandable. But yeah, knowing this now will definitely help me dismiss this sound while I am at work. Thank you. I have found that filtering inconsequential noises as white noise in my mind (by silently repeating a mantra of sorts) has immensely helped with my focus and mood. i will have to steal that advice from you!\n\nalso, nervous coughing is not something that is controlled. it is the same as nervous laughter in a way, you do not control it and it usually makes a situation worse. My coworker actually has a habit cough as well, and when I brought up to my therapist how much it drives me crazy, she said the same thing as /u/lillypaddd, that it might be a nervous tic due to anxiety. I had never thought of it that way before, but it makes a lot of sense because my coworker has told me before that she has anxiety. I wonder if these people becoming aware that their constant cough might be a nervous tic would help them get rid of it?\n\nI know I am commenting a bit late - is your coworker still coughing? I have had another coworker in the past that has coughed only whenever she speaks to people at work. A few months later, I found out that she was dealing with anxiety big time. The coughing was gone at that point, so I assume she may have either realized it herself, gone to a therapist, or someone else brought it to her attention. I never asked her the particulars because mental health can be a sensitive topic, especially for someone recently diagnosed (speaking from personal experience here).\n\nI do not think the coworker mentioned in my original post is coughing anymore. My work has gotten quite busy the past few weeks, so paying attention to extraneous distractions have been the last thing on my mind. I got sick a month ago and had to deal with an almost constant cough the entire time, which really annoyed me, but it put the way I perceive this noise in perspective. Coughing can be attributed to various causes, and I have noticed more often than not that it is beyond the coughing person\u2019s control. Thinking of it this way and reminding myself has also really helped me from becoming needlessly fixated on the noise.", "IM SO EXCITED! I finally found a support group and I could not be more happy!! Back story down below (repost due to wrong sub) I hope this is allowed I saw the no venting rule, but I think the backstory of how I found out is different. If not let me know and I will move it over to the other group!! On mobile so sorry for any formatting issues. \n\nMy first memory of my misophonia was around the age of six years old. I remember the intense feeling of anger filling my stomach in response to hearing my bestfriend, who is a notorious smacker, eating. I remember asking her to stop, I remember she tried, and then i remember hitting her when the anger bubbled out. Of course I got in trouble, but I kept trying to explain that I could not help it, but no one believed me. \n\nI told my parents what happened, and they told me I was being dramatic and that needed to get over it, but it just got worse. There is an incident I remember, though my family will not agree with me that it actually happened, and who knows, maybe it did not. It started with all of us sitting on my couch-my mom, dad, and sister- we were eating dinner in front of the tv per usual. My dad loved to crunch ice sprinkled with lemonade powder over it, and even though he had done that all my life, something about this night was different. I tried to hold the boiling feeling that was sitting in the depths of my stomach in, but I failed, and I just started crying begging him to stop. My sister thought it was hilarious and rushed over to smack right into my ear; they all thought I was making it up. I ended up hitting my sister that night, along with hitting myself while crying. There are many more incidents like this but this is getting too long. \n\nThe icing on the cake, for me at least, was when I found a post on Facebook. It has to have been at least eight or so years ago since I saw it, but it was a picture with the words MISOPHONIA in bright letters, a definition underneath, and bullet points of symptoms. I was over joyed! Finally I had a name to prove I was not crazy! I rushed in to show my mom, but she just laughed and said she did not believe things that show up on face book. But get this you all, she now tells people she has misophonia. Her reasoning? It annoys her when the dog licks his paws, that is it. One trigger and only annoyance. I do not know why, but this is the thing that annoys me the most. \n\nI know this is long but I want to end on a positive note. Since I found the term for misophonia I have been able to learn how to handle it better. My friends have been so so supportive, they will go out of their way to eat as far from me as they can, or check in with me to make sure they are not becoming a trigger even though I have never asked them to. I have been able to point people to resources when they do not understand what I mean when I say it is more than just an annoyance it is a physical feeling I get-a boiling hot white rage or complete shut down of everything. I am so excited I have found you all. I have never known anyone else who has this and it feels good to know I am no longer alone. Thank you for this. Great post. I hope I will be able to find some help here, too so I can help others as well. What a family.", "My dad chews so damn loud He chews so fucking loud and then calls me attention seeking when I want to cover my ears. He is so rude about it. I do not know if I have misophonia or whatever, but I cannot stand the sound of chewing. I am in the other room and I can still hear it. holy shit I have been there. It is very frustrating. Unfortunately I do not have any advice other than I moved out of my house as soon as I could and never regretted it. Once I graduate highschool, i will be off to college and hopefully be free of the loud chewing of my family memebrs LOL! hi yeah i really understand the position u r in. i understand not everyone may be in an accepting environment, so this may not work, but i approached my mother quietly and privately with the same issue, and explained how it affects me (for me it was first a flight instinct, and has since progressed to scary and intrusive thoughts) and we agreed that i was either able to listen to music in earphones for background noise to help drown it out, as well as/or eat in a separate room with the door closed. sometimes it helps to maturely approach the situation and explain it so that ur family can see how uncomfortable it makes u. obviously this is only a short term solution but it worked for me, and maybe you could try it too :) Same. I am trying to keep myself away from those noises with headphones. But the song finish, i am going crazy. i am sorry for swearing but f*ck... This is a problem for me as well, in that I have a family member who is an incredibly loud chewer. I do not tell them that they are bothering me because it is just natural for them, and they already have severe depression so I do not want to make them feel like they are literally *eating* or *breathing* wrong. I am sure that if I told them, they would try not to be so irritating, but they are very kind and considerate to me and I do not want to bother them. I cannot wait till I can get my own house and live alone in peace, and I wish I could help you. lmao my dad told me to shut the fuck up ahhahahahah I can relate to this, my dad was such a heavy breather I could hear him all the way through movies, car rides, family meals etc.\n\nMoving out at 18 was the best! \n\nAre you able to find any earplugs? You can wear them in such a way that blocks out most sounds but still hear conversation if you do not shove them all the way in. \n\nIf you have long hair to cover your ears, sometimes you can do this without people knowing! same every time it is so loud I tell him to shut up he screams at me my fucking home I am so perfect  I want t to punch him to fat land like he is so fat and makes nose that are so loud when I am on a call with my friends same I can hear it from the other side of my home I want to punch him in the jaw", "Weird Visual Trigger I suffer from mild Misophonia and recently realized that Misokinesia is a thing and I have certain triggers for that too, but can a visual non movement trigger be classed as Misokinesia. \n\nI basically have an aversion/repulsion/serious dislike to facial skin growths like moles or warts or even like just skin colored bumps. I get super uncomfortable looking at them and randomly find myself thinking about them later and how it would feel to touch them. It sets my teeth on edge, and I get irrationally angered that they have not had it removed.\n\nSo I am wondering if anyone can enlighten me as to what this falls under. I just had a similar post rudely deleted because \u2018it is not Misophonia\u2019 but then what is it? Is there a word for it? And does anyone share this weird trigger? \ud83d\ude16 Perhaps what you are describing could be diagnosed as a phobia? You are having the same reaction as misophonia or misokenisia.  All triggers are unique to you and your body. You use the same tools and techniques to deal with it, whether it is \"official\" or not. \n\nThinking about triggers as weird or unacceptable makes it worse in my experience. I try to say \"oh I am learning about myself right now\" without forming a judgment. It really helps. Oh shit. Finally somebody who is grossed out by this. I have never met another. When I was a kid, I had to shower with my mother. She had thirteen raisin-looking moles (even the word, unless it refers to a rodent or a spy) that truly disturbed me. At age 8, I noticed that a flat dark spot above where a breast would later grow was becoming raised. With no anaesthetic whatsoever, I sterilized the skin and the biggest needle I could find, and went to town, picking out bits of skin until it was nearly gone. The wound left a little scar, which remains infinitely preferable to....skin raisins.\n\nI do not like raisins, either. That made me pull a face just reading that \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude02 Oh there is a word for that too? I struggle with small repetative movements which I find distracting. I feel terrible about having that too.\n\nSmall movements like foot swinging and people chewing (which goes along with my misophonia). I have to look away and I feel like an asshole. \n\nI wish I could fight this condition. I have tried hard but fail. :( The harder you try to fight, the worse it gets. Look up Misokinesia and ways of coping, and join the r/Misokinesia group on here. As soon as you see other people sharing your discomfort it will make you feel a lot better.\nYou are definitely NOT an asshole. Aye. It is just my family. I have told them about the misophonia but they just get mad and sometimes purposeful chew towards my ear. They definitely will not deal with the misokinesia then. I just end up feeling bad when asking for understanding.\n\nMy Dad thinks I am asking him not to eat. I am just asking for a bit of space and understanding. I suggested I would print info out about it but he refuses to read. \n\nWell until I can afford to move away again, I have to cope. But even then I want a relationship, friends, a job and of lucky, a family. No desire to be a hermit. But it is hard to get people to understand sometimes. It makes me feel like an entitled brat. I know you are right i cannot help it.\n\nNone of us are entitled brats really. I am glad there is understanding communities here for support though. I will join that one. Respectfully, that is on your dad and not you. If he refuses to even try to understand what is bothering you, that is something in him and not something you are doing wrong. \n\nIs there another family member that is more understanding that could help make others more supportive?\n\nAlso you can look into speaking with a therapist. I have seen lots of online stuff now where you do not even need to go to a drs office. Having used a therapist myself for other issues, I cannot tell you how freeing it is, especially if you get someone who can explain why your family might be reacting the way they do. My sister has it all to some smaller degree so she understands. My family know I cannot eat meals with them (it is a shame though). \n\nHe agreed one time to help. Music at the meals, maybe me wearing bone conducting headphones at a meal to help (affording them is another story but I may be able to apply for some government funding in the UK to get something to help with my anxiety).  But he is forgotten since. It was my mum who chewed in my ear. It is difficult but right now moving is still a distant option for varying reasons.", "Fiance discovered my misophonia So I recently moved in with my fiance. We sit next to each other when we eat dinner, when I am eating it is fine, I can ignore other people chewing, but I often finish my dinner before her and then I sit there and hear her chewing,\nthis is one of my main triggers and when I lived with my parents they used to set me off all the time, but I would just tell them to stop smacking their lips or whatever. But I did not want to be rude to my fiance so I kept quiet. \nHowever the sound of her chewing would literally travel down to my shoulders and make me twitch or shiver with stress and she noticed, I told her it was nothing but it kept happening until I had to tell her. \nI explained that it was my issue and something I just have to deal with but now she gets upset if she thinks she is triggered me \ud83d\ude2b I feel like I have ruined dinner time. As a 50 something year old married person, I would say it is actually great that you two are discussing it. It is a tough condition for those who do not have it to understand what it is like. It is an opportunity for the two of you to learn together how to have a relationship with your misophonia. You can both start to learn how to work with it now, and then it will not be such a thing in the future. Personally I hate that I told my wife about it because she apologizes whenever she notices she is making a chewing sound. It makes me hate myself a tiny bit more every time she apologizes. She is not doing anything wrong, and ironically finding out about the condition was a huge part in me realizing that people are not \"smacking their lips\" they are just eating normally (for them), it is just our reaction that makes us characterize it as though the other people are doing something wrong or acting in a way to intentionally upset us\\*. I grew up complaining about my parents eating too loudly, my friend being really loud, my girlfriend and then wife doing it... all that time it was just me.  \n\n  \n\nGranted there was one coworker who literally chewed with his mouth open constantly and that was gross.. so there is a limit. There was another guy at work who sounded like he was dislocating his jaw and pushing the food down his snake-like gullet but it was so bizarre even though it was also misophonia.  \n\n\\*yes, people do it on purpose after they find out and fuck them. My partner has it and we are struggling to sleep in the same bed at all, which I find really sad. Do people have any success treating misophonia or do we just have to live around it now do you think?", "What do I do with an environment I cannot change So my uncle is not the nicest person in the world, and he is aware that stuff triggers me audibly, so I believe he takes advantage of our rooms being right next to each other and the bathroom too and does obnoxious things that will for sure make me suffer. Examples are every morning before work when he gets up he goes to the bathroom and he gets ice and starts poring it in cups and pores a good amount of ice from hight into the bathroom sink and does all he can to make this last for a couple minutes, and this happens early in the morning so it never fails to wake me up and start the day off terribly, and that is half the issue because later at night he will then stay up watching action movies and he bought these speakers that shake the house and stays up from 10-2am stops at 11 on good nights. I have tried to block the sounds with like headphones because I can also feel it shaking the whole room and this shaking sound it make my floorboards make this loud rattling noise and it is just that rumbling sound is so anxiety inducing and not just annoying, I try to talk to him about it and he kind of just mocks it. Try to talk to my parents and they do not care, I am trying to move into the basement because I would be pretty far away from him and his crap and just the fact that my parents and not asking him to stop even though they have the power to do so shows me and makes me feel like they do not understand, care, nor do they even try to. I do not know what to do about this I have tried everything I can think of and the half ass responses my parents give when I ask them for help about this. My parents arnt bad parents but when it comes to this situation they do not care Idk why but they really just do not think it is a big issue and think I am overreacting, but I cannot say the same about my uncle he is always been a negative effect on my life. If you are comfortable with him, just ask him cannot he do these things in a more quiet way. I have and he mocks it Find out some \"nonsense\" thing he hates and do it every time he is around. See him go insane and make a deal that you will stop if he stops. An easy way to get in trouble with my parents, but I do not even know if there would be anything he would stop doing that for, he just enjoys it so much seemingly Sometimes I feel like there are not always reasonable solutions. Some people are just dicks and not everybody has a skillset to deal with such people. Also some people feel superior just because they are older. The best you can do is not do what they do to you, to the people who deserve it. \n\nI would suggest to not be afraid of getting into trouble with parents and if they will not understand even after that, then remember the injustice do not help them when they will ask you for something. It is up to you tho, but remember people will fuck you up and then act like it is your own fault, even your own parents. Alright but I really have no clue what would annoy him so bad that he would stop his bull shit for, plus he is the type of person who would just keep doing what he is doing already, but 10x worse than before even if his speakers do not go up anymore he would buy louder ones What a dick. I do not know if this would help you, but I have a headband I wear at night that has headphones in it (it acts as a sleep mask with headphones). I connect it to my phone or some other device and look up 10 hours of white noise on youtube. Whenever I have to share a room with someone, I use it, cause of snoring.\nShaking the whole house is just ridiculous, some people man.  There is always a limit on how much he can annoy you by just playing loud noise at a distant because if it is too loud, it would damage his hearing. If you want to block as much noise as possible and you can spend about $400 (for higher quality sound), use a noise-isolating IEM and wear a noise-canceling over-ear headphone with noise-canceling feature turned on. The total effect of noise isolation is slightly less than the multiple of two of them, but you might get at least 45dB less loud. I have seen things with headphones a lot, but the thing with them is that there is always this static noise and small beeping noises varied in loudness and timing that I can tell are not suppose to be heard and since other ppl i know cannot hear it I think it is like the insides working, like a power surges how u can hear the sounds of the insides while it is working. So I do not want to spend a bunch of money just to find out it is the same way bc all headphones and wireless ear buds any headphones that are bluetooth that I have tried make those noises. So do u know what those are called and all the research iv done was just beeping that was showing it is trying to pair or something I do not have misophonia, but a lot of people are very conceited. things that \u201care not a big deal to them\u201d supposedly should not be a big deal to others. They think that when people have certain triggers that cause extreme stress and anxiety it is just the person is being \u201cover dramatic\u201d. They do not realize how much stress and anxiety certain things cause you, because it does not cause them stress so they just assume everyone is like them and they do not take you seriously. They do not give a fuck, they will be assholes because *they* do not think whatever you are struggling with is a problem. \n\nIt is not only with misophonia. It happens with ADHD, PTSD, GAD, OCD, people who have phobias, APD, NVLD, and so many other disorders. For some reason they cannot wrap their head around people being different from them or having disorders that cause them to be hypersensitive to certain stimuli, just because they personally do not have it. I am sorry so many of you guys have to put up with that shit. It gets me so fucking mad. I would try to get outside support. You are already doing that now, so that is a great start! But I would try to talk to an school counselor or even your friends about this. Just make sure the counselor will not go blabbing to your parents about anything that you wanted to keep between you two. A good way to do this is to make sure they are licensed. \n\nBut if you have access to a therapist, I would highly recommend seeing them, online or in-person.\n\nHope this helps! It makes me sad that people who do this exist. My sister is exactly like this and gets the favoritism from my parents so I seem like the crazy one.", "My father in law is killing me slowly at the table while eating. Venting Mouth open, every single bite followed by a big grunting noise and slurping of even solid food like steak.\n\nWe have been adressing it with him, but he gets irritated when called out in a polite way \"I have always ate like that, why is it a problem now?\". The guy is 70y old, hard to change his ways... I just had to leave the table, he is not even trying anymore. No conversation while eating, just grunting and slurping.. no table manners whatsoever. Not even sure if this is misophonia problem, pretty sure everyone would have issues listening to this.\n\nThanks for listening, guys.

I am on mobile,  unfamiliar with most of the rules here, and cannot find them rn. \n\nWe need to lobby Sonic to remove this obscenity: a family of adults in a car that has just gotten their drive through order, which, IIRC, contains an ice cream dessert. The woman in the front seat jokes about the man in the back seat's \"smacking\". Where there is no overt, amplified smacking (an obscenity in itself, Matt Damon....), there are muted wet sloshy mouth noises from one of the car's occupants. This legit jacks up my anticipatory anxiety. I cannot hit mute fast enough.\n\nSonic uses this same setup to advertise another ice cream dessert, and there is one big smack in this one. All of this is rage inducing and hardly the sort of thing to joke about or view with bemused affection. It telegraphs the social acceptance of vile table manners and even propogates an unfortunate American trope, one I do not wish to describe further right here.\n\nWhen miso finally reaches the big leagues of liberal arts academe, I really hope it gets the treatment I believe it deserves.

Everyone keeps making gross eating noises and the keep on scraping their teeth on their forks (my worst trigger noise) I brought up that I might have this thing called Misophonia to my grandma when I still was not 100% sure I had it but now I know I do. She just brushed it off and I think I know why. I think it is because she refuses to believe that there is anything wrong with me. Or she thinks that I am just trying to get attention by copying my older sister because she has a mental illness and I want the same amount attention as she gets. IDK WHAT TO DO. I am so mad I cannot stand it. If I bring it up I bet they will brush it off. I got into a huge argument with my sister about how it is real and how she thinks I can just stop feeling this way. My dad really really tries to stop, and my grandparents do not even try because they do not know. What do I do?? Omg I know this feeling so bad, I wish I was there for you. Unfortunately you cannot convince most people about this ( same with my case) I think it is better to stay in the bathroom till dinner is over and say that your stomach hurt. Because everything is better than going back... This warms my heart. It is always nice to know that your not alone. Thank you Mee too, thanks.

Either different room or different time\n\n2: headphones lol. Any soft music with repetitive percussion and a little base will drown out most gross sounds, but still allow you to hear speech.

Depends on if you are willing to put up with that though That sucks! im really sorry :/ I do not know if I have any advice but I feel your pain I am currently in a similar position :(\nI cannot offer any advice but at least you can know you are not the only one.

It frustrates me to the core because my boyfriends dad does it SO much. My anxiety is through the roof and I do not want to just get up and walk away without being rude. I also do not want to tell them I hate whistling because I care about they think of me. I have not really found ways to cope with it, especially the whistling. I honestly do not know what is worse for me, the chewing hard stuff or whistling. I hate the teeth fork thing! I am so glad I found this subreddit, feel a bit more normal now. Yay!!

Unfortunately, with Misophonia I would recommend that you approach situations like this by considering what YOU can do to eliminate or lessen triggers.

I love him &amp; know he loves me too but he just cannot stop, he really cannot he does not have any self awareness.\nI am actually at a place now where my heart sinks as soon as I know my beloved dad is around.", "I am so pissed off I have been dealing with misophonia since I was 8-9 years old, I am almost 14 now and I feel like it is somehow gotten worse. Sometimes when the sounds of my family eating start to be too much for me, I will cover my ears or dig my nails into my skin, which results in my parents calling me disrespectful.  \n I HAVE to eat with them 90% of the time. Now I just smile and act like nothing is bothering me because I do not want to get yelled at. It is so difficult.\n\n  \nI told them how much the sounds bother me but they called it a phase. They even made jokes out of it, which was so infuriating. The sounds bother me so much that I self harm to deal with the anger and annoyance. But apparently, it is just a phase and I will grow out of it.  \nI just want to be taken seriously because nobody in my fucking family does. Ask them if you can talk to them, and tell them what you feel, and show them proof. Show them articles about misophonia and how it affects you. If you have a psychologist or someone who works in this area, tell them about it. If you do not, asking your parents for an appointment with one is not a bad idea. They may be dickheads, but they are still your parents and must understand this is not a joke. Do not feel guilty about it, because you are not. Misophonia is a disorder, not a joke, no matter how much some people make it to be.", "Why do people think it is a joke?! My triggers are mostly drinking and chewing. It makes my skin crawl, and I get irrationally angry. Sometimes I even want to cry. I feel like not a lot of people understand misophonia, what it is and what it is like. I think people just assume it is a pet peeve. I wish it was a pet peeve. Any time my roommate or boyfriend want to mess with me, or \"get back at me with a joke\" they will chew at me or make loud chewing noises. Every single time I try to explain that it is not just me being picky, they say they are sorry and understand, but they do not stop doing it. I hate it. Why do people not take it seriously? Ugh Because they do not understand. That is their problem. They just do not. They do not have anything in their life that truly interferes with their lives like this. They just do not understand. I feel you! This was my whole life growing up. It can take a while to actually let someone know how it affects you and when you do it feels like it is always met with ridicule (people always immediately start doing the loud chewing thing, what is with that!?) I have definitely cried on airplanes when I am stuck next to someone chewing gum, it makes life so hard sometimes. The following advice is only when they do it to \"get back at you\". If they trigger you accidentally this does not apply. Next time it happens tell them in no uncertain terms that it is \"offensive\" to you. Make it clear that it is completely unacceptable. Make it clear you will not accept it next time. When it does happen again tell them to \"go fuck themselves\" in the most aggressive way possible. Have a fight about it (not physical, obviously). If they still do not respect you, it is time to move on. I know this is much more easier said than done. Again, I am not talking about when they forget or trigger accidentally. The way I see it, if they cannot respect you this much you do not need them around, and they are probably pulling you down. My wife triggers me most days, but I am sure she is not doing it to target me - that is the difference. As others said, people just do not understand. The replies like \u201coh you can manage\u201d or \u201cdo not be so sensitive\u201d or anithing alike make me just as angry as the chewing noises.\n\nI am lucky to have parents who stopped chewing with their mouths open after I explained my problem. But the still do not \u201cget it\u201d. They are not able to comprehend what it actually does to me. If people have the ability to give a response that can help, then they have \"response ability\". If they help, when they can, great. If they do not help when they can, they are Rats. Be the Dog, eat the Rat. You deserve the help that they can offer, it is their **responsibility** to give it. If they do not, then fight back. I personally would get an air horn and blast it **every time** until they are trained to behave. It is your responsibility to take care of yourself in any way possible. You cannot be expected to deal with a wasp sting, why deal with their shit?\n\nI usually suggest this Letter to help you explain it, but it sounds like you are past that and just dealing with assholes who need a good slap, or you need to get them out of your life entirely. I wish you luck.\n\n*\"hey, can I tell you guys something? I have this weird thing called misophonia and it makes me panic when I am around gum chewing and pen clicking. I am pretty embarrassed about it but I cannot help it. Sorry but those are the two noises I cannot handle.\" -* (\n\n(\n\n*Letter to Friends, Family, and Co-workers:*\n\n(  Hi around, I am Dad! &gt; I am lucky to have parents who stopped chewing with their mouths open\n\nUm . . . were your parents toddlers?  How do people past the age of 4 think this is acceptable?  Misophonia or not, this is just extremely poor manners. I am at my mom's house right now and she is eating a grilled cheese right now, and slurping water. She chews with her mouth open and sucks and slurps everything. I know it sounds terrible but I get so enraged I want to tell her how fucking gross and disgusting she is. I have to leave the room. So tell her. You are worth it.\n\n*Letter to Friends, Family, and Co-workers:*\n\n( Thank you. Something I have been dealing with for close to 30 years since I could remember. I always knew my reaction to sounds was not normal. I am not generally an angry person, but the rage I feel from these noises is unbearable. I want to hurt someone when I hear them. Thank you for the link! Some here say it is like getting stung by a wasp. You cannot be expected to 'deal with it'.\n\nAsk for help.\n\nIf they are able to respond with help, then they have a responsibility. Demand it. Good luck.", "I need advice For context: I have both misophonia and OCD, both of which I generally handle well with numerous coping techniques which failed me today. \nToday started quite bad, I woke up with a massive headache and a little vertigo and found it difficult to socialize generally (I do not like talking in general when ill). A few hours later, some family members came over for a get together and (after showing and dressing) I proceeded to meet with them in the kitchen (along with my mother who was already sat down). Within minutes it was clear I was the only sober one there and trigger sounds were going to be a problem, with a large snack bowl in the centre of the table filled with bread sticks. I have told pretty much all of my family that I have misophonia, and as a result most of them were careful to close their mouths whilst eating. This however, notably exempt my mother who took it upon herself to make as many trigger sounds as she could in such a short space of time. Added onto this, she purposefully began rubbing my back/shoulders without washing her hands first (after eating), which is one of my big OCDic triggers rolled into one (grease/bacteria + physical contact in general). I told her multiple times that what she was doing was bothering me, she knows more than anyone else about my triggers ect., and despite my admittedly weak protests she insisted I stay at the table. Unfortunately the triggers did not stop, and after I told her to stop eating whilst talking (by this point I was next to her making coffee, she was seated next to my standing position) she opened her mouth and began to make the most triggering combination of sounds I have ever encountered (while spitting food everywhere, OCD trigger) and I am ashamed to say that I slapped her in the heat of the moment. Shocked, she proceeded to leave her seat and loudly made a scene about what had happened to my other family members before instructing them all to leave the room and join her in the garden. I chose at that moment to finish making the coffee, went upstairs and had an anxiety filled  I a bad person' conversation with my friend (she also struggles with various mental disorders) before returning to a fever induced, nightmare filled nap. Later my father came up and basically told me he understood that I knew physically hurting a family member was unacceptable (which I absolutely do know, make no mistake) but that I would have to win my mother over somehow, adding that I should leave a room if I was triggered (thanks for stating the obvious). The problem I have now is that I have basically no idea of what to do (context: I have not spoken to her or any other family yet), I feel like I really should apologise for snapping, but at the same time I feel that I need an apology myself, triggers are not a joke, they are not funny, it is a testament to my will power that this is the first time I have ever physically hurt someone/thing over triggers, and my mother really should not have acted in the way she did, being 'tipsy' is not an excuse. As a side note, it is been really nice reading this subreddit, it is weird to find somewhere or someone else who understands.", "May 20th WORKSHOP - \"Misophonia and Your Brain\" Ft.

If we did then bob\u2019s your uncle, we are \u201cnormal\u201d.", "HOW THE HECK DO I DEAL WITH MISOPHONIA AT NIGHT?! Every night, I have to go to my room and sleep. The problem is, I share a room with my sister, and she is my main trigger. I will not go into detail, but it is EXTREMELY loud and so triggering that I can hear it even with my headphones blasting music and my door shut while she is in a different room. So it is just GREAT when I have to be in the SAME EXACT FREAKING ROOM AS HER. I cannot get to sleep. I feel trapped. I am tired. I just want to go to bed, but I cannot. Please, if anyone knows anything I can do to help soothe these triggers, or block them out, or something, please share. I would do anything to just get a good night's sleep.\n\nAlso, I cannot just go tell my family about my triggers or ask my sister to stop because they know about misophonia from another experience not involving me that I will not share. Because of this experience, they think misophonia is pathetic and disgraceful, so talking about this to them is a big no.\n\nPlease help! I have not had good sleep in months! Ear plugs. Would it be impossible to sleep on the couch, or somewhere else? Since the age restriction in reddit is 13+ (I believe?) I can assume you are a teen +, so it is completely right for you to want your own space. Say that you want to sleep naked or something, hopefully they will listen?\n\nI sleep with my fan on, which blocks out noises from outside, but I doubt it would be too efficient in the same room as her.\n\nDoes she snore? Say you cannot sleep with her snoring. Or if she mumbles in her sleep. You can say you are a light sleeper and keep getting waken up. It is not specifically a miso thing to be unable to sleep with someone snoring, I think it is a universal struggle I dose bbc international on my ear buds there is cordless earplugs you can buy from pretty much any hardware store,not if you know woodworker or a construction worker then hit them up and ask for spares, they most definitely have spares.\n\ngoing with the plug theme, air pods... or even cheap knock off ones from Kmart (or wherever you shop) but if you can get hold of cordless Bluetooth headphones those will help a lot, especially ones with rubber buds and that are not solid piece bc it can damage your ears if you use solid piece. \nthere is also, for the summer time, a fan you can switch on.\n\nsomeone else mentioned asking to sleep somewhere else which i would highly recommend as that one would cost less effort / money. find a suitable place in the house if you can and ask to sleep there. even then i would still suggest earplugs/headphones as there is many background noises that can easily set you in a bad mood and give you an awful night's sleep. \n\nand last thing, I really hope you are doing okay. misophonia is draining, enraging and a good night's rest is deserved when we have all this crap going on. you. deserve. it. &lt;3 My family also used to be similar, not very supportive and thought misophonia was pathetic, and a lot of noises they made in the house prevented me from sleeping. I feel your pain it is extremely frustrating not being able to get a good nights sleep. I will say it is taken along time but my family has started to put in a little effort into being quieter at night. That is just to say it may not help at the moment but do not give up hope, they might become more accepting and adaptable over time.  Something that also helped me when I was struggling with triggers preventing me from sleeping was moving into a room in my house that was a little further away from everyone. I do not know what your options are but if you can find a different place to sleep that will probably help a lot. But anyways good luck and I hope things get better for you. One thing not to do at night is to watch most late night talk shows. All of the hosts are screaming these days. I cannot even watch them anymore and they are mistaking volume for energy. James Corden is off the charts, Jimmy Fallon, Steven Cobert, Seth Meyers - all yelling into the cameras. Not only are they not funny, they are unbearable, especially at night. Anyone else have to mute these people? Educate them baojt misophonia and what it really is. Show them scientific proof that it is not what they may think.", "Does anyone else have people who are trigger exempt? I am not sure that is the best phrasing for it. But through out my life I have had friends/family who did not bother me at all. Even when they did a trigger of mine to an extent that would drive me insane if someone else did it. Has anyone else experienced these magical people? I would like to know why they are so special. I have them. There does not seem to be a common denominator. I wish I knew. Me too, it really pisses my mother off, bc I cannot be in the room when she eats, but regularly take my grandmother to lunch- she has the table manners of a four year old- with no problems. I have these people too. I think it has something to do with how much I like them or how well I know them. Like I remember a while back when I was hard crushing on someone they were breathing loudly and I was not really bothered. That is my best guess tho idk This might not be the same as what you mean, but it is along the lines. I have high irritability during meal situations when people are slurping, clanking, talking with mouthfuls of food, etc. However, in family situations like ones that happened for a birthday recently, my little sister was driving me up the fucking wall, and my grandpa was acting the same way and I did not react the same. It might be a respect thing? Like I can tell me teenage sister to eat politely and not scrape her damn fork against the plate for every bite, but I would never say those things to my sweet grandparents! I guess it is more along the lines of \"Am I really going to speak my mind and tell this person how I feel about their noises or is it not worth me saying something I know they will find find offensive and I will feel embarrassed to say?\" I had this with a random stranger on the train once. He was sniffling up a storm and his particular sniffle did not bother me at all, it seemed like just another normal sound. It made me realize that is how sniffling must sound for everyone else in the world...just a neutral sound that comes and goes. Had a glimpse into the other side! Another sufferer has exemption for me. We both share the hate/fear of eating sounds but each of us have slight variations. I have zero problems if she makes a trigger noise in front of me because she understands what this thing is like and I know she did not do it on purpose. \n\nOther situation that is kind of common for me is at work. If the boss is an \u201ceater\u201d it is easier for me to accept, just because they are the boss. For me there seems to be a correlation with how I think about people. I hate the noises of my upstairs neighbour, from our brief interactions (saying hello on the hallway) I could tell he wanted nothing to do with me. I am a little torn on the new tenant next to me, he is clearly a nerd but he is also the type who communicates through shouting. I am trying to avoid building resentment. \n\nIt also seems place oriented for me. If I am out on the street or in a new place I will not notice or mind. But places where I spend a lot of time, which are familiar and considered safe, that is where I will get triggered because it feels like an invasion of my safety bubble. \n\nI think that assumptions or expectations of people should know better, combined with frequent exposure, can cause it unless there is a stronger redeeming factor at play. If my upstairs neighbour were hard of hearing and a kind dude I would feel less targeted than this unkind man who seems to think he is exempt of social behaviour because he can get away with it. \n\nFurther anecdotal proof for me is that my old flat neighbour, who sadly moved away because of what I now understand must have been miso too, was the best flat neighbour I have ever had. She moved away because she heard a low hum in the flat that could not be located, and it is only after she was gone I realised she may have heard the noise from the downstairs electric meters which I could hear resonate in a shared wall (I liked it because it was white noise to me). When we both moved in, she had a long chat with me about her previous flat, and we agreed on some things regarding noise. She would sometimes have a kid from the family over but it was never bad, and she taught the kid to be considerate. It is only now much later I realise she was pretty much a unicorn and how blessed I was to have her next to me for 7 whole years. I did not know how to really say goodbye when I learned she was leaving, I do regret I did not say anything, so I hope she found a better place to live or maybe got some help. She had to retire early and I think then being home all day just really took a toll on her. Yes. My mom, dad, and sister hurt me the most (indirectly ofc). However, my friends and most others could do some of the things they do and I literally do not care. It is strange and I think the only reason my biggest problems with immediate family is that I have been around them for so long i have time to develop these triggers. It makes life so much harder than it has to be and I just wish I understood more about why this happens to me. But in short yes some people are exempt from my trigger list. Yes, and let me tell you the honeymoon period can wear off, too.  One day out of the blue they can suddenly become the most infuriating person on the planet.  No warning. That makes sense Yeah I get what you mean, I feel that way too Lol wish I could live in that state forever It is somehow easier to deal with when it is someone who cannot help it/you cannot say anything Older people have been some of the most considerate I have met. I had a teacher once who hated the sound of smacking gum and would not allow it in her class, she was awesome. I have had that happen too My mom and brother drive me crazy, but my dad does not bother me at all. He is not an obnoxious eater, but even when he makes the noises sometimes it does not bother me. Yep, my partner. They have chewed, breathed, and tapped around me for years but it does not bother me. It is one of a million reasons I love them. They are so pleasant to be around. That is awesome :) My dog crunching kibbles does not bother me at all for some reason Maybe its because as we get older we cannot help certain things, or if we can we are just so used to them we could not change even if we try?  Like maybe your grandparents cannot help it and would never do it on purpose especially if they knew it bugged you?  Meanwhile your sister  could change her behavior if she tried (and should).  Also, like you said, a respect your elders thing. I totally agree with you. Yeah, like my grandma is never going to stop picking at her nails because she is done for 70+ years and it is not worth me complaining about it now lol. At the beginning of a relationship or friendship I am usually so blinded by either anxiety or excitement that I do not really notice that they do things that trigger me until it is too late. It never lasts forever though My trigger is mostly eating noises, and I have found that small children do not usually trigger me. My own toddler does not bother me at all, and I have worked in a daycare where I sat surrounded by tiny loud eaters and found it almost soothing. Yeah! They do not bother me either, weird is not it?  It is, especially since they are generally pretty sloppy eaters! Yes!! I automatically tell my little sis to close her mouth while she eats, though she is grown up now so her manners are totally fine, but she NEVER triggers my misophonia. My friends don;t either. Different story with boyfriends and family tho lol", "Aaah it is too noisy here I cannot stand it and now people online are saying I belong in an insane asylum but they do not understand I keep hearing the heat pipe in the wall making a repetitive noise in one room, and in this room I keep non-stop hearing the people upstairs dropping stuff on the floor and screeching furniture across the floor and kids stomping around and running around and coughing and I cannot stand it\n\n..... LITERALLY JUST NOW I HEARD the sound of furniture screeching on the floor.\n\nAnd my online friend on Discord told me that in the Discord server I used to be in, people saw my vent videos and they say I belong in an insane asylum and that people are going overboard in making fun of me there.\n\nBut it really is noisy here and I CANNOT STAND IT!!! AT ALL!!! Misophonia is real. Your friends do not understand it. I have a neighbor with a car alarm that JUST DOES NOT STOP. He does not care enough to stop it or to change the sensitiviy on his car. It ruins my day. I cannot watch a movie or do anything. One day I am going to knock on his door. what you are going through is real! it sucks major booty that people are being mean about and they have no idea what you are going through; they are insensitive assholes and you should not have to deal with that. if you can stay far away from the, yknow what im going to say it, bullies. do not let your friend speak of it. trust me as much as you want to know the shid they are saying it is best to move in life without having that stuck in your head. \n\nyou are struggles are, as much as I hate saying this generic word, valid. mental conditions are NOT to be taken lightly or made fun of. misophonia can be intense, it can ruin someone is life in a split second. it can break someone, emotionally, mentally and physically. it is an invisible condition, apart from break/meltdowns, which makes it worse. i do not believe you belong in an insane asylum. you are not insane. you are struggling and i am so proud of you for pushing through. psychiatric help and evaluation is what you may want to look into if you have not already. it does not make you weak or \"not normal\" or any of the bad stuff if you do want to seek help. \n\nfeel free to pm me whenever if it gets bad, i hope all gets better. &lt;3 I have the washer of dryer on constantly to block out the pipes clicking noise by the water heater. It makes me so angry and I do not know why. poor bastard on the bottom floor beneath me.\nNormally its sniffling,  coughing,  chewing, and my husband biting his nails . Even if I see him next to me do it without hearing it  it makes engraged. I know people already mentioned the things I am about to suggest but I wantrd to add my two cents. I would start with getting a white noise machine. It will not block things out 100% but it could help in taking the edge off of all the noises you are exposed to.\n\nSecondly, I would highly recommend therapy. It is been helping me with my misophonia, and my therapist has been teaching me coping techniques to reduce my anxiety. It may not cure your misophonia, but there are ways to reduce and manage your emotionally response.\n\nI hope this helps friend. Good luck, and know this community supports you and believes you! \ud83d\udc99", "Different responses to different triggers? I am a 26 year old male, and a music graduate, so sound has always featured pretty highly in my life. There are two specific kinds of sounds that elicit a strong response in me, and they are very different kinds of sounds which cause very different responses.   \nThe first is a pretty standard one, which is people chewing, especially if it is open-mouthed or particularly \"sloppy\". (On that note, I have just had to leave dinner with my father because he is *that* kind of chewer, and I could not handle it.) This one leaves me very irritated very quickly, and I can feel a sort of tapping through my body, if that at all makes sense.  \nThe second is the sound of a nail file, or some other kind of filing/sanding down sound. This is a lot more visceral; it feels like there are things inside of me which are desperately trying to claw their way out, I feel my skin 'shredding' down my back, and I feel very nauseous very quickly. This one is so bad that I cannot even look at someone filing their nails if I have got headphones in without starting to feel the same responses. I just find it very intriguing that these two things cause such different responses in me, and I was wondering if anyone else had similar reactions? Hi there! I am a musician as well (classical violinist.) I do have different reactions as well. I experience chewing sounds in a similar fashion. I could be wrong but I think we work so hard on being able to be around eating that we just get better at it. It takes willpower and meditation though! I have the other response with many other things like crinkling papers and wrappers and bags. I feel this sense of like a countdown where I can tolerate for a few seconds and then I am going to full blown panic once that time is up. And I often do.", "Feeling hopeless  I was around 9 when I first developed misophonia. I am now 40. So you can survive this. You will adapt more than you can ever imagine. I will not lie. It is tough life can feel like a complete drag when misophonia is at its worst. But hang in there. You are much stronger then you think. Also, do not keep it all to yourself. Find people you can talk too. You do not have to travel this path alone like I did. \n\nDo you wear headphones? I would strongly suggest this. Just at a level whereby you can hear people talk but enough that it takes the edge of the trigger noise. It is not perfect but it is a coping strategy. Explain to your teachers etc that they are are hearing aids for misophonia. They should understand. \n\nYou will adapt. And you will live a wonderful life. I believe in you.

Talk to your parents, or if you do not feel they will support you, a teacher or counselor at school, or even the school nurse. I took my daughter to an ENT, and was able to give that info to her guidance counselor, who drew up a plan for school. For example, she is allowed to leave the cafeteria and eat elsewhere if she needs to, or wear headphones to drown out noise in classrooms.\n\nOne thing that has really helped her has been wearing noise-canceling headphones and listening to brown noise. There are many \"colors\" of noise, and she says brown noise works better for her than white noise.

It is gotten so much worse over quarantine, and which used to be a few trigger sounds has now turned into every background noise imaginable. Going to class is a nightmare, every keyboard tap every heavy breathing I hear makes me tear up and want to call my mom to take me out of school. Sometimes I fantasize about going deaf. If I could find a way to do it I would. I do not think therapy would work for me but I need to try it.

I am adding this because it worth a watch in my opinion! Yes I muted those parts when watching. I agree they are very loud eaters :(", "A university in North Carolina is accepting participants in their misophonia research studies- one study is even for deep brain stimulation ", "My Parents Do not Take Me Seriously Because There Is No Real Treatment My mother kept saying that I would always be angry and claimed there was a cure/ treatment. I have tried repeatedly to tell her there is no confirmed treatment or cure but she does not listen. They get angry whenever I move away from them when they are chewing. My mother wants me to go to intense therapy even though I just got earplugs that I am going to use. They are treating me like I am irrational and I hate it. My mom implied that the phone is the issue, even though listening to music is the best way to cope. And there is no evidence that my phone is the problem. It is chemical and taking away the phone will not make me better. If anything I will get worse. I cannot wait till I am 18 and I can leave this hell. I do not need another therapist, I already have one that I talk to about it. I have told them how bad it can get (I am level 6) but they treat it as a joke. My mom even went so far to say that I LIKE this and that I DO NOT want a treatment for it. It is ruining my life and she thinks I enjoy it?! I cannot even believe how dumb that is. And then they wonder why I hate them. They literally treat this like it is phase, but it is not! They treat my whole life like a phase and I will grow out of it, but I will not. UGH! I felt this way growing up. It is HELL, I cannot lie to you. But when I had it, there were no support groups and 'misophonia' was barely a word. (And noise-cancelling headphones, those did not exist either.) At least you have us and we can help you feel less crazy!\n\nBut I am going to be blunt here.\n\nRight now, it sounds like your parents do believe this bothers you, but also believe you are chosing to ignore them like a sulky teenager (their perspective.) Like, imagine how rude it would be to go have dinner with a friend while they just listened to music the entire time. That is how they see it. They think dinnertime is family quality time. Basically, your parents are taking your actions personally even though it has nothing to do with them.\n\nI can suggest to make it less obvious. Use earplugs with your hair covering your ears. Make an excuse to stop eating dinner with them (ideal situation.) Look like you are not bothered.\n\nTry to find if other behaviors are upsetting your parents-- like you staring at your phone all the time. Maybe they want you to talk to them more about your day, instead of ignoring them with your music (that is how they perceive it.) **Before dinner**, like when dinner is being cooked, have quality time with your parents then (with no phone in sight!!) Talk about your day and make your parents feel like you care about them.\n\nOh, always do the all dishes after dinner regardless of if you are asked. Maybe you already do that, but it will help your parents realize you do not hate them. \n\nI know it sucks. I know it is NOT fair and they do not understand. I would suggest a therapist... but there is a good chance you will find someone who does not believe misophonia is real and sides with your parents (which would be a worst case scenario.)\n\nThese are just tips I used growing up... I do not know what your family dynamics are like! But this would have helped me. If your parents are offering paying for you to have talking therapies then please consider taking them up on it. This problem will not go away, there is no quick cure, it affects all aspects of your life. You will see the struggles members of this sub-Reddit have in working environments and with partners they love. \n\nI am pushing middle age and have finally started talking to a therapist for the first time. Understanding your triggers is the first step to putting in place some coping strategies. You will be able to find a way to manage the triggers. \n\nI urge you. Do not wait as long as I have. Do not spend your life running from your triggers. This is what I thought, too. If they want to fit the bill for a misophonia specialist, what is it going to hurt? If it does not help, you are back where you are now plus you would have the benefit of showing them you are trying. If it does help, it will be _LIFE CHANGING_ . \n\nThe other commenter mentioned it sounds like your parents' feelings might be hurt by your avoidance moreso than your misophonia. Which is like, you know, they are parents of a teenager, they should expect some pushback...but my point is that there is more to their harshness other than making you miserable. \n\nYou sound very frustrated, I am sorry you are going through so much turmoil. Power struggles between teenagers and parents are as old as time, we have all been there. Hang in there, OP. Thanks, I might use this.

One of them understand (10yr old) but the others do not care and often mimic me when I tell them to stop. does anyone have any advice? I would maybe talk to your parents so they can talk to your siblings? I would tell them that the sounds are painful, that some things hurt people differently. It hurts when they stub their toe or get a paper cut. Those noises hurt you even though they do not hurt them. Tell them that while you understand they are trying to be funny, it would be like you hitting them with a hammer to try and be funny I think the first thing you should do is talk to your parents, and I hope they understand and help you. Because it will all start with them. If you cannot talk to them, try talking to another adult. Maybe an aunt or uncle, or even a teacher, or tell your doctor the next time you have a checkup.\n\nI am glad your 10yo brother understands. It will be harder with the younger ones. I think this is probably hard for them to understand. I do not know what your triggers are, but little kids are going to be like, what? Why does this bother you? It does not bother me. Kids are pretty self-centered; it is just the way everyone is until we grow out of it.\n\nAlso, I think little kids enjoy the little power trips they might get from doing things that bother other people. And it is worse for you, since this causes an involuntary response. As an adult, if a kid does something that bothers me, I can wait it out, take a deep breath, whatever -- that is probably not an option for you. \n\nTry being patient, as best you can. Maybe when they are not making the sounds, and everyone is calm, you could try asking how they would feel if someone did something that bothered them. It might at least get them thinking about it.\n\nI am sorry I do not have anything more specific to suggest, and I hope you find some help.\n\nMy daughter is 13 and we think she has misophonia. She is found some relief at times by listening to \"brown noise\" through her headphones. Maybe you could try something like that (she finds the brown noise videos on YouTube).

I am 16 and I believe I have had misophonia since I was 10. It is odd, typical sounds like nails on a chalkboard or a glass plate scratching do not trigger me, but anything related to asmr affects my entire mood. I cannot stand daily life sounds of other people, from eating, to snoring, to breathing, to coughing, to itching. It is gotten to a point where I get mad at my grandparents even though they did nothing wrong because I cannot stand the sound of their deep coughs or the water moving in their mouths. I also cannot stand wheezing, and I do not mean to be a list at all but my mother has asthma and it makes me not want to be in the same room as her. Additionally the vacuum cleaner regardless how far makes me entirely lose my focus. It is crazy. I also have an endless list of accredited and awarded tv actors I absolutely cannot bear to listen to, and there for Beckett to finish tv shows. It is not just the S sound or the clicks K sound, it is more the tone of voice and accent. Especially prolonged Oh sounds that drive me completely insane. Anyways I would like to know if this is my anxiety, if I have misophonia or most importantly that someone relates and I am not alone. Nobody in my family understands and just thinks I am being rude when I say I need to leave the room. Please help. Thanks! I do not think we are allowed to provide diagnoses or anything in this subreddit but that does sound a lot like the experience of many people with misophonia. It is usually self diagnosable so if you think you have it chances are you probably do. If you have not already I recommend investing in sound proof headphones to listen to music or white noise wherever you go, life savers! \n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c Thank you so much! I know Reddit cannot diagnose lol I was simply just looking for support and people who relate. :) Personally I can definitely relate. I struggle to be in the same room as her because her specific breathing has recently become a miso trigger of mine. I have many other triggers as well, eating is the biggest. I hope you find ways to cope that are good for you ^u^ me too I am so sorry it is sucks when u cannot be near ur loved ones bc of this but just know ur valid and not alone\u2764\ufe0f", "Misophonia but for certain people For some things such as eating noises, it is only my family that enrages me when they do it. But I do not get it for other people really, or maybe they just have more manners lol. But some things such as tapping is non prejudicial and I do not care who it is I hate it. This happens to me too and usally it is just my family members or certain friends that aggravate me the most. It is surprisingly common for misophonia to be triggered only by certain people, or to not be triggered by certain people. It is strange and actually makes you look bad if the person you get annoyed at sees you not getting annoyed with someone else. Yes it is quite normal for misophonia to be triggered more by those who are emotionally close to us. Yet another lovely feature of the disorder! 100%. Just the other day I was marveling at getting mild ASMR effects from listening to my baby nephew eat. If I heard it from any adult I would have to run away or deck them. I trigger my daughter more than anyone else. I take it as a sign that she loves me the most! Mine was only my family until recent years. College housing really did it for me lol. Still 10000% worse with family though. I think it is because I am comfortable with them so I feel like I am able to tell them it is making me mad Eating sounds from my spouse do not trigger me at all, but I have a specific coworker that makes too many triggering sounds to count. It is frustrating because I am unsure if she triggers my misophonia because I dislike her, or if I dislike her because she triggers it.", "How may of you have had some trauma before developing misophonia? The cause is still a mystery and I want to see if there is a big link between misophonia and trauma/PTSD\n\n( i do not even know if i have trauma or not. I mean, I have been through some bad things but I do not know if that was bad enough to be trauma or if that is the cause of it I mean, I was not traumatized before I developed it, but it just got a lot worse after Oops, I accidentally voted yes\n\nJust pretend one vote got switched to the first option Trauma is almost all the time underestimated by the people who experience it. If you are comfortable talking about it, what have you been through? I am sorry if this comes of as insensitive Hmm interesting\u2026.maybe you were a lot more anxious from the day it happened in general, causing misophonia to be worse? You are messing up my brilliant chart! XD I used to have to listen to my stepfather eating, so I do not think my misophonia came from that but almost certainly it played a role in intensifying it While this is not necessarily trauma, my dad has misophonia, he will never admit it but he does. He is one of the reasons I started focusing on uncomfy sounds and then the ADD did not help. AAh that must have been literal hell. Like you were not allowed to leave the table? Or they did not take you seriously? Hmm like that huh. So kind of a nocebo-effect, interesting. I am working very hard as a parent to not continue the cycle with my kids, table manners sure but I do not reprimand them for things that typically trigger me, it is not their fault. That is really good, I am sure you are a great parent. We may have suffered from this, but at least we accumulated enough empathy from all this suffering to not harm the people around us That Is my guess yeah. Being anxious/stressed really fucks with my misophonia I always figured I would be sensitive to noise, my dad is a lot, and I grew up in a quiet household so noise was not a big part of my life so I was not acclimated to tolerate it the way others were (ie. my partner who grew up in a very noisy household so stuff does not phase him the same way). However at 18 I was diagnosed with a chronic illness, and over a 5 year period of countless meds, surgeries, hospital stays, and basically being near death, I noticed all sensory things were more sensitive, smell and sound in particular. I was the kid who cut tags out of all my clothes, but by my teenage years it did not phase me as much. Now I am back to needing to be comfy without weird scratchy things. Noise is the same, very sensitive and anxiety inducing to be around certain sounds. Yeah, I think that is the worst part about it. The anxiety that you get even when no one is eating is unbearable. Some people in my class like to eat just after the had a break in class (no idea why) and so I cannot even concentrate on my lectures anymore. Ugh I have had it since I was a child. I could not stand certain jackets and hated the sounds of it. But for most of my childhood it was that and only that. I do not remember when it began to get worse but i am guessing around the age of 12-14. There i began developing a lot more triggers. I do not necessarily remember any sort of trauma but my dad tends to be a highly triggering person for me as he is very loud with everything he does and also very inconsiderate about my misophonia. I have family trauma, especially surrounding my mother, and she is the source of my most severe triggers so checks out I had physical head trauma as an infant, not emotional trauma. I voted yes though I honestly do not know. I relate to a lot of things that people with trauma feel, but I cannot think of any trauma that I may have A specific event involving my mother and feeling fear and a loss of control triggered it for me. A certain sound was involved And then whenever I heard that sound it is at me off. Overtime other sounds started to bother me. Primarily sniffing, coffee, and loud walking. yes but not life altering trauma, like constant little traumas that i got used to I voted that I did, but it is kind of difficult to determine. I grew up with a narcissistic parent that was also an alcoholic, but I was very aware of my misophonia issues at a very young age. I have no idea if trauma started before then or not, but I was very aware of trigger sounds at the age of six. Obviously there was no word for it back then, I just thought I was weird. Most of the trauma that I remember from my childhood was well after that. I remember being told that chewing with my mouth open(as a kid) is inapropriate  , also how my sister yelled at me because *i brush my teeth way too loud* perhaps this was the start of my misophonia , because i started paying attention to different sounds", "Family member has finally recognized my misophonia Today, about five minutes ago in fact, my mom recognized my misophonia as an illness and not me just being insensitive.\nA while back, I had an argument with my mom because I could not handle her chewing and ate family dinner in my room instead (I am a teenager). After crying in my room for a while, I looked up anything about misophonia to send to my mom in terms she could understand. I sent a link to her with no context because I could not bear saying anything more. Well, she got mad at me for that too. Like, really mad. She said that I need to talk to her like an adult, etc etc... I had to explain through my immense crying that I cant explain it. If you read the article, it even says, \"Many of those with misophonia cannot describe exactly what their illness makes them feel\" or something along those lines. She stormed off, still angry after my explanation, and I thought I was done for. I thought that my credibility had just been taken away and she would never understand. Today, however, my older brother (disgusting chewer- unbearable. cannot even look at his plate without thinking of how loud it would be if he decided to put it in his mouth) took a chocolate cupcake and started eating it in the living room. I was sitting with my mom and my brother came near me so I went across the room. He followed me again, probably subconsciously. I almost exploded, but I controlled myself rather well and said, \"I am moving further away because you are chewing, so please stop.\" As brothers do, he wanted to annoy me and, with a mouthful of cupcake, said \"Why?\" and I left. Immediately. My mom then said \"She has a disorder that makes her unable to listen to chewing noises. I forgot the name of it. It is a genuine disorder.\" I tried to explain to said brother how much pain his chewing really brings me, but he is really insensitive and just said, with cupcake STILL in his mouth, \"Do you have fetal alcohol syndrome?\"... So here I am, in my room, using my stress relief (guitar) because he nearly tipped me over the edge. None the less, my mom read the article and explained misophonia in her own words, and that means a lot to me. My mom is one of the worst chewers in my family but, since the article, she has not been eating around me unless I am eating as well. It feels really good to be normal. Though, I am still reminded of it when we are eating because she always says, \"I am trying not to chew loud\". Counter-productive, but I know she is doing what she can to help me and I cannot help but appreciate it, even if she fails sometimes.\nThanks for reading this far&lt;3. Feel free to share your experiences below! I can describe what I feel perfectly. \n\nEveryone gets irritated by noises sometimes, but we have that turned up to 11 and it is impossible to turn it down. Basically a lot more things sound like nails on a chalkboard I can definitely describe it but not in a way that my family would understand. If I say \"a lot more things sound like nails on a chalkboard\", my family will simply respond \"Oh so it is just annoying\". They are like that. My mom is definitely exactly like that\n\nI am pretty sure if I lost all my limbs she is still bitch at me for complaining about it, so the idea of her understanding misophonia is out of the question  Sorry, your comment has been removed as your account is under 2 days old.

We walked into the place, music is playing and the subwoofer is cranked up. My heart immediately sank but I tried to endure it and tried not letting my friends know I was upset. I sat with one ear plugged as the pulsating beat rang through my head and I tried so hard to push the noise out. My friend noticed I was increasingly getting upset and asked if it was too loud.

If anybody has ever had one before, you know it is done in a quiet and dark room and they can take pretty long depending on the images they need and the position of the baby. \n\nI really struggle with mouth sounds of any kind. Chewing is by far my biggest issue. I was stuck and forced to stay extremely still while the tech that was doing my ultrasound yesterday chewed and smacked her gum in the absolute MOST obnoxious way you possibly can for an HOUR. Just full on open mouth chewing. \n\nI am so glad that I was wearing a mask because I could not stop myself from physically cringing. These ultrasounds are already stressful and uncomfortable enough for me, it seems really inconsiderate to smack your gum like that when you are the only sound a person can hear for an entire hour. I truly think this would have bothered even people without misophonia because I am not exaggerating when I say that she could not have been louder and more obnoxious with the way she chewed this piece of gum. \n\nI know it sounds dramatic but it completely ruined my day. I am on bed rest, so I only get to leave for my appointments so I do look forward to them in some ways but that hour that morning just made me tense and exhausted. Complain, it is not very professional at all. i would nicely ask her to stop. You need to speak up about that and request she throw her gum away or get a new nurse/doctor. Do not let them pressure you or make you feel like you are overreacting. all the comments are saying to \"ask her to stop\" but first of all, its already happened. second of all, as those with misophonia, we cannot expect other people to always understand; and having the expectation of \"controlling\" other people (asking them to stop making sounds) is unhealthy!\n\nOP, just be proud you got through it!! it was difficult, but its good to think about how not everyone can deal with this condition, and you are doing great for coping so well. Most people would probably say something, I know I would have! the lord knows i would. i would have complained during the ultrasound. Please find a way to leave a review. How very dreadfully unprofessional of her. Not this particular sound. It has NO place in a medical setting. Open mouth chewing is unsafe in a medical setting, especially in this COVID time. True, but not in the setting being in seperate rooms! Definitely, they should not of been chewing gum into a microphone, but I am sure they were not aware they were transmitting the sound to OP the whole time. People do not eat loud on purpose, we are just cursed with noticing when they do.\n\nThere is no need to report a practitioner over chewing, it was annoying, but like OP said, they will never see them again, and they coped very well anyway! Thanks for this. I really do not want to report her for something so trivial, she was wearing a mask so the open mouth part was not a safety concern for me.

I always stay try to  away from my dad because he makes a lot of my trigger sounds. So, my dad thinks that I do not love and appreciate him.

They are deliberately targeting people with misophonia and encouraging its users to harass sufferers with the app, has someone with misophonia hurt the developer..? The developer mind as well have just named the app: \"How to get excommunicated from your friend group 101\" Plot twist - developer has misophonia and is trying to capitalize off of the people who make us suffer on a daily basis. Is there any way we can shut this fucking retarded developers down? r/Noahgetthedeathstar how do i report an app on ios Damn, I would tell all my secrets if someone used this to torture me I will fully support anyone who breaks their \"friend's\" phone for using this app. That is not a plot twist.

", "School is hell I have been a misophonic for about a year or so and I have been surviving on 3 pairs of cheap amazon wireless earbuds and lots of earplugs and almost ever class has people sniffing it makes me want to gouge out everyone is sinuses forever and one of my friends is a huge huge one who sniffs almost constantly he gets angry when I put in both earbuds or plugs and I keep explaining to him that sniffing makes me angry enough to be homicidal for people's sinuses and I keep telling him, my parents and I have a 3 sniffs thing\nIf one of them sniffs 3 times I say hey do you need a tissue. And my dad has been getting annoyed recently about it.\nIt is also snoring and heavy breathing and singing under your breath will make me want to rip your lungs out. The same friend has the same problem of singing under his breath and I just am so on the edge and when I bring it up he gives me the bullshit \" you cannot get trigger at everything\" goddammit if you say it again I will slap you.\nI do not know what I am doing I am having counseling where it is the traditional counseling and neural feedback, I do not know what I am going to do I am afraid I will screw up at a job and get fired I am really sorry I am ranting. \nI just need someone to see if they have any suggestions. Can you talk to a inclusions teacher, disability support or homeroom teacher and explain misophonia to them,  it took until a major incident for people to help me and I  do not want that happening to others, do your parents know/understand?\n\nMabey explian to your friend and give him links or videos, there is one on YouTube called breaking the sound barrier but it depends on your age, also a website called soquiet- misophonia advocacy has good resources.\nGood luck None of my teachers know homeroom teachers have no connection and there is no inclusion teacher or disability support and my parents do know and understand I have tried with the friend and he seems to A not remember or B not care if I show him the yt videos he is just either not going to watch them or just ignore them but I am sorry if I seem really negative not shooting down you just I do not know what I am doing can you maybe speak to your teachers directly? i agree with this comment, i had to go my whole school life just dealing with it and really wish i had gone to my teachers about it. it may be a pain in the arse, but it could also be your best bet! I have the same problem. I get triggered at school, but going home just means I get triggered by my parents. I do not wear headphones since they just make me overwhelmed, I just try and use what little quiet moments I have (walking home from school, empty study halls, etc.)\n\nDo you have a school counselor you could talk to? They could help with accommodations. You could try talking to your teachers about letting you wear earplugs in class, or letting you leave when you get too overwhelmed. You could email them if you do not want to talk irl. I hope this turns out okay for you &lt;3 I am an Inclusion Teacher in a high school. I would gladly help another student who came to me for help. Even if they are not on my list of students. I have quite a few students that I help who do not have accomodations, it is just in our nature. Do not be afraid to ask - if they cannot take you out if the room with them, they can at least help you brainstorm solutions.", "Dealing with OCD and Misophonia This post is intended for everyone, but focused towards those that see a doctor or psychiatrist for either OCD or Misophonia.\n\nI have been seeing my psychiatrist on and off for about 8 years now, and when we were first trying to discover what exactly this \"chewing thing\" was (before the formal naming of Miso), he formally diagnosed me with general anxiety and OCD as a sort of place holder diagnosis. I have not had many compulsions besides symmetrical touching, but i do have intense obsessive thoughts involving my triggers for Misophonia.\n\nI was wondering if anybody has (or thinks they have) obsessive thoughts of their triggers, and how you attempt to cope with it? For example:\n\n* Overly anticipating someone causing your trigger, or \"wanting\" it to happen. (This one is hard to comprehend)\n* Not being able to stop thinking about recent events that caused a trigger for extended periods of time\n* Hypersensitivity and constantly \"listening\" for your triggers to occur way too much\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGeneral discussion and feedback/coping methods are much appreciated!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nP.S. Comments when i posted this initially on r/Misophonia were getting deleted, so i am completely abandoning them for silencing anyone who wants to talk or share ideas in a community. \n\n All of those bullets seem to fit the bill. I am diagnosed with general anxiety and OCD.\n\nAs far as coping goes, for me, it involves a lot of conscious recognition of my problem; when I am obsessively anticipating a trigger or like you said \"wanting\" a trigger to occur, acknowledging what is happening and trying to move my thoughts elsewhere - easier said than done of course. I feel that in certain situations definitely. It is all a mental battle of forcing yourself to think differently. Definitely can be tougher during intense moments, but as you said, recognizing what is happening inside your mind and diverting those thoughts has been my best method as well.  The bullets really describe what I have experienced.\nI do not really have coping methods. Its best to try not thinking about it. After a trigger keeps playing in my head, I force myself to imagine a movie or an episode of a show to distract myself.  Distraction is key, however to hearing actual triggers nothing really works for me.\n\nI was diagnosed when I was 9 so about 7 years ago, however, I was initially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. After discovering information about Misophonia, I realized that my symptoms fall into Misophonia and not Bipolar Disorder.  Thank you for your input! I was said to have anger management issues but all of my issues stemmed from my triggers. Do you think you truly are bipolar? Or do you think, now understanding Miso more, that you mainly have anger stemming from situations that connect to your Miso in some way?  Or is it a combination of both for you? My outbursts and anger stem from my miso triggers, however I say I have bipolar so I do not have to explain it to others. I do not think I actually have bipolar disorder anymore. I have been trying to explain miso to my parents and they really do not get it. Ahh i feel you.. using other names to describe to people what you have can make it easier for people to understand. \n\nWhen my parents and friends didnt understand... Reddit. Showing them a few posts of other people\u2019s situations can really help if you can get them to listen for just a second. It provides the \u201csee i am not crazy!\u201d statement without really making a statement at all. \n\nShow them you are not alone, and that this is a real issue to be taken seriously. \n\nGood luck and good vibes \u270c\ud83c\udffc\n Hi I know you posted this quite some time ago but I swear I was reading my own writing.

It is not you, it is the misophonia! Curious if anyone else has dealt with similar issue.   Been married 25 years, and husband thinks I do not like him and I am not really happy.    Why you ask?  Because I sometimes express my irritation with various things he does.   I love him, but I also do get annoyed with many things he does.  Any tips on how to deal with my annoyances so that he does not feel un-liked. Yeah, I understand. He does not feel like you appreciate him for who he is. Sit him down and tell him you love him. Focus on other sounds, wear noise cancelling headphones, remind him he is cool when you are angry and explain. That is all I know The first time my irritations came up with my bf I really quickly explained the situation and demanded that he listened. I made sure he understood that this was something extremely important and he had to understand. And I made sure he listened when I told him that he is not the problem but being with me he will have to live with my problem. \n\nWe learned how to live with it over a couple of years and working to minimize my triggers is routine by now. Just be brave and honest and demand the same from your partner. Also bring him over and make him read about misophonia - it is a thing that exists and it sucks real bad.", "Parent's unwilling to understand I am 19, about to turn 20, and I have undiagnosed misophonia. For the next couple of months I am living at home but then I will be free. I am currently in my room having an anxiety attack brought on by my trigger sounds (most often from people I am closer too like parents and close friends). We were all in the living room watching a movie i wanted to see with them. My dad was eating ice cream and my mom was rubbing his feet. I could here his mouth as he opened it and he moaned from my mom rubbing his feet. Both of these sounds are triggers for me and I knew if i asked them to stop they would yell at me so i left and went to my bedroom. My mom asked why I left and said it was the sounds (she knows what it means). She asked \"what sounds?!\" I told her and she is now cussing my name from the living room saying how I will never be able to live my life if i dont \"just get over it\". They do not understand and have never made an attempt to and i do not believe they ever will. idk what im looking for maybe just someone to understand. I am also 19 not far from 20\n\nI live in an apartment with thin walls, constant barking dogs, constant stomping feet by the neighbors, and neighbors constantly playing music\n\nI also with a loud ass mom who is dismissive of any complaint anyone ever has\nI know she would never understand misophonia, and even if she did she would just tell me to get over it\n\nI cannot say I have it figured out exactly \nI still get really pissed off at mom and neighbors a lot(and by pissed off I mean in that moment I want to light them on fire), but I do have some advice \n\n1. Save up for some noise cancelling headphones/ask for some for your bday\nI have the 2nd version of Sony's current noise cancelling headphones, and while they are not perfect that help so much\nAnd also I think they are on the 4th generation now so they should be much better \n\n2. I do not know how helpful this is, but I suspect my misophonia is at least partly to due with me  growing up in a pretty silent home\nI am an only child, and most of my life my mom worked night shifts, so she sleep for most of the day(she also likes to sleep a long time in general )\nSo because of that I think all my life I grew to expect a low noise level as a given, and never really learned to function without it\nAnd because of that expectation maybe that is why I get so pissed off when I cannot have silent\n\nHOWEVER, after living in this absurdly loud place for so long I genuinely think I deal with noises better\nI still have misophonia and I still wished I lived anywhere else but here, but if I did live somewhere else I do not think I would have gotten better at dealing with noise\n\nTLDR I really do think the noises get less bad the more you have to deal with them Urg the people like your mom are the worst. I have to deal with them and they are just so fucking annoying. Like I have this one \"friend\" who always makes my triggers and then when I asked her to stop she just says no, when I ask her why she says no it is because \"you are just going to have to deal with it people are going to do it\" and shit like that. Those type of people are horrible and I am sorry that your mom is one of those people. Honestly I do not see why people cannot fucking respect a mental disorder. It is literally just as valid as many other mental disorders yet people cannot seem to respect it. I am sorry your mom is like that, also sorry I kind of went on a rant thank you for the response, i have some noise cancelling ear buds and I am pretty good at finding the sweet spot of not hearing anything else and not having my ears bleed haha. it was not so much that I could not get away from the sounds, it is that my mom was mad at me for getting away from it. but im moving and I will definitely be bringing my ear buds  with me haha. it is all good, thank you for responding. you are \"friend\" does not even sound like a \"friend\", they sound like an ass. n i dont makes friends with asses. so take that as you will haha. I am only 12 so take what you will from this i started getting triggers when I was nine or ten and my parent's did not understand they thought I was being bratty and on multiple occasions they said I just wanted attention on me which hurt me alot especially when I was confused about everything and at a weak state but I started showing them articals and video's and they slowly became better about it they still do not completely get it but they no longer purposely try to make me feel bad about my self for having it my triggers are also worse when it is someone in my family chewing/slurping/ect and it is the same for everyone I do know with miso which is the part my parent's do not understand also this is turning into more of a rant I am sorry I just need to let it out somewhere whenever I get triggered and need to leave and someone gets mad at me it feels even worse I will want to cry and yell at someone but I cannot and I remember this one time where this happened and I was not coming back for a minute and my mom said I was being weird and made me feel wrong for it so I just quietly sat down feeling like I was about to explode (I did not of course) I cannot exactly talk to my parents about this so maybe that is why I am ranting about it on Reddit so yeah I also have very bad visual triggers and honestly my misophonia has got so bad at points where I have considered purposely shattering my eardrums and stabbing my eyes out also at points my brothers used my misophonia against me like once he wanted to take pictures of me at a time where I really was not comfortable with it so he started threatening to purposely trigger me I still did not do it so he got candy and started eating it very loudly it did not sound natural so it didnt trigger me but it still really hurt my feelings (I feel so dumb saying that) so I do not know what to wrap this up with cause I am dumb but I hope things get better for you I am 16 and my mom is just like this. It is just me and her and she chew on the candies called cherry sours. The sound in her mouth makes me cry. We just had a fight about it. She believes misophonia is real but does not think the sound is worth crying over. She calls me a drama queen, and it hurts", "I HATE STIMING WITH A BURNING PASSION ", "Anyone else watching Sex Education season 3 on Netflix? OMG I was so happy when they mentioned Ruby having misophonia. It is the first time in a film or TV series I have seen an explicit mention of misophonia and whilst it was fairly brief, I was just really happy at that tiny bit of representation. I actually went to my brother, who is also watching the series and is in the \"ugh stop exaggerating\" clan, to say \"LOOK, it is REAL. Believe me now?!\"\n\nAnyway, not sure this sort of post is allowed on the sub, but thought I would try and reach out in case anyone else went through the same emotions! Surely someone has to be out there! Currently watching it, not quite at that part yet but this is incredible! I love how Sex Education is so representative and tries to bring awareness to so many different things. I have not watched it yet but that is awesome! How did it go with your brother? Does he believe you now? Yesssss so glad you brought it here. Agreed! They are doing a great job, and a lot of the acting is on point too Oooh you should! It has a slightly different vibe to S1-2 but I liked it. The moment I am referencing is brief but I was pretty chuffed anyway. My brother said something like \u201cugh fineee\u201d, so\u2026 progress? Omg I just made a post about this as I was also shocked then scrolled down to find this. I was so happy too", "DISCOVERY  I JUST MADE A DISCOVERY! I just found out that Corelle type dishes are a lot easier to listen to than China! They are a lot darker and less piercing of a sound! That helps so much at the dinner table and with eating! It may not take away the trigger of eating itself but just taking away one trigger is amazing! I just thought others might benefit from this! I have Corelle plates, did I unconsciously pick them because they are less clangy? I thought I picked them because they are really hard to break compared to other dishes, and I never actually thought to test sound when I was choosing a new dish set but that is a good idea if it is one of your triggers. I can confirm. I replaced all my dishes with Corelle last year, and they are a lot better. Not perfect... but much better", "Trigger Sounds Vs. ASMR? For context, I have got misophonia pretty bad.  I am 27 years old now, and I have had it pretty bad for as long as I have had any sense of memory.  It is only gotten worse with age and continued exposure to worldly noises.  \n\nMy question today is, why does not ASMR make me want to die violently the same way that any of those sounds out in the real world do?  Does anyone else who suffers with misophonia also find that ASMR *does not* piss them off?  I was fully expecting that I would hate it and would avoid it forever, but in fact, I think I actually kind of *like* it... sometimes... from some creators.  This makes no sense to me.  My best guess is that perhaps it has something to do with intention?  Like maybe because I intentionally turn on an ASMR video, and that person is intentionally making these noises... whereas a trigger noise out in my life is stumbled upon by accident and caused by people who do not realize they are doing it.  Is intentionality a factor in misophonia?\n\nTell me if you are like this too or if I am an enigma. I am the same way too! I am 20 and I have had misophonia for as long as I can remember, but ASMR does not trigger me. I basically only listen to two different artists and there is some types of ASMR (mouth sounds) that I cannot stand, but for some reason it is never triggered my misophonia. In some cases, it is actually helped me relieve some misophonia induced headaches that I have had in the past. This is so fascinating. Doctors should study this if they are not already. I have no answer but I have also thought it is super fascinating how much I love ASMR but how triggered I get off of people tapping, clacking or whatever! Perhaps some of us just are sensitive like that for good AND bad. I am not big on the mouth sounds-asmr videos, but you are right.. It really does not trigger me - whereas anyone in real life eating could make me want to flip every piece of furniture in sight!!!!", "I just got rid of one of my triggers!! # Warning: I made sure to avoid using onomatopoeia, but this post still may cause triggers\n\nI am so happy right now, after four years of suffering, I have finally killed one of my worst triggers, the sound of eating!\n\nI just finished eating a bowl of chips with my mother while watching TV, and I did not have a single bad thought about the sound of her crunching, in fact, I barely noticed that she was eating! It was weird, I acknowledged the sound's presence, but for once, I was not angry about it\n\nIt has been forever since I have been able to really relax with my family and enjoy some food, with absolutely no violent thoughts, I forgot how nice it was to eat with people before I developed my misophonia. \n\nIn fact, it makes me so happy, I feel like going to a Mexican restaurant right now, and deliberately listen to people eat their tortilla chips **JUST BECAUSE I CAN.**\n\nMy only triggers left to kill are sniffling and nose-breathing, and once I kill those triggers, my misophonia is gone for good... I cannot wait for the day that happens! If I can get rid of my hate for eating sounds, I genuinely believe I can conquer any sound in the world right now Well done. That is amazing! How did you accomplish this? Okaaaaaay and did you want to share your strategy? We are all waiting in the wings here.... Oops, sorry, I forgot to tell in the post \ud83d\ude05\n\nThis strategy is a popular one, but it is very well known that this does not work for everyone. My strategy was self-exposure.\n\nBut not in the way you would normally think. \n\nInstead of listening to sounds deliberately, I just put myself in situations where I would have to hear the sounds. But it was more complicated than that.\n\nIt was important to associate the sounds with good activities, like playing with the dog or watching TV. I allowed myself to listen to white noise in high stress situations, so I could avoid associating the noise with frustration. If white noise was not an option, I resorted to forcing myself to think happy thoughts\n\nI also experimented with my misophonia, and getting to understand how it works. That way, I could figure out what is so triggering about triggers, and fix that. What I found out about myself was that I was not angry about the noise itself, but the person carelessly making the noise, and seeing everyone around them acting as if nothing is happening, making me jealous. So I did my best to fix that judgmental mindset of mine\n\nThe hardest part was keeping myself motivated, mostly because I am just difficult to motivate. The process of removing a trigger is very slow, it took me almost a year, and my training was not taking effect, but thinking about how my life would look like without misophonia encouraged me to keep working to achieve that goal\n\nDo note that these methods I used may not work on everyone, though  OP replied up top.", "I am so tired.. I am just so tired of this disorder. I thought life would get much easier as an adult, as I can live in my own place.

And I am on two medications..\n\nSometimes I think of just ending my relationship so I can move out of our expensive state and buy a cheaper house somewhere far away so I would not have to deal with anyone.

There will be triggers (screaming, whistling, leg shaking if sitting, etc)... but I really want to go. What is your advice? I am considering the following:\n\n- Some CBC/THC (it is legal here, I am Canadian)\n\n- Earplugs (duh, I do not leave home without them)\n\n- Maybe something sensory wise (like a stress ball) to play with when overwhelmed\n\nWhat do you do in these situations? Alcohol? Pray? I am semi kidding here - but any advice on people who have gone to similar attractions, please let me know. Not a boxing match but cinemas are like that for me with people eating \ud83d\ude02 depending on how stressed out the sound is making me sometimes imitation works :) I have gone to the movies with him a few times. One night I actually had to make him switch rows because of a chronic leg shaker. I hate people in public... Does CBD/THC actually lower the intensity of your triggers?  I have heard others say that it makes it worse. But if it does help, then maybe that is a good idea. Personally I find alcohol dulls my triggers more than THC/CBD does, but I have a hard time recommending alcohol or pot as a coping mechanism for a social situation, so here are some other recommendations you might want to try.\n\nSome sober ideas might be to pickup some \"invisible\" earplugs. You can get some that only stick have a little pin sticking out of your ear holes - they are very hard to notice especially if you have hair or some sort of hat to cover your ears. They are not perfect but they reduce the volume of sound by 30-50% (my experience, not scientific).\n\nYou might also consider being weird and listening to music while you watch. Some people might find it rude, others do not mind. Wireless earplugs might come in especially handy here as you can have an easier time hiding them under hair or a hat like the earplugs.\n\nAnother really important thing is to come at it in a good headspace. You want to give yourself the best tools to deal with the situation; do not pound back a red bull and six cups of coffee and make yourself irritable. Go for a walk before and get some sun if you can, drink lots of water. Maybe even exercise. Just do what makes you mentally healthy and that will give you an advantage. If you are going to have to go through mental hell, then this is how I would prepare. I find this helps the most, and it is a manda procedure for me to prepare myself for taking the bus or even going to work in an open office.\n\nGood luck! CBD/THC works, but only in certain situations (and certain blends). The issue with it being illegal, or only medical use, is that it is very hard to find a good strain. I have tried some hybrids and they certainly help. Some sativas make it worse. Have a glass of wine or a beer beforehand. \n\nUse ashwaghanda for a week beforehand or L-Theanine immediately before you go (obligatory check with your doctor or do your research to see if these supplements are appropriate and safe for you).\n\nUse easily-hidden wireless earbuds connected to a white noise app to drown out any stressful sounds.\n\nGet a good night's sleep and avoid caffeine to keep your stress levels from being elevated before you go.", "Help: Loud repetitive music. I am at my wit's end. I moved into a new apartment 2 months ago. Noise-wise everything has been a lot better than my last place except for one thing: my downstairs neighbor (directly below me) plays loud music at random times of the day. Sunday morning it started around 7 am. Tonight it is been off and on (but mostly on) for the past 4 hours. It is now 11 pm. It also happens during my work hours (working from home), during meetings, you name it. The genres vary but it does not even matter what the music is. It is the reverberating bass that I can feel through my floors and at the back of my skull.\n\nHere is what I have done so far:\n\n1. White noise, music with earphones, turning my vacuum on - nothing completely blocks out the bass, except for playing white noise in my earphones really loudly, but that gives me a headache. I also soundproofed my door but it does not help because much of the noise comes through the floor.\n2. Left a note asking them to turn the volume down, politely worded.\n3. Knocked on the door, two separate times. No answer. The second time I could hear him saying \"yeah, you go away\" as I was walking back up the stairs. So I came back down and asked him to please turn the music down through the door. No reply. I shouted back, \"too scared to open the door, huh?\" (not proud of that one...). Not sure if he heard that.\n4. This one I am also not proud of. I stomped and banged on the floor. He banged on the ceiling back at me. I banged on the floor back at him and yelled \"turn the music down please!\" I am not a yeller so not sure if it carried through the floor.\n\nI do not want to disturb my neighbors, and as you can see this is getting really out of hand. I live alone so getting in confrontations with strange men is a really bad idea (I do NOT have violent urges - my emotions tend to turn inwards. I am just worried about this stranger getting angry at me). My dog has a lot of anxiety and now whenever the music starts he hides - I think he can sense my emotions even if I do not do anything but stick my headphones on. Honestly, my dog is the one keeping me from losing it completely during these episodes because he needs me to be calm.\n\nI do not want to call the cops or call 311 because they might send the cops (I am in NYC). I was thinking my next step could be to call my landlord tomorrow. I do not want to sound like a crazy person. I am not totally sure what good calling the landlord would do, though. What can I say for them to take me seriously?\n\nI cannot live like this. I do not know what it is like to not have misophonia so I do not know how a normal person would react or if they would be able to ignore the noise. I think a normal person would at least be annoyed enough to speak up but definitely would not have a meltdown like me. I also feel like this guy now knows his music pisses me off so he is doing it even more.\n\nAnyone else have a situation like this before? Hey I am really sorry to hear about this :( I am not quite sure how to help but I want to let you know I relate. My next door neighbor plays base heavy music day in day out. We called the office and they told them to turn it down. It stopped for a few days then came right back.\n\nI would honestly say telling your landlord is a really good idea, and just explain that you have lots of meetings throughout the day and it is hard to focus.\n\nI cannot wait till I can afford a house.\n\nI hope everything works out :) For us it says right in our lease nothing loud between certain hours, i know our city also has a noise ordinance so look at those. I suggest you a 20W bluetooth speaker with subwoofer, they are cheap. Put on some masking sounds by visiting the myNoise website. There you will find various masking sounds, set the volume at the level that is equal with the music you hear. No need to use headphones. Also you can play some smooth jazz or lofi in live streaming from YouTube. Just try it and you will see. I recently had a run in with my neighbor after they bought a rooster that squawked repeatedly throughout the day. I made a noise complaint to my local council and they sent a form for me to fill in, detailing the noise and the times. I sent it his back and the noise stopped, so I guess that got a call from the council. Start recording everything. Keep a notebook, record with your phone. You will need this at some point. They are likely breaking rules. Read your lease and see if there is anything in it that you can use.\n\nPersonally, I would get a cheap subwoofer and put it over his room, and play a loud hum when he does this. If neighbors complain about that, I would say it was him. But I can be an ass if I need to be. \"This means war...\" That is a good idea, I had not thought about keeping a record! \n\nI totally did think about getting a speaker and playing it into the floor though, haha. I will check the lease! The noise ordinance here is 10pm - 7am. Thank you! Sorry to hear you are going through a similar problem. I am going to call my landlord today. \n\nMe too, I dream about living in a house in the middle of nowhere. That is crazy, who gets a rooster unless they are living a good distance from other people? I am glad the council could do something. Yes that! Start with the landlord, and if they do not do anything, then I would definitely start calling the cops for noise violations. I used to be wary of complaining against people but I am at a point in my life where if someone is being that obnoxious (especially if they are violating the noise ordinance) I will absolutely file a complaint. I would also start keeping a log of when they play their music, keep recordings of how loud the music is etc... it may come in handy if you ever have to get cops involved.\n\nGood luck, and I am confident things will get better for you!!! Several times. You need outside help. Report him to the landlord, emphasizing that you work from home and your ability to pay your rent depends on that. At no point is loud music necessary in your situation. If the landlord blows you off, call the cops.\n\nAnd/or move your office setup. If that does not work, break your lease and move. Santeros Definitely do like another person said and make notes everytime it happens and report it to the landlord. It is their job to make sure everyone has quiet enjoyment of their apartment. (Now whether or not they do that is debatable, lol...)\nWe had a new neighbor move in a few months ago who decided they get to throw parties during the middle of the day and blast super offensive music while kids were playing outside. I reported it after the third day in a row where the party went from early afternoon until 2am. Shortly thereafter the landlord did an email blast about \"people being at home due to covid\" and \"working from home\" and \"being bored in the house\" and basically called out all the loud annoying people telling them they need to be respectful of neighbors, lol. \nSurprisingly the parties stopped. Thank you! I do not want to call the cops, but I am hopeful the landlord will be able to do something. If not, I am going to have to move again.", "Dr. Marsha Johnson on the Misophonia Podcast ", "Free information session in St. Louis ", "Any really good ear plugs recommendations?

They have been doing a whole lot of work and research into misophonia as it is gotten progressively worse for me. They have even joined a misophonia parent support group. I do not know if that group allows for misophonics to educate parents/friends/spouses/et cetera about misophonia as opposed to relying on non misophonic \"experts\". My dad was talking with me a few days ago and told me he is doing everything he can and reading up a lot on what I might be going through because he and my mom truly do want to help me. When I told him that it is not something that can be cured through exposure therapy (as exposure therapy is something the therapist I dropped told me is the only verified treatment to treat misophonia) he got lightly defensive and said, \"No, nope. That is not true. I am not forcing you to take it, but that statement is not true\". \n\nThe reason I brought up exposure therapy is because I am still in a a sad slump because I had to drop her. While she was nice and wanted to help me, she was not interested in finding a different way other than exposure therapy (which I still declined we I first spoke with her) and the stuff we already were doing that certainly was not improving my situation. Also because it was my dad that found her for me and I did not know if he was okay with the reason I dropped her. I am wondering if my parents are going to the wrong resource for helping me with my misophonia if this is the mentality they are keeping. Am I in the wrong or are they in the wrong? I would assume if they really want to get a better understanding of misophonia, they would go to the people who actually have it and not people who do not suffer from it.

Even my neuropsychiatrist is not aware of misophonia. Here in France, there is not so much about it... Definitely yes. Especially if it is been a while since I have heard someone chewing or slurping. Ugh. I know in my heart it is valid, but those voices in my head from the past drown me out and I question it every single time. People can be assholes. Especially the ones who go out of their way to chew or slurp louder just because they know it bothers you. Where do you live, just curious? I have a hunch that I would not have much luck with professionals also. Oh no, you just reminded me of my brother. He knew it annoyed (well, tortured is a more fitting word) me and purposefully chew louder and louder at the table. I live in South Australia, it is just disappointing at the lack of supports avaliable from a professional standpoint. I guess all we can do is hope at some point more people will look into Misophonia so we can get the support we need. I sometimes do think I am just making it up and I just need to ignore it.

I feel most comfortable this way and my misophonia is not triggered so much (unless someone in sales is sick because they work in the front of the store). I realize this is a very unusual work environment for someone who does not have a college education. I am extremely lucky in that regard. \n\nIf I worked full-time at my current position I would work with one other person in the office and my misophonia cannot handle that because it is very quiet  and any sudden noise sends me reeling out of my chair. I wear earplugs and headphones even when I am working by myself so I cannot hear the sales people.\n\nMisophonia is not recognized as a real condition so there is no chance I will ever be able to get SSI. I am currently living off some extra money in savings to help me get by because just working three days a week is not sustainable obviously. I live alone and am scared I will never find work that does not drain me or affect my misophonia negatively. I feel like I have to bubble wrap myself just to get through the work day and it is absolutely exhausting. I have panic attacks in the morning. I am a massage therapist, my work is so quiet. It is never too late to change careers and lots of people are hiring remotely! SSI may not be an option but disability accommodations at your workplace should be! Many people have successfully negotiated (or won in court) reasonable accommodations for misophonia. If you worked with another person in the office, examples of possible accommodations might be: allowing you to work in a different location, allowing you to work remotely, maybe installing a white noise machine... Definitely the earplugs/headphones. There are options! That does sound like a good choice !

I have tried to tell my parents how awful it is, but they do not seem to get it. My mom's very sympathetic at least but my dad... does not understand or even try to. I really just want to be believed.\n\nI feel like most of us have had a similar experience. Why do you think that is? Is it because they cannot imagine what it would feel like, therefore it is must be not as bad as we say?

They are also just comfy I pretty much live in them now lol. \nyeah good ones aint cheap :/ Yes, it is exhausting. :( Yeah I can imagine that being the case. Happy to hear you found something that works. I think I prefer discreet, so not over-ear; apparently the noise cancelling AirPods are meant to be good!

This is my first time posting here.\nI started to notice a few years back that I got really disturbed by chewing and drinking sounds or just the fact of someone eating near me. I used to have a friend that chewed really loud, I could barely be near her. I got into terrible fits of rage and anxiety, my heart went a lot faster and I got sweaty palms.\nI did a bit of research a few weeks back and discovered it had a name (I was quite relieved, and kind of glad that I wasn' t the only one).\nThese last 2 years have been quite hard. Since I live with my parents, it' s almost unbearable to eat with them. I feel absolutely terrible for getting so agry just because of something as trivial as chewing, but I can' t help it.\nI told my parents how I felt and what misophonia was, but they just told me to not research it anymore (I just googled it 1 time) and that it was all in my head, that absolutely every teen went through this at least once. My mother refused to let me eat apart from them. \nIt' s gotten even worse with the quarantine, I' m forced to eat with both my parents (I usually didn' t when I went to school because I was a bit rushed). My parents have absolutely no trouble in eating really close to me or doing loud sounds whilst chewing. I guess it' s exposure treatment... \nI feel terrible for feeling rage against them when they eat. But it' s just unbearable. \n\nThank you so much for reading this, I would really appreciate your advice.\n\nIf you are struggling with this condition, you have my full support, I understand how you feel. :) hey! i am in a similar situation. i am so sorry you are struggling with this, misophonia sucks. i am always here if you need to reach out. &lt;3 Hello! I know, right... :'( Thank you for your kind message, I really appreciate it :) no problem, hope things get better for you soon :) Hi, I am also a teen girl living with parents, my mom is an audiologist and was able to get me these earplugs that work pretty well (they are called TRU Universal wr:  you can also get them in various noise reduction levels) also what works for me is wearing apple airpods or some type of discrete headphones and play music quietly. Just enough to drown out the noises. It gives me something to focus on other than the eating. That is just what worked for me though, best of luck! You should not feel bad for something that you do not have control over. If you could just simply use willpower to quell the feelings, then they would have a case that getting mad was a bad thing to do. But you cannot, so there is no case to be made.\n\nThis does not mean that you cannot learn how to react in a more pleasant way or learn how to work on managing this, but you should never feel bad for something that HAPPENS to you. \n\nYou need to figure out a way to convince them; whether that be research papers from reputable university\u2019s, a professional talking about it on YouTube, or something similar. Simply trying to just push through it will not work, you need to tell them that this is serious. \n\nI am sorry that you are going through this, I know it is really hard. Best wishes, let me know if you need someone to talk to. Thank you so much! I' ll check those out. I appreciate your time :) Thank you so much, I appreciate your advice and support. I will try that out, they will surely listen to reason. I wish you a wonderful day/night, there aren' t a lot of kind people like you :) I am no longer a teenager although I still behave like one :p but this is not just a teenager phase that everyone goes through. I am already 35 and I am very sad to say it has not gotten better. It has gotten worse. Nowadays I am watching TV while eating and it really helps. I did not think it would. I was going to dismiss it but now I find myself telling my family \"turn on the TV please\". I also plug one ear that is closest to the chewing offender and cover it with my hair (I saw someone on here post about skin colored ear plugs to be even more stealthy). It helps me a lot not to get mad. Do not worry you are not alone but I am sad we all suffer from this. Hugs\n\nI wanted to add. I was also told to stop researching it. Not researching it does not make it go away. Please continue to research it as much as you need. Yeah, I just turned 18 and living on my own for a bit has helped me when it comes to eating. Even just being able to have headphones and not constantly being berated because I cannot eat around my parents was a relief. You can get to then as well. I believe in you! Trust me I know your pain and how frustrating and sad it can be, especially when it is your own flesh and blood or really close friends. Just taking thinking one day at a time, remembering what foods are worse, that can help so maybe one day you can have a dinner with your family you can somewhat stand and maybe another day when your family is eating a horrible food you do not have to eat with them. Just remembering has helped me so much Im 34 and this is still a problem for me, it does not get to me as much as it used to but it is still very hard not to focus on the sound, I often carry earphones on me for this reason.

I had plenty of money working at a record store and I was happy to have a good life. I woke up eager to get moving. I was partying every night, popping pills and smoking dope. It was so easy back then.\n\nBut one day my head started acting up. I started to go insane. Sounds in my head that would normally would not effect me started making me uncontrollably angry, it would fill tears in my eyes. I do not know why it happened. My girlfriend said it was probably just some drugs I took that messed up my head and I will be fine in the next two hours or so. But hours passed and so did days, every time me and her would sit down to eat I could not take it. I would stand up and go sit in another room. The bird that sung in the morning would wake me up at 5:00 and made me mad making me sleep deprived. When ever someone whispered to me I would freak out. I could not listen to yelling from down the street. I went to the psychologist said it was Misophonia. I would have to live with this forever. I was always mad. ALWAYS. My drug addiction sped up and I started taking deadly amounts while my bank account started heading down. I was slowly going insane. My girlfriend left me and so did half of my friends. I was out of money and no one to help me out. I sold my house and moved onto an apartment. Where I will stay for the rest of my life.\n\nI sit here in the dark crying every night. Why me? Why did god pick me to have misophonia? Why did I lose happiness? I have nothing anymore. I wish I could just not wake up. I want to end it. I am going to. Misophonia is the worst thing to ever exist! I am not jackson Howard anymore. Im just a loser who sits in his apartment drinking and crying. All because of one little mental disorder, that caused all of this. It took my friends, girlfriend, money and happiness. Now it will take my life. I just wish I never lived in the first place. I hate Misophonia.\n\nI cannot take this anymore. I know it sucks, its sucks worse than anyone will ever know. But from my experience misophonia has up and down turns. Moments when everything hurts and then days when you can actually go to the cinema and be ok\n\nFinding that support system is one of the hardest things I have had to do with regards to misophonia. So trust me, finding a way to explain this and saying hey somethings I need to listen to music to drown out a specific noise or suggest other activities than eating when hanging with your friends can go a long way.\n\nYou got this my dude\nI believe in you", "I think constant misophonic exposure has caused brain damage or is making my amygdala shrink or be crushed. Can anyone help me out? I have no idea what is going on. Ok so hear me out.\n\nI need help because I think something has happened to my brain from the exposure to the misophonic triggers as well as other miso type triggers which is causing them to not work properly, and as a result I need advice on how to fix this.\n\nMy misophonic triggers are.\n\nThe specific sound of a persons voice as well as the trigger noises they make E.G breathing, laughing, other mouth related noises specific to that trigger's voice. &lt;Misophonia&gt;\n\nSpecific movements, but only when my trigger source makes them. &lt;Misokinesia&gt;\n\nThe way my trigger source looks (which also can be triggered by what I have coined as trigger lookalikes.). &lt;Misothemia&gt;\n\nThe name of my trigger source (this name being mas in reverse) &lt;Misonomia&gt;\n\nHowever through all this exposure to the trigger source over the years to june 2020 I have noticed something weird happening to my reactions. It seems if the stress from my triggers gets really bad or I have gone through my triggers enough times the responses feel like they get weaker and even at times just outright not work even though I know the triggers are still triggering and I still get triggered by the triggers (name triggers are probably the biggest trigger of mine right now, via both seeing or hearing the name and I have to use a chrome addon I.E swappity swap to swap the trigger name online with another word as a result.). Is there anybody else that has experienced this effect? If so is it reversible through medication or some other kind of treatment?(please say yes.), because these lack of responses are actually making me feel uncomfortable. I in no way embraced my triggers, this effect just seems to be happening without my consent whenever I am awake or go to sleep.\n\nI really have no idea what is happening but I need help fast before it is too late, so does anyone have any solutions to this problem, because I am really sick of feeling hopeless like I have no way to reverse what the hell is happening to me and have to live with whatever is going on for the rest of my life (Which is a fate that I do not intend to have.).\n\nAlso has this happened to you too? If so please share your experiences for others that may also want this kind of help, because god knows we sure as hell need it. I am a little confused as to what exactly the problem is you are detailing here. Are you saying that you still experience annoyance towards triggers, but your flight or fight reaction does not seem to be triggered? As in, you do not get that weird paranoia/anger feeling where you have to flee?\n\nIt is possible for the amygdala to shrink, and when this happens it is inherently a GOOD thing.  The amygdala is the fight or flight center of the brain. When people go through depression, their amygdala increases in size. When people practice mindfulness and self care, their amygdala decreases in size. A decreased amygdala can reduce flight or fight responses. \n\nUnless I am misinterpreting what you are saying, what is happening to you seems to be a good thing. If you are still experiencing emotions normally other than the ones attributed to misophonia, I do not understand where your worry is coming from. Everyone reacts to triggers differently and it is very possible for that to change overtime, so try to accept your reactions instead. are you ..asking for help because your triggers bother you less now? Please try to respond as soon as you can because this is not pleasant to deal with. I think you are probably okay, sometimes it can feel like weird things are happening. If you can afford it you can go to a doctor like an audiologist or neurologist if you want but overall I would not worry too much about it. For your first question no, why because I still feel a flight or fight reaction of pain, but the pain is not exactly registering as it should. Today when I encountered a trigger name I felt a very unwanted reaction, but what should happen is after the reaction the inside of my brain should feel toxic and hurt. It feels like a numbing pain rather than my reactions decreasing, because I still feel reactions of anger and disgust afterwards, they just feel like the response is not matching up properly or are not coming out properly, because I still hate looking at my trigger name.\n\nAlso it is not exactly a flight or fight reaction, but a hateful and disgustful reaction where my brain actually hurts from looking at the trigger name or any sort of trigger source or look-alike. These developed after being around the trigger far longer than I should. The trigger name in particular serves to remind me of my trigger memories which I do not want resurfacing, so when I feel like my responses to the trigger name are not activating properly, it feels like the trigger memories are not being stopped from resurfacing and claim that response. So when I get a strong trigger from the name I know I am still in a good state because the pain stops the trigger memories from resurfacing by making them more intolerable to think about.\n\nAlso I have no idea if my amygdala is actually shrinking, I am more or less shooting in the dark with what is happening regarding my current state and lack of knowledge on the situation. Again if you have any other theories on what is going on post them here.\n\nYou probably are misinterpreting what I am saying because I still feel like shit and get angry after seeing my trigger name or other triggers or trigger look-alikes, it is just the constant pain and stress seems to be doing something weird to it where it seems to hurt and be painful but where the reactions seemingly decrease when a certain stress threshold is met. Again just shooting in the dark here. No, my triggers still bother me a lot, but the feeling of shock is not coming out properly. While it is still there it does not feel like it is coming out. I still feel anger and disgust from my triggers, but the shock from them that should be there does not seem to be coming out properly and feels really weak. Also since I am willing to experiment with a few things could you potentially point me to any leads to potential medication that can cause the amygdala to grow? I am willing to give that a try and see if that does anything. I would suggest EMDR therapy. It can still be done online, you do not have to be face-to-face for it to work. is that not better, though? if it effects you less Regarding the amygdala, you do not WANT your amygdala to grow. That usually happens as a result of depression, stress and the like. Do not sacrifice your mental health to change the way you react to your triggers. It will not help you. \n\nAs for the rest, a hateful/disgusted reaction is completely normal with misophonia. The physical pain is normal too -- I have heard others talk about it and I have even felt it myself! When you hear a trigger, your stress levels increase significantly. Stress is known to cause headaches, pain, and body aches. I also suffer from a personality disorder, where it is common to feel emotional pain very physically. Have you been tested/treated for any other mental illnesses?\n\nAnd now for the part where you feel like your reactions \"are not activating properly\". Everyone reacts to triggers differently. There is no proper way. My reactions have changed significantly over the years. There is no cure or treatment, only acceptance to reactions as well as adjusting/tweaking your learnt coping mechanisms. I understand that you are saying that when your reactions decrease, you cannot stop yourself from thinking about the trigger. But try to focus on the positives - the fact that your reactions will seemingly decrease is ultimately a good thing and is a sign of progress! You have probably become too comfortable with bad reactions that good ones seem foreign. Embrace them and do not ponder the \"why is it happening\", just accept that it is.\n\nAnd lastly, even though it sounds cliche, practice self care. You specify that one of your problems is that you cannot stop thinking about certain triggers. Meditation helps train the mind to stop wandering. Try it... but remember that progress takes time. I hope that I was able to understand what you are saying this time, wish you the best. No, since it is very much like being abused and then accepting the abuser in your life. That is a fate I do not intend to have when it comes to this predicament.\n\nI am hoping I can find a medication that cause my amygdala to grow since I am willing to give it a try and see if that does anything. Maybe you can help me find it to make things a bit easier for me? Misophonia cannot cause this\n\nNothing can cause this, but schizophrenia can cause you to think stuff like this is happening Well to keep my reactions in tact while the trigger memory is in my brain I will need to try whatever I can to make sure I can get back to the state I was before. This iz also why I am trying to get a brain scan to see what the root of the problem is too. Honestly at this point I am willing to give any sort of medication that can keep my responses in tact a try, plus my mental health iz already zacrificed, I can at least do something to help me out a bit so that I can get through this until the right treatment to erase my trigger memories becomes available..\n\nI never said that a hateful/disgusted reaction was not normal, saying that it was not was never the point of my post. I am also well aware of the stress that it has caused me since I have endured it for over a year now. I really just want a stable state of mind when it comes to this condition for the time being until the right treatment I am after and not constantly changing all the time.\n\nNo something definitely feels off about my reactions, it feels like they change against my will, which is why I am willing to try any sort of medication that gives me the desired effect I want to see how well it fares, I will also not accept my responses changing to a state I do not like and neither should you, you deserve far better than that, we all do. There are also no positives to my current predicament, not with the way I was treated and left to endure my triggers until it suited them do actually do something about it, and I will get my original state of mind back even if I have to go to extreme lengths to do it.\n\nSelf care will not do a lot, and meditation will just make me run into my trigger memories, which will just end badly for me.\n\nYes, progress takes time, but I want my progress to give me the desired effect I want and not continuing into this deteriorating state, but hey, this post was still useful in giving me a lead in which I can help find my way back to my original state of mind, so that is some positives out of this. I will still try the amygdala growth medication to see how it fares then give an update to see how well this works for me since what might not work for one person may work for another. I hope this post was not too much a cause for concern, I am only trying to get myself into a more preferable state of mind for myself.\n\nAlso if the medication does not work for me I will stop, since I know what kind of state I need to get towards when it comes to this predicament and if I feel the effectz are undesirable I will immediately stop and try to find a better solution. EZPZ. And what does EMDR therapy actually do and how useful would it be in achieving the desired effect that I want for this predicament? Will it help restore my responses back to a state where the reactions work properly again? Or what? Could you give me a thorough explanation on how that works? Search what habituation is. No, you do NOT have damaged your amydgalae. Misophonic response is a response to being trapped (as perceived). You have changed something else - people you live with? In or out of a relationship? Did someone die / change city / change behavior towards you?   \n\n\nMost misophonic people do not experience triggers in the beginning of a new romantic relationship, or in the beginning of their child's life, and most misophonic people notice their triggers get less intense when they move out of their childhood home. Most misophonic people experience worse reactions and gain more novel triggers when they are around their nuclear family members, especially if they HAVE TO stay there (\"but it is the christmas i HAVE to eat with them\" / \"I cannot afford my own home yet I am doomed to live with them\"). If you got options, you feel less trapped, and react less like an animal with no way out. Even if it is in the future and abstract (\"i got more space to move around once the vaccines arrive and i can travel again, phew!\")   \n\n\ntrust me the threat response center at the bottom of the brain is the last to go out. The limbic junk is working for you, it is just something has changed you have not connected to the context of the triggers. Also, good news, if you want to react worse again it is totally doable, too. EMDR is one of the therapy modalities that actively exploits the memory reconsolidation mechanism. If you got those trigger memories resurfacing and you do not want them to, this is what you are looking for (desensitizing memories, and no you do not have to look in to the context of these memories to tune them down). You do not have to tell the practitioner / therapist about the context or contents of memories, either. They will just help you run over the memory via eye movements. None of it is painful or requires you to visit the worst stuff.   \n\n\nif you got those memories resurfacing against your will it might be because something got safer for you (i am guessing in your social realm - or maybe you got more physical space or options for moving around or something). This is okay.   \n\n\nalso on a side note amydgalae does not hold memories, it asks the hippocampus about those. Oh fuck, is that what happened?\n\nIs there a way to reverse it? Why would you want to do that? You have no brain damage, your brain just adapts to your environment. But I do not want to adapt to my environment, my environment sucks, so I want to feel increased stimuli to it so I can know it is bad. This also goes for my trigger name situation.\n\nPlease tell me dis-habituation therapy is possible. Because I am out of the environment and I want my responses to the triggers to feel dis-habituated. Yeah, I think I have figured out this weird diminishing response. It is habituation.\n\nCan habituation be reversed? Because I really do not want to adapt to my triggers, just be at peace from them. This goes for my misophonic, misokinesic, misothemic and misonomic triggers.\n\nIf there exists such a medication or treatment to reverse habituation I am all for it because I cannot stand having my responses be habituated. yea you can change your responses. \n\nWhat is the goal? What is ideal for you? \n\nThe way it was + no resurfacing memories? so you did change your environment? starting from last june? and it is not possible for you to change back to that environment, but you want to respond to the  current environment the way you did in the previous one? So your saying the habituation and adaptation to my trigger stimuli can be reversed and made to feel painful again? If so please tell me how it can be done via any therapy or medication.\n\nMy goal is to have peace from my trigger stimuli and not have peace with it due to habituation. Because no-one with this condition should be made to have it respond as much as it has to me only to have it just fuck up because the fucking trigger source could not just not be triggerful. Because I would like them to feel bad as long as they are infecting my brain and memories and not feel ok.\n\nWhat would be ideal for me is to have my trigger sources as well as my trigger memories feel painful to think about again and not feel unresponsive and then have my trigger memories as well as my experiences with the trigger be completely erased so that I can properly enjoy living again and not feel suicidal because of it. Because this shit sucks. Ok so in june of last year I moved into a place where I am away from my trigger stimuli, the only problem is the day before I moved into the new place I encountered and heard my trigger stimulus, but instead of feeling like pain is shooting through my brain and a inner explosion happens nothing came out. This started happening somewhere around may where I think is were the problem started to take root. This scared me because it was like something had hijacked my brain against my will. Then after I had moved into the new place the name of the trigger source was also causing physiological responses with a miso which I have coined misonomia (the hatred of names). Then after constant exposure to that trigger that felt like it started to habituate and there was nothing I could do to stop it. And believe my I tried my absolute hardest to keep the habituation process at bay by keeping the pain in tact via the shaking.\n\nOverall my experience with this as been hell and I just want to be able to be rid of the experiences where I never experienced them again and can never experience again so I can have true peace once more. Because this shit just keeps getting worse. Okay so long term goal would be to have peace from trigger stimuli, but not because of environment/habituation, people around you etc, but through something else. But before that, get it back to painful and not feel unresponsive again. And the people who do the trigger should feel bad as long as they keep doing it, even though they could stop if they wanted to, and you need to react to that. Ok, first lets try to find a way to make my responses towards my trigger name feel searing and not unnoticeable and that the pain persists badly in my head, both from hearing and seeing the trigger name. That way we have a good lead to see if the responses return and not diminish due to habituation. Any medication or therapy that can do that would be much appreciated. Are you familiar with pavlov? That is one way to do it. Hmm, ok. It maybe one way, but in case I cannot always get that sort of therapy do you know of a medication that can also bring about the pavlov effect? In case I need to do this in my own home? I think medication that exploits the pavlov is called placebo. \n\nI have done a lot of classical conditioning in my own home and it works just fine. Ok, it may seem I do not have to do much therapy in this case. I will try this medication in combination with ritalin to see if this does anything. Also is there anything I need to do in order to make the placebo medication work better? well they use sugar pills in a lot of the studies so maybe you can experiment on that while you work out your environment and how to relate to people who will not stop making the trigger and see what the future brings", "I wish TV and movies would QUIT... ... needing eating scenes and noises continually. When I am watching a series and there is exposition during all the vileness, it makes me so angry. I cannot skip it, and then my anger and disgust pulls me out of the story. I am binge-watching War of the Worlds, and I swear that there is frantic candy bar or cracker eating at keast twice an episode. I know folks vent about this a lot, but it infuriates me that I have to sit and squirm through all the chewing or worse just to get a piece of the story. This series also has lots of crackling plastic and panting/sobbing/worse, all the way through. I am about to give up on it. Mute it and put the closed captioning on. Been trying, but half this shit is in French. There ought to be a law banning eating scenes in movies and TV.  This is why i do not watch any movies that include Brad Pitt. Worst schtick ever, eating something unnecessary in every scene, even when he is talking.", "I have a fun idea for a thread; describe your symptoms in as much detail as you can. Who knows- maybe this can help people who genuinely do not understand. (See my example first to understand) So when I explain how certain sounds bother me- I often explain that a certain sound (whistling, kids shreiking, anything to do with wet mouth sounds, cotton balls, certain accents (I can not STAND Sean Connery or anyones horrible impressions of him).)...\n\nThose sounds make me want to peel off my skin off like I am wearing an Edgar-suit (MIB anyone?)-  so I can step outside of my body just to get away from the sound. I guess I use that exaggeration to explain JUST how badly I need to escape the sounds.  (Sometimes to shorten it, I just say that the sound makes me want to peel my skin off to get away). \n\nI have often seen people with miso make reference to thier teeth- I know that certain sounds make me cringe so hard that it hurts my jaw- it feels like the sound goes right through my teeth, reverberating - and it stabs into my brain. \n\nI want to hear how YOU experience the physical symptoms. How do you describe it- colorfully and with all the gorey descriptors included? With eating sounds, my face boils a bright red and I start sweating. There is a build up of pressure in my ears, almost as if I am 100 feet underwater. My eyes tear up and my jaw clenches. All I want to do is either get angry or leave the room immediately, the flight or fight response.  I can get a pounding headache in my temples. I am unable to focus on anything bar the abusive noises entering my ears. If the noises continue for a prolonged time, the stress causes my excema to flare up and my digestive system to mess itself up. \nIts not very nice :// I immediately have to block my ears and if it is really bad I feel like a kid having a tantrum, all squirmy and frowny and uncomfortable. It either feels like I am trapped in my own body OR absolutely have to run away from the source. Like my body practically moves on its own to get away. I also feel like I want to squeeze or break something just to get all the noises out of my brain. It is so weird, my anxiety triggers my 'freeze' response, but misophonia goes straight to intense flight or sometimes fight.\n\nNot particularly 'gorey' but luckily in my time with misophonia I have only had a handful of really bad triggers (and my triggers are usually somewhat avoidable) Same! And I totally understand what you mean about feeling trapped. \n\nI think that is where the whole trying to escape from my own body thing comes from. With sounds that trigger me, (some are eating sounds, food wrappers) makes me feel like the sound vibrates all through my chest and head.  The sound drowns out all others around me and seem relentless in my brain. I feel like what people would call restless leg syndrome (twitchy irritated and moving constantly) though my arms and legs and head.  I feel trapped and frozen until I get up and leave the area (if I can). I usually feel intensely angry at the person doing it, even if it is someone I quite well like or love. One of mine is the slurping of cereal milk. I have always found milk just absolutely repulsive but there is something about the slurping of cereal milk in particular that is just horrific. I feel incredibly nauseated and then angry that I was not bothering anyone and here someone is invading and assaulting my innocent ears with these horrific sounds and that is exactly what it feels like:an invasion. I do not want to hear these sounds and want them and the people causing them as far away from me as fast as possible. \n&gt;I usually feel intensely angry at the person doing it, even if it is someone I quite well like or love.\n\n&gt;incredibly nauseated and then angry that I was not bothering anyone and here someone is invading and assaulting my innocent ears with these horrific sounds\n\nYES, 100%. Same here. When I hear my dad click his mouse,cough,smack his lips, etc. I also  have a wayyy stronger reaction then anyone else. I thought I was the only one. It is nice to know that is with other people too. A lot of things happen when I hear triggers like crying and wanting to punch a wall. But another thing that happens is it makes me need to pee. Is this also an additional thing that happens to people or just me? I get twitchy to start, like I cannot sit still and I need to move (preferably away from the sound) but I also feel like I need to pee (we called it the bathroom problem when I was a kid because if I heard sniffling then I would go to the bathroom or just hide in there) but there is also the sudden onslaught of rage. I have to put all of my effort in keeping myself from getting violent and it is so exhausting. I have gotten better over the years but I avoid situations with chronic sick people whenever possible because I get this way and people think I am just being a bitch. First of all, I did not know this was an actual thing, I thought I was just really irritable or overly sensitive. I had a light bulb moment reading all these, so thank you! My reactions to certain triggers are irritability, anger, super not okay thoughts about the person(s) doing the thing(s), which does kind of help in the moment, and an honest desire to crawl out of my own skin.

I am pretty much anticipating him taking a sharp intake of breath. It is agonising.\n\nbefore this anxiety episode, my misophonia was just eating noises, and not particularly aimed at him, or bad. I really do not know what to do. It is perpetuating the anxiety.   \nany suggestions? Possibly. By coincidence, I am currently going through the worst anxiety episode of my life right now since something that happened Saturday night. The only time anything worse has happened to me was a series of panic attacks that I sincerely thought were going to kill be towards the beginning of high school.\n\nMy misophonia has indeed been terrible lately. Most recently, the way the sound of a basketball bouncing is different from inside the house as opposed to actually being outside and playing with or being near it has been literal torture. I am so goddamn scared right now. My wife is my trigger too which is what makes misophonia so terribly cruel. It seems to focus on loved ones. The only suggestion I can make is to wear headphones to take the edge off the trigger. Maybe listen to white noise at low ish volume so you cannot still communicate.

I spend them up and I was fine for the rest of the video!!! I think  I just broke the code!!

Hi all,  \n\n\nSorry, maybe a bit of a long post, but it is my first time talking about misophonia.  \n\n\nI heard for the first time about misophonia a few months ago on the radio. Hearing about it, I thought \"Oh yes, I have this condition, everything matches, did not know it was a thing\" but it had always been mild, and therefore bearable. I had a lot of triggers, but never any hard reactions to any of them, just an annoyance at worst. By mild, I mean that I have always been able to internalize my reactions to those triggers.  \n\n\nUntil recently. My baby girl just turned 3 months old, and for now a month, she does what babies do, she sucks her hands. This triggers me madly. By madly I mean that now I sometimes no longer can internalize my reactions. Although, I have enough control to not react unless my baby's in a safe place and to make things 100% clear: I am absolutely not afraid to do her any harm.  \n\n\nBut it sometimes impacts the quality of the time I am spending with her, and I am afraid she might \"read\" the annoyance on my face sometimes and that, this, could also, on the long run, impact my relationship with her.  \n\n\nSo I started to have a deeper look at what misophonia is, how it works etc ... and what kind of coping mechanisms work. I found out that:  \n\n\n\\- Exercise is good to help. Which I already found out by myself a few weeks ago. So, this is going on (not why I am posting).  \n\\- Sharing and talking about it also does help. And that is why I am posting here:  \n\n\nDid anybody ever had similar experiences with his/her own baby and want to talk about it, and the way it is been dealt with?   \n\n\nI would like to go deeper into describing what specifically triggers me when I am with my baby, but only with directly concerned people. I think I wrote enough here for now!  \n\n\nThank you all, I have two question :   \n\\- Are you the mother or the father?   \n\\- You said you are doing exercise, can you tell me more about it?   \n\n\nThanks :) Hi,\n\nYes, indeed, I forgot to precise: I am the father.\n\nI am running, doing crossfit and started kickboxing. I have no interest in CF, but it is a way to really exhaust myself quickly, and work on my breathing.

I caught up with sport weeks ago, not necessarily in order to cope with misophonia, but more with the overall stress of fatherhood, sleep depravation and so on.Discovered ony later that it also helped with misophonia. You are absolutely not afraid to do her any harm? Yeah.. I am hoping they worded that sentence wrong. I am concerned D8 might help you. I accidentally discovered that it dampens my reaction to loud, repetitive noises like the alarms that are never turned off or down at my job. Had taken 10 mgs of a gummie for back pain, and all of a sudden, was no longer homicidal.

The **Sonys** have much nicer bonus features, very very convenient, and I find the earcups more comfortable.  However, the headband part becomes extremely uncomfortable for long wear (which is what I need to do, cuz I wear these to keep sane during work).  On top of that, the noise cancellation is not even that strong, or at least not in the ways I need it to be.  The **Bose QCs** noise cancellation works better for the sounds that I need cancelled out (coughing, chewing, creaky printer), and the headband stays more comfortable for longer.  Even once it does get uncomfortable, it does not cause the same type of ache the Sonys do, on my head anyway.  The control features are way less exciting, but my main concern is misophonia, which means the superior comfort and noise cancelling are the winning factors for me.  I will be returning the Sonys.\n\nAlso, for anyone like me who would never worn noise cancelling headphones before, know upfront that there is a feeling associated with it, not unlike how your ears feel in the pressure of an airplane.

Slurping your drink and chomping loudly on your food like a disgusting horrible pig is a choice. I cannot stress this enough. For the love of sweet planet Earth, please wait until your drink is cool and chew with your damn mouth closed. Especially with crisps/potato chips. The wording could be less aggressive but I completely agree The thing I have found in this sub is that people confront the source of sound with rage and that is what makes people defensive and make them attack our condition, it is a real problem because the condition itself makes us react that way. If someone has the Ability to Respond with closing their mouth while they chew, it is their Respond Ability, or Responsibility. They are not obligated to do it, but always feel free to call them out on it because it is only their manners that stop them. Practice until you get it right. Get the help you need. \n\nIt is nobody's responsibility or obligation to put up with that. I would rather be aggressive and let my rage out here, than take it out on my family. There is a reason I put the 'Venting' flair, and that was so I could vent how I feel. Fair enough, did not see the flair, my bad I completely understand that, but i am not sure where I can find help. I am a 16 year old in an underclass family in a small city where mental health services are not exactly at large. No problem, sorry if I came across as defensive or anything. The help I am talking about is from the people who have the ability but do not have the manners or courtesy to help your with your disability. You need to ask them for help, and to demand it from them.\n\nIf you do not have the ability to respond calmly and quietly to slurping due to your misophonia, then it is a dis-ability. It is not your responsibility to \"just deal with it\" any more than someone in a wheelchair needs to \"deal with\" stairs.\n\nYou are likely in stuck situations where you will not get the help you ask for, but make an effort to practice asking for help, find what works and what does not, and in the future avoid getting into new situations where you will not get the help. You are worth it. Thank you for the advice and saying i am worth it. It is very hard to respond calmly though, the calmest thing I can do is walk away from it because if I speak i will just have an aggressive tone and I am not making that mistake again. Absolutely agree. Do not eat like a pig ffs have some common sense, decency and manners. Eat with your fucking mouth closed wtf is wrong with you Ikr wtf I am pissed off right now because of how my dad chews... just looking at him do it makes me want to punch him in the face sometimes. He smacks not only his jaw, but he stuffs so much food into his mouth that he has to part his lips slightly each time he chews, which makes a tiny popping sound. It has to be the most disgusting and obnoxious sound I have ever heard. Tell me about it. My dad is exactly the same. He will chew loudly, sniff constantly, slosh his drink round in his cup and slurp that shit while he is at it. He is literally a misophone's worst nightmare.\n\nThat is disgusting an downright awful manners. If I was you i would feel like punching him in the face too. Have you tried asking him to stop? I have with my dad on several occasions, politely, of course (i am not an asshole) to no avail. But I seriously have felt like shouting 'WILL YOU STOP EATING AND DRINKING LIKE A FUCKING PIG'. I totally get that. Your dad sounds incredibly intimidating tbh... just for that reason. It doesnt help that bad manners like that are already annoying even without the misophonia. I asked my dad to stop chewing with his mouth open years ago, and at first he got mad and gave me some dumb excuse about his moellers at the back of his mouth in an attempt to make me feel bad for asking. But after we found out what misophonia was, he was more understanding and did his best to chew with his mouth closed... but nowadays, whenever I ask him, he will either tell me to put on my headphones or he will close his mouth for a while until he forgets to keep it closed again. I dont like to constantly nag at him about it, so now I just wear headphones with rushing water sounds during dinner. But sometimes the audio will cut out or he will gesture to me while hes chewing, and I will hear it for like 2 seconds. Even though it is only a couple seconds, it still drives me up the wall. That sounds real annoying ngl. My dad always uses the typical 'I cannot help it' and it like wtf?? Yes you can, stop stuffing so much in there and you would able to shut your mouth.\n\nI used to wear headphones (not noise cancelling) a while back, which was before I had a desk up in my bedroom so I had to have my PC down in the living room, and I used to hear all the trigger sounds no matter what. It drove me up the wall and I cannot tell you the full extent of the relief I got when I finally got a desk for my room.\n\nThat sounds like a good idea, water sounds are real relaxing too.\n\nI try not to say anything, but a lot of the time it is hard not to. Because sometimes I want to be round other people in my house and do not want to just disappear. It sucks that this thing can ruin it. Yeah, rushing water is my go to safe haven. And I know what you mean. My relationship with both my parents has declined because of this. Mostly with my dad. It hurts to think about, but when I try to engage in conversation again, I just get triggered. Having a desk sounds really nice. \n\nI think I have been becoming really passive of this whole thing lately, though I still do get pissed off when he stuffs his face I am so glad we have a place to say this - exactly what runs through my mind as well. Not only is it intensely irritating, but if you are over the age of 4 and eat and/or drink like that, I immediately lose every shred of respect I had for you, too. I hate that I agree, but I do.

I am not diagnosed with misophonia, but I do find hearing my parents having personal conversations from downstairs (when I am often upstairs) VERY irritating. I often feel anger, sometimes anxiety and I can fidget. I also understand this is not really normal for me to act/feel this way, I would like to find ways to deal with it\n\nOn another note, I like to listen to music, mostly underground stuff such as drum and bass, trance, Daft Punk, metal and wave (nothing mainstream). I am just wondering what sort of genre would be really good to overlap this sort of trigger and indulge in something much nicer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you. :)\n\nP.S. I know many people with misophonia have more than one triggers. A few other specific sounds can cause me similar problems but that is irrelevant here lol. Chilled Cow for sure.

I also have NC headphones.\nChilledCow can be found on YouTube and Spotify that i know of. &gt;Chilled Cow \n\nAh yes. I will definitely try this out when something happens. I had always believed this kind of music would not work as it is quiet and chilled and so I would probably hear them still. I would have listened to death metal but I think that gives you adrenaline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you :) I think the noise cancelling part does a good part of drowning out my triggers.

They drag their feet to make noise on purpose. \n\nRubber soled shoes are supposed to keep you from slipping while letting you move around silently. That is why they are called sneakers. Why sneakers have been transformed into an evil musical instrument is beyond me. Lol ive never seen a shoe advertise for their quietness. I dont think theyre called sneakers for that. I havent been able to hold a job cuz of misophonia and anxiety, some data entry jobs will let u wear headphones. \n\nThe shoes were not advertised that way, but they got the name for being quiet.  \"Atmospheric\" music on Spotify is my go-to. Dramatic, weird sounds to focus on that are not remotely normal things to hear. I feel like it helps a lot that they are not the usual sounds. I like to listen to things that sound really fluid, if that makes sense? Because I can get lost in it better.  Which really can be anything from disco to vaporwave to 30s Cuban music to bedroom pop.

He has quite a bit of \u201cvocal fry\u201d and while I did get through the entire doc, I found his voice so unsettling that I had to put subtitles on and turn the volume way down. I am just putting this out there, as I know we all have different triggers and usually I am not triggered by voices (for me it is the usual smacking, chewing gum, food, etc), but there is something about his that caused so much anxiety for me. I have actually been having the same problem. It sucks because I have been wanting to watch the documentary for weeks, but every time I try to watch it I get triggered :/ I cannot even remember by who. I think there is at least two people in that documentary that have voices that I cannot stand. Holy crap!  I thought I was being unreasonable, a Valley accent really gets under my skin.  The prosecutor and juror number one were the worst, but the various experts were pretty insufferable as well. California and it is vocal fry. Blech! See for me it is less about his accent. I am Californian myself, but I do not have a valley accent or vocal fry, but I can say I am pretty used to hearing it whenever I am in SoCal and it never triggered my misophonia before. But for some reason his vocal fry does. I do not quite understand it. But I guess I do not understand any of my other triggers as well. :( Yeah I found it next to impossible to watch it without subtitles. I tried to have the volume at a very low level so I could at least hear the other non triggering sounds. But it was difficult to say the least. I am also a Californian, from the mountains up north, I have a lifetime making fun of my cousins from the valley.  Reading that comment now, I can see how it is a bit offensive. But for real, Valley has an accent. No worries. I did not take offense to it. Oh for sure the Valley does have an accent, I agree. I also have family there and notice it. I was recently in LA for some family planning stuff and we visited a family member that has a pretty thick Valley Accent and uses the word \u201clike\u201d every other word. It was not a trigger for me but it is funny when I think about it. I am finding this almost unwatchable because of the prosecutors vocal fry - his voice is very grating on my nerves I know right? I turned the volume down almost at a mute and had subtitles on. I never had a problem with voices until this documentary. I did not even know this sub existed until i google searched \"Trials of Gabriel Fernandez Netflix Lawyer Vocal Fry\" Yesssss I am so glad I found this, it is INFURIATING to me to listen to this guys voice. I am just on episode 1 and am not sure I can continue watching it. Vocal fry is so strange and annoying.", "Misophonia getting worse as I become more aware of it I recently (about a year ago) found out about misophonia. I had a misophonic classmate that explained to me what it was when he noticed that I was really aggravated with sounds/noise at the library. As I took note of this, I became more and more aware of how sounds anger me and induced that flight-or-flight feeling. \n\nIn addition, this same year, I had an upstairs neighbor that would get up and walk in circles, because her Fitbit told her too (and, mind you, this was an old creaky apartment). It really drove me crazy and to tears; in fact I even put a hole through the wall. I was so angry and upset by how people can be so inconsiderate, even though I have politely asked them to stop so many times! I have even told them how sensitive to noise I am...but I feel like no one really gets it and brushes me off.  \nFlash forward, I moved into a new apartment. I loved my roommates, but there were also strains in our relationship. The walls were thin in this house, and I shared a wall with one of my roommates who would game and yell a lot! I have also asked him politely multiple times...This time I covered it up as me wanting to sleep early, which was somewhat true. I would have to keep reminding him, and at some point I gave up. It upsets me how non-self-aware some people can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am back home living with my dad, and I have to catch myself from lashing out sometimes.

For hours. I have been listening to her daily crap for months. It is driving me absolutely nuts. My 3 hour commute is miso hell. My open office workplace is miso hell. My own home is miso hell. (I also have a roommate that I had nothing to do with, but that is a different story.) I got earplugs because of her, and I am sick of the discomfort of wearing them. Not to mention that some of the noises are loud enough to seep through the earplugs. I have woken up in a panic multiple weekends thanks to her shit.\n\nWithout exaggerating or being dramatic, her time schedule for the noise is around 4pm to 11pm on weekdays, and around 10am to 11pm on weekends, and it is insane. I think it would drive someone crazy even without miso. I understand that people have to clean, and sometimes, they have to do deep cleaning, but I keep wondering, what the heck is she doing every day?? Is her dog so rowdy that it keeps messing things up? Is she obsessed with deep cleaning? Does she feel the need to redecorate every day? Is she doing airbnb, and would that require daily cleaning / rearrangement? What can a person be doing all day that requires this much noise?\n\nI have only interacted with her very briefly so far. For some reason, she feels the need to assert her dominance immediately by being a condescending, combative asshole, even when saying hello, so I have absolutely zero desire to talk to her. I highly doubt she would take it graciously.\n\nMy back is so tense I feel like it is going to snap. As per usual, she started at 10 in the morning on this blessed Saturday. It is 9pm and she is still going. I am through a migraine, 3 hours of being outside, and an exhausting earplug nap. I usually try to drown out her noise by wearing noise cancelling headphones and listening to music, watching videos, or playing with my friends. It does very little, all of those activities are dissatisfying because I cannot relax. I can still hear it. I am usually irritated when I talk to my best friend while we play, and I am sick of explaining the same story every day. I can tell that they are sick of hearing my complaints, too.\n\nI am having a hard time not detailing the horrible things I wish on her. I am so glad I am moving out in January.\n\nThanks for the opportunity to vent. If anyone has any advice, I would be happy to hear it. You had me at yeeting her in the sun..\nThat sounds exhausting. Have you tried just banging on the ceiling with a broom handle? I have considered it, but I do not know her. There is a chance that it would just make things worse :D I do not know but seeing how she is not very approachable I have a feeling I would do it out of desperation. You are a prisoner in your own home. That is the one place you should be able to relax. I lived in an apartment where the dude next door would play his booming bass in the middle of the night. I would just beat on the wall and he would finally turn it down If she gives you any shit tell her it is a form of anxiety You are right, I do feel like a prisoner. It is kind of a theme with all the noise I have never been able to turn off and people telling me I am too sensitive.\n\nI used to have a neighbor who would bang on her ceiling (my floor) with a broom, and even on the water pipes, very frequently. My daily schedule involved getting home at 7-8pm, sitting in front of a computer, going to the balcony for the occasional smoke. I did not feel it was justified. Doing it would make me feel bad, because that made me feel like a prisoner, too.\n\nI so sick of the guilt, but also the fact that people dismiss my needs. aaaaaaaaaaa People do not realize we cannot just ignore it. I recently talked to my doctor about depression and anxiety and I told her about this. She took it into account and I am trying something,  if you can I would talk to a doctor about it too. It very much is a form of anxiety. I do not know what to tell you. Have you talked to your landlord? Maybe something will open up where you could just move out from under her I will talk to a doctor about it. I have done therapy but I feel like it is time to start again, now that I know more.\n\nSince I am moving out in January, I am trying to just endure for now. I just really, really needed to vent.\n\nThank you for talking to me and for the advice!! Heck yeah for moving out!!! Hey, no problem at all. That whole situation just makes me angry for you. I totally understand. Vent away \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a To lighten the mood, this is a conspiracy theory that high me came up with but I lowkey believe it:\n\nI like to believe the world is divided into two sets of people. Those who have or have not every tried rearranging their furntire of a non first floor flat twice a week.\n\nYou hear people complain abt it all the time, but usually in a joking or comedal social manner. It would be very easy to meaningless joke abt your obsession with rearranging furniture with how the people who dont have the obsession talk abt it.\n\nSo patient zero(s) are the dancers. Obviously. And then the people who have lived below dancers got annoyed. And in attempt to take out their frustration they mocked their upstairs neighbors by mimicking them. And after about the third time rearranging, they were hooked. And so on and so forth to their downstairs neighbors. Wow, my downstairs neighbor is so calm next to yours. And mine already drives me insane (she just talks and laughs loudly at 3am so I can hear glimpse of her, but goddammit I wish she became mute).\n\nStay strong, you will soon be free or her. But I would consider annoying your neighbor with noise too, since she obviously does not give a damn about her neighbors... You know, just give her a taste of her own medicine. That is not going to help. Op needs to at least try to talk to her. Take the flat mate maybe and describe the miso as anxiety, if that needs to come into it at all. \n\nHow does the flat mate feel about it all? I had a similar neighbor to OP and I braced some speakers against the ceiling (because obviously the insulation between the floors was horrible) and blasted obnoxious electronic music. Do not live below someone is my only advice. It is inevitable to hear your upstairs neighbor in an apartment building. I did that to my upstairs neighbor (yeah, I am between two noisy neighbors, it is pure hell) when he thought playing his bass at max volume was a good idea.\n\nBut the one downstairs... She is something special. Got two emails from the \"HOA\" (well, what is close to one) and she still does not understand that 5am is not a good time to wake me up. So I just hit the floor when I hear her, like I am trying a dog... Maybe it will work. Thanks for the reply! The flat mate has been very understanding about my anxiety, but she is way less confrontational than I am. She has her baggage of her own, and I would not want to put her into the situation.\n\nLuckily I am moving out soon to a top floor apartment. I love this, thanks for sharing :D\n\nI once had a downstairs neighbor who got extremely pissed because we were vacuuming the floor on a Saturday after lunch for 20 minutes. She turned on the radio full volume and blasted the entire neighborhood until 6pm. This is how villains are born. The 3am thing sounds exhausting as hell. At least I get some quiet after midnight. I feel for you.\n\nI would rather not try to take revenge like that and annoy the rest of my neighbors, they are all very nice. I moved around quite a lot and this does not *always* seem to be a problem, but it still happens. I am moving to a top floor apartment now! That sounds absolutely terrible and I am glad you are able to move out soon- just hold on to that. \n\nIt sucks when you cannot even relax in your own home and I definitely know how you feel. I started wearing noise cancelling headphones in my place because hearing my neighbours or even anticipating hearing them was too stressful. The only other advice I have is to try to get a top floor apartment.\n\n( is a relevant video that always makes me chuckle. It is exhausting. Gives me anxiety... But I will try to actually communicate, soon I guess.\n\nBut I feel for you too. Having to wait after midnight to have some peace is annoying as hell. Thank you for the kind words! I totally get being anxious about anticipating the noise. I hope the headphones helped.\nI have lucked out and getting a top floor apartment.\n\nThat video made my day :D", "Identical twins with Misophonia New to this platform but wanted to share my troubles with Misophonia plus I need to vent to people who can relate. Since my identical twin sister and I were 7 (now 23)  we have struggled with certain sounds. We cannot help but react when people tap on things, type, sniffle, chew, slurp, drink, click, etc. we have felt guilty for getting angry but at the same time we can not control our emotional reaction to the noises. \n\nPeople get angry with us when we ask them to avoid making the noises that trigger us which makes us feel worse. \n\nAlso, My bf recently moved in and now every noise he makes drives me insane. It has gotten to the point where I cannot sleep in the same bed because of his snoring and I cannot eat near him and the sound of his computer mouse and Xbox controller make me not want to get out of bed.\n\nAnyways, I wanted to post to seek out any useful techniques for coping with triggers especially for someone living in close quarters with another person. Looking for advice that I can use and pass on to my twin.\nI am desperate to get my Misophonia under control. I usually just wear earbuds with white noise like running water. It plays off of an mp3 player, which you can download various tracks on to. You can turn it up or down to drown out the noise but still hear what is going on around you. It will be annoying and hard to get used to, and I would not suggest wearing them too often since you might start to rely heavily on them. But that is typically what I use. \n\nWhen it comes to the snoring though, that is something that is a bit more difficult. You could try having the earbuds in while you sleep, but that is not always very comfortable. You will have to talk to your bf about it. Theres a few things that can lessen snoring like nasal strips, increased humidity, sleeping position, etc. Also, getting a fan in your room or playing white noise out loud while you sleep might help, since your mind might process less emphasis in the snoring, making it less agitating. \n\nI wish the absolute best for you. If you have any questions, you can message me. I am always willing to talk to other people with misophonia. It honestly sucks a lot, but that is why we all stick together! \n\nOh yeah, and when it comes to the ear buds, I would recommend the small kind that fit into your ear. They are very comfortable unlike the big bulky ones!", "Should I move to this house? I am house hunting for my final year at uni and have found a house share in a quiet residential area, so no qualms about that, and the two girls living them seem super quiet and lovely, literally perfect housemates (medics on placement, and they have quiet hobbies, not clubbing etc)\n\nThe only issue is, I am most likely to get the bottom floor room, which also shares a wall with the neighbour.\n\nNow, knowing myself, I am so worried about getting this room and having to potentially hear:\n- light, unintentional, stomping (e.g because the ceiling transmitting sound easy or something) \n- neighbour noise, particularly chatting\n\nFrom what I understood from the convo, the neighbour is either a couple with two kids, or an old lady, but I am not sure which one is just adjacent to the house, rather than attached. \n\nThe couple with kids would concern me, kids cannot help but be chatty, active and whatnot. And kids screaming especially triggers me too. \n\nDue to lockdown, I have not gone and seen the house in person, but I have video called and seen photos.\n\nWhat is the best course of action?\n\nI do not want to miss out on a rare quiet house (for student houseshares), but at the same time, I am worried I will be having panic attacks all alone, especially because my partner and I will likely be long distance next year (hence why I am looking at house shares)  How long are you planning to stay? If the kids are loud and your possible roommates are generally more reserved/ quiet, then you might be able to wear headphones and be fine, but only if you plan to stay for up to a year or so. Otherwise, maybe consider other possibilities. You could explain your situation and see if they are willing to acknowledge that. Overall, I think you should think about how long you are staying, if you have the proper 'gear,' and just how loud they say it is. I know this is not super helpful, but I hope this makes it just a bit easier. Thank you for the reply, I appreciate the advice.\nI only plan to stay for a year, unless by some miracle I decide to do a PhD after my final year of masters.\n\nEven then, I would have the choice to leave as the contract only lasts a year.\n\nI spoke to the housemate currently there, and she gave a couple of blanket statements about the kids not being noticeably loud, but she did say that they she would met them and had has not heard any tantrums/screaming. \nThat said, I have no way of knowing about stomping/etc because there is no polite way to ask \"do you jump/dance/walk around lots in your room?\" lol\n\nI think I am going to spend another week mulling over it before I properly decide tbh! Well, I am glad I can help in some way! I had bottom room and it made my life an enduring misery for a year. Do not do it. That is what I worry about. What exactly was awful? Just stomping? or other things too? Sorry just seen this; I had good housemates but when they decided to go out for a drink or two, I would always have to wait for them to come home, because I would hear them in the living room and bursting through the front door. They could sometimes be so loud because they were drunk and forgot themselves. Not good when you have lectures / exams the next day! \n\nIt depends where your bottom bedroom is located. Luckily I had no neighbours on my side but if you have, think about that too. I just hated being on the ground floor and being subject to anything going on in the living room. I would never take a bottom room. Just my opinion :) and good luck! Yeah I am worried that no matter who I house with, as long as I am on bottom floor, I will not be happy. Even if they are not loud people, sometimes noise downstairs is inevitable. Especially being next to kitchen/living room and even a study. \n\nI am currently looking around still as I have until end of the month to decide, and hopefully I can find a nice top floor room with other quiet people. Only issue is that detached houses are rare in student areas in the UK, so will still have to settle for potentially sharing a wall with a neighbour anyway RIP\n\nThank you for the advice!! And I am sorry you went through an awful time in that room, hope you have got nicer accommodation now! Hehe it was a few years ago! I am 33 now, you will be fine with an attic room. I had several attic rooms in my time at uni and they were so much better. It is because rarely did neighbours party in their rooms - it was always the living room. So having an attic was absolutely perfect - people only went up their to sleep. Do not worry. I would always do top floor. I would say you have a sleeping problem.

I have become one of their biggest triggers, as we spend a great deal of time together, but in the past we have been able to manage their responses. They have an assortment of headphones and earplugs and they sleep in a separate room from me so they can retreat there when they are overstimulated. I try to avoid as many of their trigger sounds as possible and if I slip up my partner will remind me and I will try not to repeat the sound. \n\nOver the last year and a half I have noticed that their misophonia has significantly worsened to the point that now just the sound of my voice is triggering to them. At first it was certain mouth sounds, like 'f', 's', 'sh', 'ch', and 'th' words (i have a little lisp leftover from when i had braces). But now it seems we can hardly have a conversation for more than 10 minutes without them becoming a little short with me or slamming drawers or cupboards closed a little too hard before they finally retreat to their room to get some silence. \n\nI am now considering some form of speech therapy so that my voice will be less triggering to them. However I am also becoming concerned about the health of our relationship in regards to how triggering I am for my partner. If my sounds are their biggest trigger, then are we really compatible with each other? Or will we simply need to be flexible in regards to managing their triggers and coping mechanisms as a couple?\n\nI dont want anyone to think that I am trying to jump ship because my partner's triggers have become more complicated to manage.

I will not be able to be on the receiving end of being annoyed without caring. I will not be able to do everything with them, I cannot grow old with them. \n\nAll because of my misophonia. All because the closer someone gets, the worse the triggers are. It is stupid. I WANT to experience all of that. I want to grow old with my best friend, I want to feel like we are siblings, I want to be able to experience all of the stuff you see other best friends doing. Me having friendship anxiety and abandonment problems already stand as barriers to experiencing that, but misophonia is a wall. It is something I cannot overcome. It is not something I can cure. I can only help myself with the way I react to the triggers. The feelings towards the triggers are always going to be there. I hate it. \n\nSorry for the vent I have just been feeling extra lonely and frustrated with my misophonia recently lol I do not have misophonia, but damn. This post just highlights how impactful it is. \n\nMy SO has misophonia - and I feel like every day it gets just a little bit worse. I am scared to think of what the future holds. I am so happy to have found a space where others feel the way I do. There are days I want to rip my ears off my head. Everyone close to me makes sounds I cannot stand no matter how good I am feeling.  My own boyfriend breathes so loud when he is sleeping, it drives me nuts, but we are planning on staying together for the rest of our lives.  Miso truly sucks, but do not let it stop you from trying to strengthen your bonds. Do not be too hard on yourself. Take time for yourself as often and as much as you need it. The right people for you will understand and they are out there! Been with my SO 6 years and yeah.......in the back of my mind there is the little misophonia devil who wishes he would just leave so I can have some peace and quiet. He grinds his teeth in his sleep, makes a vacuum in his mouth when he eats so it makes this negative suction noise when he chews, just generally makes a lot of freaking mouth noise, and also taps his feet and fingers a lot. Literally the love of my life but if he left tomorrow I would feel like an absolute demon for the part of my brain that would feel joy at never having to hear his mouth again. And I hate myself because of this invasive asshole of a disorder I have been dealt. Sure I am hyper sensitive and can see and hear stuff other people cannot....cool cool.....literally not worth being a disfunctional human who cannot even enjoy the simple pleasures of a relationship. I am not worthy of his love. I do not get why he sticks with me because I know I am impossible to deal with. \ud83e\udd7a I guess I am lucky to have such a patient and understanding wife! Sometimes she makes me laugh when she opens a bag of chips and eats them so carefully like she does not want to be heard by a predator. I have had miso for over 40 years - it DEFINITELY impacts on friendships and some of those friendships could have turned into relationships.\n\nBUT\n\nDo not lose hope, there are people out there who are a good match for you and do not send you into a spiral of triggered fury. \n\nMind you, they can still tear your heart in two but that is another story that is nothing to do with miso eh", "How do I meditate when breathing triggers me? Whenever I try to meditate(I am a beginner) the video/ person telling me what to do says to focus on my breathing\u2026 well I cannot! :( It is one of my misophonia triggers and I cringe and I do not like it! What can I do? Is there another way to meditate without focusing on my breathing? Thanks.. I use headspace and make up my own by listening to calming music and focus on emptying my mind I have never been bothered by my own sounds. In fact, mimicking a \u201ctrigger\u201d sound usually helps soften the blow...\n\nI guess the only immediate solution would be white noise or running water; since ear plugs amplify your own breath and heartbeat. \n\nLong term- Are you going through a very stressful time right now? Being under stress definitely amplifies the effect of triggers. I know how this sounds, but (whole food/sugar free) diet and exercise has helped me lower stress tremendously and subsequently be able to deal with triggering situations better. I will probably never be able to sit in a room with someone with a runny nose but I do not want to strangle them now so that is an improvement. I have a friend who focuses on a candle flame. You could do body scans and progressive relaxation, or you could focus on your heartbeat instead of your breathing. You could also focus on a mantra, like the transcendental meditation folks do.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to do mindfulness meditation during a repetitive activity like walking. Thank you so much!  Alright, I will try listening to calming music, thanks for commenting! I definitely know that living healthy would help to minimize stress in life, thanks for commenting! I usually try to stretch in the mornings or go outside. There is a good mindfulness technique which gets you to try to focus your mind\u2019s attention on your breathing (usually, just because it is simple and repetitive), and if any other thoughts or stimuli like sounds are experienced, do not fight them, but try to become an observer of yourself in that situation, rather than an \u201cexperiencer\u201d. \n\nAfter some practise, it started helping me. It creates a sort of mental barrier between the sound itself and the resulting emotions.", "\"Farts are bad because everybody hates them, but sounds are fine because only you hate them, so we keep doing them while you are present\"  okay but THIS Tell that to my dog who puts his cheeks right on my nose and let us one out Okay, but farts are a basic bodily function. Yes, they smell bad, but it is not exactly healthy to keep them in. And for people like me with intestinal issues, it is not voluntary. I do not know why it is stigmatized.", "This was torture I use yt autoplay. And I was just cooking and yt did it is thing. But the next creator was so incredibly triggering, even though I watch on at least 1.75 speed to minimize triggers that I really needed to turn it off. But I had olive oil all over my hands. And I needed to wash them first. And I was so stressed that I messed up with the soap dispenser. And then I accidentally hit the increase volume button instead of the on off one. And now I am sad, but at least I will have some oven veggies to stress eat in a while.... i feel your pain.most of the ads are torturous!! Looking at you, Pepsi", "My fiance will not take my misophonia seriously? So, my misophonia has gotten a lot worse the past few years. I have dated my fiance for about 5 years and we have lived together for 2 now, and ever since moving in he has become the biggest source of my triggers.\n\nI have gotten around the eating by playing loud tv and sitting away from him. (It helps that he eats very fast as well.) When we sleep we have fans blasting and the tv on, but even then I am sometimes kept awake by the sounds of his breathing.  The worst part, however, are certain things I cannot escape from. \n\nHe will constantly shake his leg or rub his feet together, and he is prone to biting his nails. I tried to suffer through this at first but It is endless, he will bite his almost non-existent nails for hours at a time, and the clicking noise and sight of it drivez me insane. \n\nHe does not believe that Misophonia is real and because of this he thinks I just hate him and am being mean to him. I have tried so hard to make him understand but we end up blowing up at each other, me because I am being endlessly triggered and him because he feels attacked. \n\nI love him and we want to get married, but I am starting to get so stressed out by just his presence that I am considering ending the relationship entirely. I hate that this dumb condition is ruining my life and all my potential relationships. I am so sorry you have this, it is hell. Have you tried to explain it when both of you are calm? Or maybe print some documents and lay them on his bureau. Those ones that are very easy to read so he can compete it without getting bored. Maybe also say that you really care about him but that it cannot be ignored.\n\nIf he still does not want to understand, you can explain it as if it is a physical condition, like getting a massive headache whenever you hear those sounds or getting earpain. That way he will also kind of relate and maybe consider it.\n\nOnce again I am terribly sorry that you have to go through all of this, but remember, you are never alone I am sorry. My partner does not take it seriously either. She would rather watch tiktok than read this sub and get an idea of what I go through. Honestly it sounds like he has some anxiety-based behaviors with the nail biting and leg shaking. He cannot \"just stop\" and more than you can \"just ignore\".  \n\nYou can try earplugs for sleeping, but if this relationship is going to last, you guys would probably benefit greatly from couple's therapy. We are on the exact same boat. I am living THE SAME situation with my husband. He also will not take it seriously and feels attacked. His presence is stressing me and making me anxious to the point my heart races when i hear his footsteps getting closer. Weirdly enough mine does the same noises/movements. Would you like to chat? I would love to share with someone who understands. Omg. My bf bites his nails and the clicking sound drives me INSANE. I thought I was alone. Well honestly the more Tiktok someone watches, the dumber they become. Maybe suggest she browses #misophonia on tiktok? Interesting. I have never been on tiktok I will suggest to her thanks Have you tried talking about without saying misophonia? Maybe he ha some hang ups on the name. Instead, try saying these habits (and specifically name them) really bother you. Describe how feel (murderous? like crying? hated? ashamed? annoyed?) and how immediate and intense the feeling is. Be clear that he is doing a specific thing that really bothers you. Remind him that it is those specific behaviors that are the issue. You like being with him and the only exception are when he is doing thing 1, thing 2, or thing 3. Your head knows he is not doing those on purpose to hurt you but your heart is insane and is saying he is attacking you. That is disconnect causes stress. \n\nFor nail biting specifically, maybe discuss with him that the working world does not like to see such a thing. I am assuming you are old enough to get jobs since you are getting married but I am also just assuming you are young because of I do not know why. Anyway, nail biting is typically considered childish (at least somewhat). There are a lot of ways to stop nail biting, including the terrible tasting nail polish they use for kids. Apparently, nail biting can lead to a lot of nasty infections. I bit my nails for years and years and never had a problem with it, but it can happen.\n\nFor noises at night - well, two bedrooms are not the worst solution if you can afford it. \n\nTo be quite honest though, if he cannot take you seriously that this bothers you, it feels like there are deeper problems. If you had the flu, would he tell you to toughen up and go to work? If you had something serious like a heart attack or burst appendix, would he get to you a doctor soon enough? I do not know you or him so maybe I am way off base here. But take a close look and think about it - does he minimize your concerns and problems or does he listen and take it seriously? Never been on tiktok either, but I know it accepts hashtags (who does not nowadays..), cannot hurt trying. Now I am a bit curious about what kind of things you would find in there with this hashtag, but guess I will never know.. I would be cautious of searching that platform for that hashtag, being a person with misophonia. I hate it when I get \"jumped\" by someone lipsmacking or worse in a video, only for me to freak out and panic too much to be able to stop it.\n\nThen again, maybe tiktokers are not using such an unkown term for tags unless they have the condition? This is just my opinion, not being an expert or anything at relationships:\n\nIf your partner is unable or unwilling to care about your life altering condition, then perhaps you should consider this a sign that your partner is not the right one for you (or you are not right for your partner).\n\nMy view is that my partner should not have to \"endure\" me. I will not expect my partner to mind to my every little issue, but I DO expect my partner to mind my most aggrevious issues, as I mind my partners issues.\n\nPoint is: make him understand your condition is real. If you cannot make that happen, or your partner still will not mind your condition, then you may have to \"endure\" your partner for the rest of your life. Yeah, I agree with this. If a relationship is to work there needs to be compromise. For instance wife absolutely cannot fall asleep in complete silence, I sleep very poorly with any sort of noise. We use an app that plays rain sounds for a half hour and then tapers off to silence, allowing her to fall asleep and then turning off so that I can sleep restfully as well. They will never get it. Just live alone.", "Anyone know of Misophonia friendly twitch streamers? I like watching twitch - particularly gaming channels and some just chatting channels. But, so many of them think it is okay to just whip out a 4 course meal or a can of pringles during the stream. I get why they do it (uptime = money), and that people with Misophonia are the minority here, do not get me wrong. \n\nSome streamers, like Kitboga (he calls scammers), will black himself out and *kind of* mute himself when he is eating on stream. That is better than nothing. I do not expect anyone to flat out not eat or drink into the microphone on stream, that would be too good to be true. So, this is kind of what I am looking for: streamers who generally go out of their way so that people do not need to see or hear them eat or drink on stream. \n\nIf anyone knows of any channels I can check out, please drop them here :)\n\nOther streaming platforms are cool too. I have personally never had a problem with kyr_sp33dy and his crew. But I do not really watch enough twitch to be for sure. I know his YouTube channel does not have any eating. If YouTube adds get you install the app musi, it is free and play no audio adds only. Awesome, thank you! I will check them out.\n\nAlso, thank you for the app recommendation! I will check that out as well. Variety streamers Cohh Carnage and AdmiralBahroo are both easy on the ears, good guys, and have wholesome communities. i honestly do not get why they dont choose mics that cancel out those sounds. I have a \u00a315  mic from amazon (so it is not expensive to have one)  that blocks out everything that just isnt my voice. i can clap, make wrapper sounds, eat, even breathing ect and it cuts it all out. no keyboard noises or mouse noises. Thanks! I will check them out. Appreciate you taking the time :) Do you maybe have some recommendations? My daughter has misophonia and is studying abroad, we would love to try to accommodate her better so she will actually enjoy family game nights or group conversations.", "Not sure if I have misophonia? I am not too sure as I have literally just discovered it (I googled \u201cwhy do some sounds make my blood boil\u201d and here we are) and I am also known as a bit of a hypochondriac but it might give me some peace knowing it is a mental thing and that I am not just a horrible person! \n\nThe main two sounds that trigger me are snoring and coughing. Snoring is definitely the worst and I have always hated it, it does not matter who snores, the minute it starts I lose it. I get so angry and frustrated, I feel like I want to scream and hit out. I have to move to a different room. Coughing also frustrates the hell out of me and during these covid times (my boyfriend had it and I was stuck in a single room with him) I feel really awful for snapping but it honestly makes me feel so angry and almost like I could cry with frustration.\n\nThere is certain other habits but I feel like I get triggered by them if I know they are coming, if that makes sense? Whenever my dad eats ice cream he slurps and makes these awful noises and I absolutely hate it but I do not think I really notice it with anyone else. I also hate when people shout at a football game and are really angry, it makes me anxious as well as highly frustrated but that could be the tension in the room.\n\nI do notice that this is all heightened if I am on my period, even smaller noises will annoy me, like the sounds of eating etc.\n\nI already suffer with trichotillomania and dermatillomania which are two OCD issues, so when I read that this is also somewhat OCD related, it could all add up and make some sense. ive also noticed my triggers become more.. infuriating? when i am on my period. \nthere certainly is a high possibility you could have it :) I do not think you need to be officially diagnosed with misophonia TBH. If sounds make your blood boil, then that is just how it is. The only reason I would go to a therapist about it is if there was something they could do that would help me!\n\nMine is definitely worse when I am already irritated, and that includes being on my period. I also hate the sound of coughing and it makes me feel like such a bad person lol.", "I need serious help lol. pls adopt me (15f) This is my first ever reddit post. Noise typically does not bother me when i am awake and functioning. The only times it bothers me is early in the mornings and late at night. I am a pre light sleeper so I do wake up quite easily when I hear noise. I do not have a trigger noise/sound in particular, any noise that I find annoying is annoying to me. I am not sure if that makes sense but like birds chirping will not usually bother me, although I have had times where I felt like brutally stabbing them. My dad has a habit of vacuuming in the morning and sometimes blasting music. I hate my dad in general so him doing this adds fuel to the fire. Also I live in an asian household so my parents are always loud, I absolutely despise the sound of them talking. (To each other and other asian guest, its so fucking loud I just want to dip myself in lava). \n\nMy brother constantly games day and night, but it does not bother me so much throughout the day. This is because my brain is not so much aware of the noise around me. At night when it is quite, the only fucking thing I can hear is my brothers $300 wireless Logitech mouse pounding on his motherfucking mousepad. This is a sound that triggers me, it is currently 3am and I am sobbing as I write this. I have middle child anger issues too so like I do not just feel overly irritated,  i feel like I could commit a genocide where I individually go and murder every single citizen in my country. When he finished gaming, he goes in his room and then calls his friends (Another thing that makes extremely frustrated). The sound of muffled talking just irritates me in way I cannot describe, I would wish he would just shut the fuck up sometimes. There was this one time he chatted away up until 7am (he had the audacity to take the day off while I went to school that day). I remember getting so angry that I threw something at the wall (our rooms are next to each other). \n\nThese sounds make me very anxious and stressed out, I try to breathe like everyone says but that does not really help. There is nothing I can really do about it so I just let myself get angry and cry. I can only sleep when it is dead silent or when I am in a comfortable environment, so playing music will only stop the stress but will not help me sleep. \n\nOur state/city has been in lockdown for like a long fucking time now and it is driving me nuts, like so fucking nuts. Because of this, I have not been able to get proper sleep and I end up missing a lot of my morning classes. I think it is week 7/8 of term 3 now and my teachers keep emailing me, like stfu I think I know by now. It is taking a huge toll on my education, not my marks but my study habits. I guess it is better than being at school thought since I have social anxiety but that is another issue. \n\nAnyone know how I can cope with this? Both the misophonia and social anxiety. Hey there! I started to realize I (19f) had misophonia around your age too. One of my trigger sounds is also my two brothers gaming so I totally understand the frustration of the clicking and the (i am assuming) occasional yelling and loud talking. I recently switched rooms so I am grateful that this trigger does not affect me as badly anymore. The best advice I can offer you is to go into your bathroom and run the shower for a bit to calm yourself down or plug in your headphones and fine a nice audio online. My family is not very understanding of misophonia and unfortunately that seems to be the norm :/ I feel your pain, remembering similar situations where muffled talking went on for hours with no end. Got into a fight with my brother over it (he was doing the talking in the other room). He was not in school or working, so he was up all friggen night talking over skype.\n\nLong story short, here is what I learnt that has worked for me:\n\n1: earplugs or in-ear headphones with music of your choice.\n\n2: my music of choice has been purpously sound intensive to drown out any external sounds. (Drum and bass, psytrance, metal... You get where I am going with this)\n\n3: moving out. Will be hard at your age, so i suggest doing 4.\n\n4: Literally anything you can do to suffer less. maybe the problem cannot be fixed, but it can probably be improved. If you can move to another room, try that. Try putting some furniture on the wall from which the sounds are coming (maybe help block the sounds..). Try playing \"white noise\" on a loudspeaker. Close a window or door if there are any open ones that lets the sounds come in. Earplugs and music obviously already mentioned. Hi going with this)\n\n3: moving out, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68", "Is there any scientific basis to my hypothesis? I have misophonia, but it is specifically targeted towards the specific way my dad chews his food. I did some thinking, and a potential justification is that sitting at family dinners as a young child and hearing everyone get riled up about politics, in an echo chamber, could have caused the unconscious correlation between chewing and anger, and anxiety. Has anyone else experienced this? Not to mention my dad would always get even angrier when I got upset with the noise, yelling \"there is nothing I can do about it\", or \"You are going to have to deal with chewing your whole life\" or some other dumb thing. so is this justification legitimate? has there been any tests on misophonia from this psychological perspective? I am not exactly sure, but I think that that is a legitimate reason. This makes a lot of sense to me. I can definitely relate. All of my triggers have a specific, unique connection to a bad experience that does not have much to do with the actual sound.", "To complain or not to complain? I will try to keep this brief! I have always had a thing with noise and for my my triggers are hearing neighbours. This trigger has become worse as I used to live next to a man who was sexually harassing me and would blast music in his house and garden all day and night. His dogs would also bark all the time too and I could hear him sneeze through the wall as the noise insulation was terrible. I became mentally ill while living in this home and as I live alone I felt more unsafe there with his behaviour. I tried talking to him and my other neighbour but it got worse. \n\nI moved out in the end and live in a lovely flat but it is on the ground floor and the general level of noise of my neighbours moving around upstairs constantly triggers me. I would speak to them directly and ask them to walk softer but it seems unreasonable to ask. I am also too terrified to ever speak to a neighbour again about noise after my last experience and I know I would have a panic attack and cry as I am just so sensitive to it all.\n\nI was thinking of ringing the management company of the building and explaining it to them but not naming names of the noise coming from above me (which may be too difficult to make a general complaint). I am just so scared of a similar thing happening to me and my current neighbours above me (a couple in their 30s) seem nice but that is what I thought about the man in my previous home. \n\nTo combat things at the moment I sleep with headphones in and listen to white noise and I sleep well. During the day I use noise cancelling headphones to do work (working from home is obvious magnifying the issue as the neighbours also work from home). \n\nI feel so stupid to feel so on edge like this all the time I just cannot seem to get past it. I am currently doing some EMDR therapy to help with my triggers as well. Have you tried ear plugs? If you can afford a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones, I basically live in them when I am at home. They connect to my phone and tv so I just leave them on and it allows me to not hear the constant bass music outside my windows\n\nEdit:spelling you cannot wear earplugs 24/7. it will cause infections and ear pain. They are good option for sleep. I tried various things to combat this for years in many different places.\n\nWhen I moved out to the country, everything was suddenly totally fine. 90% of my anxiety gone just by putting 500m between me and the nearest neighbor. Even my cats are less stressed out.\n\nLong term it has been a perfect solution. After 10 years, I am never going back to the city, or even a suburb. The only thing I want to hear is the wind and the frogs. This is my dream!!! I am trying to save up so I can buy a house with no neighbours attached. I will get there one day! X if you like ear pain Better use Ear plugs + headphone than only headphones. Originally I was going to wait until I could buy one, but it is actually cheaper around here to rent 1500 sqft on 5 acres than it is to get a 2 bedroom apt downtown. So I am renting my silent oasis, and saving money over living in the city.", "MIL has triggered a whole new annoyance So. Currently living with my husbands mother as we are trying to save for a deposit for a house. She is  a lovely woman do not get me wrong but my god I am my wits end with her constant need to make noise. I thought it was just people eating that triggered me but apparently people that cannot go 5 seconds without having to make some sort of unnecessary noise is another.\nIt is bad enough that I cannot watch a tv show without running commentary. But that is an annoyance not a trigger. What is triggering me is that she is constantly making sounds. Shes been home from work for an hour and she is not stopped slapping her lips together, breathing heavily, sighing, scratching her finger nails across the settee or if she is not doing that she is rubbing her feet across the carpet, laughing at things she is looking at on her phone. Its like ffs can you stop being a constant source of noise. I cannot go 10 seconds without a noise coming from her direction. Its driving me insane \ud83e\udd2f /u/kelmacdesigns, I have found an error in your post:\n\n &gt; \u201c~~Its~~  like ffs\u201d\n\nIn your comment, you, kelmacdesigns, can write \u201c~~Its~~  like ffs\u201d instead. \u2018Its\u2019 is possessive; \u2018it is\u2019 means \u2018it is\u2019 or \u2018it has\u2019.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!) Seems like some people are just like this. I wish I knew why. Like there has to be some reason they feel the need to constantly make noise. And of course if we say something we are the rude ones. People do not appreciate that misophonia is a real thing. Anyway I feel your pain. I feel you. It seems like every time I leave my bedroom my parents up their trigger-making by ten. Sitting quietly before? Now ones scratching their head and slurping their drink, the others yawning and smacking their lips. If I sneak out of my room they are dead silent. It is like they feel the need to be active whenever there is another person in the room\n\nPerhaps music or headphones could help you? Quiet music while reading/working/etc or headphones while watching a tv show on your laptop or something could block out noises I can empathize with you. My boyfriend is the love of my life but for whatever reason he is so loooouuuud with everything he does. If he is tired, he yawns incessantly. And it is not just a yawn. He makes noises with his vocal cords when he yawns and then when he is done he smacks his lips and then chomps his teeth down one of usually more times at the end. I finally just plug my ears really hard every time he starts yawning. Anyway, he is loud with everything he does. I never knew so many sounds could happen from someone doing something. I had a long talk with him yesterday that did not go very well. Wish me luck! I feel you.. and then you live in a constant state of anxiety fearing the next noise. My advice is get some ear plugs. It is the only way I survive being around my family. I can still hear them talk but it really softens the other annoying noises. Just have keep my eyes off them because if I can see someone making a noise then I can hear it \ud83d\ude16 I know lots of kids like this, but why do some adults never grow out of it? \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21", "Ned Flanders misophonia confirmed  Higher quality version of the clip:\n\n(\n\nGIF format:\n\n( Never thought I could deeply relate to Ned Flanders like this Edit: decided to change flair from Memes to Trigger Warning, out of consideration for anyone here who has a nose/breathing/whistling trigger \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "When Family Members Do not Take You Seriously It is so upsetting and disheartening when family members take me and my misophonia as a joke. Most of my triggers come from them, and they are just constant (the only time I can truly escape the noises is by locking myself up in my room. And even then they follow me around the house purposefully making noise to annoy me). Last night my dad kept sucking his teeth (which makes an extremely hurtful high pitched noise) and kept breathing extremely loud (he is always out of breath for some reason and he is SO vocal which means he is always moaning and groaning and grunting and UGH!!!!) so when I asked him to stop he started making the sucking noise louder, and repeatedly. He started pretending to breathe heavily and it nearly caused me to burst into tears. Just this morning my brother started cracking his knuckles (a habit he picked up from kids at school) and every time I ask him to stop he refuses, and proceeds to make every sound possible with his neck or his fingers or his toes and of course my family always jumps to his defense calling me rude, selfish, and dramatic. \n\nDramatic. That is my family\u2019s favorite word to describe me. I have heard it all my life. It is been used against me to invalidate my feelings for as long as I can remember.\n\nI do not understand why it is SO hard for people to respect your boundaries and stop something momentarily until you are out of the room or until they can do it comfortably in private. I do not understand my family\u2019s need to invalidate my feelings, and my misophonia all the time. I do not understand why they continue to do something they know annoys me (in order to annoy me further) instead of respecting my wishes because \u201cwe are just joking around.\u201d I cannot be around my family for more than five minutes because the noises are so constant, and the invalidation is even more constant.\n\nSorry for the long post, this has just been eating me alive for a very long time. My triggers are chewing and a clicking noise my husband makes in the back of his throat. It drives me insane.  I see red and want to punch him in the throat when he does it. He taught my 9 yr old to do it and sometimes they do it together and think it is hilarious. They cannot understand that this is really an issue and my husband thinks I am trying to \"control\" him when I tell him to stop. \n\nI feel your pain. My father does this too... If possible, show them some news/articles about misophonia - maybe it could help them realize that you are not being dramatic. I cannot believe he would think you are trying to control him when you are simply asking him to respect your boundaries.... i am so sorry, and I hope he realizes sooner rather than later just how selfish he is sounding rn... sending you a tight virtual hug x I totally would!! But my parents are not believers in mental health or other conditions even when they are diagnosed by doctors. My doctor told my mom that I needed to go into therapy due to some trauma I had gone through a bit ago and she refuses to do it... it is been six months. If I show them an article on misophonia they would probably make fun of me and say a bunch of insensitive ableist shit (even though I am completely neurotypical). They just do not take anything I say seriously. Thank you so so much for the advice, and I am sorry your dad does the same thing. Hopefully he stops soon, respect is important. I am really sorry you are going through this.  \n\n\nThankfully I only live with one person, but she has her moments lol. It is not only sound with me, it is also some visual things that just drive me insane. I cannot deal with constant movement from my side view and she has a habit of dancing around in her chair while listening to music, and hums or sings softly. I have asked her a bazillion times (she actual just now started humming so here we go again lol!) to please stop. I have explained to her why I feel this way, why this bothers me, etc. I have sent articles about misophonia. She thinks I am being a jerk sometimes. She thinks I shield my eyes with my hand because, and I quote, \"I have issues with fat people.\" No....I would not care who it was, it messes with me and I just cannot. She can also be loud when she laughs and will get mad when I ask if she could please be a little quieter.   \n\n\nThe sad thing about all of it? It is my wife. Sometimes she will take me seriously, but not much. I am so seriously wishing that I could sometimes live by myself.   \n\n\n\\*Big hugs\\* for you. I hope it will get better for you!  I am so sorry that is happening! I really wish people would understand that it is not about them, it is about the sounds/visuals they are producing that causes something within us we cannot control. I hope she becomes a bit more empathetic, I hope she starts taking you more seriously and takes your misophonia into consideration when she starts her habits. I am 1000% sure that if she were in your shoes she would want you to respect her. \n\nSending you big hugs as well, I know she will understand soon! UGH! I am so shocked that your partner has misophonia as well and yet they cannot understand why it is important for them to respect your boundaries and your triggers. They just insist on making it about themselves. \n\nSending you all the positivity and all the light in the world. Things will get better. I know they will.

I just had an appointment with an audiologist, because I was told I have hyperacusis, and he was really helpful with that. But now I am feeling so defeated.\n\nMy problem is that everything seems so loud, I can hear every little electronic device. And I get extreme anxiety and anger from my upstairs neighbors who I can hear every single step they take and they walk on their heels, cannot close a door properly, slam cabinets and drop things a lot. I have tried talking to them but they will not listen and have now started wearing shoes.\n\nBut then I came to my appointment. I was hopeful that I would receive sound therapy as promised, but then he just started talking about tinnitus (which I do not have) and mentioned how I have psychological problems so there is no reason for sound therapy because I do not have hyperacusis, that is just my ADD, and then I could have misophonia instead so I should just expose myself to the noise that triggers me. I do not know what to do anymore. I told him that some sounds will physically hurt, and he just said \u201cno, you are just perceiving it as painful\u201d\u2026 well does not that mean that it IS painful? And then he said that I am just using the word \u201cpain\u201d to get sympathy. I am so angry.\n\nIs there really nothing I can do? And is it \u201cjust\u201d misophonia? I do not even know what to believe anymore. First off, I am really sorry.\n\nCan you see another doctor, or speak to one you already have? I know it is not easy, but there is nothing saying this guy is right, and have every right to seek better treatment.\n\nI have read that misophonia may have some relationship to anxiety, so perhaps you could talk to someone about that, and see about therapy/counseling for it, if needed. That is what we are doing with my daughter (13yo).\n\nMaybe, in the meantime, you could try what she does -- wearing noise-canceling headphones and listening to brown noise. She is triggered by eating sounds, and she wears these at meals and it is all pretty normal. She says brown noise drowns out the sound better than white noise, and if we speak a little louder, we can have a pretty normal conversation.\n\nThere is a rainbow of noise, so maybe something will work for you.\n\nAlso I do not know much, but I do not know that exposure to the trigger sounds will help. You are not afraid of them, you are having a reaction, and while you need to learn to manage your reaction, that does not mean exposure is the way to do it.\n\nGood luck, I hope you find some relief. Thank you so much! I have tried with noise-canceling headphones but I cannot stand keeping the noise loud enough to drown out the stomping. I have been using pink and brown noise, white just hurts my ears. I do not know where to go for treatment, the people at the psychiatric department will send me to the hospital for my ears but the hospital sends me back to them, so I have just been sent back and forth to so many different people that never help me, they just send me on to the next person", "Is this sub dead?  I think it is. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nYou ok? I am good I was just looking around, I would be here more for help, my case is not super bad. lol - looks to be dead.

Hopefully it will revive itself now that a load of people have voiced their discontent about the lack of freedom over at r/misophonia I do not really know what was going on but those moderators are awful! I am coming here not because of any changes made to that sub but rather because of the appalling behaviour of the moderators there Word Yeah, I looked at one of the recent mod posts and was kind of shocked at how the mod did not even seem to consider reasonable suggestions and always gave short, quite rude, replies. I am happy to see that the sub count over here is rising though - hopefully it will soon become the go-to subreddit for misophonia", "my dad has begun purposely eating loudly as my misophonia has been steadily worsening, as well as my general mood, my dad has quickly caught on to how i react when i hear him eat (leave the room, wear earphones if possible, etc).\n\nthese past two weeks, he is developed this awful habit of eating louder just to see me panic. i do not know if he just thinks i am acting out or overreacting cause we do not have a good relationship, but his behaviour is absolutely killing me. Your dad's a cunt. Simple as.  yeah, i know he is doing it intentionally cause he laughs when i react. i showed him the definition of misophonia and he completely disregarded it.\n\ni have my earphones at the ready at all times but since i am not allowed wear them at dinner, i am forced to hear him. Sounds agonising! This is unacceptable!! If he does it on purpose then it is straight up abuse. \nCannot you have some adult professional (school counselor, health practitioner, etc.) give him an earful? \n\nAside from moving out which i l\u2019d guess is not an option now, cannot you discretely have earbuds/plugs/ in-ear headphones? \n\nYou calling him out i would guess is not even an option if he is stupid, it will only make him more vindictive.\n\nHang on there! Wow, your dad's horrible. It is one thing to not understand what misophonia is, but to intentionally trigger someone is misophonia is just awful. This boils my blood to read these. We have all experienced this. Can you imagine going to a loved one suffering from any condition, mocking them mercilessly and deriving amusement from it??? I would not even do that to someone I DONT like and I think most here would agree.\n\nParents who do this to their kids are permanently damaging the relationship. Plain as that. \n\nI have found that being as candid as possible is the most effective means to communicate to people who do this. Hit him with a \u201cWhy do you seem to enjoy my suffering? Is it funny to you? It is really not funny to me and you are deliberately hurting me and laughing about it. I would never do that to you.\u201d Etc etc. \n\nThings will get better when you can move out, but in my experience this is a recurring behavior seen in others. I cut people tf OUT if they do this deliberately. Life\u2019s too short to subject yourself to cruel people. If you could get away with punching him or breaking some of his belongings immediately after he does this, you should. (kidding. But those are things I would want to do ;c )\n\nI would not be nice to him again unless he changes and move out as soon as possible. Do not say I love you, Do not say happy father's day, never buy him a gift and do not put effort into helping him. With anything. Ever. He is a piece of trash until he can grow up and treat you with respect and actual love, you are his child, he should not be gaining PLEASURE from your SUFFERING. When I was 12 years old.  \nMy dad had some friends over. My misophonia had only been going on for a couple years and I did not have a word for it yet.  \nIt was just, to me, the thing where it hurts me when people chew in front of or around me  \nSo my dad had friends over, and he knew of my misophonia,  \nHe turns to his friends with a big grin and says \"Watch this!\"  \nAnd he proceeds to make chewing noises at me, ON PURPOSE.  \nI start to scream and cry and beg him to stop.  \nHe laughs and does it more.  \nI start curings \"FUCK YOU!\" at 12 And he holds me down where I CANNOT MOVE MY BODY, PHYSICALLY ON TOP OF ME AND   \nCHEWS  \nDIRECTLY  \nINTO  \nMY  \nEAR.  \nI SCREAM. I CRY.  \nHE LAUGHS.  \nHARDER.  \nHIS ADULT MALE FRIENDS ALL LAUGH.  \n\n\nIt hurt so badly and I felt so horrible I have no words.  \n\n\nBut even still today, my dad is in my life, and I love him and care for him.  \n\n\nHe has not since done the same thing since I was a kid.  \n\n\nHe has even made efforts since seeing me again (I never really had him in my life but sporadically as a kid anyway)  \n\n\nand since I have seen him again he is remembered my misophonia and has tried to make less noise. He even started giving me warnings. He started to believe me.  \n\n\nStill hurt forever though. :/ I \"grew up\" but his choices to hurt me have still stuck with me today and my misophonia has not gone away and I still have to deal with how he has abused me but I also do not want to lose him.   \n\n\nThis is why it is the worst when your abusers are your parents. They are the ones who ARE NOT supposed to ever do this shit to you.  \n\n\nI wish people who intentionally triggered misophoniacs could experience what it is like to have misophonia for just one day. I hope you have hair long enough to use the solution that is already been proposed: earplugs or buds. If not, can you wear a beanie or scarf? \n\nCan you eat enough to keep you healthy at other times? This is abusive behavior and piss poor parenting on his part. I hope you show him this subreddit and can get help from a teacher or counselor. Such a dick move, your dad sucks. I would start scream-singing at the top of my voice every time he did it. He wants to upset you? Make HIS ears bleed.  When he is in the nursing home and wonders why you never come over.  You should send him this Reddit post.  It is a phrase meaning end of story, or period. This is mental abuse and actual torture. Save every penny, and GTFO. Your dad does not deserve a kid that is kind enough to still talk to him after what he is done. Your dad is a total a-hole.", "Finally told my mum her whistling sends me round the bend While it was not the best way to that the conversation ot did happen and she did try to understand and said she will make the effort not to do it... however she does have early stage dementia so will likely forget we had the conversation on a few days /weeks and go right back to doing it \n\nBut hey... we still had the conversation", "Triggers over the phone? So I just moved out, not even a week ago, and for me this always was a sort of haven for me to look forward to because my heaviest trigger has always been my dad. Do not get me wrong, I love that dude and my home life was amazing, but I was always looking foreward to moving out and escaping the constant triggers. Well, jokes on me, were on the phone as I am typing and I am getting trigger after trigger over the phone and his phone apperantly focuses on everything that triggers me (well douh, that is was makes up a conversation) and I am suffering as if we were having a family dinner. What on earth can I do to make calls more bearable? Cause this are not it!! Does he know about your triggers?  Does he know what misophonia is and that you have it?  I do not presume to know what your relationship with him is like, but usually I have found that if you explain it gently to people who care about you, they will make an attempt to stop the sound.  It may take frequent reminders, but at least they would be cooperating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat kind of sounds does he make that upset you?  Like, is it the sort of noise that seems to us like it should be controllable, or is it something that he truly cannot help?  For instance, if he sniffles a lot you could ask him to blow his nose before he calls you and if he starts again while you are on the phone you could ask him to go blow it again maybe?  If he smacks his tongue around a lot while he talks or clears his throat too much while he talks maybe you could ask him to keep a glass of water on hand when he is on the phone with you so that whenever he starts doing that you can remind him to take a sip and maybe that would help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy point is, as far as I know there is not any sort of levels adjusting we can do to our phones to make it pick up or stop picking up on certain frequencies (it sure would be cool if we could though) ((maybe we can and I just do not know about it)), so communicating with your dad is really your best chance here.  Idk how understanding of a man he is, but hopefully he will get it and make an effort to be better when interacting with you because he cares about your painful experience.  If he is the type that does not get it, I would say set a boundary.  Say \"Dad, if I do not see you at least trying with me, I am not going to be able to keep talking with you, at least not for more than a few minutes at a time.  If you want access to me and to be able to keep up a relationship with me, I really need you to work with me on this\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope any of that is helpful.  Best of luck. Oh wow, this is longer than expected, sorry for the late reply! \n\nOur relationship is actually pretty great so truthfully I do not want to set a boundary like that because I still love the dude. Problem is that I am sort of afraid to talk to him about this stuff because I already have so many times. Over the last few years I tried to explain it again and again (though with decreasing enthusiasm and frequency) to explain my struggles to him, but he sort of does not seem to understand. He is very sorry that i suffer under all this but I believe he just forgets it after a while. I do not show anything when I am triggered, mostly I just sit in silence and get maybe a little grumpy and fidgety so it is hard to notice for other people. So I do not blame him for forgetting and frankly I do not blame him for anything. Not even his reaction to when me or my mom do eventually say something (she is very understanding and very cutely trying to help) and he gets offended or brushes it off. He is been in a really bad mental state for a while now because he is to economically sensible to leave a job that basically killing him (stress, workload, colleges and stuff). This being his fault really get to him and in this case it is not even really his fault. It is mine (or more specifically the misophonia's) and I am asking him to accommodate as pest as he can, which apperantly is not a lot. \n\nWhere was I going with this? Oh, yeah, thank you for your reply even though my phone is powerless in this situation. If this continues I might have to talk to him again, but I will try everything equally. \n\nAlso thank you for listening, that was sort of a rant but I only have my non-misophonia bd to talk to irl and naturally he does not understand as well as he would like to... Glad to hear your family relationships are healthy and that they are at least aware of your situation. \n\nIf you have not already or if you are comfortable doing so, maybe you can talk to your dad about needing the freedom to give him reminders; needing the freedom to call him out on a noise while he is making it. Talk to him about needing the freedom to do that in advance and then maybe he will know from that separate talk that when you are calling him out on making a sound, that you do not mean anything critical or pestering by it. I have had those talks with several ppl in my life, and every now and again I dust it off and have that talk again just so they remember I mean no harm by calling them out on their sounds. One of my best friends, I have to ask her like, every 5 minutes \"can u chew with your mouth closed please?\", and yes, it is still a problem for me that it happens that frequently and yes I am sure she would rather eat without being critiqued, but we love each other and have had the talk about -I will be understanding of her forgetfulness if she will be understanding about my needing to point it out to put a stop to it-. Maybe you and your dad could have a heart to heart like that where you give each other permission to behave those ways? \n\nALSO, you have likely already heard of Loop ear buds. Maybe getting those, or something like them (Amazon has a few other brands with the same concept behind them), and wearing them while on the phone with ur dad could help? Their concept is that they are not noise canceling but noise reducing, so you would still hear ur dads sounds, but perhaps they would come through to u as less intense. DOUBLE ALSO, if you are so fortunate as to have multiple devices in your possession, maybe while you are on the phone with ur dad, you could pull up YouTube on your laptop or something and look up a white noise or a brown noise video and play it in the background while you are on the phone. Those sounds are also supposed to help trick your brain into thinking the sounds coming in are less intense than you would otherwise be experiencing them.\n\nTriple Also, for anyone in your life who does not really understand what you are going through, I have personally found that sharing any variety of media with them as opposed to explaining it myself makes them understand a lot easier. There is cool graphic posters I have shown to ppl, any number of misophonia memes, even buzzfeed videos before. My personal favorite is to tell ppl who have seen A Quiet Place that to experience a misophonia trigger feels like  when the creatures in that movie hear the high frequency emitted from the daughter's hearing aid and bug the hell out. Maybe some stuff like that would help your friends and family understand your position a bit better \n\nSorry I keep writing you these giant responses to read through. I have just, ya know, been there, and want to help, cuz it sucks. You obviously do not have to listen to any of this advice or maybe you have heard it all before or tried it all before. But if not, I hope any of this might make things easier for you. Good luck. No worries about your long responses. Whenever I feel like I can help on here I do the same and, honestly, it makes you feel like somebody actually cares. \n\nWith the conversation tactics I will just have to see what fits but the earbuds sound intriguing. I actually have never heard of look ear buds, or brown noise (only white noise) before... I know that yt videos help me a lot, I always have something running to cover my tinnitus and when I eat with my bf he is the one to remember to put something on. Are those earbuds actually just a loop to out in your ear so you can have the sound coming through? I will google in a minute but that is the only thing I can think of. And also what is the difference between white and brown noise? I feel like we have very different experiences on this subreddit lol Loop earbuds are just the brand name. It goes in your ear like a normal ear plug but instead of a solid piece of something blocking the path to your ear it is circle shaped and it has something to do with the engineering of how and why they are made. \n\nBrown noise is like white noise just a different frequency, I think is how to explain that. There is also pink noise, blue noise... there is a few colors and each one is essentially a different pitch.", "Does anyone ", "Misophonia has stolen so much from me I feel down thinking of how much misophonia has taken away from me. It has taken away my hope for a normal life. At 26 I long for my own family and a partner but then I realize how difficult my misophonia would make those things for not just myself but them too. And it breaks my heart. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live alone and the only time I feel safe is when I am home by myself. At work or with people I am constantly anxious and waiting for the next trigger sound. When I was growing up I stayed in my room all day and avoided my family. I know that if I get married and have a family that same dysfunctional cycle of avoidance will just come back and I will make myself miserable and damage my children and cause my husband to run away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish I could be rid of misophonia. My heart feels so heavy tonight. I want to love and be loved so bad. I am tired of this. It feels like my life has just become a constant battle between making it through work and coming home and recuperating. I have no energy for hobbies or anything. I am wasting my life away. I felt this way before I met my partner. I think it is good for people with Misophonia to have someone in their life that gets it. My partner and I never eat in the same room, and she is okay with it. She makes little sacrifices like that all the time - we both see Misophonia triggers as avoidable things. We have even gotten bamboo dishware to avoid the clinking. \n\nWhat I am trying to say is that it might seem hopeless, but you can still have a great relationship with certain people. Yes, Misophonia might limit the amount of people in your life you could have meaningful relationships with. However, there are a lot of people who can look past it. \n\nI hope you find someone that lights the fire in your heart like I did. At one point I did not believe that people with Misophonia could be loved, but now I know that is not true. Plenty of posts on r/Misophonia and r/Misophoniasupport are not from people with Misophonia themselves, but their partners and roommates. I strongly believe that it is something people can work through as long as both parties are reasonable. \n\nEven if my experiences mean nothing, I truly hope you find happiness with someone or something. Please seek some talking therapies to help you understand the root causes of your triggers. \n\nMy therapy has been really helpful for this. I have a partner and a child. It can work and you will need a toolkit to help you cope with triggering situations.

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/misophoniasupport) if you have any questions or concerns.* Mod! Please show comment! I am glad I am not the only one who experiences this kind of thing - I have gotten so used to hearing the same annoying trigger sounds in the same places that I somehow still get somewhat annoyed when I *do not* hear them. Yeah. Even at my place where I live by myself I STILL have a fan and radio all day like I did as a teen and headphones I guess the reason why I get annoyed/confused when I expect to hear trigger sounds but do not is exactly that. For instance, when I am at school, I expect to hear noises that I hate most in almost every class (such as anything involving gum, or really anything that is louder than it should be (unnecessary loud talking, for example)). When I do not, I just spend a long time wondering when I will have to hear these noises. It is most annoying when it is only on and off (for instance, the person who makes these noises is absent today). However, when the person who makes these noises has moved to another class permanently, it can be quite a relief to know. Fixed it. You should message us instead next time, that is faster. Will do, Colonel. thank you kind soul I am just like you but 14 years before I stay In my room all day but I am a person who before my miso I loved to talk and hang out with others now I stay in my room and every time I have to go out to dinner with my family I always am so angry and after I am always left with this terrible feeling that it will never go away Its going to be okay. Its tough but there will be moments when you can feel good in spite of having this disorder. My advice to you is to never let miso be who you are. Its not and it will never be. \n\nHeadphones and white noise are your friends. So are earplugs. Keep them nearby. Learn deep breathing techniques to help during a episode. It will not stop the feelings but can help you feel like you are more in control.\n\nMy miso was SO severe when I was 13. I would run to my room and cry for hours just from hearing my mom cough. Slowly, it got a bit better. I am 26 now and I do not cry after hearing it anymore. I still get triggered but its managable. You are going through a lot of hormonal changes and that makes it worse but around 15-16 it may start to dwindle down. \n\nI encourage you to write your feelings out and be real. Remember miso is real but other people do not know we have it unless we tell them. Our reactions can confuse others. If your family is understanding I would talk to them about it. The more emotional support you have, the better. \n\nIt will be okay. Thanks a lot that really did give me hope it actually has started to get a little better since my peek and I am still trying to see what fits best in my lifestyle and I have noticed that white noise is SUPER effective thanks for your support and I wish you the best of luck on your misophonia journey! Have a nice day!!!", "I feel like my mom purposely waits until I am in the room to eat. I got home from work (I live next door to them.) and she is cooked dinner, okay cool. I go to my house to take a shower while they are eating. \nShe knows how I am and that I do not normally stay for meals with them. I stay at my house for an entire hour before feeling it is probably safe to make my way back over and hang out. She literally puts more food on her plate when I come in. An HOUR later, \"You are still eating?\" I asked calmly. \"Yeah, I am eating slowly\". \nI talked a little more and left. I cannot stand to be in a room with her when she is eating, she literally makes me feel physically ill, beside the rage. I am just tired of missing out on family time because none of them care- my brother also triggers me, while my dad oddly enough does not-. I cannot help that I am like this and I am tired of feeling like the bad guy when she has the choice to help me and does not want to. \nIt would be different if she was minding her own business but I feel like she purposely chooses times I am there to eat. Or drags it out every time she eats instead of just eating her damn food like a normal person. I have taken her plate to the kitchen before for her and the food on it is ice cold because she takes so long. She cannot possibly be enjoying it at this point. \n\nSorry for the rant. I just do not know what to do anymore, I feel so bad when she goes to the effort to cook and I just do not eat because I cannot stand to be in the room with her. I feel even worse when I make excuses to leave the room just because she is having a snack or something when I walk in. I wish food did not constantly have to be incorporated with family time. My mom mocked me on purpose and I had to leave. In this case I know it was on purpose because I asked her to stop and she would do it even louder on purpose and laughed. I do not know if your mom does it on purpose or just does not know/think about it when you are around. Maybe sit her down again and tell her that you are uncomfortable being around dinner time. Her reaction will tell you a lot. We have had the conversation several times. I actually think the reason my reactions to her are so severe is because of some of the things she did to me as a kid, knowing full well I could not tolerate certain sounds. Sucks when they mock us though :/ Having to eat with people will forever be something I absolutely dread. I used to put on music or something during meals with my family to help drown out the sounds. But yeah I completely feel your pain here, it is so difficult to get through these situations. I do not feel like it is a reasonable request for me to be like \"can you not eat around me\". I also understand that eating together is like a social thing that some people really enjoy, so maybe she waits because she values that kind of interaction. Idk, it sucks I have sympathy for you. My mother triggers me but I know she does not mean to. She does not eat loudly or rudely at all, her manners are impeccable, but there is just something about it, idk man.  I try to stay in the room with her because I don;t want to hurt her feelings.\n\nMy dad on the other hand!!!! As a kid he would yell at me and talk about how gross me and my sister were when we learning to eat neatly (I mean age 4-6, older than that our table manners were fine obviously). He still bizarrely talks about how he would have to leave the room when we were newborn babies because we were \"so disgusting\". But for the last few years, he has all of a sudden started eating with his mouth open, food falling out, he picks the food up with his fingers to put it back in. So gross and SO LOUD. The other day I watched him use his finger to scrape up the crumbs of a burned piece of toast to eat them. Like, ew. I dont feel bad leaving the room obviously and without an excuse when he comes in. I know it is just a matter of time before he starts eating and in my opinion, if you;ve been told not to eat with your mouth open and you still do it, even while talking about how gross you think it is, people do not owe you shit. \n\nSorry for the rant lol. I hope you find some peace. I still live with my family and this is the biggest catalyst for me wanting to move out. Yeah, it could be she just misses the days we could eat together. Do not be sorry for ranting lol, it sucks. At least I can go to my own place, I cannot imagine still living in a house with them", "How to deal with the anger/frustration ?

I know it is hard as _fuck_ to deal with these people. I want you to know that right here and right now, there is light. There is support. \n\nI agree with the suggestion that you should find a trusted adult and tell them. Destroying taking away possessions is often a precursor to physical abuse.

I have misophonia and for the past 10 years my family has been abusing me with it. But it is gotten then so bad that i cannot listen to them walk, or whisper, or even breath. Sometimes I have to camp out on the streets because I cant deal with the noise. They know that I have it but they do not seem to care. But it makes me feel awful everytime i lose my mind because of them, because it is not my fault, but I still do it anyways. I have tried to kill my self severltimes because of them and I have dozens of self harm marks too. Are they abusing me or am I abusing them? Am I the bad person if I cannot control what I do? And for the record, I cannot get professional help. I do not know anyone who recognizes misophonia as a real condition. It appears I have found someone in an even worse situation that I am in. My dad likes abusing me with it and pretending he just does not remember or some other shit, and when I ask people to stop making a noise they go psychotic.\n\nThat said, usually I can just hide in my room, and it is usually just him going it. Additionally I have not spoken to my therapist about it much but I am pretty sure he understands it at least. I also might finally be moving out for good next month. But Ive hidden in my room for so long that it broke me. Id do it for 3 hours a day, everyday, for about two years. And when you are having a panic attack for 3 hours, you cannot entertai yourself with anything because it hurts so bad I remember when I had panic attacks. I do not know how to help you but I wish I could. You are not alone in this nightmare that is living this disorder. I basically never leave my room, so it is not so bad when they do not chase me down to do it.\n\nBeing in this sub is probably a good first step, I am sure there are people here who can help, at least a little. I am so sorry you are not getting the support you need.\n\nPlease call the ( The number is 1-800-273-8255, or you can go to the site and do an online chat. Or try this site, for ( and call them at 1-800-799-7233. \n\nI cannot actually say if they are abusing you. Being negligent or ignorant is not necessarily abuse. I cannot tell from what you have said if they are actively making noises that bother you on purpose, or if you are just really sensitive to the sounds. If they are actively, on purpose, doing things that harm you, that is abuse.\n\nYou are NOT a band person, and you are NOT abusing anyone. You are trying to get help and unfortunately no one is responding. Asking someone to stop a behavior that bothers you is not abuse, it is actually really normal for a lot of people in a lot of situations. And no, you are NOT a bad person because you have these reactions. However, for your own sake, I hope you can find a way to get help so you can manage and cope.\n\nI say this a lot, and I do not know if it will help here, but my daughter has found relief (she is triggered by eating sounds) by wearing noise-canceling headphones and listening to brown noise. Not white, but brown. Maybe something like that could help you.\n\nThe problem with misophonia is that it is not an official diagnosis. I took my daughter to an ENT, and they were sympathetic and gave her an idea of hyperacusis, which is when noise causes physical pain, kind of an extreme version of misophonia. A doctor might be able to do that for you.\n\nI have read that misophonia may be tied to anxiety -- I am not saying you have anxiety issues, but perhaps if you could talk to someone, you could come at it from that angle. You sound young, so I am guessing you are still in school, so maybe you could talk to the school nurse or a counselor. Or if there is another adult -- an aunt or uncle, maybe? -- you could start with them.\n\nGood luck. Off of your last few paragraphs,\nYes, it is definatly anxiety enduced. I am also wondering if I have autism, because I find that I follow many of its symptoms such as misophonia I like this answer, and I agree we cannot know for certain based on what you say if you are suffering from abuse, but for certain you are doing nothing wrong. I will say that most people do not understand the level of pain we experience with misophonia, and also dont respond well to being told to stop normal behaviours that happen to trigger us. My family is very loving and supportive, but it took them many years to get a proper (at least practical) understanding of the level and severity of pain I experienced. People really truly just do not understand it. That is not to say some people will not also go the extra cruel mile of using your triggers to abuse you, but in my experience, ignoring your requests/forgetting your triggers (they really do forget...)/getting angry at being told to stop is very typical in even the best circumstances. \n\nIt took me a LONG time to learn, and fully accept, that it is not the responsibility of the people around me to stop acting normally to accommodate my misophonia. That acceptance actually helped reduce my anxiety around the symptoms, and made the pain less harsh. Anxiety absolutely makes it worse. And there is a level of indignation that comes from misophonia that makes it seem like it would be so easy for people to accommodate you, and it would reduce your suffering so substantially, that it is hard to understand why they cannot just do this one little thing to help you stop suffering. Thing is, clinging to this thought just makes the pain worse when you are triggered, because you feel like you should not be suffering like this, and you are being assaulted for no good reason. It is not fair and it is not your fault of course, we randomly have brains that make normal sounds hurt, but that is not the fault of anyone around you either, even if it feels like it (with exceptions, of course). All you really can control is your own coping techniques. Noise cancelling headphones or ear plugs, white or brown noise, leaving the room when you need to, mimicking noises when you can, are all things you can control yourself without others permission, and will help you feel less helpless. \n\nAnyway, as I type this out, I feel like I sound cold and not understanding, but know this comes from someone with misophonia that understands the pain, not some outside preachy type. I genuinely hope you get some support and understanding. I am so sorry you are self harming. You do not deserve that. Please do what you need to to help yourself feel better while staying safe, even if it is just posting to Reddit for now. And I genuinely hope your family is not abusing you, and eventually understands what you go through.\n\nEdit: just to clarify, the point about acceptance probably will not help you feel better right away, but I know it did not even occur to me as being a sympathetic position to take until my therapist put it in a similar way I think misophonia gives us the tendency to assume that every triggering noise someone makes was on purpose, just to hurt us. Perhaps it is because we do not notice ourselves doing the same things in our daily lives, or because we stopped doing them completely for that reason. Sometimes the suspicion is justified, too. While my misophonia was still fresh, I sometimes noticed my dad \"testing\" me, as in making a noise and then looking at me to see my reaction. It was infuriating to no end. My parents did not accept my misophonia either, telling me to stop covering my ears/hurting myself etc., but now, years later, I can tell you that they have learned to be accepting.\nIt is difficult for someone who does not have it to understand what is going on in our brains. Disliking certain sounds is pretty common, so they mistake it for a regular pet peeve and get annoyed when someone is so \"sensitive\". Have you tried showing scientific articles about misophonia to your family? Have they done some research? It takes time, but I think they will manage to accept it once they realize it is not going to just \"go away\". \nIn general, I would advise you to get good headphones and earplugs. Also get yourself a stressball so you can play around with that instead of self-harming.\nIt gets better, I promise. :) This sounds like abuse, do not listen to anyone doubting that. If you had any other more common or recognized condition and your family was treating you so badly you had to sleep in the streets, no one would think twice about calling it abuse. You are not a bad person, you just have a neurological condition that caused you to react to sounds differently than most people. It is totally possible to have misophonia and to live a fulfilling life where it is manageable.\n\nIs there anyone outside your family you can talk to? Someone like a teacher or a doctor? Info: what are they doing on purpose exactly?", "Well this is certainly interesting.

Because of our current living situation, we have to share the same sofa when we eat dinner and I am going insane hearing the noises that come out of his mouth every single evening. It makes me so angry and I cannot help but think how are you so loud? Why can other people eat quietly and yet you cannot? He eats so fast too, so hurriedly it just makes me so angry like just relax and eat nicely and stop chomping the way you do!!! I never say anything and my thoughts make me feel awful but I just cannot help feeling this way. It is got to the point where I just never look forward to eating because I cannot stand the sound of other people eating around me. I mean he can literally be on the other side of the room and I can still hear the noises he makes!!! Will it ever stop? I feel you and I am so sorry. I live in a small one bedroom with my boyfriend and I have the same issue. I came across ( and honestly they are amazing at drowning out the chewing but I can still have a conversation and watch the tv. Good luck to you. &lt;3 Thank you so much. I am so happy I found this community because for years I just felt like a horrible person for feeling this way. It is just nice to know there are people on the same page. Thanks for the recommendation of the ear muffs - I will check them out! Best of luck to you too \u2764\ufe0f For me it helps if i am eating at the same time as the other person. Drowns out the sounds of the others eating i suppose I completely understand! I always feel like the worst person when I give him (bf) dirty looks for doing simple human things. And having a community of people that understand how we feel, that our triggers are separate from the people we love. Lmk how it goes with those! Exposing yourself to it more will most likely just make your hatred of eating sounds even worse. I would suggest you block sounds by for example earbuds and turning on some music, so you do not hear him while he is eating. \n\nIn order to not make your boyfriend offended by you blocking the sounds in some way, you will need to talk to him about it. Do not form sentences in a way that would be targeted at him, rather talk about the sounds themselves. Mention that it is not against hin, but the sound and it does not matter who would produce the sound, you would get mad anyway. \n\nSince you are a couple, you both need to input effort. It is just normal and logical that you both deal with problems, especially when you are capable of dealing with it. Your job would be to block the sounds the best you can. His job would be to not produce sounds while you cannot be blocking them, or when you are supposed to listen to him while he is talking to you. If is not a problem when you are alone, therefore if you want yourselves both to be happy, then it requires both of you to do something about it. \n\nHowever if you were complaining because he is refusing to do anything for your both well-being, then I would seriously consider leaving him. It is not your fault you are suffering this condition, but if you are trying your hardest to actually do something about it and he is not, than it is his fault. He as your boyfriend is morally obligated to not cause you unnecessary suffering and if he is unable to suffice his obligation, then he is not truly your boyfriend. \n\nI hope he will understand. I totally feel you on finally finding this community and a reason for why your experiencing these things and that it is not just you being \"a horrible person\". I always felt like such a overly sensitive bitch, but I was sooo grateful when I found out that this is an actual thing and there is a reason why I feel the way I do. Wish you well, hope you can find something to help you cope. Yes! I am so grateful to have found this forum, everyone is so understanding here too which makes such a nice change. I wish you well too and hope you too find a way to cope &lt;3", "Review: The Sony WH-1000XM4 are actually shitty headphones. They are massively overhyped on here. \n\nThey were nice when I first got them. The problem is they got WAYYY looser over time, after just over 2 months of daily use. And loose fitting headphones = poor seal = shitty noise cancellation. They already let my trigger sounds through when they were new, but they at least blocked them down to a barely audible level. They do not do that anymore, making them practically worthless unless I am playing music through them.\n\nAlso, loose headphones fall off way too easily. I pretty much cannot wear them unless my head is practically still which means I can pretty much only wear them at my computer desk. Anything that requires the slightest head movement causes them to slide right off, even with the tightest band setting, which means they are pretty useless for literally everything else. Brushing my teeth? Washing my hands? Eating? Making food? Useless for all of them.. I would argue that all over-ear headphones are shitty for noise-isolation. For that reason, the WF-1000XM3's (in-ear) are serving me very well. I even use them during exercise. I have heard the opposite, that earbuds have worse noise cancellation than headphones, but what you say makes sense. Maybe headphones are better in idealized conditions but earbuds are better in the real world? Tbh I have completely given up on over the ear headphones. Too clunky and ill-fitting. Yeah earbuds are just better for noise isolation. Active noise cancellation and noise isolation (sometimes called passive noise cancellation) are different things - people sometimes confuse them. Noise isolation is how tight the seal is in your ear - the tighter the seal, the less noise comes through. Some noise still comes through, which is where the active noise cancellation comes in. With over-ear, you have substandard noise isolation with basically the same active noise cancelling (when comparing the WH and WF series). Active noise cancelling is pretty good in the WF-1000XM3's, they are pretty much the same as my over-ear Bose QC II's. \n\nWhen I have tunes playing and active noise cancellation on high, I cannot really hear much. They give you 2 sets (3 sizes in each set) of ear bud types to try. The 2 sets are made out of different materials, one more firm and the other squishier. I use the firm set, which gets a very good seal. The firm set appears to be made out of a high density foam. As a downside, after wearing the dense set for an hour or two your ears get a little worked out. If I am being honest, I do not even care that they hurt a little as long as they work. I am sure the softer ones do not hurt after long use, but they might not have the best seal. \n\nFor reference, I wear them so that I can eat in the same room as my partner. We do not talk, but at least we can spend some time together during dinner and pretend we are a bit normal. It is a compromise, but it works. I have yet to try them in an actual restaurant or public space due to COVID. I plan to post about it when I do. Thank you for the review! Ah ok, unfortunately I am pretty sure I could only use the soft ones. I cannot even sleep with earplugs cause they make my ears hurt like hell. And I need something that I can pretty much wear all day, ideally 24/7 including sleeping, or else they are no good for allowing me to escape my misophonia. Even a few minutes with headphones off can be hell. An hour or two of wear is a complete joke. I guess that is one of the advantages of headphones over earbuds, they are much more comfortable for super long wear times. \n\nAlso, every single pair of earbuds I have tried falls out of my ear canal SUPER easily. I guess my ear canals and body in general just does not match the typical design model that earbuds and headphones are designed for.. ALL earbuds I have tried have actually been more worthless than my WH-1000XM4 due to falling out so easily. Idk if the WF-1000XM3s are better, and unless they have some special design to help keep them in the ears, I do not expect them to be. And I am SUPER envious of your situation, only needing relief while eating. In my incredibly shitty living situation I need it 24/7. Ok, maybe not between about 1am and 6am, but given I need at least 8 hours of sleep that means I basically need 24/7 protection. Haaa, well I can say it was not always like this. My Misophonia is like a 8/10 on my made up Misophonia scale - let us say it is pretty bad. Sometimes I still need it for the neighbors. \n\nI can empathize. Living with my parents was absolute hell (stomping, music, eating, you name it). Working in an open office where people eat at their desks was hell. I wanted to die because home was hell and work was hell. There was no escaping it. Now I live with my partner and work from home. Not a day goes by that I do not appreciate where I am now. \n\nI suppose going through stuff like that has made me somewhat of a headphone connoisseur though ;) Jokes aside, I really do empathize, and I hope you get through it. Good luck. I do not bother with any kind of expensive earphones or headphones. I can get a pair of Sony earphones for \u00a315 with a 3.5mm jack, and when they are in my ears and playing audio, I cannot hear a single thing outside of them. welp guess i spent $800 dollers on nothin then I would agree, i brought them for the noise cancellation too, but the fit is horrible, they are heavy and uncomfortable, they do block a fair bit of noise but far from what a cheap pair of headphones would, and definitely do not wear them in the wind! \nI found my old Blueant earbuds with no noise cancellation much better than these at a third of the cost. Have to say i was really disappointed with them. I have tried that but cheap earbuds fall out of my ears, cheap headphones do not block my triggers even with music playing, and being tethered cause of a 3.5mm jack sucks. $800? Mine were under $300. \n\nThough I have been considering getting an aviation headset in the $1000 price range with noise cancellation cause those seem to seal better than ordinary headphones. That sucks. actually i should of explained i got 2 within a few years so that is 400+400 The Sony are shitty headphones.. I bought the wh1000xm4, never had those before on earlier version.\n\nWow they block Nothing.. I can hear the bus.. The people talking.. Etc.. Shit shit shit.. And now u tell me the fitting gets loose with time?\n\nDo not buy Sony wh-1000xm4, just a scam by sony", "Do i really have misophonia or am i faking it for attention? i have been sensitive to loud noises since early childhood but in high school i started having physical reactions to some noises. at first i just thought \"i do not like this sound\" and flinched. i started noticing more and more sounds i did not like and reacted every time. i suppose i thought this would alert the creator of said sounds and stop the noises. the teachers started asking what was wrong and i did not like that sort of attention (even tho that is what i wanted) so i usually did not say what it was. or if i did, then i said it was not a big deal.\n\ni got put together with other kids with learning difficulties into one \"special needs\" class so every one of my classmates and teachers constantly make noises that trigger me. like cracking bones, drawing, lip smacking, whispering, breathing next to me like a goddamn vacuum cleaner, throwing a desk across the room and then walking to the door like an elephant to go to the bathroom in the middle of every class. not to mention that the windows are right in front of me and the light comes straight into my eyes. i live in sensory hell.\n\nat first i thought i could control my reactions and that flinching is my conscious decision so i decided to stop. unfortunately it was too late and i could not control my body anymore. it is gotten worse every week since then.\n\ni cannot sit with my family to eat without the radio on. at least my mom is respectful to me and has agreed to eat separately which makes me sad because i know she loves spending time with me but she is so triggering all the time, even when she is not eating. my dad however, smacks his lips on purpose and then gets mad when i flinch or try to distance myself.\n\ni try to not tell people when i am uncomfortable (but still am very visibly uncomfortable) because it is not that bad, i can suffer in silence for others convince, not a big deal. but they still ask, i suppose becouse they feel sorry for me. sometimes i do not explain, sometimes i have to, and if i do, they either ignore it completely and continue their activities as usual or try to trigger me even more.\n\ni went and talked to a therapist about it and her advise was to just \"get used to it, you cant escape and you cant tell every single person not to make any noise around you\". so i tried \"getting used to it\" like i had been before that and that resulted it pain and even worse reactions. \n\nnow im in 12th grade and usually by lunch im very stressed and angry. i feel like everyone in my class hates me for flinching and moving around all the time. \n\nhaving moved out has definitely helped becouse now at least at home i have control over most sounds exept the construction work going on across the street. but being constantly stressed and not being able to socialize without some annoying noise that humans make going on.\n\nso in conclusion my symptoms are not as bad as most people have described on this sub and might not even be real. do i have misophonia? am i still faking it? is it something else? if someone with real misophonia could tell me what is going on, that would be great.\n\n\n\ntl;dr:  i developed unpleasant physical reactions to certain sounds out of nowhere and now i do not know if it is misophonia or not. This certainly sounds like misophonia. Unfortunately, it is not an official diagnosis.\n\nHowever, I disagree with the therapist you saw. I am not a doctor, but there are some ways to work on managing your reactions and coping with sounds. (\n\nAnother reason I disagree is that my daughter (13yo) has developed this, and we found a therapist who is in fact working with her on it. The therapist is using a cognitive behavioral therapy approach.\n\nOne thing to consider is that misophonia seems to be tied to anxiety and stress. I do not know if you have anxiety issues, or a condition like ADHD, or something else, but if you do, you might want to see someone about that, and that may then help with the misophonia. If you can, try to find another therapist. You may need to try more than once, which I know is hard, but I hope you do.\n\nOther posters on this subreddit have said that things like meditation have helped them. I think that might be a good thing to try; it is free for one, and does not involve taking medication for another.\n\nMy daughter is triggered by eating sounds. I do not know if this would help you, but when we have meals, she listens to brown noise over her headphones. There is a rainbow of noises, and you may find one that helps you more than the usual white noise. She says the brown noise drowns out the sounds, and then we can also have a conversation with her, we just need to speak up a bit.\n\nGood luck. thank you for responding!\n\nunfortunately i cannot seek another therapist for financial reasons and I am probably going to the same one again and try to explain my condition better. i only go to her becouse she is my mom's friend and also suffers from similar sound related discomfort.\n\ni think i had anxiety at some point but now it seems to be gone or i just do not notice it anymore. i do seem to have some symptoms of ADHD but i do not think i have it, as i can pay attention just fine and i can hold my thoughts.\n\ni used to do meditation and yoga with my mom and all the breathing sounds, bone cracking and my mom repeating instructions in such a quiet voice i could only hear her mouth moving made me so angry and upset i started to hate those things (at the time i did not know why) \n\ni also cannot use headphones at the table with my family as the would see it as rude. even tho we usually do not talk while eating. also would not that make my own chewing and breathing louder in my head? I have tried brown, red and white noise which give me a little anxiety when i listen to them.\n\ni suppose i could try the noises for a longer time and see if it works but i suspect my brain is just going to decide it does not like smooth noise like that either. then I will just go back to my good old friend, lo-fi hip hop.\n\nAgain, thank you!  Ah the good ol am I faking it, I have dealt with that feeling many times. Here is a tip, if you are worrying that you are faking it, you are probably not faking it. Also just because you do not have it as bad as other people, it does not mean you do not problems as well", "dad\u2019s house im staying at my dads house for the night (my parents divorced only a few months ago). when he was at home, he was a source for a lot of my triggers. it is been easier to manage now that i see him in smaller time frames. i was actually excited to come here to get away from my mom and messy room (i like my room here a lot). when i got here, my mood changed in a matter of seconds. i was immediately triggered by his constant tics of sniffing and arm-scratching. his dog always whines and makes really annoying noises when she constantly licks herself. he lives in an apartment, and the combination of him, the dog, and outside noise was just too much. i am in my room now, which is kind of far from where him and my brother are. i feel bad leaving my brother alone with him after being so enthusiastic about coming here when he really was not. i do not want to go home but i do not want to be here. fuck misophonia Cool story bro i completely understand. my dad is a huge source of most of my triggers, and i understand how frustrating it can be, especially when they do not understand. my dad also lives in an apartment, so as you know it can be very hard to get away from the source. what i find helps is blasting music that helps loosen my anxiety, or wrapping a dark blanket all around me covering my eyes, ears, and nose. i hope it gets better.", "Triggers and living with a roommate I just need some help because I am in college and have a roommate again and it is becoming very difficult for me to live with her. Two years ago I had a roommate who snores and slurped when eating. Then I lived alone and it was amazing. Now I have a roommate again. She has dry skin and scratches. This has always been a trigger for me. I even ask my mom to not do it. My roommate especially scratches her dry skin at night in her sleep and it will wake me up. My ears begin to hurt after a while. I get intense anxiety. I usually end up crying because I often cry when mad or anxious. I know for the most part she cannot help it but I do not know how much longer I can handle it. Is there no rooms on the house where you can go just to be alone?? I know a lot of people might have have suggested this to you, but have you tried a white noise machine? They block out sounds like scratching dry skin very easily, my favorite is the \"LectroFan\". It is a little pricey for a white noise machine, but it works extremely well What is the living situation? Are sharing a dorm room with her? Or is this some kind of apartment? Is she your only roommate? For example, if there is another roommate(s), could you switch the room pairings? \n\nThe other thing I would suggest is sleepphones. These are head bands with flat speakers in them, made for sleeping. I do not have misophonia (my daughter does) but I use them and they are pretty comfortable. They are not noise canceling, but you might be able to listen to white noise, or another color noise, or music or even a podcast to drown out/cover the noise your roommate makes. If you do not like that, maybe a white noise generator?\n\n( It is an apartment style dorm in which we share a room. I could go into the living room but this mostly happens at night when I need to sleep. I am trying to incorporate meditation when I am unable to leave the space but it is harder than it seems. Yes, it is an apartment style dorm so I share a room with her but we do have a living room and kitchen. It is on my colleges campus so getting reassigned or even moved would involve filing a complaint and getting permission from our housing department. Thank you for the link! I will check it out! No, I have not. I usually fall asleep best to little to no noise but we currently have a fan in our room that does not bother me so maybe I will check out  a white noise machine or even buy some headphones and listen to white noise.

Anyway, Here you go: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI HATE loud chewers with a passion, they make my skin crawl, my muscles clench, and my bones crumble. This is especially bad when they are eating something sticky and it sticks to the top of their mouths and they try to swallow it, after which you get this meaty sound.\n\nBut there is something far worse lurking out there in these lands. Because I know a few people who are **loud drinkers**.\n\nOne of these people is a close friend of mine. I went to visit him the other day to play some games, eat dinner and have a few drinks.\n\nNow, this guy is already quite a loud chewer. He can eat cotton candy and make it sound like he is eating an apple made of steel. He does this weird sucking thing when eating something, so it always sound like he is slurping whilst also smacking and chewing at the same time. His chewing can make Lovecraftian Deity's flinch.\n\nI am not really used to it, but I am coming close to ignoring his ~~eating~~ slimy devouring sounds. I was actually kind off looking forward to meeting him again, but unfortunately, hell was about to break loose.\n\nWhen visiting him, he started making a cup of coffee. This would become the cup of coffee that would result in the longest 15 minutes of my life.\n\nWe were playing some video games. The coffee maker stopped making a sound so it must have been ready. I did not think anything of it yet, I was a bit immersed in the game.\n\nHe came back and put the cup down, the coffee was really, really thick. I do not know what kind of coffee that was but it had the thickness of some potato soup. He had some coffee milk that he put in, the coffee milk was very chunky somehow. I do not know how often he makes coffee but that looked like the most disgusting milk I have ever seen.\n\nHe picked up the cup and put it against his mouth. He started sniffing the brown cup of chunky mud, he had the sniffles so you could hear the loud piggy snores.\n\nHe took the first sip of coffee.\n\nIt is so difficult to describe this first sip. He sucked the coffee into his mouth, still extremely hot, he kept it in for way too long, you could hear it splashing around in his mouth, like a tsunami hitting the ground.\n\nHe is smacking the hot coffee with all his strength. The chunky bits must taste very good because he was chewing them oh so loudly. I do not know how, but he made sure the chunky bits made a crunch when he bit down on them as if he was chewing gravel.\n\nThe sip went down to his throat, and the swallow was like the roar of a thousand Spartans in battle.\n\nAAAAaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmm \\*\\***smack... smack.. smack.**\\*\\* *Sniffle sniffle sniffle*\n\nAll this in 15 seconds.\n\nI became light-headed and I had to stop this.\n\nHe was already starting his new sip which was almost a gulp. He did almost the exact same thing but louder. A few seconds into this gulp he grabbed one of those raisin cookie bars. He took a bite out of the bar with the coffee still in his mouth. The sight of the coffee coming out of his mouth and dripping on the raisin bar will haunt me well beyond the grave.\n\nLike Noah's ark in the storm, the cookie was floating around in his mouth. \\*Bite\\* \\*Smack\\* \\*Crunch\\* \\*Gluck\\* \\*Gluck\\* \\*Gluck\\*.\n\nIt did not even take me a minute to attempt to find a way out of this, I already went to the bathroom a few minutes ago to take a crap so going again would be suspicious, I did not want to make the situation awkward so I did what I do best. Make a distraction.\n\nWhile he was eating his damn bar and drinking his clunky wasteland excuse for coffee. I plugged in my speakers. I wanted to play some sound as a distraction, and I happened to select the worst one possible.\n\nScatman John's famous hit \"I am a Scatman\".\n\nSo anyway, I started blasting the music. And it helped for about a few seconds until he made another big \\****GULP***\\* that seemed to go over the sound of the music.\n\nHe started singing along.......\n\nWhat was supposed to be:  \nSki-bi dibby dib yo da dub dub Yo da dub dub\n\nCame out like:\n\nSkti-bihhh dibbed-yhhh dib \\*smack\\* yo da \\*heavy breathing\\* dububtthhhmmmm Yo da dubh dubh \\*smack\\* \\*heavy breathing in\\*\n\nI never clicked away from a video so fast in my life, the Greek god Mercury would be impressed with how fast I moved.\n\nI endured 13 minutes more of this, I was constantly looking at his cup and hoping it would be over, only to be disappointed by the clunky white marshmallow like chunks of milk that was still left in his cup.\n\nThose 13 minutes did not just feel like hell they were hell. Time was not fleeting but madness did take its toll. I kept looking at him with eyes of madness. Drinking this loudly should be ~~considered~~ a war crime.\n\nHe asked me what was wrong, I said \"nothing\" and started pretending to play a video game, hypnotized by the sounds of battleships in his mouth.\n\nWhen he finally finished it felt like I had escaped Alcatraz. I was finally free!\n\nI went back to playing video games still mentally scarred by the experience. I think I will forever have nightmares about the experience, and I do not think I can ever drink coffee again. And if I ever come close to experiencing this again, so help me god.\n\nSeriously, loud drinkers are worse than chewers.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Personally, I think loud chewers are worse. But loud drinkers are the bane of my existence. There is one specific sucking/slurping sound that they make that I do not know how to describe. It is just repugnant. It makes my skin crawl. Sometimes I cry when I hear it. And then it is always the same \u201coH fUcK oFf YoU cAn CoPe\u201d argument. He asked you what is wrong and you said nothing? On a situation like that o would have just been like \u201cdude you are making so many gross noises right now\u201d. I hate both groups with equal fiery passion of a thousand suns. I can 100% relate to every single word of your post. \n\nLately my condition has gotten worse. Seriously thinking about therepy.", "Idling in Noisy Cars I feel like this is the only place where I will possibly be understood. \n\nMy triggers always develop after some excessive situation. In this case, idling cars became an issue after my neighbor's son brought a sketchy guy around to stay and he sat in his LOUD running car twice a day for two hours at a time to get high...and did this for 7 months. The idling rumbled my whole house, and his second episode of the day was always around the time I go to bed. I had to stop sleeping in my own room because it was louder there. He has not been around in about a year now, but ANY idling just makes me crazy now, and people really, really seem to do this a LOT. Even when I go for a walk, there are people just randomly sitting in their driveways or on the street in their running cars, none of which seem to ever be quiet.\n\nIs anyone else driven absolutely bonkers by this? Yes! I live on a corner and the neighbors on the corner next to mine had like 6 cars, the guy claimed to be a mechanic so there was a lot of idling. The other thing they did at all hours and I mean all hours because they were meth heads, was replace rims which entailed pounding away on tires. you would think that would not be loud but it is. Also how about the people who idle their cars while listening to loud music, THE WORST. FYI those neighbors moved a year ago and the people who moved in do not own a car at all, they ride bicycles. YES! I never understood why people sat in their cars in their own driveway blaring loud music or making other ungodly noise. You are not alone friend. Yes! Apartments are especially bad for this, especially in the winter. I cannot wait to own a house. I never thought about that. I always had apartments on the opposite side of the parking lot (random), and it was prior to idling becoming a trigger, too. I live in a house currently, and the idler who turned this into a trigger was literally so close to my house that he might as well have been in my driveway. Advice: visit any potential new home multiple times, including weekdays, weekends, and late evening to listen to what is going on. Bad neighbors can turn any living situation into a nightmare. Drives us crazy too.  Especially diesels! I walked to the Publix while my husband was having an outpatient procedure done and counted 9 idling vehicles, mostly pickups. The distance was .1 miles, about a 3 min walk. And it was a beautiful cool day where a/c was not even needed. Irritates the fuck out of me.", "The squirrels in my yard are noisy as hell, all day, for the entire summer. My house is not soundproof at all, and there is a certain noise they make constantly that is triggering me. How can I cope? So my misphonja mainly consists of animal noises. Which is not very common with this disorder, as most people report chewing noises and such. Which I find annoying as well, but not nearly as much as certain other noises. \n\nDogs barking, babies crying, certain bird chirping, etc. All set me off into panic mode and distress. \n\nMy house is mainly quiet, except there is these 2 feisty, noisy squirrels that seem to occupy the entire damn yard. They go from tree to tree and are VERY noisy. My house is not that soundproof, so I have to listen to them more or less all day long. \n\nMy mom keeps putting sunflower seeds out trying to feed the birds, but this just attracts animals that make a lot of noise (loud chirping from the birds, but mainly squirrels that take over and claim the entire back deck as their territory and noisily defend whoever invades). \n\nI moved all of the bird feeders far away from the house because the noise is bothering me greatly. My mom was slightly ticked about this, but I gave up on trying to explain my hearing sensitivity since this has been going on for years. \n\nAnyways, moving the feeders did nothing, because the squirrels just come back onto the deck and continue with their loud noise. They are not scared of humans either, since when I was moving the feeders they were making noise at me and staring at me the whole time. \n\nGodamn I hate my hearing, I wish I could just go deaf and be done with it. I am in a constant state of anxiety and I hate having to wear stupid headphones with music blasting. Why cannot I just live a normal life and not be bothered by stupid things. pellet gun? I would if my pellet gun actually worked, and if I actually had decent aim. if you cant get a new one, a slingshot and a bag of pea gravel should be enough to practice True. But. More squirrels will come back regardless. I think I just need to convince my mom to stop leaving food out for them. She tries so hard to feed the birds, but it is pointless anyways if the squirrels hog it all and attack the birds whenever they try to come. The reason the squirrels stick around is likely because there is so much bird seed everywhere from my mom feeding them over the years My understanding is that squirrels do not like cayenne pepper, and that birds cannot taste it. So maybe lace your yard (or at least bird feeders) with cayenne. I think I have heard of this also. Could try it out. Thanks Otherwise can you get a noisy fan in a main room? (Or every room?) To drown out the sounds?", "going to a dinner with misophonia hello. i have a mild case of misophonia that is triggered mostly by sounds of people eating, effects including feelings of disgust, anxiety and anger, sometimes worse. everyone close to me knows about it. \n\nrecently we are going to a little trip with my family.\n(we do not have much corona here, and we will strictly follow the guidelines in our country)\nthe trip includes going to a restaurant, and i am wondering what i could do in this situation. should i just not go and ask them to pick up mcdonald's for me? i am afraid i cannot have headphones in the restaurant, nor sit in another table.\n\nif someone can help me with some suggestion as what to do, i would really appreciate it &lt;3 I have found that I am not nearly as triggered in a settiing like a restaurant, where there are lots of other noises (music, people talking, etc) If that is not the case for you, and you said your family is understanding, then maybe it would be ok for you to not go. Better than being miserable for 2+ hours. May i ask why you cannot have headphones on?\nI would never leave for a family lunch/dinner without my ear buds. It just does not happen. I do not blast the music or anything i just need a light distraction so i can function. Even loud music &amp; people\u2019s noise in restaurants do not cover up any of my parents wild eating sounds.\nSadly I have been refusing to travel with my parents or go out for a bite for the last 2 years. It is just easier this way. But I hope you do not have to do this though ! If your family understands about your misophonia, then I do not think there would be anything wrong with wearing your headphones at the restaurant. I have gone out many times wearing my headphones at restaurants. i do not have earbuds because i cannot get them to stay in my ears for even 10 seconds and wearing them for long kind of hurts. so my headphones are ones like this \ud83c\udfa7 and i think having them in the restaurant would be a bit inappropiate in a public place like that and weird looking to other people and i do not want to have people looking at me like \"oh why does she have headphones\"\nthank you for offering help! i have never been to a restaurant with misophonia, which was just discovered this year, but i do not want to risk it. usually in my case i need the sounds to be covered up completely. if i hear them even lightly it is going to affect me and i do not really want to blast the music so it hurts my ears. i will ask mom later today if i can not go. thanks for the help! Who cares what others think? As long as your parents are aware of your situation then just go for it! I mean i wear a head-cover so no one can see what is in my ears (as long as it is not headphones), &amp; i just tell my parents to pardon me if I do not respond as I am wearing ones just to keep them company..\nChin up! they do, except for my sister who mostly makes fun of it and says i am just seeking attention with it.. but it is not them, i just feel like having headphones in the restaurant would be inappropiate and weird to other people. thanks for helping! i care really much, and am afraid of causing confusion and weird stares. i am also afraid that my sister will just make fun of me and ruin the whole thing for me Man i feel you. I have been ridiculed by my siblings for 5 years for wearing earbuds all the time. It is really hard without our loved ones\u2019 support. Although I have always been clear about my misophonia since i was 8, I sat my parents 2 months ago (now 28) &amp; let them know i can no longer take this on alone. That i value them the most in this world &amp; love their company, but if they do not understand me then I cannot really be as loving &amp; affectionate. \nHope you get the support you deserve! oh, that is really unfortunate.. it really is hard when nobody takes it seriously. but thank you for all the replies and help, hopefully i can get the situation settled :)  Good luck!!", "Worthless When I know that the sound of my breathing annoys my partner, it makes me feel worthless. I do not know what to do with that information. not to sound harsh, but please do not make a mentally ill person\u2019s struggle about you. misophonic people often struggle with intense feelings of brokenness because we cannot handle being around people, even our own loved ones, who are doing regular human things like eating or breathing. your support and understanding is super important for your partner because most people do not give a shit\n\nI totally understand where you are coming from, but remember that misophonia is not a choice and the way it manifests does not reflect on your relationship with the misphonic person. I understand, and that is exactly why I am scared to tell my bf when noises he makes trigger my misphonia. I love him, and I do not want him to feel that way just because something he cannot help is sending me mad. It really is not personal at all, I hate chewing sounds but I do not hate the person making the sounds. I know they are not doing it specifically to torture me. Please just keep in mind that your partner loves you and that it does not matter who the breathing is coming from in regards to setting off their misophonia. You are allowed to breathe, you have to. But OP did not choose it either, and probably feels this bad precisely BECAUSE he/she is supportive and empathetic with their partner. Your reply comes across really shitty to me.", "My trigger is my sister's loud loud voice, I want to kill her It is like my ear is going to bleed. She has a high pitched voice and when i KINDLY tell her to fucking stop yelling (ofc I dont say that) my parents yell at me for being paranoic. She also screams so fucking loud while fighting my brother-and dont even ask the crying. Even her movements started bugging me. Literally. Whenever i am trying to focus she goes \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc49\u261d\ud83d\udc47 I want to kill her.

You know. \"Sin\"\n\nAgain, thank you so, so, much! This comment helped me a lot. there is online chat support, that way they will not hear you ! :) it exists for such situations and if people are too afraid or anxious to call people. online one-to-one chats with thesame counselor are available with headspace (my service) as far as i am concerned you should be able to access it even if you are not from australia. also no prob bob \u2661 Dude,  that sucks. I had some success using ( They are $25 here, but I feel like they are well worth the price. They make it so that you can still hear fairly well, but louder noises (and I want to say higher pitches as well) are much reduced.

So tonight I met a South African man who is lived in the US for 19 years and I am the first person who correctly guessed his nationality on the first try. He could not believe it, and asked me how I knew, but to me it was, well, obvious.  \n\nDo not forget that we can hear all things extremely clearly, and other people cannot. Yes, that is mostly annoying and a major challenge, but it is wise to be grateful for the silver linings. Devastatingly beautiful songbirds. The sound of a gentle creek. The small differences in how we speak. We can hear that plain as day. Not everyone can, and it is one of our few blessings. So, today I choose to love that. The end. Woah, that is so cool! Wait you guys have super hearing? Thank you for this!! I needed to hear it! crazy sensitive hearing! it is like a superpower that is mostly just annoying lol Very interesting! I have had a couple hearing tests, all completely at normal level. I also have a weird... quirk where I cannot hear accents. I can hear very strong ones, but I really cannot hear when someone has an accent. I remember doing a Harry Potter marathon, and afterwards thinking \"Wait a second, they are not in America. Did they have accents?\" \n\nThis makes it sound like I have bad hearing and misophonia would not be that much of an issue, right? Nope, classified as \"severe\" misophonia by my audiologist. So weird how things work out. I relate to your accent situation! I grew up around a lot of very diverse accents, so I always chalked it up to that, but there are very few accents I cannot understand. Those I struggle with are usually not just an accent but also a heavy use of English phrases I am less familiar with (like the deep south).  \n\neven if your hearing is not *super strength* on its own, if you can hear a million sounds at once (even those you do not want) or anything like that it is kind of a Jedi strength. It is good to accentuate the positive with misophonia... because otherwise it can feel overwhelming!", "Need help after Father told me to 'get used to it\" My dad is an INCREDIBLY loud eater. You can hear him eat when you are in a different room to him and he is a dick about it. He think that because it is 'his house' he can do whatever he wants. \n\nHe is a nice person but an absolute asshole when it comes to other people's emotions. He is purposefully mean to younger people because he thinks it is funny and he is mean to me but he covers it by laughing and saying it is a joke.\n\nA few minutes ago he was eating lunch incredibly loud and when he came into the kitchen to clean up I mentioned how loud he was chewing (not mentioning that it made me get aggressive and annoyed from Miso) and he basically just said 'its how I eat' \n\nI said that it made me annoyed because I hated the sound and he got annoyed at me bringing this up and said 'Just get used to it already' \n\nI then asked why he could not just be considerate for me and said as a joke 'do you not care about your children's feelings?' and replied 'no.' and walked off.\n\nThis is more of a rant than anything but I just needed to get it off my chest. Any advice on how to get him to quiet down? If I start getting angry or aggressive about it he just laughs or gets annoyed by it. \n\nThanks", "My mom is going to drive me insane Me and my mom both have misophonia, so you think that would help her to understand. Well, she gets mad at everyone else for making the annoying sounds, but then proceeds to make the same ones. Like when eating, she hates the fork scraping and does it herself! \n\nAnyways, my mom has some health issues. She coughs a LOT. It is loud, and when she does she coughs for like half an hour straight. Today, she is been coughing for the past 2 hours and it is driving me crazy. This coughing has only recently started bothering me, but it is been happening for years. For some reason she does not do anything about it.\n\n I am too scared to tell her about this though, because anytime I try to talk to her she cries and says she is the worst person ever. Honestly, I do not know how much I can take of it though. I want to scream at her and it is taking all I have to not. For what it is worth, I am sorry you are having to deal with this. I am new to it all, my daughter seems to have it so we are acting as though she does until we find out otherwise.\n\nI am guessing your mom is frustrated with this and instead of dealing with it, is lashing out. It is hard to admit you have a health problem sometimes, especially one where \"normal\" stuff is the cause.\n\nI imagine you have tried this, but it it possible for you to get some noise-canceling headphones to wear at least sometimes?\n\nIt sounds as though you are school-age, maybe high school? I wondered if you might talk to a counselor at school for support and ideas.\n\nSorry, these are probably obvious things to try but I at least wanted to let you know that I hear you, and you are not doing anything wrong. Thanks for your response, it means a lot\n\nWe are currently working to get a therapist, though it is taking a while. I had not thought of talking to a counselor, so when school starts back up I will try to. \n\nI have tried noise cancelling headphones or earplugs, though they do not really work too well sadly. Good luck with getting a therapist. If you have a regular doctor, perhaps you could speak with them as well. \n\nI see headphones recommended a lot, but I can see that they would not solve every problem. My daughter just got a pair of headphones with noise-cancelling and she says they are good. But she still sometimes goes into another room. (Her triggers &gt;!are chewing noises, utensils on plates!&lt;, etc.)\n\nI also ordered some wheat straw plates, bowls and utensils. I am curious to see how the noise from those affects my daughter, although it will not help with the other triggers. Our doctor recommended the same thing because I am bothered by the plates and chewing too. From what I can tell I think that you are doing everything right, and it is so awesome to know how you are changing things to help your daughter. Thanks. It is all a learning curve. Good luck.", "Is anyone else's misophonia triggered more by those who you are close to? `I do not know why, but my mother is the worst trigger for my misophonia. She insists on smacking her lips with everything she eats and drinks, as well as loud, obnoxious moaning whenever she is eating something she particularly enjoys. I always leave the room or put in earbuds whenever she eats and she still has not caught on. I do have misophonia with everyone else who displays these habits, but for some reason, it is the worst with my mom and she is the only person with which it is unbearable. Has anyone else ever experienced something like this; worse misophonia with those you are close to?` Also, sorry about the way the text looks - I am new to Reddit and I clicked something on the keyboard and \\^this happened. yes. it feels like they are out to get revenge on me for something I did not know I did. So I have thought a lot about this.\n\nTo me, it is an issue with respect. For instance, in public, it annoys me when people chew with their mouth open. Usually I can think of that (with lots of practice) as a \u201cthey do not know\u201d kind of deal and move on or remove myself from the situation.\n\nWith family or loved ones though, I give them the benefit of the doubt the first time I ask them politely to stop (meaning the first time I ask during a meal) as I can tell it is a habit and can only do my due diligence and assume they do not mean to trigger me.\n\nThe more I have to ask though, the more it sets me off and just starts truly pissing me off. Most of that is still on me though because I am asking them to change a habit for me, which is a large thing to ask.\n\nWhat truly angers me is when someone close to me is just like \u201cget over it\u201d because then I wish for one day that they could experience what we do so they could understand. you are describing, exactly, my relationship with my mother's eating.\n\nI have told my mother too.\n\nMany times over many years.\n\nNo change, she is going to do what she wants to do.

Yes. Oh its awful", "Do I have Misophonia?  \n\nHi all, I have had this thought for a while, but I am not sure if what I experience would be classed as having Misophonia. Certain noises, such as excessive sniffing or loud chewing make me very anxious, heart rate increases and I really want to leave the room and get away from it. Other specific examples are when my partner constantly whistles, it is good whistling, but it never fails to make me feel very agitated. No noises make me angry, just uncomfortable.\n\nI do not know how to explain this to my partner, she is autistic so she is more understanding about mental health than a lot of people I know, but when I ask her to whistle in another room, she get's annoyed at me and makes me feel guilty for getting so distressed. She does agree, and she does leave the room, but most of the time it leaves bad feelings and makes me feel like I should put up with the noise and that I am just over reacting.\n\nDoes what I have described sound like Misophonia, or just over sensitivity? Having a bit of clarity might help me explain things better. Yup. That sounds like misophonia. Typical responses to triggers are found in your standard fight or flight responses; the urge to flee, irritation, panic, and rage. It feels like my trigger sounds jump up my spine, and sometimes I do the rage thing. I wonder how many times my neighbors heard me screaming bloody murder as a kid when I flipped my shit over a trigger?  \n\n\nAnyway, I am on the autism spectrum myself, so I can relate to your partner as well in that we can be rather dense in the empathy and social cues department if we are not told flat-out what is going on. I would suggest sitting down with her and explaining what effect the sounds have on you and that you were not trying to be rude.  \n\n\nMisophonia is, more often than not, attached to anxiety disorders. And those of us on the autism spectrum are very prone to anxiety and varying degrees of sensory overload (additional smell and motion sensitivity for me.... wooooo....). If she can relate at all in other sensitivities or anxiety, she should understand where you are coming from and that it is not something that you can control.", "Smartphones and repetitive noises I barely see anyone complain about repetitive noises.

I know it is really hard to live through a life where your triggers are fairly common, but the best thing I can recommend is trying to wear headphones or earbuds for longer to block out the noise. Sometimes you have to try and endure your trigger, but most of the time its completely fine to just do everything you can to block them out. Living with earbuds in often can be challenging, but it is far better than you going crazy. And I am sure your family and friends will accept it eventually, even if the whole thing is weird at first, which it usually is. Sometimes families just refuse to believe misophonia even exists, but theres still ways to cope even then. You can DM me if you want, and we can talk about the stuff you are dealing with. I know it is hard. Sometimes it feels like your life is being ruined. But still, i hope you can hang in there, and I wish the best for you from the bottom of my heart.

I understand completely. I feel the exact same way. I have nose sound cancelling headphones and just play music or pink noise in them when something like this happens (which is almost every day). The headphones although pricey are definitely worth the money. If you can hear it over the music/headphones (happens sometimes) i just leave the house on a walk, bike ride, or a place outside I could sit, (before corona) go to a coffee shop, etc. \n\nOne day we will live alone and finally feel peace", "Explaining misophonia to others Recently in another sub I had an issue that I posted about relating to my misophonia and in it I said that I do not get bothered by my own sounds. This really put people off. Of course, I tried to explain myself that most people with misophonia do not get triggered by their own sounds but by others and I got downvoted for just being honest. \n\nThis sort of thing carries over to real life a lot as well. I do not bring up misophonia a lot to people but when I do, it is always \u201cbut that makes no sense if you do not get bothered by your own noises\u201d. The worst response is \u201cbut you chew so loudly too\u201d as if this is supposed to negate my own struggles with misophonia. \n\nI guess my question here is how do you handle explaining misophonia to others in a way that circumvents these common responses. And if you get these responses, how do you explain it? I usually suggest this, maybe it can help you explain your situation to ask for help.\n\nLetter to Friends, Family, and Coworkers\n\n( That is excellent!! Thank you so much for sharing that. Good luck! Another anecdote that might help is that to answer the question of \"why cannot you just deal with it and control it?\", some have mentioned that it is like getting stung by a wasp, you cannot really control your response. Yeah I just told my fianc\u00e9 that I just learned what it is. I have had issues as long as I can remember. All he said was, \u201cget over it.\u201d \u201cYou need to just relax.\u201d That alone makes me want to leave the room and lock the door for the rest of the week.", "Misophonia poem?

I am living very old building (1925) and I am also aware that this can be normal but most of the times I cannot help it and I am getting angry. Most of the times I blame myself and my luck that I am not lucky enough and these things always find me. Is there anyone that having the same issue and I would like to know treatments and coping techniques if possible. I am using earplugs but I really want to git rid of this thing. Thank you so much! Yes I have this same problem, I even visited a doctor as the noise was giving me terrible anxiety.\n\nYou could try that, but now I try to laugh it off or distract myself.\n\nIf they are noisy I turn my own tv up or put some ear phones in and listen to a podcast.\n\nVacuum, anything to take my mind off it.\n\nWe are not unlucky, and it will not always be like this.\n\nThat person could move soon or maybe even you might find the perfect place with hardly any neighbours.\n\nPlease do not think you are going mad because you are not, it is just some people can ignore these noises but people like us cannot.\n\nIt is ok.\n\nAs long as they are quiet at night and you can sleep well that is the main thing. Thank you. That was really good answer. I always looking for this kind of support. I does not have to be cure but some words really helps me. Thanks You are welcome!\n\nIn future you can find the perfect place to live, this is just for now! Me too brother\n\nI do not have any solid answers but I did discover you can comfortably wear iPods lying down in bed. I play thunderstorm sounds through them.\n\nI miss the previous tenant who was a quiet Asian girl. So do not live below someone? lol Yes thank you for recommendation. I currently use foam earplugs. Thankfully it solves 80% of the noises. I agree with many of the good answers already. I too just cannot ignore these sounds. Even if my neighbors are amazingly quiet most of the time, the one time I hear them make noise I get upset as well. \n\nThe only thing that has worked for me is renting guest houses / Tiny houses so I get that detached house feel. Or when I was in Germany, renting the top floor in a newer building (in Germany newer means better soundproofing but not in the states)  Also when my anxiety gets worse, noise cancelling headphones with the my noise website up. Yes I agree with you and sorry to hear you had a bad experience. Those are great recommendations thank you! Problem are  that noises must be normal to other people but for me it is not. I am trying my best but every time I ignore the noise it getting worse and worse like a crazy. I really would like to live in detached house and I am pretty sure that can solve my problem. By the way, I did a bit research about this and I came across one article and they mentioned that this can be genetic and coded in DNA. True or not my father had exactly same thing. He was waking up middle of the night and screaming and swearing the upstair's neighbor. Now I turned 28 and i have EXCAT same behaviour. You know I do not want to be asshole who scream middle of the night but I could not help it and it really make me sad. I think some people are more sensitive to noise and have trouble tuning it out. I have found I actually need silence for my sanity.  Some research has shown that more creative people tend to have more sensitivity to this kind of thing.  \n\nAlso there is a bit of an issue with how considerate your neighbor is. For example if you go upstairs and ask if they would please walk softer. If the neighbor tells you off then personally my anxiety will ramp up and the noise affects me worse, but if the neighbor reacts kindly. I am able to tolerate more noise.\n\nEveryone says rent a house, but sadly that is out of the price range for many folks :(  If you cannot afford a house, the second best thing is the top floor. Especially if you can rent a condo. You can tell a lot about the building structure by tapping on walls and floors. Listening for solid or hollow sounds. You might look a bit crazy but it is worth it. Also I have even talked to neighbors and asked if there is a lot of noise in the building. (Granted everyone is sensitivity will be less than yours)\n\nLike you, this has gotten worse with age but has finally sorta plateaued off for me. So there is hope. It is worse when my anxiety levels are higher. \n\nI hope this helps you, I understand your pain. What are  normal noises for others, can be highly annoying to us. Yes you have many valid points. Thank you so much for taking time to give your thoughts. He seems to good guy and I am planning to talk to him first occasion. Currently I am also meditating in order to reduce stress and get rid of the bad habits. I am just being beginning of the road and I hope it can get better and better in time.Unfortunate thing is, there is no treatment for this. People say some treatment might work those are \"**Tinnitus Retraining Therapy**\", \"**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**\" but I have not had a chance to try any of those. After these unfornutate corona situation goes away I am planning to consult neuroscientist. By the way I forgot the mentioned that I used to have obsesive compulsive  disorder in my childhood. I was keep touching stuff repeatedly because of the prevent bad things happening to me. i feel this so bad, luckily ive come home from university so no one is upstairs anymore, but when i was there i developed panic attacks from constant thudding noises from my upstairs neightbor. \n\nthe worst part was not knowing /what/ they were doing. it sounded like they were constantly dropping things!! or walking hard!! but the room was literally only the size of two double beds , end to end, with a quarter of that as the bathroom... so if they were walking, idek how, it was not spacious enough for that.\n\nanyway. best thing to do is listen to music or for me, repeating their sounds helped. so if they slammed a door, i slammed my door and it helped a lot lol.", "\"Pain is sadly the greatest teacher\" - Matt - S3 Ep11 &amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing video jutv16jivk561...*\n\nThis is a very powerful conversation with Matt, a young man who lives just outside of Chicago. Matt is just out of high school but he is already lived through a lot of darkness and pain brought on by his misophonia, having effects on family, friends, school, work, and ultimately culminating in a hospitalization last year to treat his mental health. Matt now has close friends that help him, his family supports him and he is driven to use his pain to help other young people who are also suffering from mental health issues. We even have some good laughs throughout our conversation. I just exchanged messages with Matt last night and he is excited to get his story out and hopes it helps others who may be suffering in silence. \n\nListen to our full conversation anywhere you get podcasts and at   \n(", "Relieved to know I am not alone! ", "Any idea how I can get rid of *bleep*s in media? I love to watch YouTube video essays, but for some reason they very frequently use long strings of curse words that they bleep out using a loud, high-pitched test tone just like they use on TV. Or sometimes they will use that test tone continually for five to ten seconds as part of a gag.  \n\n\nIt is gotten to the point where I simply cannot enjoy the work of certain creators with the sound on anymore, because they think that using the test tone heavily is really, really funny. They do not know how bad it is for us. The same goes for use of that repetitive air horn sound cue.\n\n  \nAre there any Chrome extensions for filtering out those test tone bleeps? I find them unbearable. They literally make me cry, and I abandon videos I was interested in watching because of it. Those bleeps are so loud and obnoxious! Hope you find something but I have never personally heard of anything that can help with this \ud83d\ude14 Even if I am wearing noise cancelling headphones while I watch these videos, it still makes me hyperventilate. I wish they would put misophonia warnings on videos. I do not have a solution, but just want to say my heart goes out to you. That specific sound does not trigger me, but I have definitely had to abandon otherwise great videos if the speaker has dry mouth. It is all too common.", "TV Noises Hi, I have never posted here before. I am glad to know this subreddit exists. I am having a really hard time lately and it is really affecting me mentally.\n\nI do not understand why anyone thinks it is necessary to put chewing sounds in TV shows and movies. I mean, even to people who do not struggle with Misophonia do not want to hear that shit. I also cannot stand shushing sounds, and for some reason every fan show I watch needs to include them for some reason. It is gotten to the point I can barely have the TV on. It makes me lash out and cry. I am disabled physically so I am home most days, and it would suck having to sit in complete silence all day. Like, I want to write some open letter to Hollywood telling then to knock it the fuck off. Obviously that is not a solution because no one gives a shit about us. I just feel like I am about to bust. Does anyone else struggle with this or have tips for ways to cope with this? It is funny you posted this when came here to post a rant about this exact same thing. \n\nI got into watching 90 day fiance on hulu, and I lash out at the people filming this so many times and feel the rage like someone is flipping a light switch on. The eating scenes are so hard to watch, and it is like they make it a point to play nothing else in the background to cover the mouth sounds when people are chewing.\n\nI definitely keep the mute button close by, when I can catch it. That is crazy timing, lol. I am glad to know I am not alone, but I am sorry you are going through the same thing. It is hell. I just muted a scene where an old guy was eating, and when I unmuted it he did that thing where he smacks his tongue when he talks. It upsets me more when I think I have gotten through a hard moment and then I get hit with something else. My husband does not think I am serious when I say it pretty much makes living not worth it sometimes, because no matter what I do some benign action of someone else makes me so anxious and full of rage that it sucks the enjoyment out of everything. Sorry that turned into a rant. It helps knowing that there are more people out there like us, and maybe one day someone will take our sensitivities into account when they make movies and shows and commercials. If you ever want to chat or rant yourself you can message me anytime! The mute button is my best friend I have been struggling with this lately too! I do not have coping recommendations, but I just started watching the original Star Trek (it is on Netflix), and the slightly muffled/lower sound quality of it is a godsend! I have not had my misophonia triggered with it yet (\u201cshh\u201d sounds are not an issue for me, but all chewing/smacking/mouth sounds are) Ugh, I am sorry you are dealing with this too. It frikin sucks. It is great you are loving Star Trek. I keep meaning to watch it, it will definitely be the next thing I start. I wish there was a way to dampen or muffle the sounds we hate and still be able to understand what is going on. Like, headphones that only filter certain sounds or frequencies. Chewing is so damn nasty. i just watched the help last night. the scene where bryce dallas howard eats that pie is awful, but i wanted to watch it because it is so iconic. the smacking was so terrible, i get they wanted to emphasize that she really was enjoying that chocolate pie, but i could have gathered that without hearing her chew into a high res mic :// RIGHT? You can portray a person enjoying a meal without us needing to hear them chew like animals. I hope you were able to enjoy the movie anyway \ud83d\ude41 That would be the dream! I have wondered if turning the treble way down on the tv would help make those sounds less sharp/more bearable. Shows/movies/episodes with frequent mouth sounds really should come with a content warning! I watch the tv show iCarly and there are scenes where Freddie is always clearing his throat, he does it in almost every episode,It is so annoying. I saw a scene after Carly and Freddie kissed they both cleared they are throats after doing it I started panicking. Sam was clearing her throat when she was getting Carly and Freddie\u2019s attention, it really bothered me. I like to make a playlist of my favorite YouTube videos without throat clearing. I do not like to look at the word ahem either because it is a visual trigger for me. I also mute the volume whenever advertisements come up because I am afraid of hearing throat clearing or coughing. But I understand where you are coming from and I am sorry the sounds bother you. I hope that headphones can help you, I wear them when I am at work they help me drown out unpleasant noises. Also tv subtitles set me off as well because I see throat clearing word triggers sometimes. I remember also on Frozen 2 Kristoff cleared his throat twice when proposing to Anna it made me nervous. I try my best to avoid videos with throat clearing. I understand that people do it as a nervous habit but it is not necessary to make that noise in my opinion no matter what the situation is about.", "My family invited me to a pool party My family invited me to a pool party today where there be chips, popcorn and juice  but the thing is I cannot stand their chewing , mainly my brother ( he chew  so loudly that I hear him from another room ) I really want to go but my misophonia is really strong, what should I do? Does background music help? If so bring a Bluetooth speaker if there is not already likely to be music available. Even just the ambient background noise from being outside by an in-use pool should make it easier than if you were trapped inside with the noises.

They will sync it up with whatever theater you are in and you will not hear any chewing. Better still is going to the theater in the middle of the day on a weekday and not buying the tickets until like 10 minutes beforehand so you can choose a seat near no one. That is an excellent tip about the movies and I cannot believe I never thought of it before. Just to clear it up, r/misophoniasupport was handed over to me and u/TelephoneMelon when there was outrage over a former mod at r/misophonia last year.\n\nThe head mod at r/misophonia said that we could pretty much do whatever we want with it, as long as it stays a mostly violence-free place for people. We agreed with that, with the exception that people can come here to talk about their violent feelings, but not make plans to harm people or come here to threaten others. (Hence the specifically worded rule that gets amended every so often.)\n\nWe do not have any major control over what happens over at r/misophonia. I do know that u/TelephoneMelon is a mod there, but I personally do not even look at that sub myself. I do agree that it would make more sense for them to be opposite, but not something we really have control over. I like to think of our little sub here as a more relaxed and less structured version of r/misophonia.\n\nAll I know is that we wanted to bring more positivity to this subreddit, and that sometimes that positivity comes from being able to joke around and laugh. Because of that, we have the Positivity and Memes flair. :)\n\nDid not mean for this to be a long rant or anything, just wanted to give a little insight for you and anyone else that has that same question. I think r/misophonia was just those two mods wanting to post their research. They did not want subs to actually contribute, only follow and praise their work. It is sad they completely dominated it, I think they should have moved to r/misophoniaresearch or something like that. I left after that huge blowup. \n\nAt least we have this sub. It is been helpful and supportive. I appreciate the nice comments about our sub. We really put a decent amount of time into getting it up and running so people could have a safe and supportive environment to post in.\n\nI know that blowup last year was a lot for people and I am glad it resulted in this sub.

You all are great! \u2764\ufe0f Thanks for clearing that up :) Absolutely! Your comment actually spawned a conversation between me and u/TelephoneMelon about the whole topic.

This is very damn real. Let it out my dude. I dont know how I got my parents to listen to me about misophonia, but eventually they stopped using the argument of \"But you make the same sounds!\". Actually, it probably coincided with me completely stopping mocking the sounds they make and violently screaming at them. Definitely ask your mom why she tries to force you to hear her eat food, or explain that that is what it feels like she is doing, and also show her that in most people exposure therapy doesnt help. Also, whenever possible walk around with earbuds or headphones on, either watching something or listening to music. Also, see if you can start either eating in your room or eating after everyone. Unfortunatel, people arent going to change for us, so we have to change for them. Hope it gets better for you.", "I envy people who can just come home and relax. I cannot because of my noisy neighbours' kids Fucking assholes have been keeping throwing plastic stuff for 5 years already, like, hell, did not you learn, you little piece of shit, that when you throw the thing on the laminate floor and throw and throw it again, nothing significant changes?? You do the same thing over and over for what? Oh wow, it fucking BOUNCED OFF!!! How great is that! Let me try it again for 5 YEARS!\n\nJesus, if I could I would punch their parents through the wall Same here. Yesterday they were throwing a football at the side of the building and when I finally snapped on then they did not see how they were doing anything wrong. I just keep doors and windows shut and turn the TV up to drown it out much as I can. Oh my god I know. I had the worst upstairs neighbors for YEARS. They had 3 kids and zero parenting skills. They just ignored them and they ran back and forth across the apartment all day, all night, every day like they are playing soccer in combat boots and it drove us INSANE. I tried talking to the dad and he is like \"I tell them to stop they will not stop what can I do? \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\". He shrugged. He fucking SHRUGGED. Literally ruining my family's life with the noise because he is too stupid to use birth control or parent his THREE fucking kids. Why are you having them if you cannot control them?!\n\nThen they moved out, then a year later some other fuckheads moved in and basically the same thing over again with this kid. Only one though but it did not make much difference. Mom just completely ignored him. So much that one day he busted out the window screen (on the second floor) and was throwing things out the window. He could have fallen and died if he leaned too far. The mom finally noticed and grabs the screen and the trash he threw. then it happened TWICE MORE THAT DAY. Like damn do you not learn?? It happens once, you keep an eye on him from now on. It happens TWICE and you are just a damn moron but THREE times??? Fucking douchebags!!!\n\n&gt;\"I tell them to stop they will not stop what can I do? \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\"\n\nI would want to punch him right there!!! You know, I think one has the right to be noisy at night in retorting kind of way Do not hurt your ears too much, they are not worth it\n\nI did that and I cannot do it anymore, so I need to think of something else and I will I contemplated like.. putting subwoofers on ladders or something. I called the cops frequently when it continued too late. My ceiling was full of holes from banging on it with a broom. They were just fucking ignorant and clueless. Complained to the landlord all the time. \n\nI still have *some* shitty upstairs neighbors. The one directly above me that took their apt is just a single lady so other than a bit too much sliding furniture and occasional stomping it is fine. She is nice. The ppl on the 3rd floor though, every time they come and go it is the whole family, like 6 people including the kids and they stomp like elephants down the stairs, they are talking or screaming as loud as possible. I crank my music to 10 when they go by and they are really loud. ugh It really is miserable. I am sorry. I wish I could afford to live in the woods but until then top floor of a concrete high-rise apartment is my only hope. ", "My alcoholic mother is my biggest trigger My first post on this subreddit.. my mother is both a chainsmoker and an extreme alcoholic. When drunk, which is nearly every day, especially today, she gets incredibly loud and impulsive, sometimes violent.\n\n\n She is super inconsiderate and ignorant, even when sober, and has a tendency to always talk freakishly loud on the phone for hours on end, with the speakerphone on max volume. Whenever I politely tell her to either lower her voice or at least talk without speakerphone on, she either ignores me or tells me to shut up and go away. \n\nI cant put headphones on because I am afraid of her busting down my door for something. I take walks but it is getting tougher by the day because the weather is dropping to very low temperatures and everything is getting icy and dangerous to walk on. I have no car or no friends to hang out with. \n\nHer loudness triggers me to no end - it feels as though my brain is about to explode, like daggers are digging into my head, and like static is buzzing in my eardrums. It gets to the point where I feel like screaming and banging my head on the wall. My autism also makes these feelings less bearable. \n\nPlease I need some advice or something. I am 17 and I am not sure if I will be moving out when I turn 18 which is this June. She is super drunk and violent right now and she has been loudly talking on speakerphone for the past 6 hours. I thought she would mellow down when I returned home from the store but she is only gotten worse. I dont want her to go driving because she is drunk and impulsive and has gotten a DUI before. I am so sorry you have to deal with this OP. I am very empathetic to your situation, as I am also 17 and dealing with an alcoholic parent.  It gets very hard at times but you do not deserve it at all. \n\nIf you go to school, do you do it remotely or in person? I am hoping that if it is in person, that is at least a temporary escape from your situation. Is it possible that you try to get a job, that can act as both an excuse to be away from home as well as a way to get money to move out?\n\nAnd yes, I would urge you to move out at 18. I most definitely will when I turn it. What is the worst that could happen if she barged in? \n\nIs there a way you can pursue emancipation? \n\nAlso, a DUI would actually probably help HER, but would be dangerous af for everyone else on the road. She sounds like a menace. Hurt people hurt people, and the sooner you can get into counseling, the better. Good luck. Get those headphones. I am not allowed to lock my door in case of an 'emergency'. Most times I have locked my door, she has kept pounding and pounding until I thought the door was going to snap off its hinges. \n\nShe likes to pull off my headset when she needs me. My headset was NOT cheap.\n\nLike I have mentioned, sober or drunk, she is very ignorant and selfish. She never listens to others because she is a narcissist. I have been in the car with her a few times when she is drunk behind the wheel. I offered to drive those times but she forced me to sit passenger because 'she was fine and sober'. I thought we were going to die those times from her recklessness and obviously dangerous driving. \n\nI will save up money to move out on time for college, but I will need a job because art commissions cannot pay for a studio apartment in Chicago that well.. my parents are forbidding me to get a job now because I need 'to study'. My grades are good. Finding a decent studio in Chicago as a student is tough. Art commissions do not pay very well sadly. My parents have forbid me to get a job now because I 'need to study'. I have good grades. \n\nI do remote because I am very health conscious and covid cases where I am at are at an all-time high. A lot of staff and students have been infected and diagnosed with the virus from my school and I am scared of catching it. Okay, seriously... are you me? I am from Chicago as well. Good grades, but I love to make art that likely will not get my anywhere money wise. \n\nOnce you turn 18, your parents cannot control whether you get a job or not. Apply for jobs then. In the meantime, keep doing art commissions and save up as much as you can. Speak to a school counselor  and apply for scholarships (if you are going to college) and maybe try to afford a dorm? If not, there is always the possibility of moving in with a friend or sharing a studio with a roommate to cut down on expenses. \n\nSorry if my advice is not helpful. I am living the same situation as you. At least I can offer you my empathy, if you ever want to PM me and are in need of a friend I am here &lt;3 This is going to be long. First, I am extremely sorry that you are in this position. I am likely older than your mom, but late middle age is not necessary to see that you are being abused and your life is in danger.\n\nUnless you have already exhausted this route, I suggest you contact school authorities ( guidance counselor)and child protective services IMMEDIATELY, and find your closest chapter of Al-Anon. I repeat: your life is in danger. Do not blow me off because I am old. \n\nI am also a recovering addict and had my own go-round with alcohol abuse, and know these things: it is entirely possible to remain drunk well into the day following an episode of heavy drinking. Women (I am female too) do not metabolize alcohol like men do, and get drunk much faster. Has to do with having less muscle. And unless your mom is both fat and healthy (sounds impossible, but is not; with a lot of muscle underneath, a youngish woman who works out a lot can be 20 to 40 pounds overweight and still be in decent cardiovascular shape), she does not have that much muscle. Alcohol does a metric fucktonne of bad shit to the body. Muscle wastage is but one. And now that I have said all of that, I am *certain* that your mother has not driven sober in years.\n\nThe Al-Anon and Alateen groups will have a wealth of information on how to get into a healthier situation. I used to go to mixed AA, NA, and Al-Anon meetings, and have seen sober, stable adults take kids from dangerous alcoholic homes into their own. Of course, I cannot guarantee that this will happen for you, but I am pretty sure that attendance (via Zoom these days, I think) will empower you to get some vital changes under way. Also, a LOT of attorneys and medical professionals have problems with substance abuse.\n\nI am not religious, but if you can get with your pastor or other church official (Unitarian and Presbyterian are the most open minded denominations), you might find helpful counsel. I really really hope you can get the hell out of your mother's house. Thank you for the advice and response.. age does not matter in this sort of situation to me. I will speak to my local church tomorrow early in the morning after mass. My mother is I believe a 'functional alcoholic' - at least sometimes she is. She is a bigger woman and not very tall, but since she has been drinking for over 35 years, she has grown pretty tolerant. You might want to look into how alcoholism progresses in women. Tolerance can turn on a dime. I went from being able to outdrink college athletes to blacking out after 5 drinks around the age of 30. When the liver has been rendered sufficiently fibrotic, tolerance tanks. Your mom sounds as though she is in terrible shape. Please talk to your guidance counselor and someone from CPS. Your life hinges on it.", "Going to the cinema My misophonia has gotten a lot worse this past year, and of course with lockdown I have not been able to go out to the cinema, so Im really concerned about going back with all the eating noises and sweet packet shaking etc. Does anybody have any advice for this? I am thinking about asking if they have headphones that play the audio through them, but if they do not I am not sure what I would do! I am UK based so I do not really know if this is offered at our cinemas update: they do not offer the audio headphones!): I have always taken an MP3 player with earbuds for playing white/brown noise when I go to a theater. I pop them in at a middle volume that is enough to block the eating sounds while still being easily able to hear the movie. oh that is a good idea! i usually have white noise playing through the day but was hesitant with doing it whilst watching a movie in case it distracted me! That is because most people think misophonia is just us being weird. I hate these people \ud83d\ude02 On short notice there is not much you can do to avoid triggers in the cinema.\n\nWhat you can do is practice focusing on other things. It may sound weird and I only can give a short version of this. But when I went to therapy in the AMC in Amsterdam, they gave you tools to cope with Misophonia. \n\nThe therapy is basically this; \n\n- you need to know what physical reactions you have when triggered(like making a fist with your hands etc...)\n\n- when triggered, look for \"distractions\", for example when sitting outside next to the person triggering you, and when that happens try to focus on the birds etc...\n\n- try to look for \"verzachtende omstandigheden\" (idk translation), it means that you can look for logic reasons why they sound like that. If a child eats loudly, you can say to yourself that the kid still needs to learn. If you hear an elderly person doing that, you can say to yourself \"that person needs to survive too\"  all that kind of stuff.\n\n\nBe aware that I only mention what I remember best from the therapy as it was in 2015 when i went to the therapy. Also, as far as I know, the therapy does not work on everyone but I do not have the numbers on that, in my group it was 4 out of 8 it did not work.\n\n\nI wish you best of luck! Thank you! I will be sure to give it a try!", "Do not know what to do. Struggling to live a functional life as a single adult. I live alone and struggle immensely with anxiety, depression and misophonia. The misophonia makes it extremely difficult to participate in society and be a normal person. My triggers are not the usual eating/chewing noises but coughing. \n\nAt my job I sit in a small office with one other person. The previous person who I worked with would cough really loud and it would literally jolt me out of my chair. After he ate lunch he would cough every 25 seconds for hours until his food settled. I was on edge all day and in fight-or-flight mode. I would come home almost in tears dreading the next day I would go back and have to endure it all over again.\n\nAfter this person resigned I was able to work alone in the office all by myself. Let me tell you it was absolute HEAVEN. I was finally able to actually concentrate on my work and get things done. Not being in fight-or-flight helped me to focus. \n\nWell, my boss hired a new person who I have to work with. I am extremely scared and having panic attacks over it. What if they cough loudly? What if they cough all day long? I do not think I have the mental capacity to deal with that kind of stress anymore. My adrenal glands are burned out. I will not be able to focus on my work. \n\nImagine sitting in a small enclosed office space, where it is mega quiet. And then you have to listen to your worst trigger abruptly at random times while you are supposed to sit still and concentrate on tasks that need 100% attention.\n\nI wish I did not have to work. I wish misophonia was recognized as a disability. There, I said it. Ever since I have started working I have become so depressed because I cannot escape my triggers anymore. Exposure therapy does not work, my job proved that to me. If you are in the US, the ADA states: \"The ADA defines a person with a disability as a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity.\u201d Misophonia fits the bill. Tell this to your employer and ask for accommodations such as a private work area, noise cancelling headphones, or work from home option. \nYou can find info on talking to your employer about this here:\n\n( At first glance, this looks like a pretty darn good website. Thanks for sharing. Thank you!! I have not seen this! This sucks. This is why I cannot do office cubicle type work. It is just not conducive to my sanity. Can I ask what you suggest as far as work goes? It depends on your skill set and proclivities. I\u2018ve been everything from a firearms instructor to a nanny to a musician... I have worked in offices too and I CANT and I never will again. I have told people on this forum before that I do not think the office environment is feasible for us and to stop forcing it if you are able to switch fields. In my opinion it is better to try to switch your education or skill set to something that is going to accommodate misophonia. Something like a trade, or something in a noisy/bustling environment like a restaurant or a hospital. Or something where you are mobile like a police officer. Or something where you are alone like a receptionist. There is a lot more work from home options now, too, which could be great depending on your living situation.\n\nBut know that I feel you. I think about my last office job and shudder. It was like a dark cloud over my whole life. I would never go back. my coping mechanism.. is kind of strange but i use android epub book reader \n\n\n\nwith google text to speech (the UK woman's voice but there a lot of choices) and have it read me books at a pretty low volume while i am working.  you can still respond when someone bugs you but the general background noises are not as noticeable.  Also it'a mechanical (ish) voice so there are no mouth noises or breath noises and I get to listen to a cool story while working.  \n\nSo that is what I do.. dono if it will work for you.. best of luck", "The most popular playground in the neighbourhood... ...is right in front of my apartment.\n\nI moved to a new city just over a year ago and I have moved apartments three times because of issues with noise. In my last apartment there was a constant thudding that sounded like someone running back and forth, all day and all night. I tried my hardest to find the source of the noise but did not have any luck. My other neighbours could hear it too but it did not bother them as much. So I lied to the landlord that I was leaving the country, ended my lease early and moved.\n\nThe next apartment I moved to is where I live now. There is a small playground in front of the apartment, which was quite empty the few times I came to check out the area before I signed the lease. I also never though that I would have an issue with noise coming from a playground and it is also really difficult to find a nice apartment here, which this apartment is. Now the summer has started the playground is full of parents and their kids for around 10 hours a day, from 11am until 9pm. I am under a lot of stress, constantly waiting for the next high pitch scream, baby cry or loud yell. I find it strange because there is a restaurant below the apartment too but I am not bothered by the noises of people dining outside at night. I have asked my landlord what I can do to leave this apartment early (I have 9 months left on the lease), or if they have any other empty apartments I could swap to that face another direction, however the response is slow and my patience is wearing thin. I told them the noise is having an impact on my mental health but it is difficult not being able to truly explain how serious this is for me.\n\nThis past year has been so draining on my mental health and a huge learning curve about myself. I knew I had issues with certain noises but I did not fully understand how serious it was for me until now, hence not making the right decisions when apartment hunting this last year. It started with small problems, like someone whistling in the office or the noises of people eating. Now it feels like it is taken over my life and I will not ever be happy wherever I live. It is all I can seem to talk about with family and friends, I cannot concentrate on my work or seem to have any enjoyment. I have anxiety and depression issues too and these seem to flare up by my reactions to these noises, which in turn affects those around me. I just want to be happy and not be bothered by this so much.\n\nAny coping tips for living in a noisy apartment or coming to terms with Misophonia are welcome. I am sorry you are going through this. I had the same issues at my last apartment... Neighbors upstairs constantly thudding around, people outside, etc. I know exactly how you are feeling. It literally took over my entire life, and I was miserable in my own home. The only relief I have ever been able to find for anything regarding my trigger noises is from noise cancelling earbuds/headphones. It is only a partial fix, I know. You cannot live your entire life in headphones. Not to mention, they are pricey. But it has been my one reliable source of relief. On a positive note, it should be better during the winter and during school hours when the kids are not playing. Hang in there, you are not alone. Just move, you will find a quiet place. Depend where you work but it is definitely not in town. A couple of box fans, a white noise machine/app, amplified, and industrial earmuffs will be your best friends. I have a similar Problem so I feel You.\nI have Misophonia and have extreme reactions to screaming and crying sounds, *especially* from Children.\nMy old place had Neighbors with little kids that cried on Weekends and now i have FINALLY moved out i moved into a place just a few blocks from a primary school.....\n\nEveryday EVEN on weekends (idk why..) i hear kids screaming and today it was the WORST.\nI cannot move bc we are not really wealthy and just moved in a month ago :/ i have headphones but i do not want to live in them :(", "Maybe some progress into FINALLY gaining support from my family? I have been struggling with misophonia since I was probably around 3 or 4. I am now 18 years old and it seems to have gotten worse in recent years. My parents are very aware of it as it is not exactly something that can be hidden, especially as a small child, and especially when my parents insist on eating dinner together every single night. It is always been a me issue. Stop plugging your ears, eat slower, why are you yelling, you are being rude. Just relax, calm down, it is just in your head. It is exhausting. \n\n\nI have expressed my distress and frustration with them quite a bit, but I only get anger and annoyance back. My mom did finally buy me ear plugs that I am allowed to wear at church because she was embarrassed that I would not stop plugging my ears. Otherwise, they continue to joke about how I act around trigger sounds and be angry with me over things I cannot really control. Zero attempts on their part for accommodation, empathy, or any kind of help, and I have learned to stop asking.\n\n\nA couple of days ago, though, my dad (a family doctor) asked me out of the blue about when I hear eating noises, how do I feel? Do I feel stress, anxiety, distress, anger? I said yes on all counts. I have told them that before, but whatever. He went on to say that he had a patient come in complaining of this, and that it was causing him a lot of problems with his family and it was extremely upsetting for him. My dad, being the good doctor that he is, went on to research it. One of his residents did some in depth research herself. Some pharmacists weighed in. My dad told me \u201cThere is a name for that you know,\u201d and I said \u201cYeah, misophonia.\u201d I have told them that before. The guy got prescribed antidepressants as apparently the unofficial research team heard that it could help. The patient also is in some kind of therapy now.\n\n\nDamn, Dad. Maybe it is not just me. Maybe I could benefit from therapy, do you think so now? Do you believe me now? I told him, I knew it was not just me.\n\n\nMy mom of course had to weigh in after I said that. \u201cWell not just me either! Oh but do not worry, it gets better as you get older. You are fine.\u201d Thanks, mom. Excellent input, awesome. Fuck. She does not have misophonia, or else she would have killed my dad by now, or maybe she would be a little more aware of her CONSTANT trigger noises. She says to me often that \u201ceveryone finds eating noises a little annoying.\u201d No, Mom, I do not find them annoying, I want to physically hurt someone when I hear them. Finding noises a little annoying does not mean you have misophonia, either.\n\n\nBut maybe it is a step. My dad will undoubtedly keep seeing this patient and see him either struggle or improve. Hopefully he will take me more seriously as time goes on.", "My daughter may have misophonia; looking for ways to help and support her. This is my first time posting. I am trying to be careful of triggers and marking what I can. I am sorry if this is not the right place to post, but it seemed like a good place to get started.\n\nMy daughter recently turned 13. She is always had some noises that bugged her, but over the last few months, it is ramped up for certain sounds (&gt;!metal utensils on plates, chewing!&lt;) . She gets visibly upset, covers her ears, etc. I feel bad for her and I know she feels bad for having this reaction to common sounds. I do not think she is faking it. I am taking her to see an ENT next month on the advice of her doctor, I guess to rule out any physical issues, and then we will see what happens.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how to help or support her in the interim. I have bought wooden eating utensils, and she uses plastic ones a lot. She wears headphones a lot (not just for this), and I generally let her wear them during meals, or let her eat in another room, etc. I try to warn her if I am going to make a noise that will bother her, if I can.\n\nI have been looking for non-ceramic plates that are dishwasher safe, things like that, if anyone can recommend some. I know I cannot replace everything in my kitchen, but I am willing to make some changes where it is possible. Honestly you are doing a lot more than many parents\n\nI think being understanding and working together to minimize triggers is an amazing step! Thanks. I feel bad for her. I mean, as annoying as it is for us, it must be worse for her. I can not snack while we watch a movie; she cannot turn off her sound receptors. And as I said, I do not think she is exaggerating (or is that good of an actress). I have been trying to read up a bit, and I know this is not something that can be treated with meds, so we will have to figure out something else. \n\nJust a quick skim of this subreddit makes me feel bad for those people who are not believed, or when other people purposely make sounds to bother them. Honestly it sucks all around, like you said. I feel lucky my husband is understanding and i cover my ears if he wants to eat chips.\n\nHe doesnt get mad at me for covering my ears, i dont stop him from eating what he wants. Its definitely not ideal but the way i see it is that there are worse diseases out there. And i feel incredibly lucky that he understands and i can have a normal life for the most part. \n\nI feel awful for those people that dont have a good support group around them. And that is why we are here to help :) Thank you for what you are doing for your kiddo, from somebody who used to be a teenager who struggled A LOT. I wish my mom had cared as much as you do. She thought it was funny to make my trigger noises. Especially in the car. \n\nI do not have any suggestions, because I think what you are doing is perfect. I just wanted to say thanks. I am glad her experience is going to be better than mine was. I am so sorry that your mom did that. I have not even looked at this subreddit very much, but I have seen so many stories like that, and I think it is terrible. \n\nYou sound like you are doing well, despite all that, so good for you. I hope you do have some support now, and best of luck. Thank you. Some days are easier than others. \n\nI did think of one thing that might be helpful. At work (the biggest source of trigger sounds right now) I wear earbuds with pink noise going, and the noise cancellation turned off. It masks the bad sounds, but I can still hold a conversation. \n\nThere are different \u201ccolors\u201d of sound; white noise is the most common one that people know. I have spent hours getting a playlist together of the ones that work best for me. My go to noises are typically pink or brown. \n\nThis literally has saved my job. I want a mother like you are. To me it seems like you are doing already enough. You do not force her to not wear headphones while eating together nor do you force her to eat with others. \n\nI would tell you to not expose her to these sounds, because it will only get worse. Misophonia's ending may sound like \"phobia\", but it is not a phobia. Misophonia can cause phobic behaviours like being afraid of meeting with people, but the root of the problem is not a phobia, it is a neurological disorder creating pain and unwanted harmful emotions when exposed to certain sounds. **So do not try nothing like exposure therapy, it will only mess her up even more.** But you are already doing that, so all I can say to that is that you are doing a good job. \n\nI would also like to mention that there is a high chance for your daughter to try avoiding school in the future, even jobs when adult. I have no idea how to deal with this myself, but **please, never tell your daughter to just get over it.** She will not be able to \"just get over it\". She will be left feeling lonely, misunderstood and that she is not treated justly. Misophonia can get so extreme she might start hurting herself or commit suicide, but I believe not forcing her to hear trigger sounds is the key. Just forget about all the nonsense about social standarts like \"family has to eat together and talk\" and such. I think every reasonable human can agree that social standarts cannot be put above someone is suffering. \n\nI would like to explain what misophonia feels like: For people suffering from misophonia, trigger sounds produce feelings similar to nails on chalkboard, meaning that 99% of the population agrees that such sound is terrible to experience and usually people agree that they do not want to hear it. Now imagine yourself having to hear sounds that produce the feeling most humans experience when hearing nails on chalkboard every single day. It is highly probable such sounds can turn someone insane and it will not be their fault. \n\nWhen it comes to getting professional help: Unfortunately misophonia is not in DSM-5 (a book that psychiatrists use), so there is no simple way to diagnose your daughter. Therefore there is probably no way she could get some document that would state she is partially disabled or something if it gets too extreme. If I had the power I would change it, because I myself know what terrible struggle we have to deal with. There are some reasearches that suggest misophonia is some for of OCD, but nothing formal yet. researches also suggest that CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) can help.\n\nOne thing that might help your daughter a lot is to not assume she can wear headphones 24/7. Headphones or earbuds can start feeling very achy after too much use, therefore try giving your daughter some time during the day when she is allowed to not wear headphones and can enjoy silence. If she is forced to wear headphones all day, she will deffinitely become tired, she will experience fatigue and she will not be able to function properly at school and later at work. I experience such fatigue myself, because I am forced to wear headphones most of the time. \n\nSo have a talk with your daughter and discuss stuff like that you will tell her when you are about to do stuff that produces trigger sounds, but she will in turn get time when she can relax without headphones on. Talk about it with other members of the family (if there are any) to not trigger her and also tell her when they are about to do something triggering for her. **Also all of you have to use common sense and not abuse it, not you, not your daughter, not anyone.** Be compassionate and your daughter has to be compassionate to rest of the family that you want to eat and not make excuses that she want to just not wear headphones at all. As I said, just common sense and compassion. \n\nLastly give yourself some credit. I think you are a great mom for being concerned about your daughter's problems and do not just brush it off as her being too sensitive or something. I personally find replacing dishes as something too extreme, since those problems could be dealt with by not spending money on more stuff. I understand you did it because you care about your daughter's sanity, but as I said it can be done by just blocking sounds and giving her time to rest from that all. \n\nAgain I think you are doing a great fucking job and are above most of parents. Thanks. I will definitely keep this in mind, and let her know. Right now it is manageable partly because we are at home. She also says that in a place like a restaurant, where it is noisier, the sounds do not bother her so much. I guess she cannot pick them out so much. Also, the sounds seem to be related to eating, and that is fairly easy to manage -- we can eat when she is not around, or use headphones, or things like that.\n\nI am a little concerned about school in the fall, but one thing at a time. Hey good luck! I hope it all goes well for you both. Thanks for all this information. No, I had no plans to do any kind of exposure therapy, because you are right, it is not a fear, it is a reaction to sound. \n\nShe does not wear headphones all the time, but she does wear them a lot because she watches a lot of anime shows on her phone, or listens to music. Earbuds have never been great for her, they never seem to fit, even when we try the different sized covers. I do not want her wearing them all the time, but if she needs to, I do not mind.\n\nAs for the dishes, I was going to get new ones anyway, and I found some online that I hope will help. I feel like for anyone, home should be a safe place to get away from stuff like this. So I do not mind getting in dishes or utensils or whatever will help her. Also, we are going on vacation in a couple of weeks so we can bring these with us and keep them for trips, etc., if we do not like them for regular use.\n\nThanks again for all the advice. try and get a 504 for her school life! it is really helped me, i can wear earplugs in class, and if necessary can wear my noise canceling headphones. i have a pass i can use to go to the social workers office if there are too many trigger sounds and i cannot sit in class anymore. my parents have been great at helping me through misophonia, but school is and will always be my biggest source of trigger sounds. i cannot tell everyone to stop eating, so i work around it. Thanks :) Thanks, I will keep that in mind. I do not know that we will need that, but we will see. I am not sure kids can eat in their classes at her school, not at this level. Let her eat alone.\n\nDo not eat when she is around.\n\nDo not lick your fingers when you turn the page.\n\nDo not fidget around her. Thanks. I do not have any advice that someone else has not said yet but I wanted to stop here to let you know that it is really nice to know that there are parents who are understanding and try to do their best to help with misophonia because for what I read in here a lot of us never got that from our parents or any family member.\n\nMost of the times people do not understand the struggle we live in and how horrible is to feel the way we feel just for some specific sounds and not being able to control it.\n\nYour daughter is very lucky to have you and I really hope you guys found a way to manage this situation. I think the most important part is to know about it and try yo make some changes to help the situations which you are obviously doing. Thank you. I have to say, if it was not for my son, we might know about it yet. He researched and realized that her actions matched up with misophonia. Whether she has that or not, and I know it may not be officially diagnosed, she definitely seems to fit the description, so I am going to proceed as if she does. \n\nI will not say it is not a little frustrating on my end occasionally, but as you said -- I can imagine it is difficult, scary, frustrating, embarrassing, etc., to have these reactions you cannot control. Especially, in her case, to such common, every day sounds.\n\nThat is one of the reasons I want to see what we can do about this. I figure the sooner she learns some coping strategies, the better off we will be. You are a good mom. Thank you. My daughter has been after me to let you know that she is been trying brown noise the last couple of nights at dinner and says it is a huge help. She can hear us when we speak up and the brown noise covers the chewing sounds. So thanks! That makes me SO happy!!! I hope she continues to do well!", "when someone thinks that chewing sounds are good asmr ", "Venting Not sure if anyone is going to read this but if you are, then I have a severe case of Misophonia. When your Misophonia is severe, then that means when you hear your triggers you often react with rage, anger, and other things. It is hard for me and although I do not get \\*those\\* thoughts I always wish that I never had this disorder. Everyone in my family except for my sister always chew loudly. My dad is the worst of all. His chewing is so bad that I would have to go up upstairs, which results in me missing instructional learning. My mom lip smacks WAYYYY TOO MUCH. Sips drink? \\*smack\\*. Eating? \\*smack smack smack\\*. And the worst part is when she talks with her mouth full. When she does that that is when I get really angry too point that I would grab my headphones and blast music at a high volume. Oh and I forgot to mention, she talks so loud, so when she talks with her mouth full you can hear it from the basement, your room, pretty much anywhere. My mom claims that she lip smacks because \"there is something wrong with her left tooth/teeth\". The part that I get mad about is every time I try zooming (for school) that is when everyone want to eat, ESPECIALLY when my break is almost over. I tried asking my mom If I can zoom somewhere else, but of course her entitled ass said no. The thing is that last school year back in Spring, I was doing so much better because I was in the living room, but because of gRaDeS I got put into the kitchen, the place I was avoiding. My mom would not even let me zoom in my room because it was really messy, but no one even cares about your room! They only care about you getting their work done. So ever since I have been in the kitchen, this caused me to get some zeros. Once my mom lip smacked LOUDLY on purpose because she thinks it is \"funny\" because teehee mocking someone is disorder is SOOOOO FUNNNY! XDXD. When someone would start eating I would immediately cover my ears, and then rage would fill me because I would think of the person eating doing this on purpose, and why they did not eat at the beginning of my break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk ending the bad part, and let us start with the good part. I told my dad that I did not like chewing, so now every time I was around he would take his food with him and go downstairs into the basement. What a great dad! Since me getting triggered from chewing was \"annoying\" my mom, she set up my desk for me, and put in as far as possible from the table (FYI the kitchen and the family room are connected)! A few days ago when my dad and mom were eating, I could not hear anything! I am surprised I could not hear my dad's chewing, since he chews REALLY loud. Finally, less of my triggers being triggered. That is awesome, I am glad they are taking you into consideration in some aspects. Try to remember to say thanks when they do that, it may seem unnecessary considering you are only being treated with respect, but it goes a long way in receiving more help when you need it. Hi I read it. My mom mocked me on purpose too. I had to take my plate and go to my room. I am sorry they do not allow you to be in a different room. I hope you can speak to them again. About the room thing, I have to clean up my room (which is really messy) and the worst part is that I keep getting more and more schoolwork which holds up me getting my room cleaned. Yeah, I thanked them so much. I am glad that my family members are treating me with respect, especially my dad. Hopefully I will find more methods that prevent me from getting triggered from my triggers. I wonder if you could not ask your mom to let you study in your room for just one week and show her that your grades would improve? I am envious. My parents do not give a fuck about my misophonia and in addition to mocking me, my mom then decided that she also had misophonia because she found my baby brother\u2019s whining \u201cannoying\u201d because finding something annoying and fantasizing about stabbing the people who trigger you are now on the same level. But all shit aside, good for you. People who laugh at the genuine pain of misophonia baffle me. Just like the ones who act like it is not serious/we can turn it off and on, they can all simply f\\*ck off. Really glad to hear that someone is family member is actually respecting it properly, it feels so rare. Ah, the mocking. I remember eating with friends and saying: Something is wrong with me, I do not know why chewing sounds trigger me so much. Yeah. That was not a good idea. They would start smacking their lips on purpose. Maybe I was not clear enough though.", "Co-worker noises I have not actually been diagnosed with misophonia, but there are some noises that really make me feel annoyed/stressed.  I recently started a new job, and I think it is at least not as bad as my last job, where I had a cubicle right in front of someone who would crunch ice throughout the day every day (which was very irritating, and I often wore headphones with some kind of white noise to drown it out).\n\nCurrently though, I sit near someone who likes to occasionally take a deep breath and exhale loudly.  Also, sometimes toward the end of the work day, he will open a snack wrapper and I can hear him chewing on a snack which can be at least mildly irritating. Why cannot you work from home? The simple answer is that not all jobs allow working from home..  I do not think I would want to limit myself to only jobs where I can work from home.\n\nThe longer answer: Although I am a software engineer (where I certainly could work from home depending on the job/team), it still requires collaboration and interaction with other developers, and it is a lot easier to do when you are in close proximity with your teammates.  Earlier this year, I actually had started a software job where I was working from home (mainly due to covid), and I think due in part to being a new guy and them not seeing me every day, I was not given much to do, and I was bored.  I was nervous about possibly being seen as not getting much done. Just wanted to say one thing - you led with the fact that you have not been formally diagnosed and I wanted to point something out. Misophonia is self diagnosing, and you do not need a medical professional to officially diagnose you. I have personally gaslight myself over this for years and wanted to make sure the same is not happening to you. If you say you have misophonia, then you have misophonia. Nobody can tell you your struggles are not real or validated. \nAlso, noise cancelling headphones work wonders. When you cannot wear them, try focusing on something else like deep breathing or counting backwards or something. Work alone", "Lockdown vent - running water, clipping nail, gargling, fizzy drink sipping Curious to see if anyone else shares these triggers.\n\nMy housemate does a lot of stuff, I feel bad for feeling like this stuff is wrong, and trying to moderate it, and it frustrates me that this relatively normal stuff winds me up. I feel controlling or insane.\n\nBathroom sounds have always hit me the hardest. Hearing shower water hit the bottom of the bathtub, especially when showers are long (20+ mins), drives me up the wall, waiting for relief for it to end, the disbelief that a shower could possibly take that long! \nGargling mouthwash, a low rumble with mouth open, possibly ended with an almost choking sound.\nClipping nails directly into the toilet. \n\nOne other random one is opening of a fizzy drink can that can be so SO loud. Then the inane sipping (taking multiple little sips back to back) and almost guaranteed burps. Grrrr.\n\nI would love to learn tips on how to let go of being consumed by wanting to control how another person does something, ie not taking long showers, or lots of little sips from a can. I want to control that stuff but other human beings are free to live how they want to, and I need to learn how to let it be. Just think, this is not forever.\n\nOne day, maybe soon; you will have your own place where none of this shit happens.\n\nSomething to look forward to :) Definitely positive aspirations for future living! A detached house of my own is the dream... Same here! \n\nEven now as I type my neighbour has the same weird faint music on that they play 24/7, just audible enough to hear just audible enough to make me think I am going nuts.\n\nWhat if I do not want to listen to music night and day?\n\nIn future we will not have these problems :) clipping nails makes me fucking insane it makes my teeth hurt almost", "i cant do this anymore i hate puppies so much. their whining, scratching, peeing and shitting everywhere, biting...\n\nthis is the 2nd time in less than a year that my mother got a puppy to make her happy with 0 regard to how it affects me. i cant stand it anymore. if that damn dog whines one more time i am going to fucking lose it. \n\ni know this is so irrational but i dont think ive ever been triggered by a sound to the point where im just screaming for it to stop. my voice is literally hoarse. nothing drowns it out i can always hear it, even when she isnt actively whining its like my mind cant stop torturing me and has to replay the sound over and over and over again.\n\ni punched the wall this morning and now my hand hurts :( (not broken just sore) i just need it to stop so badly. on another note, i found out about miso back in 2018 and told my mom i thought i had it and she literally laughed at me. a week ago she told me she thought i had miso. she does this shit all the time which is annoying as fuckkkk Move out? \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc41 i cant Oh it does sound so horrible, everyone have their diffrent triggers and this is so valid! i am sending you strength! and hope! Sorry :( Hugs. I relate to this pretty bad. My mom gets animals to make her happy, which is bad on its own (atleast she takes good care of them). But I DESPISE dogs, everything they do, every movement. What helped for me is suggesting fostering dogs, they come at your house for a week which makes you mother happy and they will be gone which makes you happy. Considering there are not many dogs who need that there will not be too many or too often one in your house.\nI hope I could help and im sorry if I could not. Whining is one of my biggest rage triggers. \n\nThere are some breeds that rarely whine. Labrador retrievers whine constantly, I can tell you that. \n\nI trained my child not to whine by pretending I could not understand her when she said things in a whiny voice. \n\nAnd she taught me not to use an angry or annoyed voice because she found that upsetting and called it out every time. In our family, teaching of emotional mindfulness went both ways. Is it age or financial? age mostly. it also doesnt make a lot of sense for me to move out rn. i finish high school in december so i just got to wait about 7/8 months age mostly. it also doesnt make a lot of sense for me to move out rn. i finish high school in december so i just got to wait about 7/8 months Well keep the dog thing in mind as you go through these next 7/8 months and bust your ass at work to make enough to move out asap. Find a roommate now, make a legit plan and be ready to go. Save every bit you can, weigh the need for spending anything against how that dog makes you feel or how little your mom cares about your misophonia. \nDont have a job yet? Get one, get one like your life depends on it, cause it sounds like your sanity does (no judgment, I am the same damn way!!) \n\nGood luck thank you! i am actually moving to my dads though so luckily my situation isnt as dire. good luck to you :-)", "Seeking treatment So I have been sensitive to the sound of knocking, chewing, sniffing and shouting for the past few years and its gotten to the point where I cannot even sit in my house without stressing out every second about the next incoming noise. However, I am fortunate to have parents who took my experience seriously when I told them about it. They agreed to arrange a doctor's appointment to try and identify possible treatments to my condition. \n\nBased on what you all have experienced, would seeking any treatment be effective or helpful at all? Or should I try and solve it on my own? I do not have misophonia, but my daughter does. So first, I am so glad your parents are taking this seriously.\n\nMy daughter is 13, and here is what we did. First, I contacted her pediatrician and explained the situation, and they recommended we see an ENT. We did, and she took it all seriously, did an audiology test, etc., and she concluded it was misophonia, and gave us a diagnosis of hyperacusis. She did that partly because misophonia is not an official diagnosis, and having a diagnosis of hyperacusis allowed me to speak with the guidance counselor and draw up an accommodation plan for my daughter at school.\n\nShe then sent us back to the pediatrician with the recommendation to find a therapist.\n\nWe did find one, and my daughter's been working with her for about a month, and I think there is been some improvement on some fronts, but I do not think we will find a \"cure.\" The therapist is taking a cognitive behavioral therapy approach.\n\nMisophonia appears to have some connection to anxiety and/or stress. I do not know if you have any anxiety issues, but if you do, it is worth telling your doctor. I think any information they can get is helpful. You could also target a search for a therapist by finding one who specializes in anxiety, as I do not think there are many who specialize in misophonia.\n\nMy daughter is mostly triggered by eating and meal-related sounds, so before we had the therapist, I tried to make a couple of changes. First, I purchased wheat straw bowls, plates and utensils from Amazon to get rid of the noises the usual metal utensils make. I could not replace everything, but this was a start. I have also tried to get a some rubber-covered or -tipped cooking utensils, like whisks or spoons, to reduce the noises while cooking.\n\nThe other thing that really helps her is she wears noise-canceling headphones during meals and listens to brown noise. She says that works better to drown the trigger sounds than white noise, and it also lets us have fairly normal conversations, we just need to raise our voices a bit when speaking. There is a rainbow of noise \"colors,\" so perhaps a different one might work better for you, and you can experiment.\n\nGood luck! Thank you for the advice! Best wishes for your daughter. Thank you and I hope you get some relief. Your daughter is so lucky to have a parent like you!", "Misophonia can get better Last year, well last normal year was the worst year for my misophonia but I have noticed in the most recent months that it has gotten significantly better and some triggers have almost completely gone away. So if you feel really bad or feel there is no hope that you can get better just know there is a chance. I was lucky enough to get better I hope you are too. I am really glad you got some relief :) Cutting out caffeine really helped mine! Has there been anything about your daily life that is changed? more sleep, exercise, therapy or anything else? It Might help some other people out dang, really? I found sleeping more can help with the after effects, does cutting coffee reduce the after effects or the actual sounds? For me it did both. I have been totally caffeine-free for over a year now and I find the triggers wayyy less frequent, and when they do happen, less intense. I am talking all caffeine - even a cup of black tea will send my misophonia roaring back for the day! Same! I think being less stressed in general is a huge factor. Therapy helps a lot. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d I am glad that even one person has got better. You have given me hope. Any tips? Exposure to the trigger?", "Misophonia or something else? So, first off here is some backstory. Before I was 13, I would never hear any of the trigger sounds that I do now. But then all of a sudden I started hearing people breathe, smack their lips when talking, as well as noticing when people licked their lips.\n\nRight now, I am 19 years old and have dealt with it ever since. The thing is l do not have the same type of reactions as other people with this disorder. Instead, I just become annoyed or depressed and wish that it would go back to being a normal background sound that I would never notice (like before I was 13) and then other times I just randomly think in my head that I should actively listen to these sounds, and after that, I cannot stop listening for them.\n\nbut I wonder if I can completely get rid of the noise so that it becomes a background sound that I would otherwise not notice like therapy or something. And I literally notice every trigger sound no matter how loud or quiet it is from every single person I come across. Also for some reason I am able to tune out breathe sounds unless it involves laughing as well as when I play video games I keep listening for when the characters breathe instead of just listening to them talk. All in all it drives me crazy and I wish I could just live normally without having to hear trivial background noise.\n\n  I was wondering if this was misophonia or something different like sensory processing disorder. This is from google when you search for 'misophonia'\n\n\"**Misophonia** is a disorder in which certain sounds trigger emotional or physiological  responses that some might perceive as unreasonable given the circumstance. Those who have **misophonia** might describe it as when a sound \u201cdrives you crazy.\u201d Their reactions can range from anger and  annoyance to panic and the need to flee.\"   \n\n\nTo me, it does not sound like you have misophonia unless you are leaving out extreme negative reactions/emotions that you feel. If everything you said is accurate, I would say it is something else.   \n\n\nWhen you say you become annoyed, why? Do you not know why, or do you become annoyed because you just want the sound to stop because it is so constant/loud/etc?  \n\n\nFrom my own experience, I feel like people with misophonia do not know why they have the triggers they have. I personally go straight from being fine (before I hear the sound) to absolutely enraged, distressed, in tears or even su\\*\\*\\*\\*al in mere seconds. Yeah my reactions are not that extreme, but what annoys me about these sounds is that they are everyday sounds that for some reason I hear everytime while others do not. Lip smacking annoys me because I keep hearing it but I wish I could be able to tune it out like other people. And then I fixate on other sounds and cannot stop listening for them. It most likely could be another problem like you said but I was not too sure at first. Not all people with misophonia have extreme reactions, but it is more common I think. If the reason they upset you is because you can hear the and notice them while others can', then I would not blame misophonia. I hope you can solve your problem. :) I will most likely talk to a doctor about it pretty soon. Thanks for your help", "for the love of god, STOP WHISTLING Why do people feel the need to whistle in public places, or anywhere at all?? The tune is hardly ever recognizable, just a string of off-key nonsense. They KNOW they are not being discreet. they know that literally everybody around them can hear them and STILL choose to do it. they have no regard for anybody else's peace of mind. Oh, you are trying to peacefully run errands that you would much rather NOT be doing? allow me to further PLAGUE your experience by WHISTLING in the same space as you, where you will have to deal with it either until I stop, or until you leave. literally, who thinks like that?! I can not tell you how many times I have been in this situation and wanted to just explode. It is selfish. Stop it. Stop whistling. Have some respect. God whistlers are the fucking worst I dont care how 'good' you think you are at it if you want to be a bird, go eat some worms. That sound gets me punch face mad lol. SERIOUSLY. my roommate does it all the time and I am like, god, I am not even safe in my own home anymore Whistlers are the bane of my existence, I would lose my shit if I had to live with one. I am sorry you have to tolerate such a mindless individual. This is probably my worst trigger. \n\nI start talking to myself and covering my ears and try to get out of the situation/space as quickly as possible. \n\nI sometimes ask the person to stop. ( I preface my request for them to stop with the acknowledgement that it is my problem and not theirs, but would they please just stop...)  \nThat does not always go too well. \n\nI wish they knew how hard it is for some people to hear that. Ugh. 10000000% my most severe trigger. 0 - blood thirsty rage in .01 seconds guaranteed. The one I cannot stand above and beyond all others is the warbly whistle. I always hear these whistlers in the grocery store!!!! Whistling is one of my triggers too. I feel ya. The girlfriend of the guy who lives directly across from me (I live in an apartment complex) every day, without fail, whistles the same off-key shitty tune as she loudly bangs on his door to be let in.\n\nThe other day she did the whistle and knock EIGHT. TIMES. EIGHT FUCKING TIMES. WITHIN THE SPAN OF 7 HOURS.\n\nAS I WAS TRYING TO STUDY FOR AN EXAM.\n\nGod. I usually preface my request with \"I have severe migraines that come on rapidly and cause horrible nausea- and whistling is the biggest trigger\". \n\nIf people think you are going to throw up and/or be in horrible pain- they often stop immediately and get away from you. \n\nI am not even sorry about lying. You know they do not give two shits about the ACTUAL pain they are causing and most would not stop even If they knew and understood the truth. Why do so many people whistle in the grocery store???? Beats me! Ever since I was little I have heard them whistling in the grocery store. Boggles the mind! Old men trying to be \"chipper\" and who are usually ultra-fake bastards. You nailed it! \ud83d\ude03 You would hate my job. I work at a vape store so it is just me here by myself majority of the time unless the manager comes by. Anyways, the walls are super thin. A stupid Herbal Life \u201cnutritional\u201d shop just opened up a couple of months ago and the \u201cowner\u201d constantly whistles. It is EAR PIERCING!!! I have actually walked over there before and asked him if he could stop and he just brushed me off so fast. So I spoke with my manager about it who is really understanding of my misophonia and even she, who does not suffer from misophonia, thinks it is outrageous how loud he whistles. Thank god she lets me bring my noise cancelling headphones. It was pure torture working here without them. Sometimes, even with my music at a decent volume, I can STILL HEAR HIM WHISTLE!!! I am currently trying to find a job because of this and other reasons. There never a day he does not whistle. So trust me, I completely understand how you feel!! Ex-roomate did this... We also work for the same company... So it was basically 24/7 until she heard from like a 5th party that I once complained about it (a lot of people found her annoying so it just came up somewhere somehow I do not remember). She ended up being super offended that her lovely banshee  screeching was not appreciated and did not talk to me for a week. But at least she stopped \ud83e\udd10  I am six months late but I just wanted to say 'if you want to be a bird, go eat some worms' part was the best thing I have read all week.", "im ruining my relationship with my father So, I have misophonia, and these past few days have been really tough. Just in general my anxiety levels have been high, and everything makes me very jumpy. \n\nMy dad (who chews so fucking loud) does not fully get that I cant just \"ignore it\". For me, I HAVE to tell him he is chewing loud, yes ik its rude to tell people that but idgaf. He is chewing loud, so if he wants me to eat with him at the table, he needs to close his fucking mouth. Yesterday I tried to explain to him and my mom that it is literally neurological, I cannot fucking control it. I am done eating next to him, every time I try I end up pissing him off, and he tells me to stop telling him. Idk if any of you feel the same way, like if you hear someone chewing loud you have to speak up. \n\nI have had many fights with my family over this shit. Today, I was eating and my dad said \"you do not need to tell me that every time\" and I said \"I actually do tho\" and he fucking told me \"you are not mental, it is not something you have to do.\" He will not let me eat in my room because of mice, so where tf do I go to eat.  I have tried to use other disorders that he would understand a little better to explain, like OCD or synesthesia, but he tells me it is not the same. My mom says that if it is neurological she wants to take me to a neurologist sometime, but for now I cannot tell them to stop eating loud.\n\nI think they think it is something I can just get over. I get it, I should not tell them they are chewing loud because it is rude. But I literally HAVE to, unless they want me to storm off and avoid them completely. I tried to tell them it is not my fault I have it, even if it is \"rare\". It is my fault I complain about how they eat, but I cant stop.\n\nThis rant is all over the place, sorry about that. I feel you. All I can say is that life and your relationship with your parents will improve dramatically when you can move out. Even more when you can be more selective about your social circle and whatnot. Being around understanding people is a major help. Being around people who tell you to shut up and ignore it feels like you are being poisoned. I have sent links to my mom about this. She is on my side, my dad will literally on purpose crunch down on a chip and tell me I am ok.", "Found a dog with misophonia ", " Anyone else experience this? So when it comes to talking with mouth full, I do not have a severe reaction when my dad does it, only when he chews loudly. However, when it comes to my mom I get a severe reaction and I immediately find something to get rid of her talking, such as headphones. (btw your reaction does not have to be severe, it could be mild) Yes, I am that exact same way. My dads eating literally never bothers me, but my mom's chewing is unbearable. Currently missing out on family time because of it :( I sometimes feel this way, too. Mostly because she is the loudest. Same. My dad is the only person I can sit down and have dinner with for some reason. Anyone else would be unfathomable and I would never dare to for the sake of my sanity.", "Anyone else have a love/hate relationship with Thanksgiving?? I LOVE Thanksgiving so much. Mostly because of the food but I also just love getting together with my family and having dinner together. Well this year is my first thanksgiving since my Misophonia has developed. I have been looking forward to Thanksgiving but at the same time I have been dreading dinner because my family do not know about my Misophonia. Well the people I live with do (my sister even though she does not believe it is a real thing, my dad, my mom, my step dad, and the rest of my siblings) but the rest of my family like my aunt, uncle, and grandparents do not know and if I told them they would probably say something like \u201cit is fake\u201d or something like that. I am hiding in the bathroom right now because it is beginning to become to much for me to handle. I feel so bad because (idk how normal this is) normally when I hear a trigger noise I get really withdrawn so this whole time I have been just sitting there trying to focus on not bursting into tears or walking out and not paying attention to the conversation. Anyways I needed somewhere to rant. Thanks. Oh also I am genuinely curious, does anyone else feel this way about Thanksgiving? Ok thanks. I was worried too, how was your dinner? I presume that you are done by now. Yeah we finished and after dessert it was not that bad except for a few things. How was yours? It was okay. I was surprised to see that I was hardly triggered, unlike normal meals. I made little place cards for us (6 people), and everyone assumed I was being fancy. Really, I was just placing the loudest and grossest chewers further from me. We all sit together, no kids and adults table, and adults tend to be louder, so I just had them on one side and us kids on the other. It worked well and I did not even have to stick my finger in my ear. I am glad you said that your meal went okay, and if you need to rant I will be here to listen. Aw thanks!! I am glad that your dinner was not that bad! Same too! The food on Thanksgiving is good but when it comes to my Misophonia, it turns into torture.", "Therapy My mum found a therapist and I talked to her today and the first thing she said was exposure therapy, my mum does not believe me when I say that makes it worse and I am to shy to speak up to Kel, has anyone been in a similar situation or knows what I should do, even if you post a reply saying that exposure therapy did not work I will show mum.  Check out this older post &amp; comments:\n\n\n\nI have heard some here on this subreddit have had amazing progress with exposure therapy, personally I would NEVER do it ever. I personally think it is too risky &amp; could even exacerbate misophonia reactions if it did not work.\n\nI would highly suggest you look up posts on this before you make a decision, there are plenty. But i would advise to search on google (ie exposure misophonia subreddit); because the reddit search engine is pure shit.\nGood luck! Hey friend, I am glad you are able to seek out a therapist, but you are 100% correct: exposure therapy exacerbates misophonia. I have misophonia and was exposed to my trigger sound daily at my last job for 3 months straight and let me tell you it made my misophonia SO MUCH worse. Even worse is I tried telling my boss and HR and they ignored me and did nothing about it. \n\nI started having a mental breakdown being constantly exposed to my trigger noise daily, I became more sensitive to the sound and similar sounds, and became extremely depressed and anxious to the point I had to seek out a therapist myself. Because of that experience, my misophonia has worsened whereas before I was able to manage it, even though I left that job.\n\nI hope you can convince your mom and therapist that exposure therapy would only be detrimental to you. Good luck friend! I got worse with exposure therapy. In the US they call it desensitization therapy but it is the same thing. I did not want to do it but my parents forced me. My therapist began chewing gum during our sessions. He started out just holding the gum in his mouth and every week he added more and more chewing. He was a very nice and well-meaning person, and, in his defense, very little was known about Misophonia back then, so I understand why he thought the same therapy used for treating phobias might work. Unfortunately, not only did it NOT work, I actually have PTSD to this day because of it. It was so painful to be trapped in the sessions that I contemplated suicide. I suppose someone out there might find it worth trying, but I would not recommend it. Exposure therapy most likely will not work, it has an unfortunately low success rate. I tried to do a DIY exposure sessions at home and it just amplified everything, I definitely do not recommend This infuriates me. Your therapist clearly does not know shit about misophonia, so do not even think about following whatever he or she says because it will worsen your condition. I know this by experience.\n\nThis is like saying you are not happy and some random person being like \"you should get out of your comfort zone\". It is f*cling ridiculous. This made me so uncomfortable I wanted to downvote Sounds like actual torture to me, mate.  I never understood exposure therapy. That is literally what oir whole lives have been. If it had been OK we would not be needing/wanting therapy. I dont know why eery place says 'exposure terapy' as number 1.  Exposure is what cause misophonia. If you were not exposed so much in the first place, the misophonia would not happen, simple as that. I am sorry. That was not my intention. How can I edit it, so it is less offensive? Nooo I meant I was uncomfortable for you. Gum chewing is instant boiling rage for me and the idea of sitting in a room with someone chewing gum makes me sweat. I see you have PTSD from that experience and I feel for you. I would too. Sounds like torture I know it is like getting somone who is allergic to nuts to eat them constantly We have been doing exposure therapy our whole lives!! \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02 Misophonia has actually been referred to as an \u201callergy to sound,\u201d so that is a very acute metaphor! I had a therapist a few years ago who tried exposer therapy for me. I hated it and had \u201chomework\u201d to slowly listen to more and more sounds louder and louder. My therapist was nice, I do not blame her in any way bc 1) no one can fully understand misophonia without having it, at least that is what I have decided over the years of having it, 2) she was just doing what I am sure she researched as an option for treatment. Yeah she could have looked into it more and how it isnt helpful really with misophonia but I am just not mad at her bc she was truly nice and I do think she wanted to help. But yeah I did not enjoy it obviously. I told my mom at one point I wanted to stop and she said that therapy works if you do it long term or something along those lines. Also not mad at my mom bc I can see where she is coming from considering she had therapy (for a different reason) as a teen and early adult I believe. I later said that it had worked enough and helped so that I could be done with it all. Yeah it did not help but I was able to quite so yeah. Sessions and \u201chomework\u201d was stressful af and yeah they are trigger sounds for a reason, not fun to listen to. I am the last few months I have gotten another therapist to help with my misophonia and some depression I developed over the past year. She is completely different. She has actually given me ways to deal with my emotions and calm myself when I am triggered or anxious bc of hearing a sound, and she was visibly shocked when I told her my previous therapist had not even helped me with ways to cope with the emotions when exposed to sounds lol. But yeah she is awesome and she is definitely trying her hardest and doing a great job at it. Ofc my misophonia is not cured but I have learned about different coping mechanisms and treatments to try. (One is called Safe and Sound Protocol, check it out if you are interested). My point is, there is never one treatment for something. And some treatments just do not work at all especially with new disorders like misophonia where researchers and doctors are still figuring it out. There is nothing wrong with finding the right therapist for you like I did. I hope this helps and you get real treatment and support soon &lt;3 I found intentional exposure cruel and heightened my anxiety. Seek a therapist who specializes in anxiety. Oh sorry - I read your comment wrong. Yes, it was excruciatingly painful, thus the PTSD. It was many years ago, but it seems like yesterday. Back then, there was not a name for this disorder, and everyone (including me) thought I was crazy. Some things have changed and some have not. \ud83d\ude1e Sorry mate. \ud83d\ude1e (  Most scientific articles and misophonia researchers agree that exposure therapy not only does not work for misophonia, but can actually make it worse. Misophonia is not a phobia per se and sufferers are exposed to sounds all the time.\n\nI would try to find articles that support this argument and show them to your mum and the therapist.  Check out ( and ( for reliable research and treatment options. Good luck!!! Definitely speak up. Exposure therapy has been scientifically shown to useful for dealing with phobias... but misophonia is not a phobia, although they may seem to have similarities. \n\nI recall reading some legit research article a few years ago that did conclude exposure therapy was harmful for misophonics. ", "What do you do when your trigger noise is replaying in your thoughts and triggering you I heard something and it wont stop replaying and Ive been having this problem for a couple of weeks now :((( Personally when I have this issue, I either message my ears or listen to music with headphones on for a few minutes. Do you mean you have had the same sound replayng for weeks or that you have had the issue of hearing sounds and them relying for weeks? I listen to a song that will get stuck in my head even if it is a song I do not like. I usually use Friday by Rebecca Black because it is so catchy. thank you time to get rick rolled ;\\_;\n\ngenuinely though, thank you Lots of loud white noise from a high powered fan  helps wonders for me.", "In my experience, misophonia seems to get worse with time. Especially if the trigger sounds occur every day and there is literally nothing you can do. You just get more and more and more emotional about it until it is literally debilitating and you cannot do anything without blasting your ears full of music and white noise. It does not seem to get better, only worse. Better yet, there does not seem to be a cure. I have never related more to a post than now. I feel you. This sucks, but with support from this thread, we can get through it. Can confirm, at 40 years old I walk around with headphones on now more than ever. I have found more polite and creative ways of getting out of situations where triggers can become debilitating. Unfortunately, I feel stuck in a job I do not like, only because I can work in silence. Misophonia is a harsh mistress. This is so true. I usually just leave whenever there are triggers. I used to have the energy to do so and still had a little bit of hope that I could block out triggers with music, but that is gone now. It is only getting worse with each passing day. I completely agree.  \n\n\nMine started around the ages of 9-10 and now, at age 56, I feel like I am going insane. I have also found that the people who you should be able to count on most to help, are the last ones who give a crap.   \n\n\nI am thoroughly frustrated and ready to just walk out on every person who does not want to understand, mostly my wife. The pathetic thing about that is, she is very hard of hearing and demands that I try to understand everything she goes through, but she has yet to even try to read any articles about what I deal with.   \n\n\n\\*Hugs\\* to you all. &gt;I feel like I am going insane.

The pathetic thing about that is, she is very hard of hearing and demands that I try to understand everything she goes through, but she has yet to even try to read any articles about what I deal with.\n\nThis quote. Holy shit.\n\nMy mom is constantly insisting that I am making it hard to live with especially because my brother has severe Autism and should tiptoe around him. While I do not get even the slightest amount of respect thrown my way. My miso has gotten to the point of tic fits, hitting my ears, and crying full fucking buckets whenever someone chews. I have other triggers that I can semi-drown out with music (Ironic that one of my triggers is guitar and I am a big metalhead) She alternates between caring about it enough to discuss coping mechanisms (only happened twice) and full fucking chastising me, putting me down, treating me like a mental case, and denying my suffering. She is going on and on about how hard it is to take care of an Autistic child and apparently constant paranoia and anxiety of whether or not someone will crack open the pantry or refrigerator or play guitar, or if my sibling will go onto his annoying fucking tracing app that goes on full blast is not suffering, it is me being a \"melodramatic, bossy, insufferable piece of shit\". She is told me that I will become a reclusive shut-in if I somehow do not \"get cured\" and like OP said\" Better yet, there does not seem to be a cure\". She is like an anti-gay parent that wants to convert their child. It is fucked up. She has actively put me down and chastised me for being this way. To the point to where I feel like a shitty person 24/7. She is been at family gatherings and whenever I walk into a room, she has said, on multiple occasions \"oh, xxxprintmaster42069's here, I would better starve so he does not scream at me to stop eating\" Truly disgusting.\n\nI do not have a problem with my other \"normal\" brother eating because my father has trained some decent manners into his mind. Also, my father is the only other person in my family that I can tolerate. Because unlike my mother and Autistic brother, he has decent manners, he treats my conditions with respect, and is a pretty upstanding guy that does not belittle me every second of every day. I have been taking up cooking from him and have found a side interest to mechanical projects and woodworking.\n\nEven though my mother wholeheartedly believes in Autism, she has yet to read anything pertaining to my conditions and show a shred of decency towards me. I have 3/5 people in my immediate circle that I respect, me included. My dad and my brothers are the best and I would do anything for them. My mom is the absolute worst and I cannot wait to move away from her bullshit, and I have had severe depression that stemmed from her belittling me and the misophonia. I have lost faith in my mother because she feels like my misophonia and my laptop are connected and she takes it away whenever I have an extreme mental breakdown (which is a lot). She is been brainwashed by Facebook and truly believes it with every fiber of her being. so, I truly feel you and hope for the best, I have reached out to total strangers and my friends before my family because most of them are beyond saving. ", "Trouble sleeping. I cannot sleep on my left side. Even the faintest sound (and/or feeling but mostly the sound) of anything brushing against or past my right ear, and only my right ear, causes these intense and super uncomfortable shudders down my spine. It is the same thing I get when someone talks really low RIGHT next to my ear, only way worse, and it does not stop until I am no longer on my left side. I am managing my other misophonic triggers just fine but for some reason, I cannot get the hang of this one. \n\nDoes anybody else experience this or something like it? Is this even related to my misophonia?", "almost breaking up with my bf over this :/ my bf is really not making me feel very understood right now. he just does not seem to want to put any effort into understanding what misophonia is and helping to make things easier for me. just now he refused to slurp his ramen noodles more quietly, because \"that is how they are supposed to be eaten.\" I just cannot even. I do not know what to do. It feels like he just will not even try to understand. he is a really really sweet, loving boyfriend in almost every other way. I am sorry to say this, but you should leave him. This is only the beginning of things he will not understand. Ask yourself if this is really what you consider love to be. Personally, I do not. Although he may be great in almost every other way, if my partner dismisses my disorder like it is a bother to his own life and proceeded to carelessly make it worse, I would leave. I could never imagine living my life out, year after year, with someone who could so easily do that and show no remorse when he triggers me. That lack of empathy towards a romantic partner is unsettling to say the least. \n\nThis is something we cannot help. And maybe they cannot help noises they make, but it is a conscious decision to continue, stop, or otherwise find a way to help cut down or make worse our distress. It is also a decision to ridicule, mock, or justify themselves in the presence of your reaction. You see what he chose to do?\n\nThis is your choice, but consider the future this paints and how your mental health will be affected. I used to be with a guy like this, he wasnt understanding and was pissy whenever i would bring the issue up, it definitely made my misophonia worse. however now i am with a guy who is absolutely incredible with it, he had never heard of the condition before he met me so he did a bunch of research on it and makes sure he does not do any triggers if he can help it. of course it is not our place to say, but in my personal opinion and experience, staying with someone like that will not get better, if anything it will get worse. i hope things brighten up for you! I find if people react negatively and reactionary to me bringing up misophonia the issue becomes so much worse. He should at least pretend to try. It is going to end in hate and anger no matter what, unless he does something about it. I would he decides not to help you or at least try to be more quieter, that says something about how he is going to treat you in the future when you need something. Make sure not to make any rash decisions while you are angry, but if it is consistent and he continues to do it, breaking it off might be best. Make sure he fully understands what it is you have to go through tho Yeah. I explained it to him (not the first time though...) And he did apologize for triggering me. But I am still not convinced that he understands. This is really tough. Even if you did not have misophonia, his reaction ho your request about slurping is inconsiderate, I think. Maybe you asked him because if misophonia. Maybe because you think it is bad manners. Maybe because it is a personal preference. Does it matter? You asked and he dismissed you. As your partner he should want to care about what you think especially when it means he has do something s\u00faper minor. :)", "Support and venting community I have created a page where I share my story in the hopes of helping other people with misophonia to feel validated and supported.

Very stoked  I encourage all of you to talk to your counselor if ur in high school! That is awesome! I had that accommodation as well when I was in high school. It was great ... until the school  decided to let people do class activities and eat their lunch right outside the door. \ud83d\ude10 that is rly exciting for you though! I hope your school experience is improving \u263a\ufe0f nice! Awesome! So happy for you! That is great! I am so happy for you. I hope you can finally dedicate to learning and not dealing with horrendous sounds &lt;3 oh jeez...that sounds terrible. the quiet room is an escape, so to go there and to be confronted by even more sound would just be so much worse. like putting in headphones but still being able to hear and then getting that much more triggered :/ thank you! \u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f My favorite\ud83d\ude0d Congrats! Oh I am so happy for you, my god that is such a game changer", "I am scared and I do not know how to fix it I am a 15 year old male that suffers from very severe misophonia. 4 years ago it was just chewing, eating, drinking. I could still eat with my family and go out. Now, I need to be on a different level of the house. My worst triggers are chewing, the sound of dishes, and they have expanded to every background noise you can think of. Typing, mouse clicking, clock ticking, controller joysticks, pen clicking. \n\nThe quarantine really made it a lot worse and everywhere I go is a living nightmare. I have communications technology in the mornings for 2.5 hours in a room full of computers, where I just feel like breaking down or running out of school. I cannot do anything with my family anymore. They are all so supportive and have completely changed their life around me but it is gotten so bad I can barely be in the same room as them. \n\nThe reason im scared is because I do not know how bad it is going to be in the future. it is completely changed and gotten 100x worse in the span of a year, I always wonder if in two years I will be able to handle anything. I do not know if I should try to accept the sounds to overcome them or it that will make it worse.\n\nPlease help me, I seriously need it I am really sorry. This must be so hard for you.\n\nIf you have not already, talk to your parents about seeing a doctor. My daughter (13yo) started exhibiting symptoms of misophonia. I spoke to her doctor, who recommended seeing an ear/nose/throat specialist. The ENT gave her a diagnosis of hyperacusis, and recommended therapy. She has her first session tonight.\n\nWith this diagnosis, I was able to speak to her guidance counselor and she now has a plan for accommodations at school.\n\nMisophonia may be tied to anxiety, and I do not know if you have any anxiety issues, but it might be worth considering and addressing somehow.\n\nMy daughter is triggered by eating sounds, so we have done the following for short-term coping;\n\n1. Purchased plates, bowls, and eating utensils made of wheat straw. We use those instead of ceramic plates and metal utensils. They are dishwasher and microwave safe, and not very expensive. I cannot replace all the metal or ceramic, but it is a start.\n2. She has noise-cancelling headphones that she wears at mealtimes while listening to brown noise. She says this drowns out the eating sounds better than white noise, plus we can still have a conversation, we just need to speak up.\n3. Sometimes she eats in another room, and we try to tell her when we will be snacking so she an either leave or get her headphones.\n\n( I hope this helps, even a little. Thank you so much, the fact that someone gave me advice and took the time for a stranger on the internet is getting me extremely thankful and emotional.\n\nI visited a doctor a few years ago but no results. I used to suffer with servers anxiety about break ins at night, it would keep me up until dawn from the age of about 9 to 11. My anxiety has increased because of my misophonia since and it is just making everything worse. You should try a different doctor.  I know it can be intimidating, but you need to find the resources to help yourself, and I would hope your parents would help you. That last doctor you saw may have simply not known about misophonia, or how to treat anxiety, or may just have been a bad fit for you.\n\nIt does seem to me that anxiety and misophonia seem to kind of work in a cycle. The anxiety makes the misophonia worse, and then you are anxious because of the misophonia -- I know my daughter feels bad about asking people to stop eating, worries about controlling her reaction, etc.\n\nPerhaps you could see someone and focus on the anxiety issues. If you can find ways to manage and cope with that, it might help with the misophonia.\n\nThe first step, which I realize is probably the hardest, is to talk to someone. Your parents, a teacher, a counselor at school -- keep talking until you find someone who will listen and help. And again, I hope your parents will help you with this.\n\nPeople do have misophonia and they do find ways to manage and live with it, and you can too. Thank you so much, I really appreciate you and what you are doing for your daughter but also just telling me this is amazing Hang in there. I know how you feel. Some days can be extremely overwhelming. Be kind to yourself. And if you have not already get some headphones! PS You are not alone. Take it day by day. You are welcome and I hope you find some relief. I use earbuds all the time, but with these new sounds I am discovering I am trying my best to open up to them and accept them. After years of blocking out all sounds I hated everything just got worse, so I do not know if accepting them is going to better me or make it all worse My misophonia was at its highest point when I was 16/17, and it has gotten much better since. I would say you definitely have hope. That is an extremely mature and brave outlook. You have inspired me and I am 40.

Everything was perfect for most of the time and I did not have many triggers while being at home, but recently the sister has bought herself a TV and put it right against the wall (she lives in the room next to me). The bass easily bleeds through the thin walls in the house and most of the time I can hear what the person in the movie is saying. It is really irritating me and causing me to avoid spending time in my room. Sleeping is also a problem, because even though I wear earplugs to bed since I was a child, I can still hear the sound through them and I find myself looking for it even more than normally. I will soon be going back to school which means waking up at 5AM and if I will not be able to sleep because of the damn TV I will be a zombie the next day.\n\nI became obsessed with the sound and convinced myself that it is the worst thing that can ever happen. I began having thoughts that she does this on purpose just to fuck with me, which degraded our relationship even further. I have even began looking for new apartments, even though I really do not want to move and live alone.\n\nI have tried talking to her and told her to lower the volume a few times, but she does not really care for it and even when she turns it down, the volume goes back up the next day. We have a weird relationship and I do not think she would go out of her way for me in this case.\n\nSo, this brings me to the question - if she does not want to collaborate, how can I cope with this trigger mentally? Maybe anyone had a similar problem and found ways to deal with it? I really would like to go back to enjoying spending time in my room, not be paralyzed and forced to stay awake or blast music on my headphones until she goes to sleep.\n\nThanks in advance to all the good people that took the time to read and/or bring forth any ideas. I feel your pain, as that is something that also triggers me. For me, the noise canceling over the ear headphones works for these situations, sometimes with extra pink noise playing through them. At night, I use ear plugs with the highest decibel reduction and that works too. I do think she should try to accommodate this, as it does not even have to be a misophonia issue, just common sense roommate thing. She should move the TV to the opposite wall so that the sound is further away and she could also wear bluetooth headphones/earbuds for the TV, especially after 9pm. You can offer to pitch in on the bluetooth devices or even buy them, there are some very cheap ones available. You could also buy some acoustic panels to be put on the wall in her room to keep some of the noise in. Good luck!!! I struggle with the exact same thing, and it does not help that everyone I live with loves watching TV. During the day I almost always have my over the head noise cancelling headphones on and usually I can cope. At night, particularly this year where it has gotten worse, I have started playing rain noise though my google nest (you could use any speaker or just play it through your phone). I have it at a volume where its not too loud but loud enough to block out the sound of my dad watching TV in the other room. I actually fix two issues with this because my dad also snores (very loudly) and this also stops me waking up in the night and hearing him. I would worn that now I have gotten used to listening to it every night I have become dependent on it to get to sleep even when the noise is not there. (definitely not the worst problem though).\n\nI also like the suggestion in another comment about asking your roommate to connect Bluetooth headphones to her TV, which could be something simple she could do (assuming the tv allows that sort of connection).\n\nAlso, if you have not already, try explaining to her about misophonia and how it makes you feel. Generally if she is understanding this can greatly help. I used to wear high decibel earplugs with over the ear isolation headphones blasting white noise for this same issue. Ask them to put tv on a timer if it is going all night maybe? If she is not willing to turn down the TV or move it to a different wall, could you switch rooms with your friend?", "Nightmare co-worker hums constantly. It is barely audible and it is not a melody. It is the soundtrack to me losing my mind. I can barely contain my rage when I hear this dimwit humming.  She does not hum a tune-it is some kind of insane sporadic melange of arbitrary notes.   Unless you are within a 10 foot radius of her, you do not hear it-- and even then, it is very soft so it is not disruptive to most people.  But for me? Well, I hate her and her humming with the all-consuming passion of a thousand suns.  She knows it drives me insane because I have asked her to stop many times before.    When I hear it and if I am stuck near her, I want to throw her head through a wall (and I am a woman, and I am not one to be physically violent at all!)\n\nThe other day when my boss asked me to sit directly in front of her for the day, at least I was able to quickly articulate why I had a problem with that.  I told him that I could not sit so close to her because I have misophonia and she hums all day.  He seemed satisfied with that and I was allowed to sit far away from her. I am glad you got a solution, she sounds really annoying. I hope you can avoid her, that sounds miserable. Some human beings need to come with a shock collar. That sounds awful, the fact that she is doing it without any kind of real melody or tune reminds me of (\n\n And it is really cruel that she does it more because she knows it annoys you. I am glad your boss is understanding at least. Does the fact that there is not a melody make it more annoying? That happens to me, people whistling songs is kind of annoying but when it is completely random notes it drives me crazy Yes that is it!  Just no melody or tune at all!  \nAnd I love Ricky Gervais and Karl Pilkington.  Thanks for linking to that. My mom does this. Exact same way of no real tune just like ... whatever notes her vocal cords decide to make with each breath. Usually remind her she is doing it again, she giggles and stops, then does it again later. Among many other triggers It' such a strange habit.  The odd tuneless blurts have to be annoying to people who do not even have misophonia.         \n\n When I first started working in this department, I had to sit 3 feet away from this nightmare.  I would ask her to please stop humming and she would stop for 30 to 60 seconds and start up again.  Maybe it is an unconscious habit.      \n\nEither way, I just kept saying \"could you please stop humming\", \"you are humming again--can you please stop?\", \"you must not realize it, but you are humming again\" until she became so annoyed with me that she got up and left.", "Cat and licking I have always had misophonia, it used to not be very bad. But the older I have gotten the worst it has gotten  It is at the point currently where even my cat licking himself drives me to scream. I do not mean to scream and but i have before. It is so bad. I have had to lock him out of my room and only allow him away from my personal space or i will get upset. I am trying to prevent it from getting at the point where I do end up yelling at him again. I dont want to scare him or anything i feel awful as it is that its like this. He never used to bother me with his licking.  It is not just the cat it is people too i cannot go out for dinner with anyone because their smacking their lips And it makes me so angry. Im concerned cause its to the point where i want to cry. i feel like a angry monster that hates everyone even my cat. When i do not.I do not know what to do or if there is something for misophonia? But i need help or advice thanks. Headphones are not effective for a couple reasons. Music i can hear it over. Fans work but not in the winter. Any advice medications anything thanks!", "Does anyone else just automatically focus on a trigger sound? When I hear a trigger noise or if I see someone putting a chip in their mouth then I automatically focus on them, blocking out any other noise and no matter how hard I try I physically cannot unfocus from them until the sound is over. It makes it so much worse but I cannot help it. Does this happen to anyone else? Same. Literally cannot hear anything else if a trigger pops up Same here, so difficult to focus on anything else. You are fixated till it ends. I am on mobile, but I just wanted to quickly comment on this because this concept helps me so much in life.\n\nThis is phenomenon is called the cocktail party effect, and it is when our brains isolate sounds as a result of what we are focusing on. Our brains remove environmental stimuli all the time so that we can focus and comprehend one thing at a time. \n\nThis is one of the reasons why working on controlling your focus is such a useful coping mechanism. You can use this effect to your advantage instead of the other way around. Instead of focusing on the trigger, you can focus on something else so much that the trigger disappears. It is indirect, but it does help alot if you are in the right mindset. \n\nMeditation and other mindfulness practice can help you work on controlling what you focus on, and controlling what gets drowned out. If you can focus on something else effectively, you can sometimes block out trigger sounds without any effort. When it happens, it is magical, and it makes me feel normal. \n\nOf course this does not happen all the time, even if you work on it like I do. Yes. It makes it even more frustrating. If you have ever seen the umbrella academy (a tv show) one of the characters focuses on one sound and soon it is all she can hear. That is exactly what it is like for me I love how you said you want to quickly comment on this and then write like three paragraphs lol\n\nWoah this sounds really helpful but I suck at meditating. I will try it out though! My comments on this sub are sometimes ( ;P A work trigger of mine is loud fast typing and no matter how hard I tried my ears just zero in on it, even when I am wearing headphones to block it out. Yes it is fucking awful", "Quick update on my situation: Despite showing my dad the post I made and how everyone agrees with me that he is not respecting my boundaries, he still continues to ignore me and continue to be a shithead. So a little update on the situation.\n\nDespite showing my dad the last post on how I complained about him taking away my headphones with everyone sharing the thought that he should not he continues to just ignore me and go along with his stupid plan saying \"Yeah well people will post stuff like this, they will tell you anything that will make you believe their nonsense\". \n\nGood god, how do I deal with this guy, he is literally insufferable and will not listen to me or acknowledge any source no matter how I talk to him about it or show him helpful links about it.  Oh my goodness my dad is exactly the same, mine claims that mental illnesses/ disorders are not real, that doctors just say a bunch of symptoms is a disorder for money. I am not sure what can be done to help people like this understand especially when they deny it so vehemently. I am truly sorry for your situation, is there any way you can get new headphones or leave the situation? (Also sorry that this comment is not too helpful in solving the situation but please know that I understand exactly how you feel.) There is a way I can get new headphones. The problem is my dad will just take those away too when they arrive. because he iz actively trying to stop me having headphones at certain hours.\n\nAlso no there is no way for me to leave my situation at the moment because of lockdown and going out of my current place would be trigger inducing suicide.\n\nWhat do you suggest in this situation, he really thinks his problems would be my problems, when this really is not the case at all. Are there people around you at home who you can convince to convince your dad to try and see from your point of view? I was able to get my headphones back because my mom was kind of more understanding and explained it to my dad; do you have anyone around who can do this for you. You mentioned how your dad would dismiss points coming from you, maybe he would listen to the points coming from someone else? (I know it sucks to think about.)\n\nThere would also be the other option of trying to explain to him through showing him someone who has it, but would not gain anything from mentioning it. He says \u201cthey will tell you anything to make you believe their nonsense\u201d in this ( at around 10:00 one of the people mentions she has misophonia. She is not a doctor or medical professional or someone from this forum, she is just mentioning the fact that she has misophonia in this video. She is not the main owner of the channel and misophonia is not the main content of the channel. If this was really nonsense, it would be isolated to one niche of the internet, but here is someone who genuinely suffers from misophonia and has no ulterior motives for bringing it up. If it was nonsense, why would she make it up for a trivial video? The logical reasoning would be that it is not nonsense. I know it is hard to deal with people who deny the fact that your having a problem when they could never really understand, but stay strong, I am rooting for you! About your first point. I am afraid that situation is hopeless because everyone else who is also in the home are also going along with that plans too. They also will not budge, continue to be stubborn themselves, proceed to call me a dick then also try and actively do this themselves. They are pretty much his lapdog.\n\nEven if I did show him that video, it still would not make him budge because he truly believes this is helping me, and will most likely write it off as nonsense as well and proceed to go on a irrelevant tirade about autism or some shit.\n\nTo make matters worse however there was a point where he actually did not do the research about misophonia a long time ago when I told him to so he could stop writing off the problem as autistic sensory overload. Also even when he did the research he still remains stuck in his ways, knowing misophonia exists, but still not really respecting my boundaries while continuing to do this because he thinks the stuff I do to prevent me from being triggered makes me look weird and shit like that.\n\nSo yeah, not exactly in the best spot at the moment. Again, I am sorry to hear that, I do not exactly know of any other ways I can help you, I hope someone with more knowledge/experience can give you more advice. I do hope things get better for you even if they are terrible now. Long story short: you cannot change narcissists.

What does it add to the experience of eating?! Oh hang on I have the answer. Nothing. Someone in my house does this with virtually all food. Grapes, sandwich, a steak, does not matter. Smacks away. I am fuming. Because people are disgusting jerks who do not care how their actions affect others. My coworker is a grown ass woman and mom, and she smacks her lips on every bite. It seriously blows my mind. I think it is because she smokes, so that feeling is probably calming to her, but its no reason to do it while you eat. Especially around coworkers who do not have the option to get away. Fuck mouth sounds One time I tried it just to just to see what appeal is and I found that I tasted LESS of my food while chewing like a cow.\nSo that is scientific proof that people only eat like that because they are selfish and inconsiderate. I have some family and have had some coworkers who  smack as if their lives depend on it. I literally cannot fathom how they eat that way.. I even tried doing it myself (not just as a way to cope but sheer curiosity) and it made eating 10x harder, could barely taste or chew properly.. I just DO NOT get it. Imagining some of them are triggering me, so going to stop venting now :) There are some people that due it do to dental issues.  My sister had a small mouth.  She had one of those gummy smiles.  \n\nExcluding dental issues, a person that does is pretty much trashy. Smack your food and I will smack it out of your sorry fucking face.", "Got a new job and a colleague sitting next to me is chewing gum and making bubbles/pops That is it. I like the job and I need it. I also like her, she seems to be nice. But I feel that if I tell her anything she will not be that nice and I will be disliked in the company.\n\nThe sound of those pops might be one of the most triggering for me. She chews gum all day at work. \n\nI cannot find a new place in the office. Should I approach her and how? Nobody else seems to mind her sounds but will probably mind me if I ask her and she \"spreads the word\". I think if you approach her, show compassion for her as you do it, you will be fine. Be warm, try to say something positive along with it. Do not jump to a catastrophic conclusion, people can be way more accepting than we assume! Thank you a lot for your answer. I seriously need support and advice. I go very easily to the panic mode and I destroy my health and sanity.\n\nUnfortunarely, the Hitler herself, I mean the mod of r/misophonia, does not let people ask such and similar questions there. If you want a chat, my messages are open as well- I unfortunately experiences something similar in college, there was a girl who ate chips every class. But there were way more supportive people than I thought, including people who were willing to ask her *for me* to stop, and the instructors, who made up a rule about eating in class just so I would be okay and not drop out Honest question, why did not you ask her yourself?\n\nI am just so afraid this girl will take it personally and talk bad about me to other colleagues. \n\nIn her mind and I guess in the mind of others, doing those bubbles is a perfectly ok thing to do. Maybe I also would not mind if she would not do it 7 hours right next to me.\n\nYeah I will try to explain my position, I just do not know how much detail should I go and how apologetic should I be. Oh, I have really bad social anxiety. Totally understand how that sounds weird.\n\nTbh it probably gets on more people's nerves than you know, some of my non-miso friends have expressed how even though they do not have miso, some of my triggers do just plain annoy them.\n\nAll you really have to do is say \"hey, I actually have a sound sensitivity disorder (easy way to put it for people to understand) where small repetitive sounds put me into a state of extreme distress. XYZ triggers it and makes it difficult for me to do my work, so I would be so grateful if you would do XYZ. Thank you so much for understanding.\"\n\nLots of times giving thanks for understanding works a lot better than being apologetic! Wow you put it into words really well! Thank you. I will follow your advice Glad I could help!  You really did help. Today I asked her basically how you told me to ask and she was full with understanding and even apologized. I was so relieved  Hey, thank you for your experience. I feel sorry for you but it does always help to know I am not alone in this. Reducing sounds with that earplugs is something I might try.\n\nAnd do not worry if people do not believe you. It is the same with almost anything, people only believe when they experience it. And most of them will not experience misophonia. At best, they will be annoyed by some people making some noise. That is not what we experience.\n\nI also wanted to say that we are rarely annoyed by any sounds made by us. It is normal. You chewing gum - you control the sounds. Someone else chewing it, they control it. When does a chew occur, how loud, how many pops... is what makes us insane. There is no rule to it. I do not want to sound too crazy right now \ud83d\ude04 I do not know what happened on that sub.  It used to be really good and supportive and it got super shitty.  If the post is even somewhat negative, she deletes it.\n\nShe is seriously a fucking a bitch! It is the case when \"popularity\" and power hits. The sub has many people subscribed but because of her rules it is basically useless. The rule \"not a support group\" - WHY??? This group has people wanting to help, we should all swich here.", "I am so tired of this I am such a fucking burden on everyone all the time because of my misophonia. I asked my mom to warn me before she chews in front of me (my biggest trigger) and she just forgets every single time even though I have asked her to do this for years. I know it is hard for her but i am just so tired. I am so tired of feeling like I am losing my mind when I hear my triggers. I am so tired of being a burden on my family. I am tired of feeling unlovable because I have too many problems. I am just too much for everyone and I can feel my own family starting to resent me because of my misophonia along with other conditions I have, and I hate it. I am past the point of tears. I just feel like a fucking burden and like I will never be good enough for anyone ever\n\nThanks if anyone read this far I just needed to get it off my chest hey, it will all be ok. family is family - no matter how bad you feel, they will always love you. eventually you can all come to terms with misophonia and hopefully everything will be smooth. you are not alone :) Thank you very much for saying that I have the exact same issue. - you are not alone!\n\nThis all started for me when I was only 8. I still remember the very first time that I cried and cried because I could not control myself while having supper with my mom. \n\nMy mom had no idea about misophonia. Actually no one knew about misophonia back then. She used to just ignore me telling her to stop eating, because she thought it was just a tantrum of bullshit. So yeah, this suffering has been lasting for about 10 years. My life at home was hell, and I felt like I was the problem in the house. I have had a few suicide attempts because of this, and mostly because of the fact that no one could understand me - not even my family. \n\nIt is been 12 years since my first trigger. What I know now is that this thing, misophonia, 'develops' over time if you just leave it behind thinking it will eventually be gone. \n\nMy trigger was only one thing, which was the chewing sound of my mom. But now I have much more triggers - silverware crackling, sniffing, breathing noises, mouse click, even my sister talking, etc. Because I let it go. I lived with pain.\n \nMy therapist said this develops when the things get traumatic. Like when you are suffering but no one really cares or understands - this could be a serious trauma just like my case. Living with pain will only cause you more pain.\n\nNow my mom knows about misophonia and she always bears in mind about that. My mom lets me eat alone, and when my family is invited to a meal, she makes reasonable excuses to avoid eating with me. (But she does not tell anyone about my misophonia.) And I am pretty much back to normal life.\n\nPrint a detailed article of what misophonia is. Once your family knows what exactly it is, they will take it seriously and never forget. (This is what I did as soon as I knew about misophonia.) Your family may not know your pain, but they are on your side. They never make you feel alone on purpose. They will do whatever they can to make you feel better because that is what a family does.\n\nHope you make many good memories with your family. \nAnd stay safe! Wow, sounds like you have been through a lot. I am glad you are pretty much back to normal life! Thank you so much for this response. I thought I wrote this and just did not remember or something. You and I are exactly the same. I am sorry you have to experience it. But I am glad we are not alone in this I think one day we will find a cure for this. I really, really hope you are right More research has to be done. There is not too much known about the condition. I am sure it will all be okay. True, it is still quite unknown. But still I hope someone can find a cure or at least a better way to manage the symptoms All the basic coping mechanisms are not working for me anymore, so I hope so too. I will just keep going on in hopes that there will be more hope.", "Ok but is it wrong to expect basic table manners from others? TW for descriptions of sounds.\n\n\n\nFor cultural context I live in upper North America where is it generally considered good etiquette to eat quietly.\n\n\n\nKind of a rant but looking for outside perspective. So I have misophonia towards eating sounds, but not to an extreme extent. I know its impossible to make absolutely zero sounds while eating; I do not get irritated by sounds that cannot be avoided, like the inevitable clinks and scrapes of utensil usage and the crunchiness/wetness of foods INSIDE the mouth. Its when basic habits like eating with your mouth closed are ignored do I get agitated. It takes zero effort to eat with your mouth closed (assuming you are not suffering from nasal or dental issues). I also do not understand smacking your lips while chewing, I have tried it and found it highly unenjoyable and tiring. It gets to me when the sounds are excessive and loud; you can clink and scrape utensils loudly and normally. You can crunch and chew loudly and normally. You can slurp and gulp loudly and normally. I would like to think table manners do exist. But when I see so many comments of \"its my condition and my responsibility, the other person is not responsible for the sounds they are making\" I struggle knowing what to do. Is it wrong to expect the most basic table manners from family members? Is it unreasonable to expect people to have some form of consideration for those around them? Or do I have to put up with the excessive clanking, scraping, hoovering, smacking and chomping forever, making it my responsibility to grit my teeth through until the day I die? Am I wrong for this? Share your thoughts here.\n\n\n\nTldr: misophonia aside, are table manners dead?", "Stuck at work with a football game on. Pete Carroll will surely be getting plenty of camera time as usually. ", "My newest trigger is the word *trigger*. People seem to use it for every stimulus, and it is become really annoying. Just sayin. A trigger is not something that is annoying. It is not something that just makes you angry. A trigger is something that sets off a genuine extreme response related to your condition, whether it is misphonia, PTS, or anything else.\n\nMy extreme rage that arises from being trapped in a space with a screaming, crying child (one of my triggers) is not just regular annoyance or anger. It runs far deeper than that and takes an enormous amount of effort to contain.\n\nPlease educate yourself. I have been educated now for years. The word is overused to describe any emotional outburst, and I am damn tired of seeing it applied to upset people yelling in public. When I encounter a gum popper or smacker, I must escape, and I do: I have disembarked from buses miles from my destination because of boorish chewers. Same deal with screaming kids. When asked to explain, I simply say that I lost my shit, that fight or flight took over, and I had to bounce, or else I would find myself in jail. That is all. Lmao, that is not educated.", "Sony WH-1000XM4 Not an ad. But seriously the best noise cancelling headphones I have ever bought. I also have Airpods Pro as well - for those quick relief moments, but even they do not hold a candle to the noise cancelling in the Sony's. I feel I can actually block out the upstairs neighbor's dogs, banging, yelling. Even with the volume low, with some music on, I can block out voices near me too. Feel these will make travel that much more bearable as well. Preach! Sony is the king of noise cancelling, in my opinion. I heartily agree with your sentiments.\n\nI am going to fangirl about headphones here because why not. Maybe someone will see it and find it useful.\n\nIf you want to take noise isolation a step further, the WF-1000XM3s are also quite good. I think they need more recognition than they get. They are basically the in-ear version of the WH-1000XM3's. However, they go deep into the ear canal and come with 2 different types of ear buds. The idea is to create a good seal and increase the amount of noise isolation you get. They also have a similar noise cancelling driver which removes background noise. They also have the \"hold to listen\" button, just like the WH-1000XM3s have, which allows you to listen to someone speaking without taking the headphones out.\n\nTo be clear, noise isolation is important for blocking out the more intrusive noises like people speaking, eating noises, and more. With some music, you cannot hear much of anything. Think of it like plugging your ears with earplugs but with noise-cancelling and music added.\n\nI mention the XM3 series here because they use an equally performant noise cancelling device as the XM4 series. It is worth noting because a lot of people could save a significant amount of money by purchasing the older XM3 model - assuming that they do not care about the new bluetooth functionality (connect 2 devices simultaneously) and increased music quality that the XM4s offer.\n\nI personally like the WF-1000XM3s more than any over-ear headphone for those difficult situations. Although, the battery is not as good as the WH-1000XM3s or the Bose QC II's. So, that is a little bit of a con. But other than that, the in-ear variety are by far my favorite.\n\nReviews that I found *extremely* helpful and informative:\n\n* In-depth comparison of the Bose QC IIs and the Sony WH-1000XM3s can be found ( He does a breakdown of everything to do with the headphones, but the most important part is when he shows a recording of the noise cancelling in-action.

Same with speech impediments; for example, the sound of both Sean Connery and JoJo Siwa speaking makes me want to peel my own eyeballs out of my head.. I appreciate your contributions. I agree about the list and believe I could have come up with a considerably more comprehensive list of triggers. The reason it seems so abbreviated is because it is based on scales used to determine misophonia severity. The scales I chose are the ones that have been most widely tested so there is a significant amount of reliability and validity behind them. I could come up with my own test of clinical significance in misophonia severity, but I am not nearly educated/available enough to do it well! Took the survey, glad I could participate :)\n\nGood luck on your grad school journey! Thank you!! I took the survey, and I am interested in seeing if it is just me, or if anyone with misophonia violently hates asmr.  Asmr is like the epitome of all my triggers and is utterly unbearable to me.  I would be surprised if there is actually any overlap there.\n\nBut that my also be just me.", "Does it drive anyone else nuts how everywhere you go it seems like multiple people are coughing?

Thanks All my \"friends\" growing up would intentionally smack their lips etc in a group effort to rattle me.

I wish there was a way to deal with this - leaving the room is the only real solution and I feel like an asshole when I need to. But when I get to that point it is just unbearable and somethings got to give. This is such a tricky situation. I think sleeping in another room sounds like a good idea; and it is common in couples, misophonia or not. People usually sleep better if they have a bed to themselves. That alone might help a lot/you will be more rested.  If not it becomes a difficult situation; some people have gone through therapy which might help to make the sounds less triggering, but I do not know whether that works for everyone (I have not tried).", "today i drove my friend home from school and she ate chips loudly the whole way home that is it.

I just sent it to my wife and said \"this is me when we go to the movies\" ( we have not been in a decade). On Christmas Day, our family went to the movies to see Holmes and Watson and I walked out five minutes into it because of loud choppers. I sat in the car waiting for them to return. Turns out, it was probably the best decision I made. They said it sucked. I simply refuse to go now. We have an incredible TV (60inch plasma) and a sound system at home. Also, movies come out on DVD almost immediately after leaving theatres now. Lastly, most films coming out of Hollywood lately suck anyways. I do not blame you. We have a drive-in theater and that is doable since my wife and kids are considerate of my condition. We also have a Warren theater complex which has reserved, spaced out balcony seating.

Misophonia, it is the worst, Honestly, some of this is just good old table manners too! Do you have a problem? NO - Misophonia SUCKS!!\n\nIs it an irrational response? YES - that is what Misophonia is\n\nAre people just fucking awful? Also YES!\n\nThe same thing happens to me and I just simply ask them to stop eating or call me back when they are done since apparently stuffing their face is more important at the moment.  \n\nJust keep identifying those triggers and be upfront and calm when asking others to help mitigate the situation.\n\nYOU ARE NOT INSANE! I worked as a 411 operator many years ago and I cannot tell you how much I heard this shit from assholes calling from their offices around lunchtime. Yes absolutely hate this. At least it is generally considered bad manners so people just think you are old fashioned or something, rather than insane, when you ask them not to talk with their mouth full Best thing that is happened to me lately is the ability to mute other people on my video meetings. Today someone was repeatedly gulping and not speaking. Mute. I do not even understand how other people are not also annoyed by it. Is eating really loudly with your mouth open not just objectively universally disgusting? I will end professional conference calls over this. It is absolutely not at all allowed in any capacity on my team. If a client is the offender I will ask them politely if they would prefer to reschedule for a better time. If they decline, I make an excuse and beg apologies but I absolutely can, have, and will continue to end calls immediately over this. \n\nRecently learned this also applies to video calls x10. My therapist innocently started snacking on a mini pack of chips during a session once. Even though she was on mute while chewing, the visual was enough to disrupt the entire session for a solid 20 minutes. I am not a fragile person, but having a sacred space like a trauma therapy session made worse by the sudden inclusion of a strong trigger just feels like adding insult to injury.\n\nPro-tip: I found practicing a script several times while calm was helpful for getting through the moment without losing restraint and snapping at the offender. Not always effective, but helpful.", "Could taking certain medications lessen and/or worsen my Misophonia I was talking to my mom today about how unbearable my misophonia has become. I told her that I went to the doctor for a general physical check up a couple of weeks ago and the advice they were able to give me for treating misophonia. They told me to stop taking Hydroxyzine and Vyvance as Vyvance could be stimulating my senses and making me fore sensitive to the accents. I forgot the reason they told me to stop taking Hydroxyzine. At the time they were explaining this stuff to me, my mind was already in a whirl because the noises that trigger me could be heard all over that place. They also told me to maintain my Trintellix and that I might need to continue taking Gabapentin for a while, possibly gradually stopping.\n\nVyvance might be very difficult for me to stop taking. Almost five years ago, I stopped taking it for a short while because it was too expensive for me to afford at that time. I was overly lethargic, my muscles became sore, and my attention was weak. I got into a car accident because I did not notice I was in a wrong lane road in an area I was unfamiliar with. Even with several signs (some with flashing lights around them), my attention was too weak to notice them. If I do not take Vyvance early enough after I wake up, the with draw symptoms come in fast.\n\nThe medications they did recommend for me to take to replace the Vyvance were Latuda and/or Abilify 2 or 5 \"starting dose\". Do these medications sound competent or applicable for misophonia? The reason I bring this up is because my mom told me the effects of medication may not be as effective anymore the longer you take them. I have been taking Vyvance for bout five years now. I do not know if that is long enough for the effects to not be effective anymore. Would taking this change in my medication be something that could help, would it not help, or should I not do this at all?\n\nWhen I was talking to my mom, we were visiting some family and friends of family at the pool that one of them owns. Many of the people there were speaking in southern accents which are my major most trigger. I have always lived in the south and yet, my most intense trigger is those accents. It is a complicated situation. Hearing the accents was pushing me to my breaking point. I was only able to be there for just a little over an hour as opposed to the majority of the day as they were staying. The reason I came is because these people enjoy seeing me, I wanted to visit them, and I wanted to go for a swim. This environment was just too much for me.\n\nI do not know if I still have a legitimate psychiatrist or medicine provider. The I had to stop seeing the one I was given because she has a southern accent and the meetings were making me greatly uncomfortable. the company she is with still wants me to be with them. I still need to get back with them and see if I can do the TTY option they recommended. I used to have a fantastic psychiatrist, but I had to stop seeing her earlier this year because I turned 26, thus aging out of my parent's health insurance. I have heard serotonin related meds help. By this, do you mean medications that boost serotonin or decrease serotonin? I have heard the same thing. Medication that increases serotonin in the brain (SSRIs) can help with miso. Some people even say that it makes it much more manageable.", "Do I have misophonia if nobody triggers it other than my mum? TW: Discussion of eating sounds. So me and my mum tend to eat most meals together in front of the TV. We do not have a dining room or table, this is how we have eaten for as long as I can remember. I never had any problem with it up until a few years ago, I just remember noticing one day \"Oh wow, she has a really gross way of eating.\" Since then, it is only gotten worse, now that I have noticed I just cannot unnotice it. She eats like Denathor in Return of the King; mouth wide open, loud smacking and heavy breathing. I have even seen her begin to choke while she is eating and continue to shovel food into her mouth, plus because her mouth is open, a lot of food falls out her mouth and gets over her. I cannot stress enough how gross it is.\n\nOver the years, it is gotten more unbearable to me, but nobody else's eating bothers me. When I am at my grandmother's house with all my aunts and cousins and we eat at the table, I still cannot tune her out but to be fair she is the loudest one there. Weirdly enough, my best friend has misophonia and when we lived together during uni my mum visited me and we ate together. I warned her in advance that my mum's eating might make her uncomfortable, and that she was welcome to give it a miss, however afterwards she said she did not even notice anything so maybe it is just a me problem?? I am sorry if this is not the right place for this but I just do not know if I have a legitimate disorder or if it is just my mum. Sorry to hear what you are going through. I have certainly noticed that my feeling of rage increases and subsides at how annoyed I am at the person. To the point that I would be very triggered by a person I do not know, but when they talk to me and I like them, it is significantly less angering.\nI now sometimes adopt this strategy of finding some positive vibes with the eating person so that they trigger me less.\nMaybe you have some unresolved issues with your mom? I can definitely relate to this.\n\nMy misophonia problems also started with my mom,  one day we were in the car and she was chewing gum loudly and since then it is only gotten worse. I can tolerate most chewing by men but absolutely cannot stand when women are eating. I have noticed for myself that I have always been in a really bad relationship with both women in my family and I am not proud of it, but this grew into some deep-rooted hatred towards women and their chewing.\n\nI am really unsure as to what advice I can give you, since I am figuring it out myself. Anyway, stay strong and do not forget you are not alone in your misophonia struggles! I actually get on really well with my mum, we rarely argue and I get on a lot better with her than I do my dad although I get on well with both my parents. I do find her a little lazy sometimes, she is really messy and she is dangerously overweight which I hate that it causes me to think less of her but I guess maybe me hearing her eating reminds me of that? God, that sounds awful. So your problems started with your mum but now relate to other women? I was wondering if I had \"genuine\" misophonia because it literally only revolves around one person, apart from anything else I literally cannot imagine that anybody would not be bothered by it, but like I said other people including my former housemate with misophonia did not see any issue with it I figured maybe there is something genuinely wrong with me. Yes. I am in a weird relationship with both my mom and my grandmother. It is a love-hate relationship, which makes it so confusing to me. I suppose it is been like that since I have been a child, that is why it is influencing me so badly right now.\n\nMy other issue with that is that it is not only chewing that triggers me. Their voices are incredibly annoying to me as well. I need to say this - I do not hate them and I wish them only the best, but I have come to terms with the fact that this is something out of my control. I have been to multiple psychiatrists and they all promise me that it is an issue that could easily be fixed, but no improvement for now.\n\nI am struggling with the same question - is there something wrong with me? Am I a bad person for being triggered by my own mother? Because it is so painful not being able to spend any time with her (since her voice triggers me), I KNOW I am going to regret this in the future, but I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT do this to myself. I cannot force myself to go out with her because I start crying on the street due to her voice and her breathing. This is a torture.\n\nSo in conclusion. Be grateful that it is only her chewing that is annoying you. Be grateful that you get to spend time with her, because I cannot do this. I cannot spend time with my own mother and it is something I feel guilty about every single day. We have missed on family trips, dinners, walks in the park, etc. It hurts thinking about it and I feel incredibly mad at my brain for being like that.\n\nTL;DR I am triggered by my mom's voice as well and I cannot spend any time with her. Please, do not forget that it could always be worse. I know you are struggling and I am rooting for you. No no, not at all, I am really grateful that you shared your story with me. I really hope you keep at the therapy and work towards finding peace with your condition \ud83d\udc9c Thanks for the kind words! I wish you all the best as well and hopefully there is cure for both of us one day! :\") I am really not sure if it could be it, but I also find my dad's eating much more triggering than anyone elses. He has struggled a lot with weight and I worry constantly about his health, eating habits, and that he always said that I am 'of the same breed', meaning, will get overweight also. I love him and he is an amazing dad, but I think that may have something to do with him triggering me more. I am having the same issues, except with my father. It started as me just being triggered by the way he talks, but now it is become the way certain people laugh, certain syllables likes \"s\", \"t\", or \"p\", and when I can overhear people from other rooms. Anyway, I also avoid my father now because of this and have similar guilty feelings, because I genuinely do not hate him, I just cannot stand his voice. Yes, I know how frustrating it is.\n\nI actually developed different obsessions regarding misophonia. I will give you an example: since I cannot stand my mother and her voice, I also cannot stand most noises she produces on daily basis. It is gotten so bad that I have to keep all doors in the apartment closed shut, or else I can hear her washing the dishes, or watching TV, or coughing and it drives me insane.\n\nAnother problem I have is with different movements. If I see another woman tapping their leg on the floor, or doing something repetitive with their hands/mouth (for instance chewing in the distance, or silently chewing gum), I also get triggered. I feel like misophonia is some sort of progressive disease, because it is been getting worse and worse throughout the years.\n\nI do not know whether you can relate to those things, but currently my only coping mechanism is to run away from the situation, by closing all doors, turning up the volume and leaving. I have been trying to control myself but I cannot, I just start crying uncontrollably unless I do any of the above.\n\nRight now I am hoping it does not spread to other people like my dad or my close friends, because I would be devastated if I cannot spend time with them. Most people do not understand misophonia and they use it to taunt me and annoy me just so that they can have a laugh, fuck those people, if they knew what it we are going through they would not be laughing. Yes... I can relate to all of that. I lock myself up in my room too and triggers have become almost anything to do with my dad (for some reason the coughing from the other room is SO disturbing), which again is awful because I genuinely do not hate him. It is taken a bad toll on my mental health and at this point I do almost anything to cope (loud volumes of music always, earplugs 24/7, social avoidance, my responsibilities neglected due to me just trying to get some peace of mind, and other behaviors/conditions started up because of this). Mine has progressed for sure going from those one or two things to now where the way total strangers talk can bother me, animals, and just general every day sounds. I do not know if it all stemmed from this one thing, but it is definitely became bigger over time (I am at the late teens/early 20s where apparently mental illnesses like to start showing themselves though, maybe mine's just reached that point idk). Misokinesia bothers me too sometimes, especially around my biggest triggers and animals, but luckily it is easier to avert my eyes than block out triggering sounds, but they definitely shake me up. Thankfully the people in my life who know this about me have not been taunted me about it, that is awful. I wish I had better advice than my unhealthy coping mechanisms but it is really just Suffering haha Ah, I am truly sorry to hear all that. At least you should know you are not alone in all this and it is really cool that there are people who support you and do not taunt you with your triggers.\n\nHave you visited a psychiatrist/therapist? It is the same problem as mine. it did not bother me  until my sister made me notice it and now it is a nightmare Sounds like misophonia. I know your exact pain. I know the feeling of not being able to ignore it once you notice it so well. It is not your fault. Your feelings are completely valid. God, I cannot verbally describe how much I understand what you are talking about. Even if it is simply your mother that triggers it, it doesnt matter. Honestly, that happens to me. Of course, many people can make me pissed, but my brother for some reason makes me more pissed than anything else. So I get it. Just try and not blame yourself. Because I know it sucks, it really does.\n\n(Edit: typos)", "Sorry for yet another post  These are great, no need to apologize :) Lol.

Her nails are all fucked up because of it. You are nail beds move backwards if you do it a lot. At this rate I think they will be up her neck by the time she is 20. I never sit next to her but just seeing it triggers me. How do I tell her nicely to stop sucking the life out of her fingers without being rude cus I am going insane. Thank you for coming to my ted talk :) you do not because you cannot ask strangers to accommodate for us, as much as it sucks. \nHave you looked into acoustic earplugs? I wear them during class, it blocks out sounds close to me like eating and nail biting, but I can still hear my professor I used to have a nail-biting habit back when I was a kid. I grew out of it though. I think I just really did not like my nails being long so I developed a habit of biting them.\n\nI eventually replaced the bad habit with just trimming them regularly like you are supposed to do. It still drives me nuts if I ever forget to trim them and they are even slightly too long but at least I never bite them anymore. I know, should not have put that in there. I pop in AirPods when I cannot help it but it only really works when there is something playing. I am going to buy some earplugs. Thanks! Yeah I used to use airpods too but the acoustic earplugs have definitely made a huge difference! Mine were only $20 on amazon :) I had a classmate who did the same thing, try earplugs or maybe tell a little lie and ask to move nearer the front so you can hear/see better and then you can get away from it. Nail biting is often a sign of anxiety (I bite mine in private sometimes if I am particularly anxious) so try to come at the situation with that in mind. Thanks for the tips! nail biting is my absolute worst trigger by far. started at a very early age from my mom. even seeing her put her hand up to her face from my periphery makes me visibly shrivel up. my roommate, who knows about this, also bites his nails. makes me want to scream. I will start to put my noise cancelling headphones/earplugs on and he will get offended and say \u201cI am not biting my nails!\u201d to get me to take them off, just for him to do it 5 mins later when he thinks I am not paying attention.  literal HELL. Yessss it is my worst trigger too!!!! I had to deal with this the other day. We invited our friend over to play Catan, and his younger sister always tags along. She is 13 and she spent the ENTIRE time chewing the nail glue off her nails. At one point I could not take it anymore and I thought I was going to snap so I calmly lowered her arm. One minute later she *intentionally* resumed but even more aggressively. I asked her nicely to please stop and she purposely continued. This is the story of how she is never going to be invited to my house again.", "B I R D S.

Completely get not being able to unhear a sounds :/ Oh no, having auditory hallucinations AND misophonia sounds bad. And then being paranoid... I hope it gets better for you, man. Sounds stressful.

For many others with misophonia it is the opposite. My husband is my opposite in this.I hate slurping and he hates crunching. I hate any kind of audible eating. Ugh, I am sorry!

The sound is gone but now I feel more depressed and like a prisoner in an even smaller confined space. I have anxiety and depression and first started noticing my sensitivity to sounds around 4 years ago or so.\n\nThe first sound was the sound of my new neighbor walking loudly. It drove me nuts.\n\nNow my symptoms include:\n\n* Hearing the sound of air vents at night, especially when sleeping (freeze response)\n\n* A church band plays next door to my restaurant some nights (fight and flight response) -- on the verge of quitting some nights. Some nights I have not been bothered about it at all for some reason though.\n\n* The sounds of car engines and music coming from cars (freeze response). Oddly enough this one seems to have largely disappeared and I no longer struggle with it.\n\nThe primary one is dogs barking. It has made me straight up cry from distress.\n\nI moved to my room and was afraid that this would only falsely reinforce the false idea that the dog barks are dangerous. For me the barking made me angry, but it got way worse Octobers 1st.\n\n I now I am trapped in my room and feel like a prisoner.

It is really taking a toll on me and I cannot do anything about it I feel so stuck If you dont have misophonia I guess its just really hard to understand. I think that is why so many of us are refused help or even believed. My grandma told me to just go to church and Jesus would help me with it I remember when I was younger my mom would scoot the kitchen chairs over the floor and they would screech. I would beg her to pick them up to move them or try really hard to not make all that noise. Her way of attempting to appease me was by moving the chairs more \"carefully\" which was actually just slower, made the sound louder and worse and it took longer. She just had no clue of hearing what I heard. I begged her to just do it really fast to get the sound over with but she just would not believe that was better.

It is either \"Oh, I get annoyed about noises too!!!\" or something to do with overreacting and being too sensitive.

I am sure lots of people here get this and it is nice to know I am not alone here, but I wish that more people in \"real life\" would actually listen to me? I totally agree, I wish people took misophonia more seriously. It is not simply overreacting or getting a little bit irritated by some noises, it is something that causes severe discomfort, causes you to constantly be extremely irritable, and will make your life miserable.

I actually forgot about that until I read this, it feels unreal. I am starting to feel like we all need to carry a small chalkboard and run our nails down it whenever someone starts to question the explanation of our condition. ^^^ Ya, I used to do that sometimes in school against the lockers rip. I cannot imagine what that looked like to other people, it is really wack. Honestly, yes. Though people probably would not even get the true extent of it from that \ud83d\ude10 I wonder if there is a video of nails on a chalkboard that would at least give them a hint of the feeling? I have a scar from cutting my hand with a knife when I was 7. Thankfully the only person who is ever triggered me is my grandma who I live with atm. I can barely stand hearing her speak, and my cutting was triggered by her breathing\n\nAlso, you can start by explaining that you have a mental disorder and then give ppl details, they may be more understanding", "Have you ever wondered, What is Misophonia? Misophonia is most-likely a neurological affliction that causes a fight/flight/freeze response to otherwise normal visual and audial stimuli. As of now, there is no official consensus on what exactly causes the disorder. Though it was coined in 2001 by Jastreboff and Jastreboff there has been little research published under the disorder\u2019s current name.\n\nResearchers such as Joseph E. LeDoux and Stephen Porges have been researching auditory over-responsivity. However, the name of the disorder matters little since researchers are more focused on what is going on inside the brain and body and not merely perceived notions and sweeping generalizations.\n\nMany that sufferer from misophonia struggle with similar symptoms. Commonly, tapping, whistling, chewing, and other repetitive sounds cause this severe reaction. Though the disorder manifests with aversions to sights and sounds, many are proposing that its cause is physiological and not psychological.\n\nwhat is misophonia?There are currently no experts on Misophonia and no one doctor or researcher can claim that they have all the answers. This is also true of treatments and coping methods. Before trying a treatment please ensure that you are aware that new disorders not only carry a lack of treatment but also a risk. If you are trying experimental treatments please be wary. If you feel uncomfortable with your treatment provider, do not hesitate to refrain from continuing.\n\nAs of now, much of the research must be geared toward preliminary findings. The first steps to understanding Misophonia comes from academic and ethically conducted research that will lay the groundwork for future studies and findings. The IMRN works vehemently to ensure that several angles of research are being explored. We are not committed to one theory over another. Our focus on research is about the journey. As research changes and develops, so will our ideas on the disorder.\n\nThere seems to be an overlap between SPD SOR (Sensory Processing Disorder; Sub-set Sensory Over Responsivity) and Misophonia. However, this overlap is entirely based on symptoms. Whether or not the two are related remains to be seen. Though, due to the close over-lap, Lucy Miller of the SPD Foundation has joined the IMRN advisory board to help facilitate research to see if the two may in-fact be related. If this is true, this explains the similarities between misophonics, autistics, Aspergers patients, as well as other disorders.\n\nThe cause of Misophonia is secondary right now to its impact on the lives of sufferers. As a magazine and news site we hope to connect sufferers with their researchers. Since there is no official cure it is important that we act as shoulders and support systems for each other. Together we can ask for answers. The IMRN ( does not believe that one researchers proposals are more important than another. Though we may currently be fundraising for one lab this does not mean that we are not exploring all avenues. A cross-disciplinary approach is our best case scenario when it comes to finding answers. This means that audiologists, neurologists, psychologists, and several professionals are the key to finding answers. When asking \u2018what is misophonia?\u2019 we must realize that it is through working together that we find the greatest answers. ", "COVID-19 has made my triggers feel worse (trigger warning) My triggers are coughing and throat clearing. I also suffer from OCD and one of my obsessions is getting sick. Since COVID-19 has been happening, two of my worst fears have teamed up to be just the most awful thing ever. \n\nMy nieces were sick a week and a half ago. My sister did an at-home COVID test on them and it was negative. So I went over to their house to hang out. I wore two face masks and thought I should be okay. After all, it is been a week and if my sister did not get sick from taking care of them surely it is not COVID. \n\nLo and behold both of my nieces still have a productive cough from whatever virus they had last week. And the worst part was neither of them were covering their mouths. I noticed my sister and brother in law were coughing a lot as well and sounded stuffy. No one was wearing a mask or keeping a distance. I was extremely uncomfortable and tried to keep my distance from them and not make it look obvious because I did not want them to get upset.\n\nThen my oldest niece talked about how she lost her sense of smell last week for a few days and was really scared. I immediately felt panic. My sister said she did two at-home COVID tests and they were both negative, but those tests are not 100%. \n\nI ate dinner quickly and said that I was tired from work and wanted to go home and ordered a Lyft. I felt so incredibly uncomfortable and grossed out. I feel angry and upset too. They wanted me to come over again this afternoon but I declined and said I am busy cleaning my apartment. I felt horrible for not coming over, but I do not want to listen to them cough constantly and watch them not cover their mouths. It grosses me out and makes me scared of COVID. \n\nLord, help me. wow, first of all i am genuinely sorry for you that seems like a situation no one wants to be in but you have actually handled it very well and i applaud you for keeping your cool.  \n\ni do not have ocd, just misophonia, but i researched a bit about it and by the looks of it that must have been really hard for you!\n\ni do not think you should feel bad at all, even someone without ocd or misophonia would probably not want to be there. you handled this very well and you did not let ur ocd+misophonia get the best of you which is godly because half of the time i cannot not cry whenever i hear a trigger so you should be really proud of yourself \u2661 Thank you dear\u2764", "Misophonia Art on episode 18 - The Misophonia Podcast This week I talked to Laurel, a mixed media artist who expresses her struggles with misophonia through her artwork.

On Instagram at ", "i do not know how to live like this i really do not have the strength anymore. i cannot fucking deal with this shit everyday. i already suffer from anxiety and depression and my misophonia just triggers them and everything i do to get my shit together is just gone. i cannot do it. i just cannot. even if i can, i do not know if it is worth the try, if i am worth the try. if i was just fucking gone, i would not feel any of this pain, discomfort, anything. i just do not want to exist or just be on my own, till the day i die. i do not think i can ever have a normal, happy life like others around me. all that i can do is envy them. i cannot work clearly because my friend who i work with always triggers my misophonia. she has ADHD which causes her to be SO LOUD which is even worse for me. i tried to tell her about my issue but she does a thousand things that triggers me in a day and i cannot just tell her not to do anything. i cannot tell anyone to not do something. i cannot fit in in this world. misophonia is just one of my problems too. all my problems are buried inside me, no one else knows. they think i;m happy or something. but i cannot keep this facade longer either. Do not give up on yourself. I know the feeling of keeping the anger deep inside me when people are making my trigger noises. I also suffer from anxiety and depression, I have recently gone back on to anti depressants. I find one of my greatest comforts is simply headphones. I do not care if I am perceived as being rude, headphones with some comforting background noise does wonders. You can explain to people that you do not like certain noises. I always felt like I could not say anything, but my husband and daughter know not to chew chewing gum around me especially as that is my biggest trigger. This probably does not really help you, but I can relate to your post. I really do not know what I can say to help with this, but I cannot scroll by it in good conscience.\n\nResearch is being done on misophonia right now in an attempt to understand it better and help those who it has affected in their everyday lives. I am so sorry that you have to put up with this, but I hope you know that you have made it this far and you can make it further. There will be help for you with time. I know you said that was not your only issue and I would highly encourage you to seek out a professional that could help you out with some of those other issues, if you are able to. It is a struggle for sure, but you are definitely worth the try, I promise. It can be really tough to get a handle on it, but you can curate your own experience to a large degree. I highly recommend trying apps or websites that play some kind of background noise that can function as white noise (I am particularly fond of a website/app called A Soft Murmur which let us you mixed noise/rain/waves/wind etc to block other noises), nature sounds may also help. Noise cancelling headphones help for a lot of people and some folks have found that bond conduction headphones can help too. \n\nI have found that reducing the number of sounds i have to tolerate through various tactics makes it a good bit easier to tolerate the ones I cannot otherwise mitigate. \n\nMy partner also has ADHD and he makes a point to be very accommodating and considerate when it comes to noises that cause problems for me. It is not 100% of course but he tries and usually does a very good job. thank you. i became a lot more vocal about my triggers this past year too. for example i told my friend not to do a repetitive sound and she stopped doing it completely for me which is huge. but now i get triggered by other sounds by her. :( so no matter what i do, i feel like there is no way out. i get so obsessive that even if i wear headphones i cannot just get over the trigger and i get triggered visually too. i know you cannot do anything to help me, your comment alone is a bit of a relief for me. i just want to vent so thanks for letting me. &gt;I have found that reducing the number of sounds i have to tolerate  through various tactics makes it a good bit easier to tolerate the ones I  cannot otherwise mitigate. \n\ncan you explain to me what you mean by this part?\n\nthank you for your comment. i also want to ask, does it make a difference to listen to music or white noise? i never tried white noise so if it can be more helpful than music, that is exciting thank you. i actually started going to a psychologist 2 weeks ago. but so far she is just getting to know me. i really hope i can make some progress. Gods, I do not know how to reply to this because this is how I felt for a *very* long time. Sometimes it comes back to punch me in the face and on those days I will not be able to get anything done.\n\nI am not sure if this would help, but what helped me reduce the pain were distractions. I would slip in my earpiece and listen to podcasts. There is this one podcast, \"Invisibilia\" that helped me a lot. Sometimes they dwelled on mental health and sometimes there were things I could use to help. I recommend just listening to one episode, the very first one.\n\nThen I buried myself in books, wrote poetry and watched as much series as possible: they helped me, because all of the sudden I was not looking at my bleak life, I was looking at the fantastic things of the world.\n\nIf you can, find something that would help you cope day by day. Just live it day by day. I used to wonder, \"how in the hell would I live this shitty life for the rest of the year\"? But that got me down because a year is *so* long.\n\nSo I asked, \"what would help me cope today\"? And slowly, I got better. It *will* get better. Not drastically, not immediately, but it will.\n\nI am a pessimistic lad, so it was hell of hard to take this mentality: sometimes life presents you with shit, but other times it gives you gold. Hold on to that, hold on to that tightly no matter how shit gets, because it is those moments that helped me get through my darkest days.\n\nIt is those moments that are still helping me now. I guess it is kind of like a stress budget? If I can avoid being triggered by my coworkers all day then the odd  trigger noise I was not able to avoid is a lot more tolerable instead of being the one that finally reduces me to tears, lol. \n\nI find white noise way better for blocking out noises without messing with concentration or worrying that you will hear the sound between songs or during a quieter part, etc. You can also layer audio. If I start the white noise app first i can play music or a podcast on top of it (but it will not work in the reverse order for some reason - i expect both devices and apps vary so it may take some experimentation). thank you &lt;3 (feeling a lot calmer atm) i am curious about that podcast, i will check it tomorrow. usually when i get intense, i find it really hard to focus or even acknowledge any positive thing in my life-even though there are plenty, that s something i need to get better at. I am really tired of struggling every day, waking up with the fear of these awful emotions, not being able to function, not being able to do my job, not being myself etc... but i will not give up, not yet :p I hope you can too! I believe in you :) Ok so controversial suggestion and please take with a grain of salt im just happy to share my own experience with addressing my misophonia.\n\nPersonally, for me, I feel like my miso was fully interlocked with my MDD, anxiety, and PTSD. Which makes sense on all accounts. Depression made me isolated, anxiety made me frantic, and PTSD put me in constant fight or flight mode. The trigger sounds would ultimately put me in fight mode because there is often no escaping the sounds and THAT IS what sets off the anger.\n\nSo I went to a therapist that specialized in OCD. Trauma, PTSD, and depression. We did exposure therapy which did help me control my reactions, but it did not necessarily make the strong dislike of the sounds go away. It allowed me to not fixate and panic. Then EMDR sealed the deal, that is truly when I was able to manage it.\n\nI still strongly dislike sounds, but it is been a dream I never thought would come true that I would not have a mental break down, crying fit or panic attack when a sound would be happening.\n\nOf course there is not enough research around what makes misophonia happen, so it is hard to say. I am sure it is both learned and/or genetic.... but if any of these things sound applicable to you, I highly suggest looking into it.\n\nJust therapy in general, having someone to talk through any of this is a big help too. The first therapist I went to was like \u201cso what sounds bother you???\u201d And I was like nope noOooOoo this is not going to work because dear lord that does not do this any justice. The second therapist, and my current one, was so relaxed and bon judgmental about it and really tried to meet me in the middle. I think someone like an OCD therapist, even if you do not have OCD, is a great person to see. They are used to people performing things as a result of anxiety over something that could be perceived and is not even real.... so I found him to be the most comforting, with the right amount of appropriate challenging and push back.\n\nAnyways! Good luck friend \u2764\ufe0f dont give up , dude , i had the same feelings too , maybe some therapy will do a thing ? Mine misophonia gotten alot better since i started it . Your post sounds exactly like something I would have said when I was in my twenties (I am now in my fifties). It brought back a lot of memories for me. Feeling trapped by my own curse and hopeless that life was worth the extraordinary effort it takes to get through even one day. I definitely feel your pain. I would like you to know that it does get easier over time, but you cannot be your own worst enemy. If you have a friend who drives you crazy, maybe you should take a break. It sounds like you see him/her everyday. If you have a job that is driving you nuts, find a job that will allow you to work from home. I am glad you are in therapy, but I also hope you are on an antidepressant because they really do take the edge off. I also take CBD oil. You have to find a pure brand - do not buy it at the grocery store. Also, stay current with the latest developments in treatments. Duke University is researching the use of TMS for depression, anxiety, and Misophonia. It will give you hope that you will be free someday. Those are my recommendations, but I will be thinking of you and I hope you will not give up. Sending you love and hope \ud83e\udd70 thank you. it really feels comforting to hear this from someone who has lived with this for so many years. i was in a hurry to leave a comment so i will leave another one :D the biggest problem is i love my job, i love my friend whom i spent everyday with. but i cannot enjoy them because of,, me. and this results in me being more angry and sad. i will try to get antidepressants, i was hesitant to be honest but at this point i want to try whatever i can to lead a normal life. thank you again for your comment, and i wish you the best.", "I thought this was nice and really related to it, so I thought I would share.

It is only the last few years that it is been getting worse and I have been telling them that I just hate it and it makes me angry. \n\n\nHow do I tell them that I cannot ignore the sound, that I cannot be tolerant towards it. They do not feel the same as me, how can I make it clear to them how I feel? I have been trying for these last few years to no avail...\n\n\nPlease help. The only way I have found of explaining it is giving an example based on something that bothers them. My mom hates when my dad stomps his feet, I explained to her that when she chews with her mouth open, for me, it is like sitting at the table with someone who stomps their feet the entire meal. Excerpt worse bc it does not just annoy me, it makes me physically ill. Anyway, have you tried that? Yes, but they still think I am joking about it. Ah, that sucks :/ I wish you better luck in the future It is a disability. You cannot change it. You do not do it on purpose. They should please close their mouth when they chew. That is also manners. Perhaps tell them if they hate it they can pay for some cbt therapy Show them this\n\nMisophonia is a disorder not something to choose and some can argue it is a disability. once you are in the presence of a trigger sound, the fight or flight reaction kicks in causing anger and many other emotions such as disgust, or fear. \n\nMost parents do not understand misophonia for a long time for so long my parents did not and putting your child down for having it can leave long term affects. \n\nYour son/ daughter could begin to feel guilt and anger at thereselve for having misophonia, which trust me I have been going through that and I do not wish it on anyone. \n\nMisophonia dosent just stop and it can be hard to imagine your kid having a disorder that you cannot stop. However putting them down is a harmful-destructive behavior, which can have long term affects on your relationship with them and their mental health.", "At what point does it become misophonia? I do not think anybody likes the sound of snoring, but is it your reaction to it that defines if you have it or not? Like a \u201dnormal\u201d person would not really mind or care and could probably calm down but one with misophonia becomes really angry and feels helpless? A normal person might feel agitated/ annoyed whereas someone with misophonia would need to exit the room or wake up their partner to make the noise stop. This comes from my personal experience anyway. I usually fall asleep before my partner but if I do not I will either use noise cancelling headphones with brown noise or I will sleep downstairs on the sofa. Ok thx", "Sometimes I wish I were her.  i-is that helen keller LMFAOOO Home boy, that is a little weird. Lol, as someone with misophonia and misokinesia, the point I am making is that I feel like shutting off my vision and hearing so I would not have to worry about avoiding triggers 24/7. Obviously I know actually losing vision and hearing like Helen Keller is extremely unfortunate and disabling, but it can feel like I want to do that in the heat of the moment whilst experiencing a trigger. I gotcha, did not want to throw shame or anything. I sometimes wish I could not hear either.", "Sleeping with misophonia Sleeping/trying to get to sleep with misophonia is the worst thing ever. Especially when the heater/air conditioner is a trigger. I used to cry myself to sleep almost every night. I started wearing in ear earbuds but it never drowned out the noise. \n\nFlash forward to years later and I got Bose sound cancelling headphones. \n\nAs some of you probably know, headphones are impossible to sleep in unless on your back. \n\nBUT my dad traced one side view of my headphones onto a memory foam pillow and cut a headphone hole into my pillows. Now I can sleep with them on and it is such a nice sleep. The most peace I could possibly feel not living by myself. I could never imagine sleeping without them now. \n\nJust a helpful tip for those of you who struggle to sleep because of misophonia\u2764\ufe0f I use a traveler neck pillow for the same reason. Also, your dad loves you very much. This is so sweet \ud83e\udd7a it makes me miss my Dad.  This condition can be unbearable sometimes but your father loves you OP (For reference, I am in my teens with a family of 6, there are not enough rooms for me to have my own room.)\n\nWell shit.\n\nI am currently sleeping downstairs on the couch for the second night because my sister is playing computer games in her room. Clicking and typing are some of my biggest triggers, and her keyboard is so loud that my headphones cannot cancel it out. I also do not want to sleep in my back.\n\nThis sucks. I want to cry. ): i feel you, my family triggers me all the time. maybe try convince her to buy a soundless keyboard and mouse? if it is disrupting your sleep then she might understand :( She has a soundless mouse and she really likes her keyboard now. She bought it with her own money. Besides, she will not understand. She knows I have misophonia but always tells me I am selfish and dramatic, I never take her into consideration, she is called me a \u2018fucking bitch\u2019, told me that I and my misophonia were a joke, her friends have insulted me because she is on Facetime, I do not really expect her to understand. oh no that sounds awful :( for some reason family never seems to take misophonia seriously. i am so sorry that you are going through this, hopefully she will realise how badly it affects you soon. She understands sometimes... But always seems to want her own way. I mean, when I typed that comment, it was 4 am. I still could not go to sleep. My family is becoming better about it but I still get blamed. i get what you mean, people always blame the person with misophonia rather than themselves. hopefully soon she will come to her senses and realise that you are being hurt. hope it all gets better for you soon Thank you, I will be okay. :) I am so sorry this is happening to you. Being stuck in a situation that you cannot get away from trigger is the worst. I am so so sorry. One day, you will live alone and in peace :( Its because you cannot choose family you just get a genetic crap chute", "One year anniversary and giveaway updates! Hey, everyone!\n\nI wanted to make a quick post about two things: our year anniversary or this sub and an update on the giveaway that we ran during February.\n\nCan you believe it is been a year? I cannot! We have grown so much over the last year and it is all thanks to you all for supporting us and adding content. We would not be here without you all, so thank you for everything!\n\nIn addition to that, u/TelephoneMelon and I have been talking about updating the Wiki to reflect some new stuff, including the background to why r/misophoniasupport exists side-by-side with r/misophonia. If there are any things you would like to see updates or changed in the Wiki or on our sub overall, leave a comment below.\n\nNow the fun part...\n\nThe giveaway! We shut down the giveaway post at the end of February and pulled a name from the comments to win. After talking to that person, they did get back to us in time to order the headphones before we would have drawn another name, and we have decided to give them a new flair option as the winner of our February 2020 giveaway.\n\n**The winner is... u/The_Ampersand_Monkey! Congratulations!**\n\nWe hope to do some more giveaways in the future, so if you have any suggestions to what we should give away or how we can raise money to do more, let us know!\n\nWe have had a wonderful year with you all! Cannot wait to see where the future takes us.\n\nYour loving and grateful mods,\nu/feuxdevigne and u/TelephoneMelon Thank you for all you do!", "Why yes, yes it is.  I really enjoyed this meme.", "Can misophonia be triggered by certain words?  I also have words that bother me like this for no reason. Not sure if it is related to misophonia or not, but I have always been that way. \u2018Moist\u2019 triggering misophonia is a meme. I have seen people freak out over that word. I am not personally triggered by any words. I do not think you are overreacting in the slightest. I feel awful imagining what you are going through - and I do not even have misophonia. \n\nI wish there was an easy answer to how to make people with misophonia feel at ease, but I am still searching for it myself.\n\nFor now, I just want you to know that \u2014 regardless of what it might seem like \u2014 there are so many more people out there that will understand, sympathise, and try their best to avoid triggering you (if they are aware of the issue at hand). \n\nSo perhaps my only suggestion is to communicate with those you talk to - inform them of misophonia and inform them of your triggers (not necessarily by vocalising them). And if they do not comply - I do not think they are worth your time. I have misophonia and this word-trigger thing as well. I call it WordHate (which was ( although I do not think his version is misophonia-related).\n\nI get irrationally angry when I hear or read the words \"milk\", \"meal\", \"salad\", \"yummy\", \"kiddos\" and \"doggos\". In fact whenever I see Reddit posts with those words in them, I quickly hide them. Certain misspellings trigger a similar reaction, and especially misused apostrophes. And then there is certain \"elisions\" (I believe they are called), where people will omit syllables e.g. \"SarNightLive\" or \"Sannercisco\" for Saturday Night Live or San Francisco. That makes me boil with anger. Or when people say e.g. \"Bronco game\" instead of \"Broncos game\". It goes on and on...\n\nWhen I first met my wife, I noticed she would refer to other families just by their last name, e.g. \"Andersons are coming over tomorrow\" (as opposed to \"*The* Andersons are coming over...\") That sent me into a bizarre rage and caused huge fights, and the whole thing was very confusing for both of us. But there was no denying that that simple missing word caused me immense discomfort.\n\nSo I sympathize with you, friend.\n\nThe only thing that I have found that helps is to just encourage myself to not wallow in my discomfort (Ugh, I hate that word \"wallow\"). For me, if I let myself stew about it, it only gets worse. That is easier said than done, obviously, but if I can somehow distract myself, change the scenery and move past it, at least then I do not end up spiraling with rage about a word or phrase. Hello. I have been complaining about this issue on the sub for months. This is what I have coined Misonomia - The Hatred of Names. For me my trigger word is the name of my trigger stimulus, which basically causes me serious pain and discomfort upon hearing my trigger name. It is gotten so bad that any word the sounds like the trigger name is also a trigger as well as potentially the word is reverse (especially when reading it).\n\nIf you are struggling with this, I highly recommend the chrome addon SwappitySwap. Which allows you to swap your trigger word with a word that is not a trigger (Keep in mind this does not work for images with the trigger word though). Here is a link to the addon:\n\nAlso remember that swapping the trigger word is case sensitive, such as the trigger word with all caps, capital letters at the beginning, all lower case etc. Are you sure? Is there anyone that you lived with or were around that could have caused you this issue? Hello.\n\nI have personally coined this particular type of trigger condition as misonomia - the hatred of names. It really sucks, but there is a way that it can be avoided via text.\n\nAllow me to introduce you to swappity swap, a chrome addon that allows you to swap your trigger word with a non triggering word. Here is a link to it:\n\nI hope it helps. That is amazing; I am installing it now. Thank you! There is been speculation that I have complex ptsd, if that is what you are asking. I guess what I meant by, 'they bother me for no reason' was there is no logical reason that they bother me. I cannot thank you enough for your kindness. What you said is exactly what I needed to hear, and it is great to know that I am not alone. Yes, but what caused the PTSD in the first place? Repeated childhood trauma. I have a theory actually that a lot of people with misophonia also suffer from complex ptsd Wow, I wish I could of found this addon sooner! Thank you so much for this. You are spectacular! I am the exact same way you are. When one of my family members say one of my trigger words or something in a specific tone, I will feel like screaming at them. \n\nMisspellings and mispronunciations bother me as well. My dad mispronounces \"mage\" as \"mange\" and it really irritates me. Of course, the list of loathsome words and phrases can go on and on... \n\nDistractions work the best for me - if I can distract myself, that is. Otherwise, I will ruminate over it and fall into a bundle of overwhelming emotions.\n\nThank you for your sympathy and know that I sympathize with you, too. So did I. I actually regret being ignorant of it in the days before I found it. It would have saved me a ton of trouble. Indeed. Also did your trigger word get repeated a lot when you were around your trigger sources when they were giving you toxic levels of stress? Oddly enough, the words that trigger me are completely unrelated to any trauma I experienced. Oh really? Do tell of your experience if you can remember it for what might have caused it. Honestly, I could not say. I have seen some of your posts too and it seems like a lot of this is a mystery Same here. Again, thank you!\n\nI hope you do not mind me asking, but what is your worst misophonia trigger? Talking is mine. When I listen to people talk, it feels like my ear drums are about to rupture - especially if they are talking loudly. \n\nAlso, do you have any words that you make you feel relaxed or happy?", "do you take medication for misophonia? if so, which one/s and has it helped in any way? i am asking as i am currently switching medication and to what that will be is up to me, though i am still taking Setraline at 100mg and prior to that Fluoxetine. I cannot remember for the life of me an old post that had a discussion about medications and a few were mentioned that i would not heard of before but the names of them and the title of the post are beyond me, so it would be great to get some insight from people who deal with condition and not psychiatrists taking stabs in the dark :) can i pm you? comment to commenters: Please only recommend prescription medication only as to not violate rule 4. sure can :) I noticed SSRIs help me a lot  I take Horizant and Neudexta in addition to anxiety medication. All of it helps. It does not make the misophonia go away, but it helps. I take fluoxetine for depression and anxiety and I think it is really helped my misophonia as well. I still find sounds annoying, but it is not as emotionally distressing as it used to be. Also, I have noticed sleep has a HUGE effect on my tolerance for trigger sounds, so I try to make an effort to sleep for 8 hours. Also, I sleep with earplugs and that has really improved my quality of sleep. my psychiatrist recommended me risperidon, it is as useful as swallowing dirt ah, thank you for this. mine also recommended me it last session and tbh i was not too sure on it plus i already found possible medication that will not only work for my misophonia but other mental issues :/ I have noticed the exact same thing with that med and other SSRIs and so has my family! It is not that they go away but boy does it dampen things...I think this is worth some clinical research", "Misophonia and Culture? So my roommate is my best friend but his eating sounds drive me INSANE.\n\nHe is from Nigeria and I have noticed that there is different mannerisms when it comes to eating food. \n\nHe loves eating chicken so he will eat the meat off and then like such his teeth and pick his teeth with a toothpick for an hour after.\n\nHe also eats so many apples and takes huge bites and it is so loud that I can hear it from my room.\n\nAlso when he eats cereal/yogurt the sound of the spoon scraping the ceramic bowl drives me crazy.\n\nThere is obviously no nice way to say that it is disgusting and grossing me out so how would people handle this situation?\n\nI just shut my door or leave and put on music but I have noticed that when I get my period I am especially sensitive to sounds (mostly people eating). From my experience, this is a balancing act between offending the person and getting your point across. \n\nIf they are open minded, they might listen to a discussion about Misophonia. You can tell them about it and see where that goes. Keep in mind, it might take more than one discussion. The only thing you can do is try to convince the person that your issue is legitimate enough for them to make some accommodations -  if they are not open to that, then there is not much one can do aside from find a new roommate, in my humble opinion. \n\nWhenever I have this discussion with people, I like to focus on a few specific things:\n\n* I am not telling you to avoid eating, I am trying to say that the noises cause me pain and discomfort. There is likely a solution where we can both reasonably accommodate each other. \n* I am open to changing my habits to cope with my Misophonia. I am not only asking for you to change; I am asking for help, suggestions, and for you to work with me. If there is something I can do to prevent hearing these noises, I will do it. \n\nBeyond that, it is important to realize that perception of the illness is half the battle. Try to be persuasive here, do not let your anger get the best of you. Telling people that they are being disgusting is not the way to get what you want here. It is in your best interest to communicate what you want concisely, firmly, and politely. Offending someone is the opposite of what you want, so I like to play it cool, but firm.\n\nTry to also have a plan here. Understand that a person can only reasonably change so much, and try to think of something that will work for both of you. I personally try to do as much as I can from my end of the bargain, so that any change to that person's lifestyle will be minimal. I know it is not the same, but my partner will let me know when they are going to eat and I will leave the room, put headphones on, or leave the house. I leave, they continue with their life. It is me doing most of the work, but it still takes mutual effort to pull off. Just an example, might not be relevant to your particular situation. \n\nPart of having a plan is also to understand when you are sensitive. This might also involve letting someone know when you are feeling this way, and maybe you can take extra precautions. Some days my Misophonia gets so bad that I do not have anything to compare it to. On these days, I will usually let my partner know and we keep a larger distance. \n\nAnother random thought I would add is: do not expect it to be fixed immediately. Sometimes roommates and friends take a while to come around. For many, avoiding someone while they make these particular noises is completely foreign to them. It may take multiple polite discussions or sending research articles to the person before they start remembering to do certain things. Be patient and resilient. \n\nTake my advice lightly - I am just some random on the internet. Regardless, I do hope you sort it out. I hope you manage a trigger free environment. Live by yourself", "Saw this and it reminded me that sounds can be good too.

My roommate dropped out of college and moved out of our room today, and so far I am thriving because no more loud eating sounds (I had to wear two sets of noise cancelling headphones to block her out. Earbuds with headphones over them. It was bad), but this made me think, does everyone with misophonia have food/mouth related triggers? I feel like it is the most common trigger but I genuinely do not know anyone else that has misophonia so I do not know if there are people out there that have severe misophonia like I do but without sensitivity to mouth sounds. I cannot imagine having it and not hating those kinds of noises but it would be wild if any of you guys are that way ! I think mouth sounds were the worst for me growing up and figuring out that I was different. However, there are several different sounds that are far more excruciating for me. I have never had mouth sounds be a trigger, but have a slew of other triggers Wild ! So people eating loudly does not bother you ? never had it but i did develop it after exposure to hearing that it is a common trigger. heard it everywhere, thought about it a lot and somehow developed it. Mouth sounds are my first and number one trigger. Next is whistling. I feel ya dude. I give myself triggers a lot. I never used to have a problem with sniffling until I heard that other people were sensitive to it and then I was hyper aware of people around me sniffling and now it drives me absolutely insane Loud kids upstairs really will make be in a constant state of adrenaline Mine is tongue clicking. Like when someone calls a cat I lose my mind and hit my head and ears over and over. I am covered in bruises and scars. I hate it so much, I just want to live. My misophonia is relatively new too, it only started around March of this year. Yep, they do not bother me! I feel very blessed in that respect", "Co-worker from hell. I feel like I am going crazy, my co-worker is one of the worst people I have had the displeasure of working with. \n\nShe eats very loudly about 8 times a day every hour and will take 20 minutes to a whole hour to finish what she is eating, so its pretty much constant. Its not just me over reacting about the chewing either, I sit alone in an office with her but occasionally we have a part time co-worker who comes in and eats at her desk and I dont even hear it! She also loves to lick her fingers after shes done with whatever shes eating.\n\nWhen she is not eating she has frequent coughing fits because she smokes and blows her nose all day. She also swallows super loud randomly.\n\nShe has a very very loud voice that makes it difficult to hear anyone when i am talking on the phone and hard for them to hear me too, I have even had someone comment that she was too loud. Most of the time when she talks I can barely think and have to pause what i am listening to because I cant hear it over her.\n\nI wear earphones all day and even then her chewing, talking and coughing gets through. I also hate wearing them constantly, it hurts and sometimes I just want to sit in silence.\n\nI do feel awful sometimes because she is a nice person and maybe if we were not in the same room I might like her, but theres no where else I can move to and I honestly think I might just quit all over this one person. :( Oh geez, I would add a trigger warning to this. I have anxiety just thinking about your situation! Is there anything you can say to HR? Maybe there is policy against eating all day? Or maybe they can let you work remotely? Good luck! Unfortunately its a small business and we dont have HR, I would have to speak directly to the boss. I am very worried about people thinking i am an asshole for it too. So weird that I had literally the exact same situation. Same room. Eating 56 times per day. Like no meals.. just snacking ALL day. I hated my job anyways so I quit but my misophonia has taken a turn for the better since leaving a job that triggered me daily. Jesus, between the smoking and all the eating, how much does she actually work?\n\nIs this a career or just a job to pay the bills?  If it is just a job, then I would suggest leaving.\n\nCould you adjust your hours?  If she came in at 8, could you come in at 9?  Also you should consider going out for lunch or running an errand.", "I am at the point where I genuinely cannot stand my father. He is unbearable and I need to get the fuck out of this house as soon as I can. I(17M) am fucking fuming. I am so angry I am in tears. My father is the most inconsiderate fucking PIG I have ever met in my life. If you have misophonia, try and picture your worst nightmare. I promise you that whatever you think of is no match for my father. Not only is he so fucking disgusting and obnoxious, he also makes zero effort to try and help me out. I told my mom about my misophonia and she laughed at me. I literally feel like I am going to hurt someone and I am at the point where I genuinely hate my father. I am starting to have the urge to hurt myself and I am going to start breaking things soon. I was so angry that I almost snapped my phone in half just an hour ago. I am desperate please help me. How can I deal with this anger? I am so sorry you are dealing with this! I used to spend a lot of time in my room or outside with headphones on. It is definitely tough with digital learning having to be around them so much. Headphones are great, and earplugs. There is no cure for misophonia, but it may be worth seeing a counsellor or therapist. Of course, this will not cure it but may help you cope with your anger and find healthy coping methods until you can move out. yeah.. my intolerance to certain sounds and my father's inability to at least try to eat like a human ruined my feelings towards him too. I just refuse to eat with him (my family makes a point about eating a meal together.. I just do not do it) and whenever he starts to eat I leave the room. i do not think there is more than we can do.. I am sorry you cannot leave and have to live like this I doubt these parents would be receptive to that, let alone pay for it. I got my own place at 17 and never looked back. I still love my parents, but misophonia makes us loners pretty often. I know this does not help much, but just stay strong and hang in there. You are nearly old enough to leave home. You can do this :) I have been avoiding eating with my parents since I was 9 (!?!) and every time they ate apples I was just fleeing the room. This would not have been such an issue if my mom did not make such a big fvcking drama about it, coming into my room after me, screaming and telling me how *insensitive* i was, slamming the door etc.\n\nMakes me sad remembering it lol Please do not hurt your self, we are all in this together. You have friends here, even if your parents do not understand we do. Can you tell me more about the situation and your triggers? ugghhhhh, I hate the \"You are being insensitive\", \"You are being rude\". No bitch, I am trying to stop this literal mental abuse. If you cannot see how badly this is upsetting me there is something wrong with you. My dad snapped at me for wanting to be excused early from dinner today, and I sat there with tears literally streaming from my face as I had to listen to their chewing. They did not do anything, and my mum kept up this falsetto 'everything is fine' tone, chattering away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nside note, when you are angry from triggers, do other sounds that do not normally trigger you make you angry? When I am being triggered I cannot stand the sound of my mum's eunciation of consonants, for some reason. It does not bother me usually I have actually been seeing a therapist. It is not helpful. I do not think I got the best therapist because she seems to think it is not really a big deal and does not really have helpful advice Unfortunately the thought of leaving home scares me a little bit although I absolutely love it when my parents leave the house I live in a house with my mom and dad. I love both of my parents but they are pretty loud. My father is unbearable. He yawns obnoxiously, has recently started sniffling constantly, and chews his food like a barn animal. I have listened to him eat food before and thought \u201cthere is no way that he actually eats like that. It is impossible to have that little awareness\u201d. Unfortunately it is at the point where I hate being at home because of it and I hate being around my parents (especially my dad) even more. I am sorry to hear that. Well hang in there, I hope everything goes ok for you and luckily you can move out soon. Contact a Doctor.\n\nForm a short clear letter.\n\nWrite the list of triggers. Write the reactions you feel in detail. Muscles tense up? Neck tense? Dizziness? Wave of rage and anger? Utter depression. Anxiety. Insomnia. Social anxiety. Migraines.\n\nFocus on those reactions they are medical problems and send this letter to as many doctors and clinics as you can find. \n\nBecause you parents are the cause, I would shift the problem to being migraines, social anxiety and insomnia.\n\nBasically, stop communicating with parents. Avoid them at all costs. When they start to enquire why, or just simply call for you, every time claim you are getting migraine which is crippling you. The migraine means you must be left alone... Loud noises, small noises near you cause the migraine.\n\nForget misophonia. No one wants to bother believing in it.\n\nClaim it is migraine, insomnia or anxiety attack and in order to avoid these and also recover from them, you need silence. \n\nThis puts the ball in your parents court. They certainly will know what migraines, anxiety and insomnia are, so use those medical problems as the issue... Then simply claim it is the constant noises today which caused yet another migraine.\n\nThis can spiral too. The noise caused migraine. The migraine caused insomnia. The insomnia causes anxiety, which in turn causes migraine which is compounded by the constant noises. \n\nNo need to explain this to your parents. Just use each section of the downward spiral, change it up every time they cause your misophonia to trigger. \n\nSo now it is not some crazy unheard of disease and all your problem... Now the issue is you get migraines and medical problems which can only be cured via peace and quiet and being left alone. Migraine sufferers need to be alone when they are having attack. Same with someone who has not slept all night. \n\nVery quickly your folks should move to help, \"do you need water?\" \"Hope you sleep better\" \"we will try and keep it down today till you are better\" ... Then after a few weeks of this they should be helping you find s Doctor. They will feel the guilt from causing your migraines and insomnia. It is less about the actual triggers which they will take personally, and more about them trying to cure or stop you getting migraines. Move out. Wtf are you waiting for? I am 18 and broke. Get noise canceling headphones and work on getting financially independent. You call your dad a disgusting pig and hate him, but he is making otherwise normal sounds. So in normal world, your reaction makes no sense. In normal world, you do not hate your dad for making sounds. You hate your dad for physical and mental abuse. Its only in miso world where normal sounds = physical and mental abuse. Normal world will not adjust, so you have to. \n\nEveryone in this forum has the same damn complaint, and the same solution applies. There is no magic pill here.", "I cannot stand my coworkers voice and I feel bad about it \nSo I work in an office and there is an older woman who sits a few cubicles down from me (she is in a different department than I am). Her voice sounds like she literally smoked 10 packs of cigarettes every single day for the last 20 years and hearing her talk actually upsets me even though I know she does not have control over how her voice sounds. But that is not the worst part. Throughout the workday, like literally once to three times per MINUTE she will clear her throat, cough, mumble, go \u201cmm\u201d, swear or talk to herself because she cannot figure out how to use the computer. I actually had to leave work early today because I was getting so agitated. The only relief i get is when she goes on a smoke break once per hour and were not allowed to listen to music or white noise while we work. \n\nCould just use some advice. Or validation. Or emotional support lol  Can you adjust your schedule to avoid her?  If she comes in early, could you come in later?\n\nCould you go out to lunch?  You would not have to go out to eat.  You could run an errand or go window shopping. Because of my school schedule, unfortunately I cannot I can relate, some people\u2019s voices drive me insane and I also feel bad because they cannot help it. That really sucks your workplace does not allow headphones! There is some sort of earplug that blends in with your skin, forgot what it is called though. Maybe look that up. do not feel bad, please. It is not your responsibility to care for everyone in the world. Just do your best to deal with it but do not beat yourself up. You have a serious condition and it sucks that she will likely never understand. I know people try to act like you are mean or evil just because you cannot handle the feeling of being abused. And it might just be a sound, but it is not just a sound. It is your brain and headspace that needs love and care. You deserve to feel comfort too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a stinky addict who smokes and I sound annoying, and if you felt that way about me it would be OKAY. Your boundaries matter even if they are difficult to tip toe around. If we were friends and I knew you personally? I would do everything in my power to never trigger you. And if I triggered you so much you could not stand to be my friend? Well I would just have to accept that, it would suck, because i care a lot about people with our condition. It is friggen hell :C  \n\n\nmisophonia really is the worst. You might just have to throw in the towel and get a new job.", "Strong aversion to my dog grooming. Should I really not get a cat? Cat owners, help me out? Hey there, I am new here, recently coming to terms with the fact that I have misophonia. I have one sound that drives me insane, and it is the sound of my dog licking his paws. Something about that atrocious repetitive noise (I also cannot handle someone chewing gum with their mouth open for the similar sound, but it is less of a trigger).\n\nBut at this point, I have grown up with dogs my whole life, and I currently live alone with just this one dog. He licks his paws a fair amount, but he is learned that I go insane when he does it -- so I usually just poke him or give a 'shh' or get his attention in any way and it works after a sec, but in times when he did not stop immediately, I have gone into full screaming fits that I felt horrible for a minute later. I love my dog very much, and he is a spoiled brat, he is okay, no worries there. Nowadays he usually stops once I have poked him once or twice, and if he does not, I will just excuse myself to my room and close the door (still raging, but at least no screaming fits lately, I have been better at managing that).\n\nI have been wanting to get a cat, but I have never really lived with one. My family has been notorious for having dogs only. Anyone out there who has had both dogs and cats, can let me know what your opinion is on which animal is more triggering to have? Because I feel like cats are usually more silent with their licking, and maybe I could get desensitised to it, but they also might do it a lot more often, and I am worried I will not be able to handle a full day of stressing -- rather than a dog who only does it a handful of times a day. And would a cat be able to learn that I do not like their grooming like my dog eventually learned (at least in the sense that he responds to me poking him and knows to stop)?\n\nAny advice appreciated, thank you! Cats groom their whole body and they do it often. The sounds are not always the same and some of them are bound to trigger you at some point. You CANNOT make them stop, it is healthy for them. It keeps them clean and relaxed. I have multiple cats and I always have earplugs with me - when they start grooming themselves, I put them in. But it is cruel to stop them from doing so. If you do not think you could cope in a similar, non disruptive way, do not get a cat. Cats can be wild while in heat (for reasons different than grooming) but they are tolerable. I have two cats: one does not make any noise and the other very little noise but definitely hearable. It still triggers me a bit just watching, so when I know they are doing it I just make sure they are out of my sight and I cannot hear them. It does not last very long luckily. With humans, if they make a sound that is difficult for us we can have a conversation about it and explain why it is problematic. We cannot have that conversation with animals. and trying to train out their basic instinct to keep themselves clean is not healthy for them and can make them confused or anxious long term.\n\nMy cats will not stop grooming if I give them a gentle poke, I learned this as my misophonia was starting to develop and I was in the 'panic at sounds that are bad' phase. The only option is to either move myself or them to a different part of the house until they finish. Many times my one cat will jump up on my desk while I am working and go to town and it is awful if I am trying to concentrate. Usually I will gently pick him up and put him in the hallway outside my office and close the door for a bit. He will pause for a moment, then continue right where he left off. After a few minutes I will open the door again and he will come back and lay down and nap. \n\nThat being said, I love both my cats dearly and my life is better with them in it. All animals are different and you may end up with a cat that only grooms at night or away from you, etc. You might consider fostering first as a trial. They climb with their shitty paws all over the counters, can shed like mofos, whinge and yowl at times, destroy furniture, and the sounds they make while eating are every bit as insufferable as those made by a dog licking its paws. You decide. Cats are not as loud as dogs when they groom, but they can make licking noises, as well as crunching on kibble when they eat. They groom themselves a lot more frequently than dogs. Some cats also snore when they sleep. I have a cat and she never triggered my misophonia, but in general animal eating noises do not bother me as much as people eating. Many people here have said all true things, and I am just going to agree with them.\n\nI have only lived with a dog for a few years now (a large breed) and he makes a fair share of noise when eating and licking his paws.\n\nBut my cats are the same, if not worse. Any animal makes noise really, my rabbit makes the most excruciating swallowing sounds when she drinks water, and my cat is no exception. Cats groom their entire body all day, every day. They can be less loud than a dog, but when you are in a quiet room with just a grooming kitty- its the loudest noise on earth. My cat in particular likes to clean in between his toenails with his teeth...disgusting, truly... and you can hear him bite and suck on the nails. sorry for that description. He cleans his entire body as well, which is less unpleasant but still noisy, and he does it all day long. Not sure if a cat is best..  I have five cats. Mostly, they make pleasant purring noise. One of them, however, LOVES to lick and lick and lick, and it drives me batsh\\*t crazy. He always likes to do it when he is close to us, or at night. So it depends on the cat. I need to start keeping earplugs on me at all times. Instead of yelling at my cats.", "Mild eating disorder due to misophonia  \n\nEating sounds are a trigger, and my own sounds trigger me. It is leading to some unhealthy eating habits.\n\n1. I often find that I do not chew my food well enough, which leads to gagging and choking. It is getting worse as I get older, too. I am afraid that I am going to choke to death alone in my car or something. My husband taught me how to do the Heimlich on myself with a chair.\n2. Sometimes I just do not eat at all, because I do not want to hear it.\n3. Oftentimes, I will watch TV or read the news while eating to distract myself from the sounds. Then I find I am not mindful of how much I am eating and wind up over eating.\n\nHas anyone else had to navigate this? It seems almost impossible to drown out your own sounds. Thanks. First off, I am so sorry you have to deal with this. Just curious, have you ever tried wearing earplugs when you eat? Or maybe trying to drown out the offensive sounds with loud music, a fan, or something else that would not bother you? I do not know if it would help but it would be worth a try if you have not. It is hard to fully drown out sound that reverberates in your own skull. :/ Mostly I am motivated by shame. Shame of not taking care of myself by not eating and shame at the thought that someone finds me choked to death on a cheesy blaster. Does this happen with certain foods? Or certain textures? For example, if crunchy foods are especially troublesome, maybe you could find an alternative for those foods.\nIt may be something you have thought of before, but I hope this helps. Good luck in the future, I hope things improve! oh man, earplugs make it WAY worse", "At my wits end. Just venting. I had a full on mental breakdown last night because I have HAD IT with having roommates. I am seriously spiraling downwards mentally because I N E V E R have a moment of quiet to myself. \n\nI have lived with my boyfriend and two of our friends for a year now. There is never a moment of silence in our house and I mean that quite literally. When I get home from work, one roommate is already home with the living room TV blaring. The other one comes home and blasts a podcast from his phone at full volume (never wears headphones). The upstairs bathroom is directly next to our room, and of course the podcast roommate needs to either have his podcast or music blaring during his shower. I try to sleep at night and all I can hear is the TV downstairs, my other roommate's podcast or music, or someone is walking around and slamming doors all hours of the night. I cannot drown out the sound. It is not so bad in the summer because the hum of our room air conditioner helps drown out the other noise. Winter? Forget about it. I have tried airpods (not comfortable to sleep in), white noise apps on my phone, fans, ear plugs. Nothing works. My boyfriend thinks I am nuts because we will be in our closed room watching TV and I will be getting flustered because I can hear things other than our tv that he does not even notice or think twice about. \n\nI literally started crying last night because I was so angry that I could hear podcast roomate's podcast OVER our television and my boyfriend went to go ask him to wear headphones for me, which I appreciated because I feel weird confronting people about it.  They live there too and they deserve to live as they please but holy fuck I wish it did not affect me like this. \n\nI do not understand why people cannot just enjoy silence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Darlin', I completely empathise!  \nI am making the most of my in-laws being out of the house (and the country!) until the end of this month - the house is so quiet it is bliss! No blaring TV (with potential for unnecessary levels of laughter), no thumping footsteps right as I am trying to get to sleep at night, I can watch something or just sit downstairs without someone walking in and eating like they have fasted for a week...\n\nI especially understand how you feel about hearing it even through closed doors! **You are not nuts, and not alone!**  \nWe do not have a door on the living room here, for reasons I still do not *quite* understand, and the kitchen door is never closed unless someone is cooking something (and even then, they only close it about 25% of the time), so smells keep wafting around and many make me nauseous alongside the irritation of hearing utensils smacking against pans and plates...\n\nIs there any way you and your boyfriend can find an affordable place for just the two of you? (This is what my hubs and I are currently saving for!)  \nIf not, is there a way you could bring it up (together) with your roommates and work out some kind of \"quiet time\" schedule?\n\nOkay, this got longer than I intended...\n\nSending positive friendly internet hugs, if ya want  them!", "Do I have misophonia or am I just a jerk I just recently learned about misophonia after posting in r/relationships, seeking feedback on a roommate issue.\n\nMy roommate talks on the phone incessantly (seemingly). It makes me very exasperated, tense, and anxious. Someone in the thread suggested that I look into misophonia, and for the most part, I connect very strongly to what I have read. \n\nI am not effected by the more common triggers (chewing, and other bodily function noises) but the sound of my roommate talking on the phone sends me up a wall. My fight or flight definitely kicks in and I experience emotional distress and rage. I cannot stop thinking about it. It is so bad that in the moments where she is not talking on the phone (she works three days a week), it is like I cannot enjoy the quiet time enough, because I know that it will end soon.\n\nI am having a hard time feeling like I am not justified in my reaction to her though (my level of discomfort does, however, feel disproportionate). She talks loudly and basically puts on a performance every phone call. She digs deep in her belly to force out laughter, she squeals in reaction to things, and talks at a volume like she is trying to get the attention of a school bus full of kids. She speaks on speaker phone as well. This can go on for up to eight hours a day on four days out of the week, and at least three hours on the other days where she does work. She can be on the phone as early as 7:30am and as late as 10pm. She also wakes me up every morning with her coffee routine between 6am-7:30am or so, but that almost feels unrelated.\n\nI live in a 1,000 square foot apartment with two roommates total. It just seems unconscionable to create that much noise in a shared living space. It feels like the sound she creates takes up physical space and forces me to the corners of my own living space and I do not have any space for myself.\n\nBut I am told I am wrong haha. Which I get. \n\nReading about this disorder, I realize that I have experienced this sort of rage in other instances in my past. I have a distinct memory of feeling tortured by the sound of my dog whining. My cat meowing at me or pawing at things to get my attention also cut through me. I have at least three other specific memories of taking coach buses and wanting to die from listening to other people's conversations. I also feel like I feel claustrophobic easily, but do not know if that is attributable to sounds. The sound of my roommate's slippers on the floor is really aggravating, but I had been chalking that up to bitterness and resentment, until now.\n\nI have been keeping my air conditioner on the fan setting for over a year, not realizing that I was using that as white noise to cope. I have been wearing headphones that block out a fair amount of noise. I have been taking CBD and melatonin to feel less stress and get restful sleep. I plan errands out of the apartment on days she is there. I have been volunteering on days that she is not working (I am unemployed due to the pandemic). I plan long bike rides on days she is in the apartment.\n\nThis is by far the most challenging part of the quarantine for me, and it is so unexpected. My anger from this turns into resentment towards her - which I do not want. I feel like I am expending so much time and energy to cope around behavior that - to me - seems so selfish. She gets to act like herself and I do not get to. It feels unfair. \n\nThe fact that every piece of advice that I have read from google searches and my post in another sub is that I am wrong to feel this way and she is doing nothing wrong, makes me feel so disjointed from reality. So discovering this sub and the information on this disorder has been helpful. Thanks for reading. I would say it sounds really similar to my misophonia. And you are definitely not a jerk, you obviously cannot help but feel this way and understand that it is not normal. Thanks, the layers of emotions with this get complicated. First I feel like she is being a jerk, then I feel like a jerk, then I feel like she is a jerk for creating a situation that makes me feel like a jerk, and then typing all of this really makes me feel like a jerk.\n\nWhich is why support groups exist I suppose lol You have misophonia. Triggers do not have to be \u201ctypical.\u201d I get triggered by my MIL (we rent a basement apartment from them) stomping up the stairs in her bare feet and shutting the bathroom door without turning the handle multiple times a day. Unfortunately, my husband has a chronic cough that sometimes makes me want to climb walls. My dogs licking themselves makes me insane. Seek support now, but in the long run you will have to learn healthy coping behaviors like meditation and relaxation or avoidance and distraction or you will feel crazy. Best wishes!! It is interesting that none of those are triggers for me, but I can imagine my reaction to them if they were.\n\nI would feel like it was a crime against humanity and an insult to common decency and a direct personal attack...that someone could not just turn the doorknob before they close the door lol. Oy this is going to be a long haul thing, is not it. I hope you are surviving during the lockdowns Thank you! Just thinking about that damn door handle right now is making my heart pound and my head throb lol. Headphones and earplugs for daysssss! You are not alone, and if you want to talk I am here for you. Having had it for so long, I have discovered that some of the triggers happen out of any combination of the following:\na) not having the control to stop the noise from happening.\nb) I am unable to express to the person how it makes me feel.\nc) I can express how I feel but they dismiss me.\nd) I am generally stressed out.\ne) I have an issue with the person, or they have crossed a boundary, and I have not been able to address it with them.\nf) the person annoys me in general.\n\nIn my experience, when I notice what is happening in my body and accept those feelings and sensations as they happen, while focusing on my breath, I can feel the rage and irritation melt away...**most** of the time.\nI find that if I have an issue with someone, and I address it with them, their chewing is less likely to irritate me afterwards, especially if they follow thru with their side of the agreement.  If they do not, I tend to get **more** annoyed when they chew.\n\nIn this case, I doubt this person is going to change. If it were me, I would move out (or kick her out) and keep a good distance. I might even end the friendship if she did not bring any value to me as a friend (i.e. if she rarely respects my needs and wishes.)\n\nOr, you could raise the issue with her. Explain how her behavior of talking loudly on the phone at all hours is disruptive and uncomfortable, this is a shared **home** not an office, and yes, understood we are in a pandemic, is there a way she can compromise? Have set office hours? So you and the other roommate can plan ahead. It is really not fair for YOU to have to be the one to leave all the time, it is your home too, SHE can take her calls somewhere else sometimes. Thank you for your feedback. Your characterization of it is really helpful.\n\nIt is honestly very surprising to me that I have not heard any other response that sounds like your last paragraph. It just feels so correct - even if she might be in the vicinity of being reasonable - that she somehow is crossing a line that I am allowed to address.\n\nI think I will very likely bring it up to her in these terms. That her behavior is creating a lot of work for me to adapt to and before I continue to work to accommodate her, could she consider thinking of ways she could help balance the situation. Something to that effect. I am worried that if I bring up a condition or disorder that I only read about online that she would dismiss it (with somewhat fair reason, I suppose).\n\nI do not want to ask her to move and I am definitely not moving (I have been in this apt four times as long as she has and it is furnished with my belongings). But I have a strong tendency to not recognize when it is time to end a relationship until long after things stop working (we are not a couple though, btw). &gt;I am worried that if I bring up a condition or disorder that I only read about online that she would dismiss it\n\nYes, I discovered early on that people dismiss things they do not understand. It took most of my adult life to learn how to set boundaries without explaining myself (still a work in progress!) to avoid people dismissing me for misophonia (which I did not even know what it was for the longest time.)\n\nIn my experience, loud people are used to others asking them to tone it down and are way more accommodating than I expected them to be. (Or, they lose their shit, depends on lots of factors lol.)\n\n&gt;I have a strong tendency to not recognize when it is time to end a relationship until long after things stop working\n\nSame here. I split up with my emotionally abusive ex last year after 30+ years. So. Yeah I totally get it. I am better about getting out of toxic friendships or work environments, but still, I am in it way longer than someone with solid boundaries would. \n\nGood luck, I hope it goes well for you!! Thank you, again you are feedback is very, very helpful I also do not really like that, and I do not really care to hear peoples' phone conversations.  Also there seems to be a trend these days of people using video chat and having people on speakerphone, which I think makes it worse because you have to hear both people.  I am not sure if it is misophonia or people just not being considerate when having a phone conversation near other people.  \n\n\nOn a somewhat related note, I had job where I worked in close proximity to another person who sometimes talked on the phone - He did not use speakerphone or anything, so I could not hear the other person, and sometimes he would burst out in laughter (and could be rather loud) at something the other person said.  Going from quiet to sudden loud laughter in a small room would often startle me fairly bad, and one time I almost jumped out of my chair.  He was the same person who also sometimes would prepare packages for shipping right next to me, and the loud noise from tape coming from the spool of packing tape right next to me would drive me up the wall. I just read the thread on relationships and I am pretty shocked at everyone is answers that your housemate's not doing anything wrong. I have lived in sharehouses for a decade and it is a balance of being tolerant and being considerate. You need to be tolerant, but she needs to be considerate. Might be worth having a polite conversation with her about volume boundaries during lockdown, but you would have to be incredibly respectful about it and not accusatory or you will end up with bigger problems. \n\nAs for your original question, yeah that sounds a lot like misophonia. It is great you have discovered it, because everything will become a lot clearer and you can make a plan of healthy coping strategies. Although, that and being a jerk are not mutually exclusive - we have a responsibility to not take the rage out on others. It is not their fault. I am afraid that my situation might be misophonia (newly discovered) combined with a roommate who is also acting inconsiderate, even if she does not realize it. Side note: I have not mentioned it in these posts or comments, but she did ask last week if she was loud on the phone and I responded with an unequivocal Yes but nothing has changed.\n\nI can put myself in your work situation and I feel for you. Sometimes I will be doing the dishes and she will pop in and startle me. This is another \"me\" issue, but I like to cook and do not like other people in the kitchen with me. If only that were the only problem I needed to compromise on.\n\nWhen thinking of ways to bring this up to her, I have actually considered comparing it to a workspace/cubicle situation. I think people universally understand the concept of a chatty, over-noisy cubicle mate. I am really happy you said this because the fact that none of the feedback was acknowledging that there was at least some behavior that she could change was really starting to stress me out. It was like I could not deal with a situation that everyone else in the world could handle easily.\n\nFor the matter of not being a jerk and taking the rage out on others: I am totally with you on that. It is made it hard to bring up with her because I want this not to be an issue so badly that when my distress subsides, I try to convince myself that I will handle it better next time. And when I am feeling distressed, I thankfully recognize that I need to calm down before I bring it up. So it is either chest-tightening rage, or delusioned  peace-keeping lol I have kind of the similar problem. My mom and my step dad are talking really loud, the coffee machine sounds terrible and the footsteps are annoying. \n\nWhat I do most of the time is that I put on my headphones. Sometimes I would even just go outside and walk a little bit. \n\nBut I am always so thankfull when I can sleep at my boyfriends house.", "Parents have people round and I can hear them all downstairs I am going to lose it.

But it feels like so much longer. Anyway, I think a big part of this is the guilt after. At least for me. Like I am lucky, my family is so supportive and understanding of it and how it just mentally (and sometimes physically) drains me. But then, like my sweetheart of an older sister tries so hard to eat so quietly for me. And I just.. she should not have to do that.. but the fact that she does makes me feel so loved but so guilty at the same time. \n\nAnyway, if any of you guys ever feel guilty any tips on how to cope?

It could be compared to you having a broken leg and being allowed to use crutches, while the unsupportive family is like kicking that broken leg - there is no in between. \n\nYou need those crutches to function, so if you are not arrogant and are also supportive to you family when they need it, then just keep using those crutches without a guilt.", "Everything and everyone.

This one is also accompanied with tics and sometimes beating myself. \n\nI also believe misophonia is making me more tired than other people, because I am anxious and stressed 24/7. I often get headaches and I feel fatigues almost every other day. But these could be from something else aswell, I only assume it is from all the cortisol running through my veins.  I have been thinking about this too! The constant triggering definitely leads to more anxiety and higher stress levels. Also having to hide/pretend that we are ok most of the time is draining. I definitely think this leads to a chronic state that includes anxiety, fatigue, etc. Actually, I have been going through that too, so you are not the only one. I have quite a few disorders (physical and mental), though I am not sure which were caused by misophonia. As for the ones that are related: I got my first ever depressive episode because of misophonia, and now I definitely feel depressed semi-regularly (undiagnosed) and have a very low self-esteem. I started self-isolating when I was 13 because of miso and now I think I am incredibly avoidant because of this and have very few social skills. I have some symptoms of OCD (but not a clinical level), which apparently is related to misophonia though I cannot draw a connection personally. I also have TMJ (my jaw does not open correctly and hurts often), which is related to sensitivity to sounds (according to my neurologist). tics began, and from that my neck is in pain and sometimes i cannot go to school because with misophonia/kinesia and the tics it is exhausting. depression though not diagnosed, am currently in the process of getting diagnosed with ASD, there is probably something wrong with my ears because i hit them a lot, self harm was bad because of anger but i stopped and somehow substituted one coping mechanism for another and ended up with an eating disorder.... that is about it. These are really good questions!\n\nThe main thing for me, I think similarly to other kinds of traumatic experiences, is that it has burned a lot of instincts into my brain. It has completely changed the way I move my body. A big trigger for me is my own mouth sounds, so it definitely makes me eat differently. It also changes the way i am able to move my head without triggers, for example looking up or nodding are tough. My jaw is tensed pretty much all the time, even while i am sleeping. So that is definitely affecting my teeth xD . I also habitually suppress my instinct to swallow, because it is a trigger. I mainly know the effect that has on me mentally, i am not sure if it has long term effects physically. \n\nI also have selective mutism, where if I feel nervous around someone it becomes almost impossible to vocalize, and miso has definitely exacerbated that. If someone is making a trigger sound, even a close family member or friend who would normally be easy to talk to, I lose the ability to speak. \n\nMy mom also has misophonia, and I know that for her, her stomach gets very upset when she is around a trigger for too long and cannot get away. \n\nAnyway, that is everything I can think of off the top of my head, I hope it is interesting :) I grind my teeth a lot from anxiety anyway and sleep issues though I have had those since I was a kid. So with my regular anxiety I do not notice anything extra since I am used to it. However I will try pay extra attention. Thanks for bringing this to mind.\n\nFyi my misophonia is mainly eating noises. My sister had those bone conducting headphones and they really helped. I could still hear regular conversation. \n\nHowever the big test would be eating with my Dad who is the worst (due to nose issues). My family agree it is ok. But I need to buy my own instead of borrowing my sister\u2019s. I also hate my own eating noises so it would help me alone. Intense triggers make me do a violence. nothing caused by misophonia, but definitely made worse. headaches, dizziness, and nausea get worse with trigger noises, probably from anxiety. ", "Stupid ads Holy shit has anyone heard those stupid chip ads? I put my headphones on to listen to music and distract myself from the noises around me, I wear them almost all the time at this point, and then some stupid ad about chips comes up, and they literally have people chewing into the fucking mic, holy shit how does it even fit into someone is brain that chewing sounds literally INSIDE my ears is going to make me buy your stupid chips? the last thing i want to hear when I am trying to avoid triggers is \"It is a cheetos thing\" and then someone literally chewing with their mouth as open as humanly possible, who even thought that this would be a good ad thing? it is literally half a minute but it feels like an eternity listening to people chew it is impossible to deal with there is no escape from these noises Yea i feel, i think streaming services choose those ads to force people to buy their premium shit.  I know how you feel, and that one insurance commercial where they are literally sloshing the food around in their mouths annoys the ever-loving crud out of me. It is disgusting. yep, that is why i either download my music or use Spotify premium, it is worth it tbh I know how you feel, I have been getting the same takeaway delivery service ads for the past two months and it is torture. Just want to watch a video to distract myself and relax, instead I get obnoxiously loud crunch sounds that shoot anger and adrenaline straight through my veins. THISSS!! I am also baffled as to why these ads exist and annoy the hell out of me\n\nThere is a run of KFC ads I get all the time that a visual trigger central too where there is people grossly eating and the camera is zoomed super close in. Thank god adblock blocks everything on desktop, but mobile apps are just full of triggering ads Yep and so many of these ads start with the eating sound just so you have no chance of hitting the mute button in time to not hear it.

TLDR: looking for ways to support my SO in our new living situation - apartment building where we can hear footsteps above\n\nI apologize if it is inappropriate for me to post here as I am not the one dealing with misophonia - I was not sure where else to turn.\n\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over 4 years. In that time, there have been moments where I have seen her misophonia elicit the kind of rage response that I have read about, but often the sounds have come and gone or she has found ways to block them out (ear plugs, white noise machine, headphones, etc.) We recently moved to a new town and into a large apartment building. We decided to live on the second floor because of our plans to get a new puppy (we did!) but I am now regretting that decision (the 2nd floor, not the dog). It was mostly fine for the first few weeks, and then yesterday someone(s) moved in directly above us. The sound of their movements is unbearable for her - I can see the physical pain that she is in as they move about. We cannot move out - the cost of breaking the lease and moving to a new place is prohibitive for us. \n\n\nI have read all the google articles about supporting a partner/SO with misophonia and at this point they are not helpful. It is mostly listicles with advice like \"believe them\" and \"do not take it personally\" - I am already on board with those kinds of things, that is not the problem. I just cannot think of a practical way to drown out this particular noise (having TV/music on does not help) and I desperately want to support her/make this living situation easier on her because we have the better part of a year left on this lease. \n\n\nAny ideas/thoughts/feedback? Thank you for any help you can offer. I do not know if this will help, but you can go and talk tp them. Explain that it is a psychological problem and that it will really help if they made less sound. If they do not understand it or do not believe it, you can kind of explain it as like \u201cphysical pain\u201d like a headache or ear pain. That way they will understand it better. Maybe offer them some cookies to appear more friendly and kind. Wish you and your girlfriend the best of luck! Thank you, that is a great idea. Even as someone who would not normally register this kind of sound, their footsteps sound like elephants. I will definitely approach them and try to explain. Does one room in your apartment tend to not hear as much of the upstairs noise as the rest? If you are lucky and that is the case, I would try to help make that room as inviting and personalized as possible for your SO. \n\nI also agree to talk to the neighbor upstairs. Sometimes stuff like that just does not occur to a person- maybe they have never lived above someone else before.\n\nAlso, maybe talk to management and see if you can make a deal in which you can be on a list to transfer to a different apartment within the building, one that no one is above you. Adjust your scheudule to theirs, hang out on the patio or go run errands when they are loudest Thank you for all of this. For me, the bedroom is quieter (I think their bedroom is directly above, and those rooms are carpeted so it is muffled), but it does not make much of a difference for her. I am going to approach management today about our options for transferring apartments within the building. This is definitely becoming evident as a good strategy! It is only been a couple days but so far it is worst in the morning. Good opportunity to make it a daily routine to get the dog out for a while in the morning - which also then tires her out so everyone wins. Thank you for taking the time to read &amp; respond.

Could you please elaborate on what you mean by no violence?  \"I want to murder _________\" I cannot stress enough that I do not think we should encourage violence, but I feel like this is a difficult subject given that anger is a symptom of misophonia, often accompanied by a feeling of wanting to hurt someone. Disallowing everything mentioned violence would then mean that we would not be able to discuss a very big part of this condition. 100% agree. No one is saying \u201cMy coworker smacks gum and I will kill them.\u201d I think we are all just expressing the extremity of the anger, how else can that be communicated? Furthermore I would assert that most of us feel remorse/shame over those \u201cviolent\u201d feelings - it is all part of it.\n\nI think it would be fair to censor CALLS to violence ie : \u201cwe should all go murder anyone we see chewing gum.\u201d but otherwise you are just censoring a major part of misophonia.

I hate snapping at them/acting peeved because it is pretty innocuous as habits go, but my brain cannot take it! How old are they? Maybe you could tell them it is bad for their teeth or something, I do not know if that is true but it is a little white lie for the greater good it is actually is really bad for ur teeth, so it would be a win-win telling them to stop! I used to sit across from a coworker who did this all day long. It drove me insane. Tell them to stop I guess No food at the desk or computer. Drinks only in sipper tops or sports bottles. This means you have to do it too and have your coffee / tea in a travel mug. We have the rule anyway to save our keyboards and books! \n\nBut because drinks will be lidded then they cannot get to the ice (which as someone pointed out - is bad for their teeth anyway :) ) Would they happen to be anemic? My sister is and she would come home from school and literally chew on ice all day. She found out by a doctor that she did that due to her anemia and he gave her iron pills and a diet plan. Yessss please get them tested foe anemia!! That is so bad for their teeth!

Ign\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIgnore this if you want, but here is my misophonia rant. (Warning-mentions trigger sounds)\n\nMy battle with misophonia began when I was nine years old, and has gotten progressively worse since. The sounds that used to have me in tears give me full-fledged panic attacks now. And seeing as the sounds that trigger me are so common-mainly chewing, sniffing, crinkling of wrappers, blowing of noses, heavy breathing, words with a hard 'a'-that amounts to several severe panic attacks a day. It gets quite annoying, and interferes with my grades as well as my relationships with friends and family. Being a high school student, I have to leave my classes often to avoid a panic attack simply if one of my classmates has a cold or is chewing gum. The issue is, I can only get out of class once per period because I am too embarrassed to tell my teachers the real reason I am leaving. I have tried to set up 504 accomodations for myself, but my school's guidance counselor told me that I need a proper diagnosis in order to receive said accomodations.\n\nBecause of this, I have seen several doctors. My pediatrician, a few audiologists, and even an otolaryngologist. None of the above had any previous knowledge of misophonia, and therefore did not think that they could diagnose me. The only other option they told me I have is to visit a neurologist, but the nearest one is two hours away and neither of my parents have the time or money to set up an appointment with one.\n\nAnd speaking of my parents-they trigger me immensely. More than anyone else. My dad is very respectful about my misophonia most of the time. If he knows that he is triggering me, he will nearly always walk away or stop making the noise until I leave the room. My mom, however, is a different story. She makes fun of my misophonia all the time, lashes out at me about it, and has no remorse when she gives me panic attacks for her own avoidable sounds. Then, when I confront her about it, she plays the victim card and claims to understand what I am going through. It is truly draining, and makes me very insecure.\n\nI feel immense guilt about my misophonia as well. When I am with friends, I often just suffer through it with little to no mention if they are making triggering sounds. A few of my friends are really good at avoiding my trigger sounds, and I am very grateful for that. However, many of my friends forget or do not bother to try. I do not blame them. I cannot expect everyone to tiptoe around me all the time. However, it makes me feel really guilty when I have to ask them to stop for my own sanity. \n\nIs there anything I can do to make these sounds trigger me less? I cannot eat dinner with my family anymore. I avoid parties and nights out with friends because I am worried about hearing my trigger sounds. I can hardly eat without fear that I might be triggering someone with my own eating sounds. It is gotten to the point where I have tried to make myself become deaf. I stay in my room in the dark constantly. It is become unbearable. Sorry, your post has been removed as your account is under 10 days old.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/misophoniasupport) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Do I have misophonia? I have read that misophonia relates to certain sounds, whereas my problem seems to be sound and noise in general. For example, I always prefer radio silence when sitting in a car as a passenger, and will tell others to turn it off as a passenger. I will get overly annoyed and eventually angry if a certain noise persists for a long period of time. I can remember as a kid sitting at the family dinner table and literally begging my family members to stop conversating because \"I cant enjoy my food with the noise\".  If a conversation between people in my house persists for too long, I get annoyed and angry at their voices continuing if that makes sense. I am honestly not sure if I have it or not. I am in no way an expert but it seems more like Hyperacusis to me, here is the ( if you want.\nMisophonia is more a sensibility to certains sound wich cause anger/annoyance with different degrees while hyperacusis is \u00ab difficulty tolerating everyday sounds, which become painful or loud \u00bb ( wikipedia ) to my knowledge.\nHowever Misophonia can vary a lot between different people and sadly Misophonia cannot be diagnosed so it is for you to judge. &gt; I will get overly annoyed and eventually angry if a certain noise persists for a long period of time.  \n\nThat does not sound like it to me. It would be serious feelings of anger and panic immediately upon hearing the sound. Personally, I think the key question to ask someone who wonders if they have it is \"do you feel panicked?\" A lot of feel angry and annoyed at slurpers and foot tappers but that does not mean you have misophonia. I am in agreement with others. I think you are ok.\n\nNow, if you are fantasizing about employing sadistic methods in an attempt to destroy what is causing you the distress, then maybe there is a problem.\n\nYes, anger is part of it. Fight or flight is too. More than often, it is the terrifying prospect of losing control or becoming violent.", "This! No more popcorn and pop/ice, I can bring MY earbuds... Life-changing!

Oh never knew you could do that", "My parents trying to give me limits on when I can wear my headphones, how do I stop them from interfering? Hello.\n\nI have a really big problem.\n\nMy parents are setting time limits on when I can where my headphones, essentially thinking they need to do this in the belief that they need to furfill their duty as parents when they do not understand that I need my headphones on every single day to block out the outside.\n\nWhat can I do to stop interfering like this? Since I am also worried they will make a big mistake and have them taken away when my trigger source is around. Yet when I try to warn them they just continue to be stubborn.\n\nAnyone got any tips on how to prevent this? Move out. Cannot due to the lockdown. If it is their home, suck it up. That is nice that you think I do not get rights in this matter. lol, it is their home. Do you pay the bills? If so, then talk to them about it calmly. If not, suck it up. Pretty simple. Respect the rules your parents lay down as long as your in their house. Except for the fact no matter how calmly or angrily I talk to them they continue to be stubborn and not budge. Yeah I am not in the best of places at the moment. Getting angry will not help. If you love them, do as they ask. Except it does not matter if I am angry or not, they still will not budge no matter what.\n\nAlso considering the apathetic approach to try and make the accommodations to my misophonia when I needed them to I do not exactly have any love for them particularly.. Then do it out of the fact that you live with them. Sometimes thinking of others is better then being selfish. Saying you do not have love for them is kind of strange being that you still depend on them for alot, apparently. So wait, just because you may depend on them means that you cannot dislike them? I find that argument kind of trash and dismissive of the suffering to be honest.\n\nAlso would you really say this to the victim of an abuser when the abuser is clearly threatening their life just because you must not be selfish? \n\nJust because you depend on a person or thing does not mean you have to love them, especially if they think it is ok to basically demean you behind your back and write you off as evil when you clearly just want everything to stop.\n\nSo yeah, I am not really convinced by your point. Sounds like you just want people to agree with your line of thinking. So you believe it is ok to use people for your own selfish needs? If you truly believe that then I am totally for your parents on this. You would be homeless without them, they do not owe you anything that they are not still providing you with, and depending on your age, they may not even \"owe\" you that. Be grateful, you are lucky if your problem is a headset. \ud83d\ude02 Um, how did you come to the conclusion that I just want to use people for my own ends from my comment? Sir I think you completely missed the point of what I was trying to say.\n\nI in no means implied that it was ok to use other people for my own ends, all I said was you do not have to love or even like someone just because you depend on them and how it was kind of a dumb argument to suggest that.\n\nAll I asked was that I just have peace without anyone butting in where they do not need to butt in, not that I need to use people for my own selfish gain. Again how did you come to this conclusion from what I wrote in the comment above here?\n\nAlso I would hardly consider people who think it is ok and morally just to demean you behind your back and even aggressively insult you to your face and make comparisons between you and other people that they think are like you worth wasting your love on. All I really want here at the end of the day is to have peace undisturbed without people unnecessarily butting in just because they think it is their duty. Also I cannot move out or get accommodation at the moment due to the lockdown and would probably get fined for breaching lockdown rules.\n\nAlso it is not about losing the headset in itself that is the problem, it is the potential mistakes that could be made upon hearing my trigger source should they fuck up the times. Which would be very bad for me if such a mistake was made. This guy is just a troll pay them no attention. So let me get this straight you are old enough to move out (18+) and your parents still treat you like a child? This sounds like a boundaries issue, perhaps the best way to approach this is to announce that treating you this way is unacceptable. Ok a few things to note.\n\nOne, the lockdown in my country is preventing me from moving out at the moment, and doing so would breach lockdown rules.\n\nTwo, No matter how many times I try to tell them that this is unacceptable they just ignore me and be stubborn and just continue to go ahead with what they do without my consent. I mean just today I got home and they basically announced that they would do this out of nowhere believing that they are helping me when really they are just making my problems worse.\n\nThree they are for a good part responsible for my current predicament due to not moving me into the place that I am in currently because they thought the conditions were unliveable (even when I could very much deal with it and have something done about the water leakage) and waited six months to actually do something about it. So because they waited so long I had to basically suffer six months of pure misophonic hell, causing my misothemia and misonomia to develop strongly. Now I also fear that my responses are not kicking in like they should and am now trying to find the right medication or even treatment to get the responses back to where they should be without me having to fear them being diminished due to a good number of potential mental issues.\n\nSo yeah, in the case that they are stubborn, how do you propose I deal with this? Because I fear no matter how many times I try to point it out they just ignore me and continue to haphazardly go along with their dumb plans. Do not listen to that asshole he is just a troll I do not know, you and I have pretty different families. If it were me I would cling to my headphones like my life depended on it. Also worth noting is that if you cannot move out, they cannot kick you out. Other than food/water what else do you have to lose if you decide to just ignore their policy completely? Eat shit and die What I am worried about if I ignore their policy is that they will completely start ignoring my rules about my trigger name which will end very badly for me.\n\nIn this case where they may start to act like this or retaliate against me in some manner how do you propose I deal with this? Especially if they are not willing to see reason and write me off as irrational. Well, do you know for 100% certain this will happen? Might have to test out the waters a bit to see what is what. Well the thing with that is I am really scared I could actually make them act a certain way that is detrimental to my current predicament and mental health. I mean sure testing the waters can be a good thing but I also do not want it to end badly for me.\n\nDo you have anything to say to them regarding these choices that they are making, because I would like to show it to them. Do not worry, never did. Education is a neutral way to help them see your view without making them feel like it is a parent v. child argument. Maybe if you sent them some articles on misophonia or explain that this a real disorder, then maybe they will change their minds. Good luck, I hope everything works out \ud83d\ude0a Ok, I will see what I can do.\n\nHowever in the case that they still do this despite me showing them this, what would you say to them if they still continue to act stubborn. Trigger name? What does that even mean ..? Ok so basically it is getting a physiological response from the name of your trigger source.\n\nThis developed when the triggers would basically continue without ceasing, making these conditions develop. So whenever I see the trigger name I get the physiological responses I would get from hearing the trigger or seeing the trigger source. It sucks because it means I cannot read anything with the trigger name in it without getting a physiological response. Because I would just get the trigger source as well as the associated memories with it present replaying over and over. It is the worst thing in the world. It depends on how close you are with your family. If you have a close relationship, then maybe ask to have a serious talk about how this noise, and their treatment of you, makes you feel. If your parents knew they were truly hurting you, they may change their behavior. \n\nIf you are not close, then I would start to become more independent so moving out will be easier when it becomes possible. Try separating your bank account, searching for colleges/housing opportunities, etc. You could also reach out to another person that they will listen to, and explain your feelings to them. Were not you just complaining a week ago that you WERE NOT experiencing the same misophonia symptoms and you wanted them to come BACK? \n\nIt really sounds like you need some counseling. You seem extremely fixated on your psychological issues, but you do not seem to mention any professional help.... That is the problem. My responses seem to continuously diminish with every trigger response. I find this very concerning because it means that my trigger stimuli as well as the memories pertaining to the trigger stimuli are not coming out like they should. But I know that they are triggers, they just feel like really numb and unresponsive triggers. This feels really scary to me because I feel like there will be no way to restore the diminishing responses back to how they should be and that I will be trapped with this effect for the rest of my life and that nobody will be able to provide me with anything that can reverse the effects of habituation if this is habituation and not potential benign or even cancerous brain tumors in the hypothalamic regions of the brain. \n\nMy god, I really hate that my brain is doing this, I do not want any of these effects. This is about as helpful as \u201cWell if you do not like the noise, do not listen!\u201d That makes literally ZERO SENSE. \n\nYour triggers \"are not affecting you like they should\"? \n\nNo honey- normal people do not HAVE triggers. Your goal should be not to HAVE triggers, not to have reactivity, and not to BE abnormal in response to things. Your goal should not be \"getting back to what you got used to with your broken brain\"- your goal should be HEALING and getting WELL. \n\nLemme explain: \n\nI have a joint condition where my hips dislocate every day. If I woke up one day, and could run and jump and roll over in bed without pain- without dislocations... The answer would NOT be for me to try to figure out \"holy shit... How come I am not in pain? How come I do not have all that shooting pain and all those joint pains and all the sharp electrical pain...\" \n\nWould it be wierd for a couple days after years and years of being in pain? Yes. I would probably be skeptical of it lasting, and I would be wierded out that I \"just got better\"- but I would be THANKFUL because I would be NORMAL and HEALTHY- and you are supposed to be GRATEFUL to be in less pain... Not trying to figure out how to go back to dislocating constantly because that is the \"normal\" I experienced as a result of my condition. \n\nYou sound like one of those people who \"believes they are a disabled person at heart\" and so they go to doctors trying to find someone to chop off thier perfectly healthy limb. It is not normal, man. It makes absolutely ZERO sense for you to want to go BACK to the point where your body was responding in a MORE broken way than it is now. \n\nYou have NO REASON to be WANTING to be bothered more by triggers. That is psychologically not okay. You are literally SEEKING out ways to feel worse- which makes absolutely ZERO sense whatsoever. \n\nYour brain should be like \"Oh - someone chewing? Cool. I am going back to reading this article. Peace out.\" \n\nThe fact that you are trying to feel WORSE rather than trying to find health and happiness is a good reason for you to seek professional help ASAP.. Exactly! If someone tapping on a desk used to drive you nuts and now it does not, that is PROGRESS! Like getting callouses. A callous builds up because of repeated friction and then you cannot feel the friction, and that is a good thing.

Full-on wheezy coughs, congested sounding. Complete with little groans and moans afterward. I do feel sorry for him but it has been wrecking absolute *havoc* on my misophonia and as most of you know, misophonia does not pick and choose what your triggers are. I have been coming home crying and wanting to tear myself out of my skin. For the past four years I have been working I have had my share of coworkers with horrible sounding coughs but this one is taking the cake for my misophonia. \n\nI do not even work close by him but I can hear it all the way in the back where I work. I also oversee the security cameras and I can see when he is having a fit and just catching glimpse of it causes me to have anxiety. I have been sneaking bluetooth headphones with brown noise to drown out the sound of his coughs and it has been helping, but I have to make sure no one can see them. \n\nI also have another side job cleaning houses. I have been thinking about quitting my office job and just go full time cleaning, but I would be leaving behind a great opportunity to gain accounting skills and advance my resume for scrubbing shit from toilets. But with how bad my misophonia gets triggered at the office, I am not sure if it is worth the pain anymore. \n\nI do still get triggered cleaning houses, like if the other cleaning tech or client is coughing, but at least I can isolate myself into areas of the house to work by myself. Working in an office is hard because you cannot really move or get up if it gets too tough to bear. \n\nI am absolutely torn. I do not want to leave my office job because I will miss my boss so much, I love talking to her. She does not know I have misophonia, and I am too scared to tell her. But at the same time, I do not know what talking about it will help. People cannot stop coughing because my brain cannot process the sound correctly. You poor thing. My heart goes out to you and you should be really proud of yourself for holding it together during work!\n\n\nI think you know what you have to do though. See if you can work up the courage to tell your boss. It is really daunting, but it sounds like she is a decent person. \n\n\nI told my boss about my 'sensory processing disorder' which I sort of euphemistically related to anxiety and panic attacks. While I know he did not fully get it, he could see I was not making it up. If you can tell her the problem and show her you have the solution (bluetooth headphones), which I imagine will not impact your work, that should help too. Thank you so much. I really needed your kind words tonight. This has been causing me so much anxiety. \ud83d\ude1e", "Noises in my building are driving me crazy  \n\nI have depression and I have  been living in my current apartment for years now and last spring I  started noticing all these different noises in my apartment building.  First it was stomping, moving furniture, something falling etc. Basic noises you hear in every building. In summer it stopped  or I did not notice those noises, but about two months ago they started  again... worse than every.\n\nIt  feels like I hear every single door opening/closing loudly, stomping and  every other noises as well. It is daily and the situation ATM is so bad  that being at home is mostly stressful, terrifying and it gives anxiety.  Those sounds trigger me so much, that every time I hear door closing all  my concentration goes to that noise and I just start thinking about  when the next noise comes or long this noise\"marathon\" will last this  time. It feels like I am in constant stressmode. Few times I could not  just stand it and I had to flee... my own home. Going outside helps  little but anxiety comes back every time I get back to my building. At night is more peaceful.\n\nThose  noises are already so deep in my mind that even putting volume higher  when watching movies, does not help, I will hear those noises trough  almost anything. Even going to my friends place does not help, because those noises are so normal, that they exist basically every where.\n\nToday  I met my social worker and I mentioned those noises to her. She asked  how many days in the past month were \"noise stress free\" and I said  maybe couple. She seemed bit worried about my answer.\n\nMaybe  a week ago, when I fleed my place, I just wandered about 30min outside, almost went  to a bar for a drink.  I just called distress call to my friend, something I never done before. He  answered and we talked a while. After the call I was way more calm.  Now, when I think about what those noises have done to me, I am scared. I  never called that way to anyone, I never had an urge flee my home and I  never felt anxiety when getting back to home.\n\nI  got my doctors and nurses appointment in next month, so that is good but  it is still agony be at home. I have not had a chance yet to mention this to a doctor.\n\nIs this misophonia?", "Is whispering a common trigger? I really really hate the sound of whispering, especially close to me. There are lots of other sounds I hate, but this one makes me so angry at the person doing it. I did not realize how bad it was until I was playing a game with a character who becomes your companion and you are forced to travel with for a section of the game who talks in a whispery voice and I could not stand him even though he had a sweet and kind personality. I almost hated him for it even though I knew it was not justified. \n\nI have googled it but it does not seem like many people with misophonia are triggered by whispering? Can anyone else not stand it? I cannot stand most asmr videos because of it, it is disgusting to me. I definitely get triggered by whispering, something about the \"s\" sound makes me feel so irritated. That said, not my worst trigger as I do not often hear whispering but still,,,, I hate it when people whisper, there is like a characteristic of it that is so different to just talking at a low volume. shits annoying yo I feel the same way. Whispering/murmuring is triggering, and \"s\" sounds especially. I absolutely hate whispering, I want to punch whoever is doing it in the face. I am Definitely triggered by whispering that is close to my ear!! Not sure about further away but next time I hear someone whisper I guess I will notice bow I have thought about it \ud83d\ude05\n\nAlso if someone kisses me near my ear it has the same effect\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude49 I do not know if in-person whispering bothers me, but whispering on tv definitely does... something I discovered while binge-watching Big Brother.

After reading countless posts on /r/misophonia over the past several months, trying out multiple masking methods, and having a few mental breakdowns and bouts of desperate crying just thinking about having to return to work and hear the coughing, today I finally found the perfect trifecta for masking my coworker's once-a-minute, ear-shattering cough that can pierce through (almost) anything:\n\n* Foam ear plugs\n* Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones\n* ( This is a custom URL that links to my tweaked settings. I did my best trying to set it to a similar frequency to my coworker's cough.\n\nI am in heaven right now\u2014I literally cannot hear anything, not even my own typing. Before I was blasting music on my headphones every day; I could STILL hear the coughing once in a while and I would go home with a headache every day due to murdering my ear drums with the music. I hope this helps someone else who might be struggling. Nice! What foam earplugs do you use? Any specific brands you would recommend? I am curious, had you approached this coworker and discussed this with them? I just bought a 50-pack of the generic Walgreens brand this morning before work. I will probably do some research into some better ones once I start running out. I have not. Unfortunately this is a chronic allergy issue that I am almost sure the coworker cannot do anything about. I feel it would be rude to bring it up. This is badass! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have the same problem as you: I can blast only so much loud music into my brain during the day. And it seems like that little space between songs is when all the coughing and spoon-bowl tinking happens. Constant white noise for the win! Hi! I am just discovering this thread, and really appreciate your link with your custom tweaked settings. They are working for me, too.\n\nI am actually looking at getting a white noise machine for at home. The white noise from this URL is simply emanating from my laptop, and it is working. :)\n\nSo, thanks. :) I hope things are still going so well with you.

I am trying to decide on whether or not I should go with Powerbeat Pros or AirPod Pros.\n\nAny recommendations?\n\nI like the Powerbeat Pros aesthetically and they hold a longer charge, however the AirPod Pros have transparency mode as well as ANC which both seem like they could be helpful.\n\nDo any of you have either? Do you find them helpful? What do you like/ dislike? \n\nThank you! I have the airpods pro and ANC is a lifesaver! It is not perfect of course, but the cancellation is totally worth the extra money (although if it is your only focus and you have a lot of money to spend on it, you might like researching other options, like airpods max). The batteries are good, i have been using mine for 40 minutes now and it is at 90%. The case holds a lot of power (enough for 24 hours of music), and it is pretty small so you do not have to carry a big thing with you. I have not seen the Powerbeats personally, but the airpods are probably a better option for you, especially because of ANC. I had both. The noise cancellation works pretty good in the AirPods. \nFor the PBPs, I liked their sound, they isolate well, but there is something in the plastic they are made with that caused an allergic reaction for me. I got horrible rashes on my ears where the ear hooks and other parts touched my skin. Not everyone gets this reaction, but it is something to consider if you have allergies or know you get skin rashes easily from irritants.

", "My mom has to change her \"lifestyle\" because of my \"quirkiness\" Last post I made here about my mom was when she claimed it was \"bratty behavior\", now she is thinks it is a little \"quirk\" of mine. She refuses to take me to a psychiatrist despite saying I need one, and refuses to stop talking with her mouth full and even threatens to hit me in a way. She has said many rude things about me and my Misophonia and does not listen to me when I try educating her. My mom clearly does not know anything about disorders nor does she know how to respectfully treat someone with a disorder. I am tired of her bs but unfortunately cannot move out for a bit. Another thing, she uses her dental issue as an excuse to lip smack (including when she takes a sip of something) and although I think part of it is true, I have the feeling she is lying about something.  \n\nLast thing about the psychiatrist thing, I do not even have the money and insurance to go to a psychiatrist, so I do not know why she keeps saying I need one but refuses to take me to one. She is doing this on purpose, just to be cruel. \n\nWear earplugs whenever she is around, and avoid interacting with her. Move out and go low or no contact. \n\nI doubt that a psychiatrist could do much to help. It is a neurological issue, and little is known about it. Thank you for the advice, I will use it! She is not doing this to be cruel. She is ignorant and does not understand. Do not make people out to be evil just because they do not understand something nearly no one would understand without a ton of empathy and open-mindedness. Wtf? How is threatening to hit your daughter not evil? How is telling your dependant that they need medical care and denying them of it not evil? How is making your daughters life hard on purpose not evil? I cannot even begin to understand your thought process here. This woman is provoking OP on purpose, and you are dismissing it completely. Please explain how she is just iGnOrAnT when she has all the recourses in the world to learn about her daughters very real disorder. So, just my .02\u00a2, but I am not sure it is a bad idea to find somebody to talk to. You do not have to see a psychiatrist. You can just seek out a therapist, which can be much cheaper, even if paying out of pocket. I used to see a student therapist who was overseen by a licensed therapist and paid very little. You can also find one online. \n\nYou are home situation sounds challenging OP. Therapy may not change your mother, or your misophonia, but it can offer coping techniques and support.

I know what to expect to so i eat in the kitchen until I know the coast is clear. My dad eats way too loud for no reason amd my mom gulps way too loud. My mom is less of a problem because she recognizes my issue , most of the time. When she is about to drink she tells me to close my ears. Thus makes me happy that she isnt making a joke out of this. Sometimes she does and I almost want to burst into tear. Even writing this I get PTSD just thinking about the sound her drinking makes and there are tears.  Anyways , my dad is just out of control. He eats like a cow. It amazes me how he manages to make sound with everything he eats. Like chicken noodle soup , like what can you be eating that you got to chew so loudly with. Anywas got side tracked again. Every time we watch a movie, towards the end he always has to eat something. I get so upset, because there would be about 30 or 10 mins left of a movie. Like why can he just wait. I know he isnt starving. He even k ows this makes me upset. He jokes around all the time and chews in my ear. I just want to murder this guy 10 times over when he chews or even jokes around. Usually though I end up in tears. Its just overwhelming for me. Ive manage to hit \nhim once , but not hard. He thinks this is a joke.", "How the f!ck do I explain this disorder to my dad? A few days ago, my dad came in to my room to tell me something. I swear I was trying to pay attention, but it was difficult when my focus was centered around the horrible noise his socks were making against the carpet. He slides his feet. You know the type. \n\nI tried to hold it in . He gets easily aggravated so I kept my mouth shut but my body language was enough to make my discomfort known. I was visibly grimacing and this set him off. He got all up in my face, yelling that one day he would \"fucking tie me down and chew in my face\" so that I get used to the sounds because this was the only way to cure me. \n\nI feel like I have exhausted every approach. I have asked him to watch a documentary on misophonia (\"Quiet Please\"), I have showed him tons of research, I have told him that my flight or fight response is uncontrollable, I have went as far as to show him this subreddit. Nothing has worked. Mostly, he laughs in my face. This hurts the most. \n\nMy mom believes me, but she still gets angry when I react to my triggers. She also does not believe in therapy, and I am financially dependent on my parents so that is out of the question.\n\nI am a ten on the misophonia activation scale. I have hurt others and myself. I have tried psychedelic drugs. This shit is fucking unbearable. It controls my entire life. Reducing my stress levels through self care and meditation only helps to a certain extent. My brother is constantly on the computer and I refuse to leave my room unless it is absolutely essential. My headphones do not leave my ears and I wish the entire world would just shut the fuck up. \n\nSo.. any advice? :/ Move out as soon as you can As someone who went down the psychedelic drug hole, do not use them to escape your miso, I made that mistake and seriously regret doing so. Do not worry, I do not use them anymore! I actually thoroughly enjoyed the experiences EXCEPT for when I thought about my misophonia. So I 100% agree with your advice and I   recommend others to follow it. Thank you :) I am not sure of your age but the fact that your father said he will tie you down and eat your face is enough for you to 1) want to get out of that house and 2) need to get out of that house. To me, this sounds like a dangerous situation and a recipe for disaster. I wish you the best, make sure you have all the noise silencing stuff but be sure that the items you get do not upset your father and make you a victim of abuse, please. I read that as \u201ceat your face\u201d at first, too. He said \u201ceat in your face\u201d. Jury\u2019s out on which is a worse fate, really. Even if it seems so far away and unattainable- when you are able to move out, that will help tremendously. I am sorry your parents are jerks when it comes to this. My mom is totally a \u201cbelieves you but still is angry/mean about it\u201d type too. Now that I moved out, if they mock me or sniff on purpose or whatever I leave. Oh wow, thanks for pointing that out. Ask them to watch Quiet Please documentary. As another user pointed out, I did say chew IN my face. But to me, your advice still stands. He does not go through with most of his threats but that is not always the case. The soonest I would be able to move out is a little less than two years, but as soon as that time passes I am out. \n\nYour words put things into perspective. Thank you. I am sorry yours are too. But it helps me tremendously to know that I am not alone in this. Thank you for your input, I really appreciate it.

The upstairs neigbbours are fixing something, their doors squeak so loudly I grind my teeth. Puppy needs to eat and pee constantly, whine whine whine, slams herself against cage. Take the puppy out ten times a day - have to get into the elevator. Two advertising TVs in the elevator, one is quiet enough that I can ignore it, the other new one is so loud I prefer to take ten flights of stairs rather than be locked in that tiny space with that sound. Girlfriend needs me to go pick up an express package from the ground floor, take the elevator downstairs, ready to destroy loud TV, take the lift back up almost have a panic attack from the sound. Want To go to my bedroom and hide under the covers with my earplugs firmly in my ears, puppy has eaten one earplug, and girlfriend keeps coming into the bedroom leaving the door open so I can hear everything going on in the apartment. Trying so hard to stop my heart beating so hard, and then BRRRRRRRRR - assholes upstairs start drilling and I snap. I want to get out of the room so bad, it is the worst kind of claustrophobia when I do not even dare go outside because I know that outside is just a noisy as inside. I calm down and look up a definition of  Misophonia so maybe my girlfriend will understand. She asks me, \"how can I help?\" - I say just leave me on my own in the quiet for a while. She does not understand, gets pissed off and slams the door. I can still hear the dogs scuttling sounds under the door, neighbours music, and the cars on the highway.

It has caused so much tension with my loved ones. Earlier today my brother swallowed (a trigger of mine) and I asked if he could warn me before he does that and he said that he thought he was being sneaky. He then proceeded to tell me how many times I \u201chave not noticed\u201d him swallowing. I fucking notice!!! When we spend time together, the whole time is spent in emotional turmoil for me. He swallows SO much and it tortures me. I notice it ALL. THE. TIME. when we are together. So after he said that I told him that I notice him swallowing much more than I tell him, and I told him that I feel so guilty about it that I try not to mention it and I usually end up suffering in silence, and then he denied my fucking excruciating experiences I have had and he said that he knows \u201cfor a fact\u201d that I do not always notice it.\n\nAlso, my mom was questioning me earlier today. She did not believe me when I told her there is no official known \u201ccure\u201d yet.

My triggers are coughing, clearing throats, and chewing. My brother has a dust and pollen allergy, so that is a fucken problem. And whenever I release a slight bit of my amount of anger, my family thinks I am fucking insane! They also tell me to \"ignore it\", but I fucking cannot! I am literally the only one in my family with misophonia, and I got it from my great great grandparents. I am sorry you have to deal with that That must be so difficult I am sorry you have to go though that :( unfortunately people tell me to \u201cignore it\u201d as well but if we could ignore it we would not have misophonia!! I do not know what is not clicking to people who say that You are not being dramatic, but try to see what it might look like from their perspective. It is incredibly hard to imagine what it is like to experience something without actually experiencing it. And when it comes to something that on the surface sounds ludicrous, then it is going to make it that much harder to imagine what what it might be like. You have to try to get them to understand how serious it is for you and how you are not in control of it. They should absolutely try to help you as I am sure you would do the same for them, but do not blame them when they forget. I am sorry for what you have to go through but it can get better. Thanks for that perspective. The thing is, I have tried to explain it as clearly as I could before and it is just frustrating to have my experiences denied. But I should probably look at it from that perspective more, thanks again.

Whenever he eats cereal, it drives me mad! He eats with his mouth open, he denies any fact or explanation that he eats with his mouth open, and he does it just TO PISS ME OFF. That sounds really terrible to live with, I am sorry you have had to deal with that for so long. I really hope he starts being more considerate because yikes it sounds like he is very inconsiderate You linked to a documentary about wake-boarding with the same title on YouTube, not the Misophonia documentary.

I wonder if group therapy is something my new consular suggested or that my parents suggested on their own.\n\nMy dad also told me that studies have shown that the more I isolate myself from sound, the more sensitive I can become to it. For example, a massive sporting goods store opened up right outside of the building I live in earlier last month. They have an outdoor track/courtyard area where they play music loud enough that I can still hear it even with my windows closed shut. The noise makes me so stressed that I have sometimes have to wear construction headphones in my own living space. The managers of the building say there is NOTHING they can do about the store playing overly loud music.\n\nAnyways, I told my dad that I have heard that exposing yourself to the sounds that trigger my misphonia could actually do be worse for me. This made my dad rather irate. I probably should have kept that to myself, but I was also having to agree and say okay to a bunch of other things he has said that I do not think are totally true. He told me that I need to \"believe in myself\" and to \"not listen to what all of these other people say\".\n\nTo be honest, I would rather go by the word of people who actually are more educated in misophonia than people who are believing in things just so they can somehow make the bad situation end quicker. The \"believe in myself\" phrase made me think he might have been trying to make be believe I believe in the same thing he does about this or making this situation not seem as complicated as it truly is (somewhat like gaslighting). Maybe he did not know what to say at that time because he was so angry.\n\nWill group therapy actually be helpful? It would be better if it text chat based as opposed to forcing myself to hear the same things I hear EVERY SINGLE DAY that can bring me to a meltdown. Has anyone else done group therapy as a means to treat misophonia? Is it effective or damaging? Would doing group therapy be akin to exposure therapy?", "Misophonia &amp; residential for eating disorder - any tips? Hey guys! I was wondering if any of you had any experience in going to treatment for an eating disorder when you have misophonia? Two of my biggest triggers are people chewing and certain silverware scraping noises, and I am really, really anxious about how meal times are going to go since we all will have to sit at one table. When I am at my family's for meals, they allow music or I can get up and go to the bathroom for a quick break, but I obviously cannot do that in this situation... It also makes it really hard to eat, because it is all I can focus on and I am so grossed out. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or ideas for how to cope during this? Thank you :) Hi! I have never had this experience but I have miso and know a lot about residential treatment centers like this. I would talk to your therapist/staff on site about this very explicitly. It is important that you do not use this to avoid doing your own treatment and that will be their concern. They may also be concerned about other residents being triggered (someone may be more self conscious about their eating). I would frame it as an \"auditory/sensory stimuli processing issue\" and offer ways to help mitigate this (in ways that support your ED treatment). This could be being allowed to wear earplugs at the table or small head  phones for music. One suggestion might be if it is possible to sit at the end of the table so only one ear is toward the eating and be able to put in one earplug. Again, this may be hard for other residents and against rules depending, so you may have to get creative. \n\nAt the very least, keep a stress ball or something else with you during meal times to help regulate a little. Even scratching around my ear while I take bites sometimes helps me eat when I have some trigger noises. Resting the head on one hand so I can mess with my ear and try to block as much nose as possible is definitely something I have done. Work on some exercises of your own and with your therapist to do when trigger noises pop up, and make it clear you are still invested in your ED treatment (as again, it may be possible this will be read as trying to avoid eating/thinking about eating/will be seen as connected). Also, I am not ignoring that your ED and miso might very well be connected (one might improve a bit if another one does), however, this is All about small steps and reasonable accommodation and transparency. Be clear you are flexible (so this is not seen as a restrictive food ritual) and you are open to how auditory stimuli can be dampened. \n\nGoodluck to you!\nYou got this! Yes, I definitely do not want to make other patients more self-conscious, nor do I want it to come off as avoiding my treatment! I like your suggestion of framing it as auditory processing issue, and definitely will try to explain it that way. I am not sure how lenient they will be with headphones but I think that in addition to discussing  exercises with a therapist, the end of the table and a fidget are worth advocating for. Thanks! :)\n\nYou mentioned you had experience with residential centers - I was wondering if you might be able to answer another question? The center I am going to treats co-occurring OCD and eating disorders (I am not sure what experience they have with miso). I am worried that if I bring it up they are going to want me to do exposures, yet everything I have read seems to say ERP does harm than good here (plus, just sounds like torture). I am unsure what to say to them, because like you said I do not want to come off as not committed to treatment, yet I feel this would not be the right move? Any advice on what to say to them regarding this? Thanks again!! Every center and therapist is different. However, exposure therapy is actually usually not recommended for OCD anymore. For some phobias, yes, but not OCD. Typically it would involve working on the obsessive thoughts and anxiety management. Yes, that may involve some level of getting \"used to\" necessary triggers, but that is a different process and very very slow. Also, miso alone will not give you an OCD diagnosis (not sure if you do have a co-occurring OCD diagnosis). \n\nI would generally frame it as more similar to stimuli sensitivity seen in Autism spectrum disorder, which means the brain has a lower threshold for certain noises and that the body needs physiological regulation. And that by finding ways to dampen these sounds and find in the moment coping mechanisms, you are finding ways to regulate and support your ED treatment. You and your therapist (if they are good) should be able to collaborate on ways to reduce the anxiety/distress. They would not just flood someone with autism with their sensory triggers, instead they would work to find regulating devices and to accommodate when appropriate (turning down the lights or music slightly/getting a weighted blanket). Similarly, you just need reasonable accommodations. \n\nI would also be sure to mention some triggers are not food related at all (idk if you have any, but pen clicking is a common one or paper crumpling or tapping) and that it can often feel like a full fight or flight response. \n\nMaybe bring in a research paper that explains it somewhat such as this \nOr one you feel describes your situation.\n\nAll in all, continue to stress you want to be there and eat with everyone (even if it is hard with ED), you just need help managing the physical symptoms in response to certain stimuli because your brain is wired a little differently. And that you feel intense exposure (especially more than just the already tough dinner time) without thinking of these coping mechanisms will make your treatment even harder Because you have to deal with the neurological response on top of ED challenges. You just want to minimize and cope with your body's reaction to stimuli in order to better be present and healthy in treatment. And you want to practice coping strategies you would also use in every day life! Many of us misos have these tricks we keep in our pockets for big dinners etc. This is so, so helpful. I really appreciate it thank you! Your comparison and suggestions are spot on, and I definitely am going to check out that article :) \n\nHopefully, they will work with me on getting some coping strategies down so I can fully engage both inside treatment and outside. Again, thanks so much! Can you tell the therapists there about the miso? In my experience, they are pretty understanding, and they let me wear noise-blocking headphones during meals. (I was in a PHP, though, not res.) Yes, I am planning on it! I just am worried that they will not take it seriously, and say something along the lines of how \"everyone has noises that bug them.\" I would be surprised if they did, but it is something I have experienced and makes me hesitant in telling others for sure.\n\nIt is great to hear they were understanding in your experience and even let you wear headphones - that gives me some hope :) Hey, I have been to residential places twice, one for an ED for a few months and the other for a week that was more general mental health so I can share my experience. Utensils are not a trigger for me, but I know some places only allow plastic utensils. At the ED place there was assigned seating but I was able to request not to sit with people I knew ate loudly. I did not say why bc at the time I did not know what miso was but it was fine no one knew except for the people assigning seating.  There were also efforts in place to take attention off eating like table games which coincidentally also took my mind off the sounds of people eating. Gum was not allowed in the ED place which was amazing but it was in the other one bc people needed nicotine gum but they were avoidable. If you ever need to get away from a sound just tell staff you are \u201cfeeling triggered/overwhelmed\u201d and they will let you get away if you are in group or something. I have also on occasion just straight up walked out of group bc of this girl who always chewed ice and literally no one cared I guess I am trying to say the staff will try to let you feel comfortable and will listen if you need to get away I found those places easier misophonia-wise cause I could easily get away if needed I kind of miss it Jesus that was word vomit I apologize I am tired I have always wondered if there is a link between misophonia and eating disorders!! Does anyone know? Haha, no, it is all good! It is definitely helpful hearing someone else's experience and I appreciate it! \n\nYa, it is part of the staffs jobs to make sure people are as comfortable as they can be (considering the situation) and if I communicate my needs then hopefully we should be able to figure something out :) I am definitely not an expert, but I think it makes a lot of sense for sure. \n\nI found  ( really interesting article that references a paper suggesting OCD, anorexia and misophonia all share similar pathology and/or underlying causes.  \n\nThey also mention how some of the most common triggers seem to be good related (chewing, swallowing noises, silverware) and since avoidance is a common strategy used to deal with this, it might not be a far stab to assume that misophonia can be a part of the reason an eating disorder develops or continues. \n\nI do wish there were more research on this though, since it is really interesting imo!", "Please help.  Hi, my trigger sounds are when people smack/talk with their mouth full and when I ask a family member to stop they either smack louder or talk with their mouth full and when I say \u201cplease swallow your food\u201d they keep on ridiculing me. How do I deal with this until I can move out?", "I have been asaigned a middle seat for my flight today Thoughts and prayers \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \n\nWill I be seated next to a gum chewer? Two of them? Someone who brings snacks on the flight? SEND HELP \nUpdate: I have an entire row of seats to myself. I would like to thank God, Jesus, Allah, Buddha, and Vishnu for all blessing me with this miracle. Yay! Nice one OP This is why I take earplugs with me everywhere I go. I am glad you lucked out by getting the row to yourself! I have earplugs, but having misophonia for 20+ years has given me enough time to develop a fear of everything associated, so even seeing or knowing that someone is chewing too close to me is stressful AF. Oh I totally get that. I have dealt with Misophonia for nearly 40 years and I completely sympathize with that fear and stress. Earplugs are not always going to solve the problem but they can help even if a little bit. I hope that there is some legitimate medical treatment in our future that will help us, friend. Same. I have had mine for about 7 years now but I am 13 so most of my life so far and even knowing that there is someone clicking a mouse or chewing something near me even if I cannot hear it makes me stressed to. You are allowed to ask strangers for help.", "Total noise cancelling earplugs?? Hello there, fellow Misophonians! I am looking for serious noise cancelling earplugs! Not earbuds or headphones. I need something I could just stick in there when I cannot blast my headphones. Like at dinner with my fiance or when I am at work, because I have ADHD and I cannot focus when I have music playing.  I have seen ads for some, but they do not seem to block those horrid sounds we all know so well. Please help me find some lifesaving earplugs! I have actually considered making myself go deaf so that I do not have to live with this. My absolute favourite ear plugs are these foam ones ( not necessarily the brand, but the mouldable style):( if installed properly they can block out 22 decibels.\n\nI have also heard about silicon earplugs being very good but personally they do not fit in my ears that well.  They block out around the same amount but are more resuable and more expensive.  (\n\nThe best way to find out which ones are best is to just experiment! Some even have higher claims so just look around at the pharmacies. Unfortunately I have tried them both. No luck. Especially the foam ones. They are the worst. I am willing to pay a lot for something different than all the rest. Fair enough, they do not work for everybody.", "My life is really hard nowadays because of this stupid disease and lack of the understanding of people So the hugest trigger for me is my brother playing. He is nowadays playing many hours almost every day and that really makes me suffer. I am scared to come home from school because my brother is probably already at home playing and making loud sounds. Sometimes I have had to wait outside in a cold winter weather because I could not go inside my own house where I should be safe and in a relaxed mood. But due to this shitty condition, I am so scared to enter the place where I live in and it should not go this way.\n\nBut my parents do not understand my situation properly. They just keep saying stupid shit like \"just ignore it\" and think that I can just stop panicing about my brother playing if I get used to the sounds that he is making. They really think that it is just that easy! Then they will get mad at me when I cannot do my home chores properly because that is just really hard for me if there is a big trigger. This illness has caused many conflicts in my family.\n\nI am so tired of this. This has been continuing for 4 years and I am not sure if I can stand it at all anymore. When my brother is playing and the triggers are eating me alive, I sometimes think of something irreversible. And when my brother stops playing, I get sad and mad that I am thinking of doing such a thing.\n\nIt is also really sad that my brother has to get his own part from this evil thing. I have said many rude things to him countless times and I wonder how it is affecting him.\n\nSometimes there are periods when my brother does not play that much and I notice that my life quality and mental health improves a lot. My self-esteem gets a bit higher, I am generally happier and my OCD symptoms decrease. But now once again it is a period when my brother plays almost every day for many hours and it is affecting to many other factories of my life. I am just so tired of this.\n\nI still have to wait some years before moving out is a realistic option for me. But I am really looking forward it and hopefully one day my biggest trigger will disappear from my life.", "BF... walks loudly? I have misophonia. Yes. But I cannot tell if it is just me and my misophonia or if it is real... \n\nSo, my boyfriend recently started living with me and as a person who grew up an only child, I do not enjoy sharing my space and I am very particular about how I like things to be. Misophonia adds to this stress because now I have to eat and sleep with someone else - two things I hate the most. \n\nAnyway, I live in a third floor apartment, meaning that I have downstairs neighbors. The floor is creaky and does make some sound when anybody walks. But, I feel like my boyfriend\u2019s walking is so heavy and loud. I have asked him to try to be considerate because we have downstairs neighbors, I have asked him to stop stomping, I asked him to try to walk softer or quieter. His response is, \u201cI am sorry for being fat\u201d and \u201cthat is just how I walk. I try to be wary of stomping but it is just how I walk.\u201d \n\nTo see if it was just in my head, I started paying attention to how I walked and what sounds the floor made when I walked. Not as loud. Of course then I was like, ok well I am a bit lighter than him. But I had a friend over who is taller and heavier than my boyfriend and when he was walking around, it was not loud. \n\nI do not know what to do. The neighbor has not said anything to us but I feel so embarrassed and annoyed every time I feel like he stomps. Today it has resulted in him leaving to go to his friends house to get away from me after I asked him to walk quieter. \n\nI do not know what to do. Please help. Is this in my head? Sorry you are dealing with this OP. It does sound like a common misophonia trigger; something I have struggled with in the past for sure. \n\nI would not worry about your neighbor unless they make a complaint. For now, I think the most important thing is communication. Have you talked to your boyfriend about your misophonia? Explain to him that you are not blaming him, but that these sounds are difficult to deal with for you. He can most definitely walk more quietly. \n\nOther than that, can you invest in a white noise machine? Maybe play music, background noise or whatnot? Earplugs or noise cancellation? Best of luck. Yes, stomping is really rude and not all people care about that. I cannot stress enough that this is independent of a person's weight. It is just rude.\n\nMy upstairs neighbors do that too. I wish I could have usptairs neighbors who are as careful and mannered as you are. I can relate, footsteps are one of my biggest triggers! People have the ability to adjust their gait to change how much noise they make, and walking flat footed or striking the ground hard with the heel is actually kind of hard on your back and posture. Sometimes different footwear can help, too. Maybe he could try wearing slippers or those socks with grippy bottoms to muffle some of the sound. Or maybe even put rugs down on certain areas that the sound seems to travel more. You seem like you are doing a good job trying to communicate and problem solve, living with a partner takes some fine tuning for both people! SOME people have the ability to change their gait. Let us not be ablists in a quest for our own condition's acceptance and understanding..\n\nI have a serious joint disorder on top of misophonia - and I assure you, I can not just \"walk a different way\"- not if the intention is to remain upright and NOT to end up injured. Fair enough, if OP's partner is not able to adjust, hopefully they have other options to try. Did you have any suggestions? I do not know why I am being downvoted for pointing out that no- not everyone can just change how they walk. Wtf people. \n\nMisophonia is a disability- but it is not the only disability that exists. That was my point. Let us not forget that how someone walks is not NECESSARILY a choice. \n\nAs much as I cannot stand my mom's endless string of scream-sneezes, I also recognize that she does not CHOOSE to do it; I can only figure out ways to cope- I cannot tell her to change how often she sneezes. Thank you so much! I definitely try to keep the TV going and the kitchen fan on at all times so there is always some background noise to cover up any triggers. But if I see him walking I ultimately hear the sound of that makes any sense lol Yes I agree. This is so hard. I do not want to be controlling or overbearing by asking him to walk differently anymore. As much as i wish I could make him walk differently, I cannot and for all he knows and feels, he cannot walk differently either. Not a disability thing though. He just does not want to change the way he walks which is actually very reasonable. I get it. I just do not know how to cope lmaooo I feel you. Misophonia is one of those invisible disabilities that is SO hard for other people to understand. \n\nRecently, I had an experience while pregnant, where my acid reflux has been causing a horrible side effect; every single time I eat.... I end up coughing and clearing my throat for forty five minutes afterwards..\n\nMy mom, worried about Covid, immediately was like \"Hey, what is going on, are you okay?\" \n\nSo I am like- no- it is related to acid reflux, I recognize the \"lump in my throat\" feeling that I used to get when I first started back up on my ADHD medication, I recognize the awful feeling of acid burning my throat- and it is long been known that reflux and heartburn are common in pregnancy, ESPECIALLY for someone who already has an incompetent esophageal sphincter (that little flap that keeps the acid down in your stomach). \n\nI am taking the meds, I am eating small meals- but it does not seem to matter. Anything I eat- causes coughing fits, and as much as it bothers my mom(who has never admitted to any kind of misophonia type issues- though my siblings, young son and I all have it, so it is clearly genetic)... This one perticular thing, with me coughing and clearing my throat non-stop, is making her crazy. \n\nProblem is- with pregnancy, comes nausea. If I do not eat constantly, I feel so sick that I cannot stand it. If I do not clear my throat - I feel like I cannot breathe and I cannot stand that, because it causes me to gag over and over. It is a hellish situation. Like- no matter how annoyed SHE is, I assure you- it is bothering ME far more than it is upsetting her. So I tried to explain to her- that the way she feels when I am coughing all the time, is the EXACT same way I feel (panicky, upset, angry, triggered)- when noises that set off my misophonia are going on; Nail clipping. Her repeatative scream-sneezing. High pitched squeeking. Foot tapping. Pen clicking.  Etc etc etc. \n\nIt was the first time she was able to understand where I am coming from- and yesterday, when she got off on one of her sneezing fits... She actually GOT UP AND CLOSED HER BEDROOM DOOR so I did not have to listen to it!! I was so impressed. \n\nSometimes,our loved ones REALLY cannot comprehend what it is like to live with this condition, and they can only really learn through compassion. \n\nBut since our symptoms usually make it impossible for us to deal with our frustration, rage and panic CALMLY- We often end up blowing up on them for things they cannot(or should not have to) control or change. \n\nThere is no excuse for anyone to torment you, intentionally antagonize someone with misophonia, to taunt you with triggers, etc- that is completely unacceptable and inhumane. But when someone in your home/life cannot comprehend what you are dealing with, the road towards finding common ground and peace, is often TRYING to meet them in the middle; taking responsibility for your own problems by taking every step to mitigate how you react- and then CALMLY approaching them during a time that you are calm and NOT triggered, and trying to have a non- confrontational conversation with suggestions on how they might be able to best help you. \n\nIf the person is not receptive- then you need to do what you can to change your living situation. No one should live with anyone who is unwilling to make an EFFORT to help you live a peaceful life. But we also need to understand that this condition is our own. Just like it is not fair for me to treat everyone around me like garbage because my joint condition has me in pain 24/7- it is not fair for me to make ALL the rules and to expect ALL the effort to be on other people's backs when it comes to controlling my misophonia.\n\nWhen it came to addressing my husband's snoring- I used to ask him to roll over, or to move his pillow, and often times, that would work. But some nights, I would be waking him up every fifteen minutes, to the point that I am in tears, and he is disoriented and exhausted because he cannot control what he is doing when he is dead asleep. (He tends to roll BACK onto his back, or to continuously fall asleep in positions that worsen his snoring.) So finally, we decided that he would try out a device that adjusts the position of his jaw- and that it is absolutely fair for me to be upset if he goes to bed without it- I am welcome to wake him up and insist that he go get it, and put it in, because it is not fair for him to keep me up, or to wake me up, repeatedly, when there is something he CAN do that is fixing the issue. \n\nHowever- if he is napping during the day, in between long jobs, often at his desk- and I am awake and able to - then the solution is for me to go elsewhere and let him take his short nap. Because if I wake him up, he will not have time to get any real rest, he will not have any time to get BACK to sleep before he needs to wake up for work again- and it is unfair of me to demand silence from him when he is only got fifteen minutes to rest in the first place. And I totally agree; even if it means that I get my ass up from a comfortable place and have to go elsewhere in my own house. \n\nAnd that is how we came to find a solution that suits us both and is FAIR. And it is 7 am- PRIME snoring time... But guess what? My husband is sound asleep beside me, not making a single peep because he put his little device in before he went to bed. And I am a happy, happy wife, because now I can roll over and get some more rest, and I do not have to toss and turn with anxiety that he is going to start sawing logs and making me miserable. \n\nI sincerely wish you the best, and hope you are able to find some way to address this with him, so that you can both move forward. I have this problem too with some people. Luckily do not live with them anymore.\n\nSome really like to stomp down the staircase. Sometimes I wonder whether there will be holes in the stairs if they continued like that.\n\nWhen I was little, I and my sibling like to storm down the stairs, my parents will tell us to walk back up and down again in a proper manner.\n\nI got to learn that it was not very polite, maybe because I am a miso, but not everyone care about this. And I cannot stand how unnecessary loud they stomp or slam things.\n\nOut of my experience there is just so much someone want to do to change their behavior. And there is so much we can do to accept to hear it. \n\nIn the end it should come to a solution that is sustainable in every day life. No matter how much you love that person. Stuff can feel like torture really quick.", "Sometimes I wish I just lost my hearing. Anything better than this torture. This is literally hell. I cannot take it anymore. Moreover I live in a country where mental illnesses are overlooked. I will just destroy my eardrums I know fam I feel you. I think there are hearing aids that create white noise to keep out sounds. I feel like someone posted them here but also said they were really expensive.\n\nSide note- I use to always think this, but then had a terrible ear infection for 6 weeks and my eardrum ruptured.

Venting in this little safe haven of people who truly understand me is the only thing that comforts me slightly. :/ .. I completely understand. It is a form of hypervigilance and it royally sucks. Sometimes distraction works for me, sometimes listening for trigger to reassure its gone (this can obviously backfire if it is not gone). Sometimes nothing but time... Cognitive Behavior Therapy helps me with this - picture a stop sign when the thoughts start up, and even say \"STOP\" out loud.  Lots of other CBT techniques out there - they can help. Try talking out loud to yourself (if you are alone.) This makes you focus on the words you are saying instead of the mental sound you are replaying.\n\nMaybe even a phrase you can say.

I gained some muscles as a side effect I think lol that stuff was really a workout. I ended up finding ways to manage it so they do not last longer than 15 minutes anymore. Although no therapist would approve of my ways and even though they have backfired, I think you can learn to manage your trigger loops too. Just hold on for a bit, remember that this condition does not define you and often remind yourself of who you really are, even if you get sidetracked sometimes. That is an awesome idea because your aurally grounding yourself.

I feel like they wont take it seriously at all and just look at me like im rude or something \n\nAnd definitely will forget after a few minutes and continue to chew loudly People I know yes, because it tends to get worse. It is probably gard for them to know that their gum chewing hurts me more than if they would hit me. If strangers snap their gum or blast their phone calls through the speaker however, they at least get the stink eye, sometimes I confront them about it. It really depends on the person and how well I know them. For example a friend of mine (when I first told her) instantly showed consideration on the other hand my mother is annoyed by it very often and acts like it is something I voluntarily do. Anyways I do not want to talk too badly about her because she is gotten better.", "Problems with sounds of eating So my whole life I have had many issues with sounds of people eating.    I cannot sit in the same room with people like family or friends when there eating.    If the family is eating at the table I always eat in the other room or just I do not eat as normally if I hear others eating I lose my appetite.     Usually people understand because it causes me to have breakdowns and freak out.  In fact I have yelled at people before because of the disorder.  Recently I have been put on antidepressants for misophonia and other reasons but it has not really helped at all.   Me and my fianc\u00e9 never eat in the same room or go to restaurants because of it.   I hate freaking out at her because of it because since I have had it so long that I have completely lost my patience with it.     I really want it to stop because I want to go on dates but I cannot stand to eat in public.   Any tips?    How would you all cope with it?? Earplugs i do not know if this would help, but go to a busy or loud place to drown out the eating sounds? that may just be more overwhelming for you, but i have found i do better at restaurants because all the background noise distracts me from the eating sounds.  I turn the TV on. I put one in my kitchen specifically for this. Game shows are good. Soaps and dramas are not. I cannot even listen to myself eat. I stop chewing during the silence between commercials.\n\nYou have my sympathy. Bro yeah eating makes me so angry. Even when it is just me.   I will not eat unless something is blasting. I second the ear pods idea, as long as your date does not take it personally. The noise canceling kind, not so much. They tend to cancel out only the drone type sounds, which are actually the ones that help me. I have a fan in my bedroom going 24/7/365.", "since the police will not do anything about advertising speaker cars, i will (nsfw because rock) ", "My safe space is being taken away So basically my sister is moving back home and one of my major triggers is television noises through the wall. Now my sister is redoing her room and she is putting the TV on the fall in her room that directly faces where I lay my head at night. I am literally so freaked out that I am looking for apartments to be prepared to move out because I will not be able to function with my trigger being right where I sleep. I begged my sister not to put the TV on that wall and she does not care at all. She said she would not watch TV too late but just hearing it will drive me out of my one safe space which is my bedroom. I am so hurt that literally no one cares about my mental state and my misophonia. All my safe spaces are being ruined by sound and I do not know how to escape anymore. The only reason I have not moved out already is because I do not think my mental health would be good with living in an apartment because I cannot control my neighbors noises. I just want quiet so so bad.  I feel you, believe me.\n\nHave you considered running a fan? I find ( specifically to be EXCELLENT at blocking out noise and sounds from other rooms. Point it away from you if you do not like the breeze.\n\nBest of luck! \u2764\ufe0f Can you sleep with foam earplugs? Agreed with this. I run a fan and a white noise machine in my room as well as wear earplugs(orange foam kind) and it is a life saver! You can also download a free white noise app on your device and play it with or without headphones which helps too. Good luck OP. When I was still living at home I had the exact same issue. I slept with foam earplugs, isolation headphones playing white noise, and a pillow over my head. It was not fun. \n\nThen I got a cheap apartment with thin walls and feckless neighbors who were way louder than my family and that was a whole new world of hell. \n\nI guess my advice is to pick your first apartment carefully. Visit at night and on the weekends to assess the atmosphere because it is a whooollleee different game asking a stranger to be polite then asking your sister. I do all this, too.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou will likely deal withe same noise stressors if you move into your own apartment, but you will probably feel better having your own space that others cannot disrespect. Your sister is an inconsiderate a-hole not even putting the TV in a different spot in the room. I used to when I was younger but I have small ears so it always causes me pain and ear infections unfortunately. I used to wear them a lot but I had about 8 ear infections a year with them. I was actually thinking of completely avoiding an apartment and just buying a small home with like a one bedroom. Like a small ranch. My brain needs peace and quiet and I think that is my only option. I think the neighbor situation would drive my anxiety up the wall. But yeah. I mean my sister said she would keep the volume low, I convinced her to do that so we got somewhere. My mom was so mad I even bothered her about it because no one understands it is a real condition. \n\nEven my therapist does not know much about it... If you are looking at apartments, I would sacrifice almost everything else to get a top floor unit. Unless it is a *very* new unit with incredible insulation, you will here every single step your upstairs neighbor takes,not to mention squeaking if it is an old building. I lived under a loud squeaky neighbor for a year and it almost made me go insane. Every step also made the floor vibrate a little, so headphones would only help a little bit.

The **suck suck suck** of him on the bottle fills my entire chest with anxious rage. Being a baby he also breaths quickly, but at certain rhythms and volumes it can also trigger the same response.\n\nI have a lot of experience in managing these feelings, so I am not afraid of *doing* anything regrettable, like whipping the bottle across the room or just leaving him to cry. I just hate feeling this way in relation to things that should make me happy.\n\nI do not know what to do. Hi there . I do not have any advice but I wanted to say you are not alone. With my first son I felt that exact rage at the sounds he would make. He is almost 5 and his sounds still trigger me. However my second son who is almost 3 has never triggered me and it is pretty strange. He is the only person in my life that does not trigger me and I get a taste of what it must be like to be normal when he is eating chips or whatever. It is nice. \n\nI am sorry you are struggling. Just know you are not alone and do not be too hard on yourself. I wore a lot of ear plugs that first year or 2. Then things got a little easier when he stopped making so much noise and can eat away from me. I only have to deal with it on weekends. I am on the road Monday through Friday. It is not a good arrangement for being a parent, but when he is sucking down that bottle or breathing loudly, all I can think about is Monday morning when I get to put headphones in my ears and listen to podcasts, audiobooks and music while I drive for 10-11 hours. I know I should not look forward to getting away from my son, but in those moments the thought may as well be heroin. I have found when sounds are getting to me, either turning some music to play on my phone can help, or if absolutely necessary just throwing my headphones on for the duration of what is bothering me can be the solution. It is not ideal to do that while you are feeding your son and trying to bond with him, but when the alternative is rage it is no contest for me. I would not want my brain to begin linking my son eating with me getting angry. You could try some hi-fidelity invisible ear-plugs. You can still hear people talk, but it turns down the volume significantly. I sometimes use them in restaurants to cut out the noises of the people at the other tables. It works pretty well for quieter noises that are usually quite bothersome like breathing or the more polite mouth noises.  I own ( There are probably earplugs which block out more noise, but I find these ones to be a good balance between hearing people talk to me and blocking out some lighter triggering noises. \n\nIt is not perfect, but it helps.\n\nWhen I can afford to completely drown everything out, I wear some wireless earbuds and listen to some white noise or instrumental music. \n\nHope you find something that helps.", "Is this misopnonia? I live at home currently, will be for the next year,  and at home we have a dog and a bird. They are both noisy, like, very noisy. The dog is very vocal and will show the whole neighbourhood the song of his people multiple times a day. The bird is a sun conure, a very loud type of parrot. The noise they both make triggers a rage in me that is very unreasonable and almost scary to the people around me. I am usually a very chilled out person. There are not many things that annoy me. But as soon as the pets start making noise, something snaps in my brain. I cannot handle it, I cannot think, I cannot focus, I cannot even carry on a conversation, it stresses me out to the point of unintelligible rage. I even struggle to sleep due to both the noises made by the pets and the anxiety that the noise will start up at any minute. I hate it because I love animals and I have come to realise that this issue is not only affecting my health but also damaging my relationships with my family and the pets. I do not want the pets to see me as a threat just because of this problem. \n\nI come to this sub in the hope that some folks here can point me towards some resources that will help me cope in this environment better than I have been and start healing my relationships with both my human and non-human companions. TIA! Here are a couple of links I have found that I think have some good info about misophonia.\n\n(\n\n(\n\nCan pet noises trigger misophonia? I do not see why not, but I am not a doctor. It sounds like it, given the reactions you describe. However, I would say if it bothers you, it is a problem, and whether it is misophonia or not, you will need to find something to do about it.\n\nMy daughter seems to have misophonia and is triggered by noises like &gt;!chewing, or metal on metal!&lt;. That is a problem for various reasons -- they are common, everyone makes them, etc.\n\nSo anyway, the first thing we did was look for ways to eliminate or at least reduce some of those noises. I bought utensils and plates made of wheat straw. My daughter has bluetooth, noise-cancelling headphones and listens to brown noise (available on apps, and on YouTube) at mealtimes. She says the brown noise drowns out the &gt;!chewing!&lt; noises better than white noise. We cannot eliminate everything, but I feel like your home should be a safe space, so we have tried to accommodate her within reason.\n\nBut you have a problem with pets. First off, you could rehome your pets. I am not saying you should, but that would be a blanket way to eliminate the problem.\n\nAssuming you do not want to do that, you need to find ways to cope with the noise. Could you get noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs and wear them, at least at times, maybe especially at night? There is a whole \"rainbow\" of noises, so you can experiment to find which one works best for you. Can you find some time each day to be away from the animals? \n\nThe next thing might be too find some kind of counselor. This is what our doctor recommended for our daughter. Misophonia seems to have some relationship to anxiety, and so while misiophonia cannot necessarily be \"treated\" like other conditions, there are techniques for coping.\n\nI do not mean to harp on it, but it may be that rehoming the animals is not just the best thing, but also the most practical. It is not a failure that you cannot keep pets -- lots of people cannot keep pets for all kinds of reasons, even though they may want to. \n\nBest of luck! Hi! Meant to reply to this sooner but been busy since school started back a couple weeks ago. Thanks for the advice and the resources! I have tried ear plugs but had to stop when I noticed that they were causing such severe irritation to my ear canals that there was blood on them when I took them out in the morning. I was advised after I had surgery on my ears last year that I should not be using ear plugs at all because of the damage they can do to my ears, but the situation was getting desperate. I bought a Bluetooth headband instead that you can wear to bed and that has been helping immensely. \n\nMy family do not want to rehome the pets, nor do I expect them to. I am planning to move out next year for university so rehoming them would be a permanent solution to a temporary problem. As much as I wish they were not in my life sometimes, I know that my family are as attached to the little fluffballs as I am to my axolotl and I know I would not be very happy if they asked me to rehome my pet because of the unavoidable noise that comes with having her. \n\nI have found a way, however, to remove myself from the pets in the meantime so I do not get as irritated with the noise. My cousin and I both live in very noisy households and we attend the same school so we started studying together at her dad's place (away from the 2 year old she lives with and the animals I live with) after our classes so we can get away from the noise and do our homework in a much more peaceful environment with fewer distractions and stressors. It also gives us both a chance to relax and decompress before returning home for the rest of the evening.\n\nThanks again! I am so glad you posted an update, and I am glad to hear you have been able to get some relief.\n\nSorry about the animals -- I thought they were yours.\n\nAxolotls are so cute! I have gotten into having planted tanks, and am working on getting a betta fish. I have a 10g tank for it, just waiting for the tank to mature. I have debated axolotls, but really just do not have the room to do it properly.\n\nAnyway, good luck with your studies, and I hope you can find more ways to get some relief! Yeah, that is probably misophonia. There have been times where, instead of calming me and helping me sleep, raindrops have landed on something else outside my windows and triggered my misophonia instead, leading me to call my mother at 2 AM crying over a noise in my 20s.", "Heavy triggers for a specific person? Heads up: I will be talking about triggers, but only naming them and no descriptions.\n\nTldr my dad is almost the only one that triggers me, why?\n\nI would say that I have a relatively mild case of misophonia but with the typical eating related triggers both audible and visual. My family always has family meals and we talk during them and stuff so most of the time it is bearable. I do get very irritated when I am in a bad mood or not doing so great though and also when things are too close to my ears (eg my bf snacking while we watch a movie in bed). \n\nHowever I have a definite focus on triggers produced by my dad. Like very very hard focus. With my mom or my bf things are fine until I am not and just moving to the other side of the table can help a lot. But my dad only needs to breathe the wrong way on the other side of the room for me to ram my nails into my hands so I do not scream. Things like the distance between his lips when talking or the way he rubs his fingers together when talking trigger me. Even just the pa\u00edses in his speech make me irrationally angry. \n\nI read somewhere on this subreddit (or just the misophonia one) that people can develop heavier reactions for people they are close to because we have them more so I think it might be that but he is not the closest one to me out of the three. The only difference that I can think of is that mom and bf know about this and respect my struggles and try not to trigger me and stuff. Ever since I told my dad he does not seem to remember. When I look miserable at the dinner table and try to hold my ear shut he is puzzled as if I spontaneously disappeared. \n\nDo other people experience this heavy focus as well and if so are there any ways to soothe it or get rid of it or am I just stuck with this? I have not thought about it, but both my sister and I distinctly remember first being triggered by how our Mom ate salad - even thinking about the crunch - crunch still gives me a reaction.  She was our only trigger for a while, but it is expanded for me at least to just about any eating sound. My daughter is mainly triggered by me. I eat dinner in my bedroom while the rest of the family eats at the table. I like to think it is because she loves me the most. Uh, that is a very tough love! But the closeness might actually be the thing so do not hold it against her. But honestly you are an amazing parent for taking the hit of eating alone for her! I very much see the difference that family meals make between me and my friends and it is a very positive one!! Well, then I am sorry I brought it up! Salads are truly an awful food, sound bad and even worse to eat gracefully Pretty much all the things you are describing with your dad get me with my mom, but as a bonus she chews ice too. It is definitely a thing though. Oh come on I was hoping that is just a wired thing of me. Man. Misery loves company? ", "Loud eaters Heyo, I do not really know what to do but My relatives are **very** loud eaters, you can easily tell they are eating from outside the room. They insist of eating loudly, with their mouth open and trying to start a conversation with food in their mouth.\n\nIt is a daily event, one day after college I came home and just could not deal with it anymore that I actually ended up in tears. I tried saying about it and it does nothing or I get told \"you eat loudly as well\" and I know i probably do to some extent but I am very focused while eating not to be loud or talk with food in my moth etc. \n\nWhen I hear it I cannot help but listen it is god awful and honestly i do not really know what else to do to block it out other than avoid dinners which I cannot do really :/ Andy Advice on how to deal with it?

Yup Everyone is got a \u201csolution\u201d \ud83d\ude44. \n\n\nHaVe yOu TrIeD nOt LiStEnInG?? Ugh when will people learn the difference between \u201csolution\u201d and \u201ccoping mechanism that *might* help alleviate stress caused by mental illness a *little bit* in *some* scenarios\u201d\n\nDeep breathing, imitation, listening to music, etc. help a little bit sometimes, but holy heck they are far from being actual solutions \ud83d\ude44 That is so true. It is not that these techniques are not helpful in some scenarios, they are just not solutions for a complete mental illness. \n\nDeep breathing might work for someone who is experiencing a bit of anxiety before giving a speech for example I think nearly everyone who does not have true misophonia thinks this way. They think it is like normal annoyance-- like when someone pokes you repeatedly or clicks their pen. With those normal situations, the annoyance is gradual and builds up. You can breathe and tell yourself to not worry about it. Maybe you do lose your temper after a prolonged time, which is normal. \n\nThat normal annoyance is the *only* way most neurotypical people can relate misophonia. They have no idea that it is instantaneous and automatic, like feeling pain if you get hurt.\n\n\nIf I did not have misophonia, I would probably feel the exact same way as everyone else; that it was an anger management problem only entitled people have. I get their perspective. Get a wasp. Get it to sting her. Tell her to breath deeply.\n\nThen, get her to take you to your doctor to get actual help. Getting confirmation from a doctor may help your mother realize that this is serious. tfw your cbt therapist asks you to employ exactly that and it obviously doesnt work, so you just accept that you will always have miso rip My bf started doing some research because sometimes my misophonia is really driving me crazy. He saw a solution somewhere: forcing myself to listen to my triggers. Like, on YouTube and all.\n\nIt is a long process (like around 8-9 months long), all that jazz. But I am so not ready to torture myself willingly with those sounds... Honestly my mom has said something similar, I should just be quiet and sit through her sounds to get desensitized to it.\n\nFor some reason I do not think misophonia works that way. And it honestly sounds like a form of medieval torture! I mean, I am sure it works for some people? You kind of force your brain to get used to the sounds, after all. Like... Listening to a song you do not like, and you end up liking it? Idk.\n\nBut yeah. That is a huge no from me! I guess it could. From my experience the more I hear a trigger sound, the more things I found that will trigger me. For example at first it was just slurping soup, it turned into crunching chips, licking lips, chewing bread, whispering, quiet talking etc. I am just like you. Now, I am even scared of being in a completely silent room because if I hear a sound, it will seem so loud... Pure hell. It really is is not it. I am here for you and we can get through this together I am here for you too, mate. Together, we are stronger!

Now just breathe through it while I stomp on it again until you get used to it.\u201d\n\nThey do not understand how a noise is as bad as a physical impact but it is. I keep trying to explain that it is like feeling pain. Some days it hits harder and some days you can deal with it and almost \"ignore\" it but you certainly cannot snap out of *feeling* it. Yeah. I say certain sounds \"hurt\" my ears. My family takes me *slightly* more seriously then.

Him triggering it got me thinking about my mom triggering me earlier on the phone today. That is what pushed me to tears now.\n\nI hate remembering previous triggers or things my mom says. I \"correct\" her and she just accepts it and moves on which is really helpful to me. But tonight I feel the pain of the trigger replaying in my head to the point that I find myself in tears.

Letting her feel what she feels and encouraging her to express it. My mom was the kind of person who tried to pretend she wasnt angry, hold it in, and then lash out later.

My family does not tolerate it and they do not support me with my misophonia/-kinesia.  same here :) tics are able to be held back but that pent up energy/emotion can bring about what i call a \"tic sesh\" like a little less intense than a tic attack. tics are not just all time everyday, they can also be when distressed, anxious or overstimulated. i would say what you got are tics but do not take my word for it, best for a proper doctor to tell you.\n\non the other hand there is stims. these are the ones that can be suppressed without them NEEDING to happen. like if you supress stims it can lead to emotional distress instead of more stimming to compensate for the extra time they were supressed. i got these too, it is been a while trying to distinguish between tics and stims but i think i got the hang of it.", "This, my feelings ", "Another post about a cow-chewer roommate Sorry, need to vent.

I have told him so nicely so many times, made rude jokes about how it sounds like shitty porn etc, and straight up told him how revolting it is, even to someone who may not have misophonia (I swear this chewing would scare all the hoes away, not just me).

It does not sound rude, the simple fact of the situation is these people who think not liking the sounds of children screaming can fuck off because in saying they have misophonia when it just annoys them, they are downplaying what we experience. These people are the worst people and deserve absolutely no attention whatsoever from anyone because they are actively making misophonia seem like just a pet peeve. This disorder destroys our lives and forces us to make so many accommodations yet still suffer because of it, so it is perfectly justified to hate those who perpetuate our suffering by their own want for attention. Sounds do not annoy me, they physically torture me. I completely understand what you are saying and I agree. I was in a Misophonia group on Facebook and had to leave because it was annoying me. So many people think they have misophonia just because certain noises \u2018annoy\u2019 them. It is just not like that. For me I can deal with being with a stranger eating really noisily with their mouth open however I cannot be in the same room as my husband eating anything (even the quietest of foods) because the rage takes over and I have to scream. ....it is completely different! The sting of a wasp. Amen. I totally get it and I agree completely. I also have OCD, and it drives me crazy when people say, \"I am so OCD about organizing my clothes.\" Like, really? By that, do you mean that you lose sleep, cannot leave the house until the clothes are organized in the exact way they \"need\" to be, or that your relationships and friendships suffer because you constantly take time away from them to organize your clothes? OCD is a horrible, debilitating disorder. Misophonia is as well (everyone assumes I am just a b\\*\\*\\*\\* because I cannot help but complain when I am under auditory assault). So yeah, I can very much relate to your post. IKR it is really annoying That Is absolute bullshit It trivializes what we all deal with every single day. I did not spend a fuck ton of money and 3 months of exposure therapy for you to make this into your quirk.\n\nThis happens when there is more research and public discussion around a problem though. Though it is frustrating, at the least it brings me hope that it is on the map for research and treatment. Exactly. It is not just an annoyance. It disrupts my learning at school and my relaxation at home - it genuinely feels like it is ruining my life. It fills me with so much more rage than I should be able to feel. And I am tired of people thinking that they have it just because they were slightly annoyed by the person chewing chips with their mouth open. How do we differentiate between someone who has a mild case of misophonia and someone who does not actually have it? I have never been more than a 4 on the activation scale at my worst and have seen a decrease in symptoms since receiving treatment for my anxiety. Same Exactly. If you can simply ignore the sound, it is pretty unlikely that you have misophonia. \n\nAlso, in a lot of instances of misophonia, the sound(s) you are bothered by are not sounds that are typically thought of as irritating (or, to the person who has misophonia, they are irritating to a much larger extent). My unprofessional rule of thumb is that if it noticeably inhibits daily life, then its misophonia. I would say someone having to move because of a sound because they are so genuinely agitated by it has mild misophonia but if someone can just stay in the uncomfortable area without panicking/self harming/other actually hurtful things they dont have misophonia. But that is still just my opinion and I am not a professional  I cannot seem to find any information about this, so here it goes. Why is it that at least some people with this condition seem to be perfectly fine doing something (eating chips, cereal, etc.) but if someone else does it, suddenly the condition kicks in? This does not  seem like a physical problem to me, despite all kinds of studies to prove it is. Should not it affect the sufferer when they are making the noise if it is purely physical impairment? This seems like an emotional issue,  but there does not seem to be much being done to address that. I believe people do suffer from this, but need help they are not getting. Anyone know more about this specific aspect?  lol wow. I do not give a fuck what you have I will literally destroy you if you step to me with some bull shit about me making normal everyday sounds. that is why it is a medical condition lol Good point", "5 mins into family dinner and I am already crying in the bathroom Literally we got to my grandmas house 5 minutes ago and my dad starts chewing chips in my ear while I am talking and my little brother starts dipping his chip in the salsa, taking it out, licking it, and then putting it back in. Then I moved the salsa away from him and told him not to double dip and of course he starts screaming, crying, and throwing a tantrum and everyone gets mad at me because \u201che is only 5 years old\u201d even though it is disgusting and makes me refuse to eat any chips when I have not even had a single bite yet. I probably sound super selfish right now but it is just really frustrating because it is so obvious who everyone is favorite is. My little brother. Got To love the interactions with family that prove they do not care to understand how misophonia works. I am very sorry you had to attend this. Nope not selfish at all. The \"he/she is only 5\" argument is absolutely fucking ridiculous. If anything that is the perfect time to teach not to do things like that, so when they are adults they do not do that. You did the right thing Thanks this makes me feel better Yeah they suck In situations like this one, I listen to music on my earphones on loud volume (\n\nr/SalsaSnobs if you want to learn how to make the salsa yourself.   Then people respect the salsa more.\n\nI agree.   Double dipping is NOT cool. It is actually quite unsanitary especially during covid times. I would not touch that dip anymore.

I do not have an issue with anyone else, but him. He is the most disgusting person I have ever met, and I know that my reaction to his sounds make me feel this way, but that is how I feel. When he is not eating, he is constantly moaning, groaning, sighing, or coughing. Seriously, this man cannot move without making some  noise that somehow must short out my rational brain because I feel irrationally angry whenever he moans, sighs or makes another irritating noise. He is not old enough to be in pain when he moves, I think, sarcastically of courseD that every movement he makes must just feel so good he just has to vocalize his pleasure. Right now he is asleep on the couch but every minute or so he will moan, it drives me up the GD wall. He will be walking and just start moaning or sighing, but that is not it. He is a terrible eater. He chews gum like a cow, and cannot keep his mouth closed for the life of him. He does that smacking thing when he opens his mouth to take another disgusting bite, I do not even know how to describe it. I can hear him eating chocolate from across the room. How someone can eat chocolate loud enough to hear across the room, I do not know, but he manages. It sounds like white people having sex when he eats. He will burp loudly and exclaim \u201cahhh, that felt good.\u201d Like thanks, did not need to know that, but that is not the end of it. I sleep down the hall and whenever he gets into his bed he makes the loudest moaning/exclamation of pleasure when he lays down. I can literally hear him moaning from down the hall in my own room with the door closed. He will tell my mom \u201coh yea my back cracked, that felt so good\u201d and moan some more. If you were to record this man, no video, just the audio and patch it over a porno, you would not know the difference. I swear to god he is the most irritating human being to ever exist. No one else bothers me, but he can be in another room and moan like a cow having an aneurysm and I will lose my freaking marbles. Hope you enjoyed my venting rant, thanks!", "misophonia affect hygiene I am a gamer, even tho i hate that word I have to use it. My trigger which affects me most is tvs in anither room. If you have ever been on here I am sure you know me by now. in the  house I am in there is no shower, so no running water sound to block out tv sound. At night, all the tv will go off and it will be good because then I can hear. I play games because I can hear it, and it matters because of competitive game. This takes most of my time and I cannot stay up too long or my sleeping schedule will get fucked. I get to choose between have a bath and go to sleep or not feeling like shit. I usually will pick the latter because with misophonia, life is very shit. This means I do not have a bath and I am not clean. Nobody ever complained about me until this 1 person who I hate but I have to be with every thursday. He is annoying and complains if I did not change clothes and have a bath every single day. I usually go weeks without it, and before you call me gross, I do not care it is because of this disorder. I envy my normal friends who are as stupid as they are about everything. You can do anything at any time. Your complaints, especially those about me are just going to make me hate you. This is somewhat of a vent and no I did not kill myself like I said I would. As for my grammar, I am not sorry. My trigger is upstairs neighbor noise. Unfortunately I work at home and am exposed to it constantly. What I do is take my showers very early in the morning before my neighbors are awake. Our ceilings are paper thin, so if I have to take a shower while they are awake, I use ear plugs. if your misophonia affects you so bad you cannot bathe or take care of yourself, you should see a specialist if possible. no condition is worth feeling like you cannot do what you need to do to live somewhat normally.\n\ni notice when my diet sucks, my miso is worse. i stopped eating processed foods and started taking magnesium. helps a lot.\n\ni hope yours improves with time. it looks like you are still young. mine has improved over the years where now only certain people and situations really draw it out. it can get better.", "It is been over half a year now that I have not been in the same room as anyone else eating, unless I myself am eating something very, very loudly. My parents literally beg me to come eat with them or spend more time with them but I literally cannot take any noise anymore. it is so embarrassing to go full on rage or storm out of the room because someone ate a cracker next to me,they have a bag in their hand and keep crinkling it, or because they are rubbing their sweaty toes on the carpet which makes me want to scream.", "When my parents are out vs. when they come home  this is so truly my condition. please accept these honorary \ud83c\udfa7", "Ever had someone lick their fingers after eating? It is like..the cherry on top of the lovely sundae of emotional distress that was just served right up to me.  I HATE IT. Two of my family members do this I am like ??????? Why cannot you use a napkin??? And then all I can think is they are going to use their spitty fingers to touch food and it gives me so much anxiety. Like what if they go for a pickle and they do not use a fork??? Now the whole jar is contaminated!!! And pickles are a comfort food!!!! Goddamn I have got to get out of here It is right up there with someone chewing gum with their mouth open. Absolutely gross and distressing. It is so unnecessary. It is also disgusting and childish. I straight up give people dirty looks when they do this. Have some manners. We are adults! I was shocked the first time I saw someone do it in real life. I would thought it was just like, a character tic they used in movies to show how rude and villainous and gluttonous a character is. I just f*cking tell everyone and give tissues to them, just tell them THIS IS SO THAT YOU DO NOT LICK YOUR FINGERS, I just do not care anymore about being a little bit aggressive, I will eat happier. I used to have a boyfriend and every time he ate he sucked every single one of his five fingertips at the end of a meal like a cartoon fat cat. He did it with a smile on his face. Then he spent about half an hour tonguing the crap out of his teeth after the meal and making sucking sounds. This basically triggered a shit-ton of misophonia reactions for me ever since regarding that. I hatee itttt it makes me want to crawl out of my skin. If you are still hungry just EAT MORE. All the NASTY stuff under your fingernails that are now in your mouth and the slurping sucking nasty noise omg.", "Help? (Dark topic) Kind Of personal and dark question?\n\nSo I have noticed I have had misophonia for a while now and every once and a while it gets kind of bad. Usually if I hear the sound of chewing I feel pressure in my chest and heart and my mind races and breathing gets faster. This is normal I think when I talked to a specialist on it. But is it normal to feel the need to destroy everything? Like you feel like slamming the table or running into a wall? It feels very dark and wrong to think it but I also get intense suicidal thoughts while experiencing misophonia triggers. (I am not actually going to kill myself or anything so I do not need any help with that because I know that my family loves me and I have a great life and whatnot) so that is why this confuses me. I shock myself with these thoughts and want to know if it is normal for someone to feel like they need to die or explode or something? Hopefully this makes sense and sorry for being so dark.\n\nP.S. I ask twitch and talk oddly like I have Tourette\u2019s or something? Sorry if this too is insensitive but it seems like I have it when I am triggered by the misophonia (head twitches a lot and I sometimes hit my head/ears and I stutter a lot) (I do not usually twitch or stutter on the daily, only when misophonia things go on) \n\nso idk if this is all normal I just want to know to see if I need to seek more help from another professional?\n\nThanks so much to whoever reads this :)\n\n\n(I posted this on r/misophonia and it got taken down for talking of violent acts / suicide) is it fine in this sub? If somehow you read this before the rest of the post then read above for clarification. I feel the same way, I usually get really vivid thoughts of slamming my head against a wal thoughl, it is weird haha. I am not suicidal either, I am actually really positive most of the time so idk I guess it is just something that comes with it Same! Except instead of the slamming I am thinking more about murder. Yes, it is very dark, but I have sorta made peace with the fact that I cannot help think about it? I try to push it out of my mind, but I think it is normal. Because even then, I still know that there is no *CHANCE* I am going to think of seriously doing that. It is sort of an anger response, I guess. This is relieving thank you! Ok thanks so much for responding The problem of miso is not just irritation from the noises, the problem is that it directly induces fight or flight responses from the irritation. In which case, suicide/violence/destruction is all a natural fight or flight response (although extremely inconvenient for modern life, and obviously an overly extreme response given the lack of severity of the situation). Its best not to punish yourself for having had these thoughts but to focus on not pursuing them (at least imo). Try to remind yourself that they need to eat/chew as a living being and imagine you are doing the same at the time (typically eating noises are not as bad for me when I am also eating). Your mind is stronger than your impulses, never forget that you are in charge of yourself. Yea thanks mate. I do not plan to pursue any violent thoughts but the misophonia provokes it. Thanks tho for your response I get the urge to just throw everything near me. Sometimes I get the very dark urge to want to physically lash out on someone, or I get the dark thoughts of wanting them to be dead. Those thoughts pass, and I do not let them affect me, because I know they are not true. My misophonia does trigger thoughts of suicide, and unfortunately it still affects me even with no triggers. But, after reading the comments, and going from my own experience, this is unfortunately common. Thank you for responding. I am glad there are more people having similar experiences. (Obviously I wish that I, and everyone else would not have these experiences, but it is good to see that I am not in need of extra psychiatric help) Yes, thank you very much for your response. I just wanted to let you know that it is all okay. I hope you are doing well handling these experiences. :) Thanks, I wish the same for you :) Thank you! :)", "Throat clearing/Coughing Hi everyone! I am struggling with my friend\u2019s throat clearing/coughing. Before we were roommates, I noticed she would sound like she is coughing up phlegm every time we would stay somewhere overnight and she was showering. I figured she was just clearing the phlegm out as most people do, so even though it did make me feel crazy, it would be over pretty quickly. As context, it was so loud that once when we stayed at another friend\u2019s house, that friend thought she was throwing up. To me it sounds like she is trying to clear something out of her throat, though.\n\nNow we live together and are both working from home. She usually has headphones in during the day so our apartment is really quiet most of the day. I wear headphones because I need sounds to be able to focus on work, but also because of the throat sounds now. I think she does need to clear her throat because of mucus but also I think it is a habit at this point because when she is distracted, she does not do it as often. I think that is why I would never noticed it other than during the morning before we lived together. She does take allergy pills and she said it is been helping but her throat clearing/coughing has not changed. It is like every 10 seconds there is either a throat clear or an aggressive cough. I know she does not mean it but unless I have headphones in, I am losing it. \n\nI do not really think there is anything I can do, but I just needed to vent. She knows I struggle with eating noises, and she does try to be considerate about that because her boyfriend also struggles with those sounds. I am so grateful to him for that because he is the one who told her she had to stop smacking (it used to be with like every bite \ud83d\ude25). The sound of eating chips and popcorn is still grating, but she tries to be quiet so I cannot fault her. \n\nI am so glad there is a group for this! And that I am not just losing my mind and this is all a real thing. My mom still thinks I am making it up and will smack her gum more if I ask her to stop so I guess we all just have to take it a day at a time.", "I am so over this The lady I sit with has suffered from chronic dry mouth for the last two weeks and almost constantly smacks her lips. There is no escape for me, I cannot wear headphones here or ear plugs. I cannot leave the room.

I am at her place this week, and her boyfriend who she is been with for nearly a year has autism. She does everything in her power to avoid his triggers, and even sent me a list of them before I met him the first time. Tonight I tried to watch a movie with them, and nearly the entire time she repeatedly and intentionally produced my main trigger, despite my repeatedly begging her to stop. So yeah, it is settled. She knows triggers are real. It is just me she does not give a shit about. \n\nP S I am in the process of getting (very) drunk so any typos or grammar problems are a result of that as an autist myself, what the fuck is wrong with your mom Thanks &lt;3 idek at this point", "Possible misophonia getting worse? (Question) Hi, so I am a teen (14) and I suspect I have misophonia. I first discovered I might have it when I started to hate the sound of scratching on pants, the sound of cutlery and plates together, and lastly, the sound of metal clinging. At first, people told me this was normal and everyone hated those sounds, but it became a problem when I could not even eat dinner with my own family without having a rage attack. (This is not that big of a problem anymore since we got plastic cutlery) After a while (Now) I am starting to get more \"triggers\", like eating, breathing, and swallowing? these were not as bad as the others but it makes me feel a little nauseous. Is it a possibility (if) I have misophonia it is getting worse? Because I read that it could get worse when u get older. I am also unsure where to get medical help and a diagnosis, And if I try to get a psychologist I have to wait like a year. Right now, I would say that my (possible) misophonia is not very severe, but could that change with my age? Also, should I reach out to a psychologist, audiologist, or? I have had it since I was 8, now I am 17 and in my experience new triggers come along over time while others dissipate.\n\nDo you get a fight or flight response to triggers? That is a big part of misophonia, subconsciously waiting for the next trigger to happen is also one.\n\nAFAIK there is no official diagnosis for misophonia as of right now unfortunately, I have talked to multiple therapists and I have had only one not take it seriously, the others never heard of it before but decided to help me the best they can.\n\nI was going to talk to an audiologist before I was going to move from Pennsylvania but I never got to so I cannot speak on that. I also am very sure that I have misophonia (not diagnosed) and I am 18. I experienced the same as you. When I have a lot younger I never really had issues but when I was around 12, I started to develop misophonia symptoms. Since then it has got worse to the point where I also cannot have family meals and struggle to sit in the same class room as others. I have never spoken to a psychologist, but from my experience my misophonia gets so much worse when I am under stress and I know I cannot avoid the triggers. So exams were basically the worst thing imaginable. Since I have finished my exams I have felt so much better. So from my experience, I would guess that your symptoms are getting worse because you are getting older but also maybe think about if you have any big stressful situations in your life that could be making it worse? What ever the cause, do not lose hope, there are lots of different ways to deal with it :) \n\n(P.S if you do end up having a hard time with exams like me, ask your school if you can wear wax earplugs in the exams. It literally saved me) I would say I get a fight to flight response yes Thanks for the advice! Welcome to the club\nJust accept it, live with it\nMuch easier than trying to find help or medical solution\nWith the tome it should be easier, you will handle it better, rage control etc I am 35 and it definitely got worse for me. I am annoyed at so many things and complain every day a thousand times. It never stops. I need to plug my ears to be around people. It sounds like you do indeed have misophonia. I am afraid no one will be able to diagnose you formally because it is not a recognized disorder yet. It is a neurological condition, so psychotherapy will not really help much unless you are just looking for a sympathetic ear. There is no cure and there is no treatment that will take misophonia away. The most you can hope for is that you will develop strategies that will help you avoid triggers and cope with them if you cannot avoid them. I do not know about an audiologist, sorry. As for getting worse with age, I think that varies by person. For example, many of us also have OCD, depression, anxiety, etc\u2026 When one of those other conditions get worse, our misophonia might get worse. I noticed that I got worse when I was on my period, so I tried taking birth control pills and found that it helped me a lot. Some people have found relief from antidepressants after they noticed they got worse when they were under stress. So, pay close  attention to your body and start logging when you feel worse, you will start to make connections and figure out what you may want to try, what you may want to avoid, and what you may want to research further. It is very difficult but you are not alone. Reach out anytime. Hi, I am also a teen (15), and it does sound like you have misophonia. I am sorry to say, but it really does get worse with time, so what you are experiencing is completely valid and normal. \n\nI am here to help and/or answer any questions you have about it. :) This is an awful thing and we need to stick together to get through it.", "What do I tell this relative? \n I have a relative who takes the position of a parental guardian. As of now there is nothing I am able to do, although I have tried to vent my feelings about all of this and ask them nicely to stop.\n\n It drives me insane, they do anything they can to annoy me at this point. They do not take me into consideration and they are always smacking their mouth or talking with a mouth full of food around me and ignore my request even after I show signs of annoyance.\n\n I cannot stand it, it gets to the point where I almost throw my phone or tug at my hair. Then they act oblivious, like they have never done it or they tell me to just deal with it. What do I say? How do I make them stop being so selfish? I have nothing in common with people who get defensive and shitty when asked to please stop doing something that is bothering someone else. It is objectively an obnoxious and cruel trait to possess...\n\nAnyway... I guess the only thing you can do is try to inform this person. They are obviously not very perceptive so I do not think you are going to get anywhere by passively expressing disgust/frustration. If you do not want to just straight tell them to their face (i would not blame you...) maybe you could text or email a link to something explaining misophonia, or print something out and leave it in their room where they will find it when you are not around. No matter what you do, prepare yourself emotionally for scoffing, eye rolling and excuses. But maybe you will get lucky and the person will be receptive to the information.\n\n\nRemember : when you are able to be out on your own everything WILL BE  SO MUCH BETTER. How old are you?  Are you old enough/able to get a PT job?  maybe you could get a job during dinner time?  I am fifteen and possibly, but my situation makes it a bit hard. That is good advice!

I find myself just irrationally and extremely irritated and antsy (to the point where I will leave the room to go decompress) when I hear loud chewing, breathing, swallowing or even things like tiny throat clears. The triggers are dependent on the day and the situation but almost always feel like things I \u201cshould not be upset about\u201d.  But they agitate me to no end and I will start fidgeting and sweating until the trigger is gone or has stopped, sometimes if there are multiple triggers I will feel like I need to scream. Anyway, long story short, I live with my SO and love him to death. But he is a loud chewer, and breather and swallower and just generally has a lot of audible ticks and fidgets that I pick up on a lot. He is really receptive to trying to decrease these because he knows how uncomfortable they make me, but I feel horrible because sometimes I cannot stop from snapping. Does anyone have any tips?

The agenda for this year's misophonia convention looks quite good! I think some of the sessions will be recorded for those who cannot make it live.

It gives me a little bit of hope that there is finally movement on the research front about this horrible disorder. \n\n( I mean, will it be edited to cut out speakers coughing and throat clearing?

It is a result of my misophonia, which is no one's fault. Clearly, I cannot expect people around me not to chew or scrape the bottom of their yogurt containers with their spoon. So I deal with that in silence. \n\nBut damnitall, is it too much to ask that my fucking sister not \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude6e talk with her mouth full of food? This is perfectly avoidable. Not only is it avoidable, but it is basic etiquette and common sense. Millions of people eat without talking every day. Nevertheless, she is in her forties and will never stop, even if I said something. So I am pretty much screwed. \n\nHow much of your misophonia would you say is unavoidable, and how much is due to people being self-absorbed, inconsiderate pigs? Do you find the avoidable portion harder to endure? I sure do. I come into contact with an unbelievable amount of individuals who eat with their mouths open. It baffles me they were never taught manners or just simply do not care. Another massive trigger for me is when people suck their fingers after eating something with their hands. My misophonia is quite severe, I get triggered reading words to do with sloppy eating and I trigger myself when I eat \ud83d\ude12 Oh, man. I was in rehab with a guy who did the smooching sound when licked food off several fingers in succession. It was pure agony. Even the look on his face was insufferable. To me I get triggered/pissed off with people smacking their lips when they eat.  Unless a person has some serious physical and/or dental issues they should not be smacking their lips or making any disgusting sounds.\n\nI am really fortunate that I do not get triggered when the family dog would gup down water or make lip smacking sounds. One of my childhood triggers was my grandmother who chewed with her mouth open and also sucked her teeth.  To this day I can still hear that awful sound in my head.  I loved her dearly but my lord, that was horrible.  I am not sure whether it was a result of old age or if she had done it her whole life and nobody ever corrected it.  Naturally I have taught my own children to chew with their mouths closed. Sounds like it is your sister who is one of your main triggers.\n\nI do think you should say something, how is she to know you do not like these things if you do not mention it?\n\nIf it were me I would rather my brother spoke to me and i could try to rectify it.\n\nIf you really do not want to bring it up. Could you limit time spent with her? I have problems with Christmas time because my extended family will not chew with their mouths closed and smack their lips every time they eat anything I honestly think about this all the time. Like how I feel like it is a lack of respect and manners and not just a sound. Chewing is not a trigger of mine, but god damnit, chewing with your mouth open is pretty damn gross. Then again, etiquette is a cultural thing. You would NOT want to go to Asia, where people express their love of food my chewing louder. Gum is banned in Singapore, though, if that helps you xD. But yes, etiquette is a necessary skill for humans to have. No one wants to be around those who do not care for their hygiene. Holy crap, I did not know that about chewing in Asia. My sister would fit right in! Yup. I do not know that I have true misophonia, but I am incredibly annoyed by the sheer lack of consideration of loud bass music aside from being physically bothered by the sound. Loud vehicle engines, aftermarket add-ons on vehicles that are loud, etc. I have to try and treat it like a natural phenomenon rather than focus on how rude it is.", "Getting absolutely rocked by a new trigger Warning for mention of specific trigger\n\nI have lived with my spouses parents for about a year now, and over that time I guess i have been slowly developing a response to the sound of one of his parents flip flops.

What is something that you have to do on a date or with your boyfriend/girlfriend so you do not lash out? \n\n(You do not have to get very personal with it, I am just very scared about my future with anyone who might be in my love-life and future family) I have had a few relationships without being totally aware i had misophonia (but obviously still experiencing anger and irritability over noise). Some partners were tolerant of it and tried not to chew with their mouth open or smash and bang cutlery, other partners told me to stop being a baby or stop being sensitive. \n\nIt will depend on the person and their tolerance, but if they do not believe you or do not want to make some slight adjustments to be with you, then they are not the right person for you (relationships are about compromise on both ends).

It actually helped a lot. \nI love that you do walks with your dog and I will definitely try to do that as well since I also have a dog. \nHow were you able to tell your partners or dates about your misophonia?

My grandmother has misophonia and cannot stand the sounds of my grandfather eating his cereal in the morning. So he eats breakfast in the dining room while she is in the kitchen. They have been together since the 70s and are still completely in love with each other.\n\nI think you will just have to have honest and open conversations about your misophonia triggers. dates - quiet areas or drives at night. those are more intimate than restaurants or movies imo. i am not in a relationship atm but my last one was very nice in regards to my boundaries and sound-triggers. i would just recommend talking about it if/when it comes up or you start feeling that irritation. obviously, if you cannot handle it, wait until you get out of that situation before talking about it because your emotions may get the better of you I am not sure if I have misophonia or am just noise sensitive, but my boyfriend is aware of my issues and takes steps to avoid noises that trigger me. Noises like babies crying, muffled music, multiple voices talking at once (tv and irl, for example), loud crunching or chewing, cats grooming, etc. Kids are out of the question for me because I have such issues with all the sounds and get overwhelmed easily, but you need to be forward with your partner early on if you want them to understand the issue and your needs.", "Construction noise is horrible I havent posted before but there is two different construction happening around my home.

They are super comfortable, very subtle and do a good job blocking noise. I wear them a lot whereas before I would sometimes not want to have earplugs in even when I need them cause I also have sensory issues regarding things touching my body. These I never have a problem with. Thanks :) Noise-cancelling headphones? i have airpods pro, problem is that it is not a cheap option They have these ear plugs that are sold for drummers to use while on stage/playing, they are noise reducing but you can still hear what is going on. They are tan colored so they may be better depending on your skin tone, but they snuggle into your ear so either way they are not very obvious. I bought mine for $25 CAD let me know of you want more info n I will get you the name/brand (i just dont remember right now) I prefer in-ear headphones with well-fitting ear pieces to all over-ear headphones or even earplugs. earplugs block out all sound pretty effectively, but for me it is more a pressure thing. hard to explain. I can still hear everything with the headphones in, but much quieter and filtered or something. I can hear the world around me better and it is less abrasive.  \n\nalso, people cannot tell if I am listening to music softly if I am having a worse day.  \n\nI also recommend to other misophones to find sounds you love that you find soothing and relaxing.

I have almost all the symptoms of misophonia and I really want to get diagnosed. My parents do not know what misophonia is and I do not know how to tell them or explain it. I go crazy every dinner and want to scream and cry and I do not think they would understand. ( Unfortunately, you cannot be officially diagnosed with Misophonia. It is not something that is officially recognized as a discrete disorder.\n\nHere are some tips and recommendations. Ultimately, you are the only one who knows what is best in your unique situation, so take it all with a grain of salt.\n\n* Do not bring up Misophonia while you are having a Misophonia attack. That is, do not try and talk about it at the dinner table or other place where your triggers are present. It is going to do you a lot of good to appear professional and educated, not crazy and irritable.  The best time to talk about Misophonia is away from food or anything that will prevent you from thinking clearly.\n* Use adjectives and verbs that people without Misophonia understand. This is important, especially if you are trying to evoke an empathetic response in your parents. People need to understand your condition, and using precise words can help.For me, this changes depending on who I am talking to. When I am talking to an employer, instead of saying \"noises give me anxiety\", I say \"my condition causes certain sounds to cause me physical pain and discomfort\". Everyone can get anxious from loud or uncomfortable noises, but I think we can all agree that Misophonia is a bit more than that. With a little twist of words we can escalate someone is perceptions of Misophonia into taking it more seriously.One more example where words matter: do not make it seem like you are \"offended\" by the noises. Make it clear that the reaction is involuntary. Many people get offended when you tell them something they are doing is affecting you. Some of this is tied to people thinking they are \"annoying you\" instead of \"causing you pain and discomfort\" - which is my previous point.Another example is the word \"trigger\". Depending on the person, this might automatically downplay the severity of the problem in their minds. I heavily avoid the use of this word when I am talking to more conservative people. Instead, I say \"\\_\\_\\_\\_ causes pain\" or \"\\_\\_\\_\\_ is a sound that causes pain\". Conservative people associate \"trigger\" with something that is fluff and nonsensical. Do your best to distance yourself from this mainstream word when you are discussing Misophonia with more conservative audiences.The biggest thing here is to understand that words are powerful. Try and use words to your advantage - do not talk yourself into a hole, and be prepared.Before I sign off this point, I will say one more thing; do not be afraid to write a letter or essay. An essay can communicate your words more effectively because you have time to revise and ensure you are communicating the message correctly and concisely. It can also make it clearer the gravity of the situation (most only go out of their way to write an essay for important and complex issues, as is the case here).\n* Do not be afraid to give people time to think. Introduce the idea to your parents, and let it sit. Do not try and unload all the baggage all at once. If it turns into an argument, tap out and let the other people think about it.  I will go back to my other point here: if it is always an argument, consider a letter or an essay.\n* Keep your goal clear. You might need to make your goal clear to yourself as well as your parent's. Do you want recognition? Do you want them to change some of their behavior so that you are hurt less? Do you want them to simply understand? Try to be specific with this one. Going into a conversation with a goal will keep you focused. When I have this conversation with people, I find it is easier to just come right out and state my goal, intentions, and reasoning. ***Beating around the bush only downplays the severity of the situation.*** I get it, it is uncomfortable to talk about. But being upfront about the problem will help you get taken seriously. Do not try and have this conversation in a \"while I have you here, I wanted to talk...\" type of way. Go out of your way to have this conversation: \"hey I want to talk to you privately about something. What is a good time for you?\".\n* Keep trying. Do not be discouraged if you are not taken seriously at first. Try to be as knowledgeable as you possibly can about Misophonia before you try and get into it.  People naturally have resistance to the concept. People do not change their opinions easily, even when presented with facts. But, it can still happen. Try to be logical and knowledgeable; it will help your case.  Like I said before, do not be afraid call it a night and try the conversation again later, or write a letter/essay instead. Try to take the conversation with people as seriously as Misophonia *feels.*\n* Propose solutions - not complaints. Misophoniacs and people who do not have Misophonia are both in this together. You parents and you live together, and you must exist in the same room at times. This goes back to *keep your goal clear*; you need to make it clear what you want out of the situation, but you must also propose good solutions. Do you want to eat alone? Do you want some music on while you eat? Do you want to wear headphones at the dinner table? Come at people with solutions instead of complaining about them personally. You should still start with *what is the problem* but make sure you describe what can be done about it.\n\nAnd that is all I currently have to ramble about. Good luck. I relate to this spiritually. These tips are really great. I am not OP but I really appreciate what you wrote here and will be keeping some of your tips in mind next time I need to tell someone about my misophonia or any other important thing really", "I do not know what to do, need advice For me it is my mon's voice, there is just this feminine part of her voice that scares me.\n\n\nI cannot handle it sometimes but I feel pure rage just because she will say \"Hi UM UH UM SMACK SMACK\" or whatever.\n\nI have lots of deep pains I need to deal with, but I do not want to take that out on my mom because she is doing nothing wrong.\n\nHas anyone else had this specific kind of misophonia? I have this exact same situation. I ended up having a really frank but respectful discussion with my mum -  letting her know that particular noises she made caused me a lot of distress, and I know it is my problem and she is not doing anything wrong and I love her very much, but if she is able to stop making the specific noises it would help me a lot. She made a massive effort and stopped making her clicking mouth sounds around me as much as she could. \n\nIt is definitely worth having the conversation, and anyone who really loves you will do their best to help if you approach it with respect.

She will be yelling or making noises and when I ask her to stop she gigglesand does it louder. That pisses me off, and then it combines with my having a reaction to the trigger, and my dad fucking yells at me instead of being reasonable. They do not know what misophonia is but they know I have a different reaction to certain sounds, and they fucking ignore it and go straight to me just being a brat. sorry you got to deal with this man, it was like this for me too in my early years of having it. i hope they can at least reach an understanding sooner than later &lt;3    \u2639\ufe0f Sorry that is horrible and no one should ever have to deal with people who refuse to understand.

That thinking got me through a lot of tough times. This story perfectly mirrors my own, except it is apparently less acceptable in my case because the noises come from my 12 year old Autistic brother. My parents are saying it is hard enough having him around, and that I do not know how hard they have it. Straight bullshit. However hard they have it, I have it 50x worse. Not only that, during one of my birthgiver's rants, I told her about my suffering. Well, constant paranoia of whenever someone eats in this house, and full blown mental breakdowns is not suffering, it is me being an overly dramatic recluse. I am so sorry you had to deal with that! Misophonia is neurological disorder, it is not something you can control or simply stop. Her telling you to \"try harder\" is the equivalent to telling a person in a wheel chair to run a marathon. It is not how that works! \nShe needs to try harder to better understand her own kid!", "My response to triggers have become less intense over time, but I have more triggers now?  This post was removed from r/misophonia , so I guess this the right sub?\n\nWarning: Potential triggers discussed, and sexual content discussing arousal and masturbation.\n\nI have had this embarrassing condition ever since I can first remember, and I am 20 years old. Luckily it is been rather mild though. Starting from when I was a toddler, my primary trigger was hearing my dad or brother have a case of the hiccups, and some other family members less intensely trigger the reaction too, but hardly any strangers, except sometimes if they remind me of my dad or brother. It would often make me scream and cry, and it would make me (unknowingly) sexually aroused even as a young child as well, and it still is my worst trigger. I remember once when I was like 8 years old hitting my younger brother because I was so angry. My parents and I just assumed I was being unreasonable and a jerk, because I did not know what misophonia was, all I knew was that I could not stop these reactions, even if I really wanted to.\n\nHowever, I also had a mild obsession with hiccups as well, and would think about them frequently. When I got older, as a young teen, I would (shamefully) look up non-sexual videos of people, both men and women (I am a het female), hiccupping, because I actually would find it pleasuring in an odd way and masturbate to it, sometimes for hours on end, and it became like a twisted fetish. I would not feel angry while masturbating to these videos, but would feel angry if I would feel my relatives would hiccup. However, my response to this trigger has become less intense over time, because instead of feeling enraged, I instead feel moderately irritated or annoyed and I usually just leave the room or if I cannot I pretend like it is not happening me and that I am a ghost observing. However, I always experience physical sexual arousal still, even when unwanted, even when I just think about hiccups. I wonder if spending hours masturbating to these videos sort of lessened my reaction somewhat, or it is just because I grew older.\n\nHowever, my other primary trigger as a child (which also I still have) was hearing my younger brother and occasionally other relatives chew loudly, which started a couple of years after my primary trigger (hiccups) and it still intensely bothered me, although not as much as hiccups. I have never felt aroused by hearing chewing, however my reaction to hearing loud chewing as lessened over the years as well, although it can still occasionally be activated. However, I do not eat meals with my family as much as I used to. For instance, sometimes my mom brings carrots into the car for my brother and her to eat, and I find it intensely annoying, although not to the point of screaming.\n\nHowever, as a teenager I developed more triggers, albeit more mild, and I think I still occasionally develop more triggers. For instance, hearing my dad dry cough or sniff, gasp, or burp, or speak in a lower voice like he needs to burp irritates me, which makes me feel sad because I know he cannot control these things and when I get annoyed he thinks it is because I am mad at him. My grandpa earns a similar reaction whenever I visit and he does these things as well, which makes me even sadder because he is old and does not have much time left on this earth, and I feel like a dick having a negative reaction to these things. However, they do not know that I hate these things, and I do not want to tell them because it is manageable for me, just annoying, and I do not want to make them feel bad.\n\nHowever I am pretty sure my family does not know what misophonia is. Once when I was alone with my dad he told me he noticed that I get pissed off when he makes certain sounds, and he speculated that it could be Asperger's Syndrome, probably because of family history of autism in my extended family, and because I am and was socially awkward with literally no friends as a child and teenager and because he does not know what misophonia is. I am pretty sure I am not autistic, just socially awkward and a jerk, although maybe I am slightly ADHD (or just undisciplined), because I have read up on the symptoms of autism and the only stuff that applies to me is surface level stuff like being an overly emotional socially awkward introverted loner with intense hobbies, unknowingly pacing around when bored (possible ADHD), and being physically clumsy and uncoordinated, likely because I still walk on my toes as an adult due to having hereditary flat foot, which I had a surgery which gave my feet slight arches as a child. Autistic people have a hard time being empathetic and reading other people's emotions, however I can usually tell how other people feel and I just do not care anymore, however I was extremely empathetic as a child and remember crying whenever other children would cry. They also have sensory processing issues, which I also do not have, which can easily be confused with misophonia. Misophonia is frequently confused with other disorders.\n\nThe point is my family members do not know what misophonia is, however while my reaction to triggers has lessened over time I have more triggers now. What a confusing disorder.", "Loneliness I hate it when i get overloaded by triggers and just have to be a dark room crying to calm down. It sucks. Because I have to do it alone.

Over the last couple of years I have become more and more sensitive to noise. It first started when the apartment below us was being renovated and they were using power tools every day. After they were done, a new couple moved in there and they were constantly stomping and slamming windows. We already had pretty loud neighbours on one side which bothered me a little, but it was not too bad. Slowly, all the noises from neighbours became more and more bothersome, to the point that hearing any noise from them made me furious. Then, I started having panic attacks, if I came home after a long day to noises from neighbours. In particular, I could not stand the sound of talking and stomping. I became hyperviligant and my SO eventually bought me noise cancelling headphones, because of how upset and hyperfixated I was when I heard specific neighbour noises. We recently moved because I could not stand it anymore, but I can sometimes hear noises from neighbours in the new apartment.\n\nIf I hear talking and determine that it is from inside the building I get angry or panicky, sometimes start crying uncontrollably. I will often ask my SO to go and search for the source of the noise to see if it is a direct neighbour or some noise outside. If it is outside, I mostly ignore it. I walk around with headphones on all the time, regardless what time of day. If I hear talking in the aparment during the day, I even sometimes leave the apartment to escape the negative emotions. I have had extreme social anxiety for several years, where I have issues in spaces that other people would not call crowded, but to me are incredibly crowded. The same thing seems to be happening with noise from neighbours, where my SO has to really strain his ears to even hear the apparently very low mumblings from the apartment above or below us, while to me the voices are unbearable. However, misophonia is often described as hating a specific sound pretty much regardless of the circumstances, but I hate the noise of people talking and stuff specifically in my own apartment, nowhere else. Would you call this misophonia or is this perhaps some type of OCD? That does sound like it, at least IMO. At first, it seemed like any noise that would bug anyone (power tools and window slamming). If you are having panic attacks partly or entirely because of those noises or start to cry uncontrollably from the sound of people talking, it seems likely that you have misophonia. \n\nJust a reminder, we **cannot** diagnose you for sure, as most of us are not mental health experts.  oh yes. welcome. \n\na club no one wants to be a member of Many repetitive noises can be triggers even if other people would not notice them at all It might me something else, something more psychological that expresses itself through misophonia, cause misophonia does not simply starts out of the blue like that. Did something happen in the last two years? Something stressful? The covid thing could have been the real trigger also Yeah I think Covid made it a lot worse, because I am home all day (all my classes are still online). I try to leave the house everyday now, to get some distance. I have also made an appointment with a psychiatrist, so we will see if anything comes out of that. I have this same exact issue with apartment neighbors. I get startled by anything they do (door slamming, closing the closet, water turning on, yelling). Have you figured out what is the reason behind this? I also have a psychiatrist appointment next month, since my therapist thinks it is a symptom of PTSD. I have not found out what the reason is exactly. I think I have some sort of psychological issue that has not been diagnosed, because I generally am very tense and stressed when it comes to other people and have a very obsessive personality. My sister is diagnosed with BPD and my mother seems to have a personality disorder as well. When I am more relaxed in general, I am not as sensitive to neighbor noise. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find a therapist as they are all booked solid and are not accepting new patients. However, I do have an appointment with a psychiatrist on Tuesday, so maybe she can at least prescribe me some anti-anxiety meds or antidepressants.\n\nEdit: The thing about PTSD is an interesting angle though.

I thought my misophonia was making me crazy and I never knew any one else experienced it. In my house it is usually the refrigerator or freezer. But there are several recessed lighting fixtures that humm all the time and are much more noticeable at night. Oh yeah. It sometimes is just a head thing that all people have, sometimes it may be a plug in a power outlet. One of my chargers make these sounds. WHAT, YESSS! And the worst part is that it is not only at night. I believe that is caused by some machine somewhere, it is like some huge turbine and it is annoying the shit out of me. I wish I could live in a forest so if it is in my head I know it is 100% not caused by some doomed machine anywhere near.\n\n\nEdit: earplugs do not do anything because it is vibration. Horrible, just horrible Happens with my heating and cooling, fans , idling trucks, other people's heating and cooling. Lol I live out in the middle of nowhere in Rural America and I know all about the hum. \n\nIn my case it turned out it was the electricity moving in the electric blanket that I use. \n\nI sleep with earplugs now. It could also come from a windturbine. I lived in the catskills for a month for work. I stayed in the middle of nowhere and shared the house with another co-worker and every night I would hear, nay, FEEL kind of hum or frequency and I could not place it. My roommate coworker did not hear anything so I thought I must be crazy. A few nights in I was going insane switching off the outlets and unplugging random objects for some relief- turns out the moment I unplugged the DVD player it was like all peace returned to the world. My sleeps were great after that! Hope you find relief, even if its earplugs! I do the same thing trying to pinpoint a hum! Sometimes the weirdest devices cause disturbing sounds. It sounds exactly like a huge machine is running... Like it is a \"big\" noise that sounds distant. And like you say ear plugs do not do much because it is very low frequency! \n\nIt is not been preventing me from sleeping thankfully, I can tune it out since it is not \"people noises\" Thanks! I had a similar thing a while ago with a quiet high pitched beep my living room that after a lot of unplugging turned out to be my PS4 (it now gets unplugged when it is not in use!) .. but verified other people could hear that one thought they usually have to get right close to it to notice. \n\nElectronic noise has been higher pitched in my experience before (this is very low and very much a distant vibration) but I will definitely try unplugging everything in my room tonight (Friday night so do not need my lumie alarm!).\n\nI used to hear in it my old flat too (same street). I was convinced for months there that my upstairs neighbours were running very late night/early morning laundry!  I do think it is \"stronger\" in this semi-detached house but I am also more aware of it now! My boiler is right behind my bedroom wall and I have spent time with my ear up to that when it is off feeling for vibrations and I do not think it is that! I know the noise that makes when it is on.\n\nHave wondered if it could be next door's boiler (semi detached house). \n\nIt is such a constant low vibrating drone that I will hear before sleep and when I wake up in the morning (if I wake before the boiler wakes me up!). Sometimes if it is very quiet I can hear it in the day time too.\n\nIt is such a bizarre feeling. Especially when nobody else hears it \ud83d\ude02 I will try unplugging everything in my bedroom tonight! \n\nEarplugs do not seem to help because it is a super low vibrating droning noises. Luckily I can sleep with it, I have learned to ingore it... But some days I hear it more than others, or it feels \"stronger\" There is a train line close by, and a large industrial site that I think has some manufacturing that likely runs over night (and would not be effected by lockdown) ... Have wondered if it is something to do with that.. if it is nothing inside the house! Question- are your triggers emotional i.e. does the sound infuriate you, or is it more bothersome because you cannot place it? Or both? Also yes! The unplugging electronics game is oh so fun. But honestly can offer relief! That is a little freaky to me, I hope I never get or notice it. I wonder if it is similar to tinnitus but in a lower frequency. Good Point, this could be a reason No it does not trigger my misophonia because it is not \"people noise\"  - as you say it is the fact I cannot place the cause that drives me mad, it is the mystery. Because its low and monotonous I can manage to tune it out and sleep etc thankfully! \n\nAt at least do not have noisy neighbours in this house! My ear plugs are retired for now and I sleep well! Hi! I found your post while searching for recent posts about the Hum! I would definitely say I have misophonia; I could have killed my siblings for chewing with their mouths open as a child and, TV shows are sometimes so freaking loud for no reason, and I swear I am more sensitive to mechanical noises than the average person. I had taken my brand new car in to the dealership several times over an awful high-pitched buzzing noise that no one else could hear. It started after the car had been running for several minutes and stopped when I was stopped at intersections. I ended up trading it in.\n\nAnyways, the Hum. I heard it the first time a few weeks ago around 3:00am. I do cocaine and have BPD so as very real as it felt, I chalked it up to one or both of these things. I heard it again for a second time last night. It also started at what seemed like exactly 3:00am. This time I looked it up and now I do not believe it is a function of my drug abuse or mental illness. It was terrifying and anxiety-inducing for sure. The loud, low vibrating hum of a large diesel engine in the distance is the best way to describe it, but it can also be felt. My entire body felt like an excited-state atom. It was scary in that you have no idea where this is coming from or why or how or how long it will last. It is as loud and present in the interior areas of my apartment as it is close to the windows. I was too scared to investigate outside. I am so intrigued and curious now. It is absolutely horrid when you first hear it... Or rather feel it is how I would describe it too, since it really is a low vibration. I am listening to it right now before I go to sleep.\n\nI am sensitive to the higher end of things too.. I have a dimmer switch that I can hear \"squealing\" (need to get it changed!) and my microwave I have to unplug when I am not using it.\n\nFor me it is \"everywhere\" too but only inside. Never hear it outside, but I suppose a building could \"conduct\" whatever it is.\n\nI definitely hear it at my boyfriend's house too, I paid more attention this weekend (he is my support bubble). I hear it in the day but only when I focus and look for it. It is louder at my house though. I cannot go anywhere else at the moment to test other locations!\n\nMy last remaining external cause theory could be it is WiFi/radio frequencies (I have some smart devices as does my boyfriend) that I can somehow \"hear\" ... Which sounds mad \ud83d\ude05  \n\nOtherwise it is somehow just a noise my body is making - maybe like a kind of tinnitus I have developed? \n\nIt is been about a year of hearing it - 3 months since I moved house, still heard it then googled and found out about the Hum! Does not bother me so much now in terms of finding it alarming any more... It is just the frustration of not know what it is! It is just super weird! And makes me sound like a lunatic. \n\nIf you are always hear it at 3am is that due to your routine? (The kind of time you are going to bed maybe?)\nWhat are you doing when you hear it?\n\nIf you have got BPD I am sure hearing a mysterious noise that nobody else can is one of the last thing you need to be dealing with!", "Misophonia is like having a mental allergy to certain noises ...just a half-drunk thought that popped into my head. Maybe explaining it like this would make more sense to people who do not have it. I am always worried about offending someone or being misunderstood, and I think relatable metaphors help. Anyone else have anything like this? You named it. Thank you. Nobody will believe you though. Yeah, you might be right. Maybe I just need to figure out how to justify it to myself and let that be enough I call it periodic spontaneous deafness because I deafen myself with pink noise using earphones I have read somewhere that it was described as an allergy to sound so I would say it is accurate. I would rather have hives. I agree with that Feels 100% accurate", "I would lose immediately  Kill me now! *Raises hand*\n\n\"I concede, just make it quick, headshot or something.\" Instead, can I be a pink soldier, and the game is for them to eat silently? That is ingenious! \\*2 minutes in\\*\n\n\"Can you shoot my finger to take my mind off the constant fucking chewing\"", "I am getting really tired of this, I hate there is no escape. These triggers of mine have been going on for too long.\n\nFirst it started with just misophonia and misokinesia, then that got intolerably bad and made me develop misothemia, then after that it got so intolerably bad that it turned into misonomia.\n\nAnd you know what is worse? All of this could have been avoided if I had moved into the summer house earlier but no I could only move in when it suited my parents.\n\nThank you family for being the leading cause of my inescapable mental problems from this condition, I hope you are proud of yourselves because I may never be able to be happy or sane ever again. *sound trigger warning*\n\nOkay so this might not be helpful and feel free to tell me off but one tactic I use to cope with awful sounds, especially chewing is to mimic the sounds as the person is doing them. If someone is chewing loudly I will chew along with them, I do not get annoyed when the sound is coming from me and it helps me pretend it is just me chewing. It does not always work but it is a tactic.\n\nI am sorry about your family, I cannot fully understand your situation but I can empathize with some of what you are feeling. I had to stop eating dinner with my family because I almost punched my sister in the face for continuously scraping her fork/knife against her plate. A part of it was also me insinuating that she should use a paper plate until she learns how to cut food like a human instead of a wolf that was suddenly given a human form.", "ONE OF US! ", "He gives \"nursing a drink,\" a whole new meaning. I do not understand how my flatmate can make SO MUCH NOISE drinking.   \nHe sits there, gets the liquid into his mouth in an almost slurping manner, and then I swear to god he swishes it and then gently gulps.   \n\n\nI put headphones on or I walk away when he is drinking anything because even knowing he is making those sounds infuriates me.   \nHe is driving me crazy and I think what is most annoying is I think he does it intentionally, as a way to savour his beverages.   \nHe has also started this savouring thing with his food, he takes a bite and it is like he is breathing with his food. The time it takes him to chew one bite is elongated every day.   \n\n\nI cannot say anything to him because I know it is my problem but I would be embarrassed if I made that much noise while eating. I feel like there is a certain point where anybody would be annoyed with the amount of noise someone is making when eating/drinking... misophonia or not. Definitely not a you problem... sometimes people are just overly annoying without any regard. I would say something for sure, cause if he is being that obnoxious I am sure there are other people who find it annoying too!! The most important thing is to bring the conversation up when he is NOT eating- to remain as calm as humanly possible and to frame it as YOUR problem, but by asking his help if at all possible.\n\nYes, some people are ASSHOLES, but some people will do everything possible to help you avoid your triggers, if you just approach them in a calm and respectful manner..\n\nI had a co-worker who used to drive me absolutely INSANE eating at her desk, and I made sure to approach her when there was NO food around, and when I was calm enough to be able to explain my severe issues with certain sounds. By not making HER feel defensive and angry, I avoided her getting pissy and blowing up at me- instead, she was VERY compassionate and understanding... Even more so- she explained that her step son has autism and she was very familiar with misophonia and sensory issues. It turned out REALLY well.  She asked me to gently remind her (because she would often snack quietly between meals at her desk and said that while she was happy to cut down, or to take her snacks out of ear shot- she also very much admitted that it would be a hard habit to break.)\n\nIn return, she did mention that my nail-biting was actually one of HER pet peeves, and I made a valient effort to curb my nail biting in her presence. It made for less stress and a better environment for us both. \n\nDo not automatically assume someone knows they are doing something that is bothering you, or that they will automatically react badly if you speak to them about it. If you frame the discussion in a way that does not put them on the defensive (if you attack them with accusations that they are rude/loud/gross eaters- how do you THINK a person is going to feel/react?!? - you may be surprised that someone is willing to HELP you cope with this condition rather than intentionally making it worse.", "There is a special place in hell for.. ..people who continue to make triggering noises after it is obvious that they made someone uncomfortable. \n\nMy classmates are especially guilty of this, which is why I am glad that I will not have to deal with any of their bullshit until May 1 (I previously said April 10, but the date was extended). \n\nExamples: \n\n-Kid on my bus who chews gum like a goddamn cow. He was once asked to stop, and continued to do it out of spite. (In related news: kids at my table in Spanish class who also chew gum and blow bubbles, despite the fact that I often stare at them angrily/cover my ears/etc when they do it) \n\n-My guidance counselor's daughter, who also cannot chew/drink water at an acceptable volume. She also once started whistling immediately after I was physically cringing from the sound of her slurping a water bottle, causing me to cover my ears. The shame is, she would probably be a pretty cool person.. \n\n-A kid in my Spanish class who was eating and smacking his lips while doing so, causing someone to ask him why he smacked his lips like that.. causing him to do so louder/in a more exaggerated way. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot really explain why. My classmates are mostly shitty people and would probably just keep doing it.. Oh my word, YES! I just called out a friend of mine for doing this to me. I hate when people do not take it seriously. If only they could understand what it does to me... Just reading the words \u201csmacking their lips\u201d sends me into a rage. \n\n\nThere is also a special place in hell for people that disagree with you about something you say here on Reddit (or any other social media) and then go into your history/profile to find stuff to use as \u201cammunition\u201d against you. Someone dug up something I said about my illnesses including Misophonia and said some pretty nasty things to me. Oh jeez, me too - if I do not get angry while just reading examples of sounds I hate, I often wince, instinctively cover my ears, feel physically ill, etc\n\nAnd yeah, it pisses me off when I get in an argument with someone and they start personally attacking me. My stepmom is very guilty of this.. main reason I try to avoid her every chance I get. When I was in middle school I was bullied for having Misophonia and visible OCD tics. One kid in particular noticed me get upset even he coughed, and he literally said \"watch this\" to other kids and started trying to trigger me. I am 30 and that shit still pisses me off. I am glad you at least get a break from it all. Oh I know, some people will be making some triggering noise so I will ask them to stop. When I do they say no and it is a habit. Like I know it is a habit but that does not mean you cannot say I can try I know where you are coming from, i had a colleague that during some group projects i was doing on my laptop would stand, behind me, with his head right behind mine, chewing gun with his mouth open (to me it is not just the noise, but the momevents as well). But, as i noticed with misophonia (that is something I observed, and my opinion, no scientifical value whatsoever) is that some people continue doing it, not out of spite, but because they are completely oblivious to how torturing it is for people like us, listening to \"normal\" sounds that most people makes. The fact that those sounds are considered normal, may cause the person to not even think \"well, maybe my chewing noise is bothering that person that is weirdly covering their ears\" so they continue oblivious to that. But, some people might be assholes and would do that just to fucking enrage you TALK TO YOUR TEACHERS. HAVE LEGIT INFORMATION AND APPROPRIATE LINKS IN HAND. SEE YOUR GUIDANCE COUNSELOR/PRINCIPAL ABOUT ACCOMMODATIONS. I am old, and forget what it is called, but I believe there are certain protections in place for students with sensory integration issues. \n\nNONE of this shit happened when I was in school in the 70s and 80s. Eating and gum, a word I have come to fear and despise, were 99% forbidden. Some teachers would soft-core shame people who violated these rules. Poverty was not that prevalent in my area, and most kids were fed by the time they got to school.\n\nThat said, you MUST obtain these items: decent headphones or a white noise app to use on the bus. If you cannot have these items, 32 dB rated foam earplugs underneath SHOOTING earmuffs (I have a 36 dB rated set; no idea if the effect is cumulative), combined with as much distance as you can get, should help.\n\nHowever, please know this: by letting your peers know that their behavior causes distress, you have given them carte blanche to work at tormenting you. This is just the nature of the teenage beast. They do not even have to be predisposed to bullying. With certain, unknowable exceptions, they cannot and will never comprehend the level of distress their disgusting behavior causes in a true misophone. If your bus driver seems to like you, you MIGHT approach them and ask that they enact a ban on gum, but this might backfire: bus drivers and monitors get bullied, too. Kids do not really respect them.\n\nAnd are you able to ride your bike/ get a ride from an adult neighbor to school? Maybe walk or run? Whatever it takes, youngun. Good luck. My teachers in school used to be the worst offenders. We had some kids that just could not eat quietly or breathe quietly or sit quietly without making those sounds. I would put on music or have some sound in the background if I was forced to deal with it but they stopped me doing that and constantly sat me next to the most gross ones. I know they could not help it but nether could I so I would rather not sit there and get driven mad. Nope I am apparently rude for not being able to stand it. And thanks to my mother with her munchies the school nightmares are back. Oh jeez, I have experienced some teachers like that.. and some that were the source of the noise itself. I remember in 7th grade that I used to have special education teachers who decided one day to start kicking walls, ripping paper, playing music, etc as a way to intentionally bother the kids in the class. They got all surprised when I started freaking out, too. I was taught from a young age that even saying something about it was showing weakness so I was really desperate when I did that. But I was not allowed to freak out that was just not done and solved nothing which meant I focused all that anger on myself quietly or somewhat quietly. One example is giving myself a mini concussion before dealing with a really bad chewer because its better then having to sit and smile or be yelled at for not sitting and smiling.", "How can I get people to understand the extent of my misophonia? My mom often asks if my counsellor has helped me at all with misophonia, and we have tried some things but nothing has really worked. Sometimes my mom tells me that she \u201cused to have misophonia\u201d when she was younger but she \u201clearned to ignore it\u201d and now noises do not bother her anymore, and she does not understand why I cannot do the same. How can I help her understand that I can not control my reactions to my triggers and that if I could then I would not have misophonia? And how can I get her to stop doubting the quality of my counsellor just because she could not \u201cfix\u201d my misophonia?\n\nThanks for reading all this. it is a medical condition. your mom should understand that at least.\nyou are getting professional help and your mom is being counterproductive to the leaps forward with said professional.\n\nyour mom thinks of counselors like car mechanics. you just drop it off and they fix it. i takes sometimes years for treatment to work. it is not going to happen overnight.\n\ni am sorry that you are going through this. I will try to explain it like that.\n\nThank you for saying all that, sometimes when she makes comments like that it feels like I am \u201cfailing\u201d at therapy so I needed that reminder.\n\nThank you again for everything you said. I appreciate it. Could you possibly find some articles on it to send to her? She could learn more about it and its mechanisms, symptoms, etc. Or even show her some posts from this sub so she can see what we are all going through? There is some good info on the sub sidebar I believe which you could check out and start there. \nI know how much this sucks and explaining it to people who do not fully understand is so frustrating. I feel for you. I wish there was a quick fix for us. I will try to find some stuff to show her. Thank you so much, I wish there was a quick fix too", "I FINALLY found relief after 25 years with misophonia I have struggled with misophonia since I was ten. I will not share my specific triggers unless asked because, in my experience, triggers have the potential to be \u201ccontagious\u201d to others with the condition, but suffice it to say I have many, many triggers (both audio AND visual) from many different sources and all with varying intensity.\n\nI have tried everything under the sun to ease the hold misophonia has had on my life, from CBT to brainspotting to special hearing aids (prescribed to me by an audiologist who specializes in the condition). NOTHING has worked. In fact, every year I pick up new triggers.\n\nA couple of months ago, my counselor started talking to me about \u201cfeeling my feelings.\u201d It was not in the context of my misophonia, but I very cautiously decided to try this method out on it. I say cautiously because I have always tried to avoid thinking/talking about my misophonia (at the suggestion of my audiologist). When I do think or talk about it, I become even more hyper aware of my triggers than I would have been otherwise.\n\nThe gist of \u201cfeeling your feelings\u201d is that \u201cwhat you resist will persist\u201d and \u201cwhat you embrace will fade away.\u201d If you sit with uncomfortable feelings and pay attention to how they affect your body (e.g. is your heart rate and/or breathing faster, do you feel tension in any of your muscles, do you have butterflies in your stomach), then your brain will start to realize that you are not in danger and will stop sounding the alarm when specific situations (in this case, triggers) occur. If you run away from the emotion (physically or mentally), you reinforce the reaction, essentially proving your brain right (that you are in danger).\n\nHere is what I did to \u201cfeel my feelings\u201d about my misophonia.\n\n(1) I laid down in a dark room, closed my eyes, and played \u201cbiolateral\u201d music by David Grande (from Spotify) in my headphones (headphones are a must!) at a very low volume. This music is used in brainspotting. It engages your vagus nerve, relaxing you and allowing you to access deeper areas of your brain.\n\n(2) I visualized a specific time in my childhood where I experienced the first trigger I can remember and allowed myself to feel the negative and very uncomfortable emotions related to it without pushing it away. It might sound silly, but at times I had to imagine myself on a bucking bronco. My brain was trying so hard to push it away, but I held on tight and embraced the negative feelings. \n\n(3) I observed my body to see how the emotion was affecting me physically. I noticed my breathing was shallow, my jaw was clenched, and I felt tension in my hands, feet and forehead.\n\n(4) I then labeled the emotions I was feeling. I was *angry* at my mom for both making the sound AND for getting angry at me because she did not understand why the sound was bothering me so much. I felt intense *guilt* for getting so mad over \u201cnothing.\u201d I felt *embarrassed* for reacting so strongly and *confused* because I did not understand why I felt that way. I also came to realize that when I first experienced this trigger as a child, I was *scared*. This was a surprise to me. I recognized that the noise initially startled me (it is not a sound that you would expect to elicit fear; I think it was because it was a bit loud and sudden), but my mom got mad at me for my reaction instead of \u201cprotecting\u201d me by showing care and compassion and helping me to realize that I was safe. Of course none of us understood what was going on back then, so I do not blame my parents. However, during this exercise, I felt *anger* about this too, so I allowed myself to feel it fully. \n\nAs I labeled each of these emotions, I allowed myself to fully and completely feel each one and frequently checked back in with my body to observe how they were affecting me physically.\n\nAt times throughout the process, I did try to think about the emotions objectively (e.g., I felt anger at my mom for making the sound, but why? She was not doing it on purpose, and lots of people, myself included, make that sound). This part helped me but it was not necessary.\n\n(5) I repeated steps 2-4 until I literally felt a weight lift from me. I hesitate to admit that because I would not have believed I could have felt a physical release like that had I not experienced it first hand. Since that first time, I stop when I do not feel negative emotions anymore. \n\nAfter this first experience, the trigger that I focused on was no longer a trigger. I was absolutely SHOCKED and decided to try it with my other triggers.\n\nI do want to point out that the first time I did this, it took a while (about an hour) and was exhausting. It has gotten much easier the more I have done it. \n\nSince that first time, all I have had to do to tackle most of my triggers is embrace my negative feelings when I hear the trigger. I do not leave the room when I hear the sound. In fact, I will sometimes move closer to the source. I may label the feeling and notice how my body feels while it is happening (this was more important early on), but the key for me has been fully embracing my negative feelings by holding onto it like a bucking bronco and not letting myself flee when the fight or flight kicks in. I have not been using the biolateral music when I experience a trigger in real time. \n\nI have also found it helpful to think about the sound objectively and be curious about the sound. Be warned, I will give an example with an actual trigger in the next sentence to illustrate my point. When I hear barking, I wonder what the dog is barking at. Is it playing? Does it see a person or another dog walking down the street? Is it something the dog heard or smelled? Is it trying to protect its family? Is it scared? You get the point.\n\nEVERY trigger I have tried this on is gone. It has truly been my magic bullet. \n\nSome triggers have disappeared after only doing this exercise once. It has taken a few times and greater effort for my some of my more intense triggers, but each time it gets easier. For the more intense triggers, I start by doing the full exercise as outlined in the numbered steps above and simply imagine the trigger or play an audio clip of it. \n\nI still notice many of my triggers, and sometimes I feel my body physically react to it (like I am startled for a split second) until my rational brain comes online a moment later, and I realize I am safe. Most of the time when this happens, I do not feel any negative emotions, whereas before I would have felt intense anger or disgust. Occasionally, I feel some residual anger, but I just embrace it and it disappears.\n\nThe exercise is so simple and easy, I wish I had known about it years ago. However, I have found it challenging to do when I hear more than one trigger at once or when I am mad at the person making the sound for an unrelated reason. \n\nAs a final note, \u201cfeeling my feelings\u201d has completely changed my life and not just because of how it has helped me with misophonia. I have used it for pretty much any negative emotion I have. I have used it to completely resolve negative emotions resulting from past experiences/traumas. I also use it when I am nervous or anxious about something that I have to deal with in the future. I use the \u201ccringe test\u201d as my therapist likes to call it. Any time I cringe about a situation, memory, etc., I know it is time to feel my feelings about it.\n\nFeeling my feelings has COMPLETELY changed my life for the better. I am still pinching myself.\n\nIf you have made it this far, I want to tell you that I really hope this can help you too. You are 100% lovable and worthy. You are safe, and you can do this!", "Have to wear headphones/have music on constantly Mild trigger warning for vaguely describing noises. \n\n\nI live in an apartment and the noise of apartment living drives me crazy. I constantly am wearing headphones during \u201cpeak times\u201d of noise and I am starting to feel really depressed. I do not WANT to wear headphones constantly but I also do not want to hear my neighbors. \n\n\nIn reality, I do not think the noise levels are bad at all. No loud parties, crazy music, yelling, etc. It seriously is just NORMAL level of noise in apartments (sounds of walking, doors slamming, etc). I know it is not their fault either, but our upstairs neighbors walk extremely heavy footed and it makes me irrationally angry. It also makes me paranoid constantly that I am being loud. \n\n\nI am starting to feel helpless and our lease goes for another year and then we can finally buy our own home. \n\n I am like this. \n\nI am not sure if this is a concern for you, but I reached a point where even music was too much for me sometimes.... And I am a musician!! \n\nMy therapist introduced me to a white noise app that I can mix and adjust until I find the right frequency to cancel out trigger sounds. Red noise, for instance, works exceptionally well against treble voices and high pitched whistles, hums, etc. I mix this with a low airplane engine sound and for me, it is ear nirvana. \n\nWhen I am at work and need to concentrate and worried I will snap on a motherfucker if they start eating pretzels near my space, the white noise app saves lives.  I am interested! I do have a white noise machine and it does help for sleeping for sure. I also run a fan in the living room/kitchen area to help muffle any voices or other random sounds. Unfortunately sometimes there is just no hope - when one of our neighbors (not quite sure where) has sex the annoying moans echo throughout our entire apartment somehow unless the TV is going or there is other background noises. The vibrations from the upstairs neighbors footsteps can literally be felt on the floor of our apartment. \n\n\nI really feel like I cannot complain about these people because it is not their fault the apartment just has horrible horrible sound proofing. I asked about t when we were touring and was assured it was very quiet but that is definitely not the case. \n\n\nI KNOW it could be worse and I KNOW I should not care or let it bother me but it is actually making me miserable. \ud83d\ude41 I spend as much time away from home as possible. \n\n\nAll I want is to be at peace with the sounds I hear like my partner is.  I have ( In my last apartment (several years ago), there was a neighbor in an adjacent building who would stand and talk on his phone outside, and it was just outside my bedroom wall.  I could hear him talk on his phone fairly loudly, and I always wanted to ask him to go talk on his phone inside his apartment.  I always found it fairly irritating that I had to listen to someone talk on the phone, and I did not understand why he had to talk on the phone outside rather than inside his apartment.", "People in the r/misophonia subreddit so I made a post about me giving two letters, one to each person, because I did not want to have to explain to them what misophonia was. One of them felt bad about harrassing me and the other is a manchild so he tried to report me to the cops for being suicidal. \n\nApparently this is 2 edgy 4 everyone in that other subreddit  bc I got a bunch of hate saying I have a victim complex and I am overreacting / being childish / being a bitch. \n\nThanks. Now I feel even shittier. ", "Every single day ", "2nd night at my new place ", "I forgot my headphones at home today and the two colleagues that sit closest to me always chew gum all day. RIP me.  Oh man. I might go home sick tbh. If that is not an option deep breathing and try to focus on something else, I know easier said than done.\n\nAlso, I always like to keep a cheap pair of backup headphones in my desk, in the car, and in my coat pocket. This is why I have like 8 pairs of earphones, I keep forgetting them and buying a spare one to get through the day. \n\nThe only reasonable options I see are to fill your water bottle with vodka to drown the pain, or fake your own death to get out of work.  Might have to buy some backups to keep at the office, so I will not be in this situation again! \n That is what I do. I have so many headphones. One in every bag, and two at my desk. Tell your boss you have left the oven on at home or something and either go and get your headphones, or go and buy some earplugs.  Serious question. Have you asked them to stop? Do you have a script that you practice so that you do not get emotional? I am wondering if you have been able to develop this coping skill, it is probably the hardest one.  I have not. I do not think I could ever get my self to do that.  What if they were smoking? And you had emphysema and could not breath? Would you hesitate to ask them to stop, or to ask for help from HR to get them to stop if they become ruder, or maybe you could ask to move? If you would not hesitate if they were smokers, how would you approach them with that request? What would you say? You can use the same script when approaching them about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy exactly is this any different from smokers? Figure that out and you might be able to confront your problem head on. I definitely see your point, but honestly I am not even sure I could say something then. It is stupid, I know.  It is not stupid at all, you know that. But you can figure out what the roadblock is, and you can practice and fail and practice some more too get past it to get to a point where you can confidently ask people to stop and to deal with them either helping or not. You can do it.", "Struggling to parent teenager with misophonia My 16 year old daughter has misophonia and is depressed, anxious and isolates herself in her room. We found out she had it at age 12 and have tried to accommodate every need. I am her main trigger and have almost no communication with her. She usually will not respond to texts. I avoid her presence to avoid triggering her. Her mom handles everything and their relationship is strained too. We have tried meds but no real improvement. I feel helpless in trying to even parent her in any sense because I do not know how to address her misophonia, I get no indication from her she wants to communicate, and I fear her reactions. Do you have any recommendations on what I can do? Maybe try therapy? Maybe a person outside of the family with experience in depression may help her How are you triggering her? Do you chew with your mouth open? my stepfather is my main trigger, and it is not just one trigger, when he is close i get very anxious and pretty much any sound he makes sets me off (even his voice), so that is probably what op\u2019s daughter feels She needs therapy immediately. Not only misophonia but depression is something really dangerous that can kill her if she does not get help. Good luck! What are her triggers specifically? Is it chewing with your mouth open? Sniffing? Squeaky shoes? Try to get as detailed a list as possible. I would recommend asking her over text or email so that (1) you do not trigger her while asking what he triggers are, (2) she has time to consider her answer and think things through, and (3) you have the list in writing to refer back to. \n\nNext, try to see how often you do those triggers every day. Here is where it gets tricky because you will miscount. Not because of any failing on your part but my money is on a number of those listed items being completely unconscious and you do not even notice you are doing them. In fact, I would bet there is an item or two on the list you will say you never do. \n\nOnce you get a feel for how often the triggers happen, maybe try sitting with your kid for a few minutes with *absolutely no triggers*. Like, ten minutes on the couch where you are not doing any of the things listed. Make it a game and if she catches you doing it, you owe her $10 or something. Maybe set up a recording so that you guys can do replay in case there is a disagreement over whether or not it happened (again, I suspect some unconscious actions will be on the list). Over time, see if you can increase the time - ten minutes to twenty or thirty. Eventually (hopefully) you two will be able to be in the same room for a reasonable amount of time. \n\nThis whole exercise will also show your kid that you are taking this seriously, you are actually trying to change, and that she has agency in her own life. This will not cure anything but it may lessen the friction between you two. I would recommend starting sooner rather than later as she is out of the house in a couple of years and if she associates your house with you and you with \u201cpain\u201d (or at least extreme discomfort) then she is likely not going to come back much if at all. \n\nGood luck. The most important element is hat she feels heard and that you are trying to make this right. We have tried therapy and we have moved to meds. I do not think she found it helpful and dropped it for now. Her triggers are the ones you describe but others (once I opened a sugar packet and she said that was a trigger). My presence is generally a trigger, which is why I avoid her and I have never contemplated making a list. I have taken her misophonia seriously, and maybe too seriously in a way because the easiest, safest thing to do is avoid all contact so there is no risk of triggers. I like your idea of at least trying something. Thank you. Yes. Anything I do and even my presence a lot of the time is a trigger. It is much more comprehensive than one thing. One thing that was super tough for me to figure out was what I think of as \u201canticipatory misophonia.\u201d  That is - you are not doing the thing right this minute but it is only a matter or time so now I am on edge because I am just waiting for you to do the thing and it is going to feel like a knife in my brain. So I end up associating those feelings with just seeing that person. Now even if that person is not doing the thing(s), I still dislike being in their presence because I get anxiety about when they will do the thing. \n\nIt took me a long time to put that together and just as long to get rid of it (after the person never did the thing ever again). Maybe your daughter has something similar going on? I am kind of like your kid, I live with my mom only and she is my main trigger. Even if she is just laying on the couch she is a bother to me.\n\nI do text a little with my mom even when we are in the same house and it does really help, maybe try to talk to your child about that. I am not in her head and neither are you, I completely understand that it is super scary talking to her because you do not want to trigger her.. I do suggest trying it and maybe asking what she wants from you, you could say something like \"I really love you because you are my child and I would really like to talk to you, what can I do so it will be comfortable for you?\" maybe you can write a letter to tell her that, or text her but as you said there is a chance they will not reply.\n\nI am not the kind of person that thinks family is always number one but I can really tell you do love your child and want to give them what they need.\n\nI really hope you can create a bond that you are both comfortable with! Yes I am sure she does, and I think she has it with everyone it is just a matter of degree. I wish I had had a parent like you when I was a kid trying to deal with this. Back then I did not even know that other people felt the way I did. I am 40, so no internet back then. You are awesome for trying to understand and help your daughter.\n\nFor me, the people I love the most trigger me the most. I know, small consolation. But please know that she loves you and probably feels guilty about the situation. I know I do. \n\nFor the depression and anxiety, try a different therapist if you have to but she really really should talk with someone. That would be my advice whether she had misophonia or not. Good luck to you both. I am so sorry You are a good parent. :\u2019( I try. Thanks.", "Do I have misophonia?  I have always absolutely hated chewing sounds. When I was younger, I would get very VERY angry at the people making those sounds. I thought it was norma, and when I got a little older I stopped getting so mad. \n\n Drinking, chewing, and some other sounds are still very cringe for me to hear. I do not eat with my family because I cannot stand the sound of them eating. They have always just said I was picky and I guess I just agreed. \n\n Recently it is been getting a little worse though. I cannot stand the sound of myself eating so I have to eat when I am distracted or when I am watching something. I cringe at the sound of me gulping and I do it quite often. I tried to eat a banana, but it was absolute torture. I could not do it. The sound was too much. \n\n I decided to look up what it could possibly be and apparently I potentially have misophonia. I just wanted to get the opinions of people who actually have it. Also, if anyone has any advice on how to make it less bad, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance! It sounds like you have misophonia. To my knowledge, unfortunately, theres no medicine that magically makes these problems go away, so you will have to make do with your own coping mechanisms (if that is the right word?).\n\nI have been in your situation before where my own chewing has driven me crazy. \n\nSomething what might help is if you have earplugs or noise cancelling headphones. The headphones help me, and, since my family understands, i even eat at the table with them.\n\nIf anyone is aware of any other ways to help, hopefully they will post too.\n\nI hope this helps at least a little bit.  It does help! Thanks for the advice! \n I have noticed that when I try to put earplugs in, it makes the situation even worse. I do not have to worry about other peoples eating anymore, but my own eating sounds seem amplified. I noticed that headphones with loud-ish music helps, but I do not always have them.\n My family just thinks I am picky, which I probably am, but I am fine with eating after them. \n Thanks again! Of course!\n\nAlso, i forgot to mention in my previous comment a couple of things. I notice eating things that need less chewing (smoothies, soups, etc.) help when i feel bothered with myself. Cutting my food into smaller pieces typically helps too, to a degree. In my situation, making my bites smaller than usual makes less noise.\n\nThese sometimes work for me, but maybe it will make things a bit more tolerable for you too. Thanks so much for the advice! I will try it out.", "I am sure you can relate  It is basically assault It is innacurate, the rest of the body is not filled. My sister swallows very loudly. Very annoying. Yeah, annoying as hell.

I just want to say to all of you that you are not worthless! \n\nMisophonia can feel debilitating and not all of us have come up with coping mechanisms. And even the coping mechanisms that we do come up with do not come with a 100% guarantee that we will not be triggered. It is a hard life for sure, but please understand that despite how you feel, you will survive. I hope as much as any of you that one day we will have effective treatment, but until that time comes we have to find our ways and give ourselves credit that we are strong enough to make it through the pain. \n\nPart of how we survive is talking though forums like this one. My heart goes out to every one of you that struggles. Truly.\n\nThere is research going on in the US and in the UK and I strongly believe that there are physicians and scientists that are on our side. It just takes time.

We have already come really far even if it does not feel like it. \n\nI do not any surefire answers on how to deal with misophonia.

There is a cause for this, it is misophonia and it has been triggered non stop every single day and I wish he was dead because then the fucking noises would stop.\n\nThis makes me either misunderstood or else an evil wicked person.

I was just lying in bed thinking about my dad and nearly started crying because the thought of him made my brain play trigger noises that he makes and it was haunting me.\n\nHe makes every one of my trigger sounds on a near daily basis. He sniffles at an unholy rate and intensity, he chews louder than the TV, he slurps coffee at a motorcycle volume and has multiple a day, he is addicted to gum, and drags is feet everywhere he goes.\n\nI am now afraid of him coughing because he often sniffs after a cough, and I am generally afraid to be around him when he has coffee or food (which is almost always). Because of this, I have started to deeply hate him, and I am excited when he leaves for a business trip. I can barely even stand to be around him at this point.\n\nEven though he knows about my misophonia, he will just treat it as a joke when he is in a good mood. If he is in a bad mood and catches me stating at him, he will start yelling and asking what is wrong with me angrily. Worst of all, whenever he is in a bad mood, he becomes even more obnoxious with his sounds and this causes a vicious cycle.\n\nI do not even think I can sleep now because even though I am listening to music, the sounds of him sniffing and slurping are haunting me to the point of tears. I also forgot to mention that he is a chronic nose-whistler and heavy breather, and snores, which makes vacations a living Hell. I know how you feel. When I first developed misophonia, my Dad was the source of all my triggers, and it really made me hate him. I think a big part of my problem was that I was paranoid he was doing it on purpose to annoy me (he was not, but I was still convinced). And I feel you about vacations being a living hell--I would spend every vacation locked in the hotel bathroom, earbuds in, crying on the floor. \n\nAs I have gotten older, my dad and I have had many conversations about my misophonia and he is reassured me that he does not make those noises on purpose. He is also made an effort to quiet his chewing, slurping, etc. It might be worth having a conversation sometime with your dad about how you are feeling. I found my dad was most responsive when I used \"I feel\" statements. Ex. he got really mad if I told him \"your chewing makes me mad,\" but he was way more understanding if I said s/t like \"I feel very anxious and angry whenever I hear my trigger noises.\" Also make sure he really understands what misophonia is, and how it is something you cannot control. I know everyone is parents might not be understanding, but it is worth a shot. I hope things get better, hang in there. wow, i almost thought i made this post lol. i had a crying fit thinking about my dads chewing last night. i usually avoid it if i can but there was a situation where i was stuck around it lately, and i could not get it out of my head, the memory just kept replaying over and over till i broke. i am really sorry you are going through this. something i do is kind of just make sure my dad is not going to do something triggering, and have a small conversation, and then leave. To me, its kind of just replacing the negative experience i previously had.  Sometimes when my wife triggers my misophonia I turn quickly and look at her. Apparently it is the most vile and offensive of looks so in addition to being upset with the chewing noises I get to be told/lectured about how horrible I make her feel for looking at her that way... so that is fun.", "I will have to try that...

", "any successful moving out stories?  \n\nHi all,\n\nI have been lurking around this sub for a while, and appreciate the community and support. I have been having kind of a hard week, and feeling frustrated with my living situation. I was wondering if anyone would have any stories to share to give me a little bit of a boost/hope. Here is a little about me:\n\nI am 31F, been living with my parents ever since undergrad for the past \\~ 10 years. I am very thankful to them for their support, and at the same time I have been hoping to move out in the last couple of years to have personal space. However, I have OCD which made it challenging, and misophonia is a relatively new issue for me, probably brought on by stress from work in the last \\~ 2 years. With the arrival of COVID my OCD symptoms got pretty severe, however I was able to go through a residential treatment program, and significantly improved. Funny enough, and as to be expected with misophonia, the sounds that triggered me at home (loud eating/door slamming etc) did not bother me at the residential treatment. But anyway, which brings me to today. I am working on getting a job, but meanwhile I am at home most of the time. I have been struggling to get out of bed, in part to not wanting to be around my parents and hear triggering noises. My father's chronic coughing sends me into rage/disgust. My mother is an early riser and so I hear her moving around the apartment starting from \\~7am, and I am starting to dread mornings. I keep telling myself that I can work on things step by step and move out in the next year or so, but I am just feeling stuck right now, both in my brain and at home.\n\nI should mention the things I do that help me are 1 hr walks every day, meditation, and active noise cancelling headphones. Anyway, I just wanted to hear people's successful moving out stories, since I am not feeling super hopeful right now. Thanks! Not about moving out from my parents, but worth a comment. I tried three different apartments in my college town, the noise was always awful and they were overpriced. Eventually I moved to a mobile home. Apparently a lot of students, especially veterinary and medical students, go this route because it is cheaper, has more room, and it is near the teaching hospital. It was probably the best decision I ever made. The best part? No upstairs neighbors. No side neighbors. It is the best. When I left my previous apartment I was just like \u201cfuck you all\u201d and I packed my shit and left for my new home, stopped paying rent, as they had done a shitty job maintaining the place and enforcing anything. They did not maintain their end of the lease agreement, thereby breaking it. See ya suckers. They tried to email me and call me for a while. \u201cOh, yes please do harass me some more. See how that goes for you. I highly advise you find a new tenant for Spring semester.\u201d My previous neighbors were trashy and loud. I was constantly on-edge and it made my misophonia 2x worse in a matter of months. My new neighbors are great. I have made several new friends and this also probably saved me for the online semester. Thanks so much for sharing your story, makes me a bit more hopeful :)", "Sometimes I Question Myself Sometimes I question myself about whether or not I really have Misophonia. I think I do this because I am so desperate to get rid of it. Maybe I just made myself believe I have it and it is just become routine to lash out when certain noises are made, or maybe I just want an excuse to be mad at people. I think these things when I am not experiencing a trigger...\n\nAnd then I do, and I realise that this is real, this is something I have to live with. When shopping I think, \"I could be faking it\", and then I see the man with the gum, chewing with his mouth open, making loud smacking noises, and I want everything to end then and there. It is hard not to cry in public, and I cannot run away.\n\nI ask myself while walking behind my dad into the food court, \"You do not actually have this, people struggle with it more than you.\" And then I see the woman with her young children eating, mouths open, half chewed food out on display to the world, the loud squishing, crunching, chewing, slurping. I would let out a sigh and just stare at the ground, wanting something, anything, to take me away, because I cannot get away myself.\n\nAnd then I come home. I feel safe, and I begin to relax. But come dinner time, my dad and his girlfriend, knowing my problem, insist I eat with them. I say no. They tell me to anyway. I sit with them, and within minutes I am storming out. They are just like the woman with her children, eating loudly, smacking their lips.\n\nI have mentioned time and time again that I cannot stand these sounds.\n\n\"We will try not to make them!\" They say. I do not believe them, and when they continue to make those sounds as I knew they would, I cannot ask them to stop.\n\n\"We cannot just stop instantly, it is a habit we have had for years!!!\" And now I am the problem. I am the one causing an issue.\n\nI cannot even sleep at night; as soon as I lay down, everyone in the house decides it is the perfect time to stop into the bathroom, the kitchen, their rooms, back out to the kitchen, to the living room, to laugh and yell and play videos loudly. I cannot sleep, so I walk out looking tired and angry. I get asked what my problem is, and I walk away because you know.\n\nAnd I am not the problem. You have it. HOLD YOUR GROUND Yeah that is misophonia haha.\n\nYou might want to see a therapist if you do not already. They will at least help you with coping at the very least.\n\nI treated mine with an OCD and trauma specialist, by doing 3 months of daily intensive exposure therapy. I have a hunch that for many people, these things (trauma or OCD) cause misophonia- mainly because being triggered feels just like a PTSD response, and also explains why your body does not communicate flight or right appropriately anymore.\n\nFor me, after having a good handle on the sounds, I was flooded with obsessive and constant worrying about the authenticity of my sound \u201cproblem.\u201d  That is in part a facet of having \u201cpure OCD\u201d, and a trauma response to my validity.\n\nI am not sure if you have OCD- but something in your language suggests you might., or have tendencies at least. Look up pure ocd, it is different than magical realism or contamination ocd- the two people are most familiar with and often think that is all OCD is.\n\nRegardless- just because you do not have the same sounds or intensities or whatever that trigger you, it does not make your suffering any less. Once we know more about it, perhaps research will show the nuances are related to how misophonia develops psychologically.... but regardless, just like OCD there are many versions of it. I believe the same is true for misophonia we just are not there yet in terms of research and understanding.\n\nWhat you feel in response to continuous sounds is really affecting you (effecting??) emotionally and that is misophonia.\n\nBest of luck friend! I am not a doctor but I am pretty sure you have misophonia I know in my life I told myself that I am just imagining it and I do not but after a few years I realized I do have it and we just say that we are imagining it as some sort of comfort Eating with the family is rough, I feel you on that one, my family has forgiven me for needing headphones set at a volume where I can hear them, and not be disgusted by my own chewing noises. At nighttime I use earplugs and white noise apps on devices that I set up around the room to absorb sounds from every angle. I enjoy camping, so I create the sound of a creek, and I find it soothing and easier to sleep. \nTherapy helps, and so does sharing. You are not alone, this does get easier, or at least less frustrating.", "New trigger. ): They keep adding on. You know when a spoon clinks against a bowl or a fork against a plate? Sounds like that have started to make me so irritated that I cannot focus and I want to cry. Never was like this before. Ugh, it makes me want to tear my ears off my head. I have had this same development recently. As of February-ish of this year, any sound involving ceramic and metal (or just ceramic in general) triggers me to no end. It is also the same for glassware... Clinking of classes being put away, the sound of a glass being put in the sink, the like. Same. Hell, is there even a way to prevent triggers from adding on? I have so many already. This has been a recent development I have witnessed in my pitiful situation too. Mine seems to be getting worse the older I get. I am 33 now and can easily list off 6-7sounds that make me want to go on murderous rampages without really thinking about it.\n\nPrior to about 2 years ago only had 2 things that I really hated the sound of, now there are so many it is actually affecting my life somedays. ): I am in my teens and I have about 7 or 8 things that irritate me. ): Though, it seems that trigger sounds have been adding up at a much more rapid pace for you. This happened to me a few months ago! I cannot think about going to restaurants anymore, my noise cancelling headphones do not even block out the sound of cutlery when the music is on full blast. It sucks. Surprisingly, I can watch my dad doing the dishes and I am fine with it, like as long as I can see the cutlery or the plate or whatever it does not trigger me, but if I cannot see it I get so triggered it makes me want to die. It is not the same with my other triggers.. I get triggered by mouth noises even if I can see it, in fact it is worse when I see it since with that I have \u201cmisokinesis\u201d (I think that is what it is called). Try to prevent being angry, stressed, uncomfortable, or anything like that, around certain sounds. If you are overwhelmed, put yourself in a situation where there is not just one noise or go somewhere quiet. The way my new trigger formed was because I was angry when coming home from school and my dad was loading the dishwasher, I believe. Could have been a different reason or not exactly that but I do believe it could help. I think alot of it is stemming from quarantine if I am honest. No one has been at work and I live on quite a busy estate, so I am experiencing more of the noises I hate, purely because I am at home more and so is everyone else haha. Yes, me too. My family also consists of 7 people in total, so it is difficult to find quiet. Unfortunately, I cannot tell if school is worse. We use computers and the typing and clicking of the mouse or trackpad drives me off the wall and makes it so difficult to focus I struggle not crying and drawing attention. \nIt is very difficult for me to do that, but I am trying. I try to think of a more logical thought process toward the sound, and think about the duration it will last. During some situations, this thought process only brings me more dread, and sometimes I am unsure what to do. But my main goal is in fact working on how I respond. I believe that can help me reevaluate the way I feel, and I will not have to keep isolating myself. Moving somewhere quiet has made me feel very unsocial, but of course I do not want to torture myself by continuing to hear the sound. I still have a long way to go. Managing emotions and responses is a long-term thing. Going to restaurants brought me dread because I was close to people and could hear them eating. Mouth sounds irritate the living shit out of me and whether I see it or not, whether I hear it or not, I still know it is there and it brings me so much anxiety. Just seeing the silverware hit the side of a dish makes me want to stab my ears out. Seeing it plus hearing it is terrible. And just hearing it is as bad. Exactly the same for me with chewing and eating and things. It is only silverware that is strangely different for me. My whole family laughs at it because I have to watch the dishwasher being loaded or do it myself. Makes me what to kill someone and then myself when I hear pots clinking and I am just chilling in my room, though. Oh believe me I know, me too for the entirety of that. I was not on about when you are triggered by your triggers, I was on about when you are feeling any of those things in general. If you have had a bad day and you come home to someone whistling, for example, and that is not one of your triggers, then it can turn into a trigger if you are not careful. Or so that is what happened with me I guess. God, it sucks that they laugh at you. My family has learned that it is a serious issue. Well, kind of. I hope your family gets better about it, because it is important to have that support. I know exactly what you mean. Sometimes I am pissed off and then things start annoying me more than they should and it all goes downhill. Yep, agreed. It sucks having to be careful all the time It does. I feel like I can never actually relax. Honestly I laugh with them (when I am in a good mood). My very close family are extremely supportively and understand it mostly. They know that it is serious and they always apologise when they know they have accidentally triggered me. I am lucky that they support me. It is my less close family that just think it is a weird qUirK of mine and not an actual mental disorder. They just accept that I wear headphones or earphones pretty much all the time when I am with them. Oh my god same! It is like I am on high alert 24/7 and it is honestly exhausting. Lockdown has been the best for me because it is let me stay in my room basically all day. It is unhealthy for me physically but very healthy mentally since I feel \u201csafer\u201d hah. Oh, I apologize for misunderstanding. I am very happy to hear that you have a supportive family. Misophonia is a difficult thing understand, so it may take time for the people you want to understand to understand. My family before always thought it was me being mean and me being dramatic. Lockdown is shitty for me. My father thinks I just want to isolate myself and he forces me to come out of my room. I cannot go out a lot because he works from home and I can hear his typing and his mouse and then when my brother is downstairs also playing xbox I cannot stand the sound of the controller joystick or buttons, so I have no choice but to sit in a room by myself. I mean, it also sucks because I do not like going out. Classes are not better at all due to the fact we use computers and the typing and clicking makes me want to bawl my eyes out.\n\nSo, in short, everything is kind of just shit. No worries! Yeah, it sucks when they do not realise it is not something you can help. I do not mind my less close family being not so understanding because it is difficult to get your head around when you are not going through it. It is not like they make me upset or anything. I admire your attitude towards it. That is a strength I do not have. I am so sorry. That all really sucks. Have you tried having a loud a fan in your room? I find it helps with those quieter triggers and I sleep really well with it. It is like a white noise machine. Also headphones/earphones of course. I have a fan, yes. I am able to sleep at night. White noise is probably the greatest thing ever brought into the universe. Thank you. I do not see them everyday or live with them, so it does not bother me. They do trigger me but I know it is not on purpose and I love them so I always remove myself from the situation or have earphones/headphones. Dealing with it for years and understanding it more fully as I grow older has helped. Haha I agree! My fan is a life saver. It gives me time to focus on it instead of my dad clanking silverware and pots even for a split second in order to grab my headphones. Hm, then I suppose my plan to think more logically and maturely about when someone makes a noise can greatly help. I really do not want to ruin my relationship with my family members, and though we are close now, it is still one of my biggest fears. I am sure as I get older my mindset will improve. I also am unsure what I do without the existence of noise cancelling headphones. Those are a life saver, too. Yessss they really are. :) If they truly love you, and you have explained that you really cannot do anything about how you react, I am sure your relationships will stay intact. As long as you apologise if you have hurt them and you maintain a good connection with them, you will not ruin your relationships. It also might help expressing your concerns to them. It really does help being honest, I have found.", "From perfectly fine, to triggered by EVERYTHING. Warning: description of triggering sounds. You know how sometimes you will have a person who does not trigger you at all, and then one day, EVERY FUCKING SOUND THEY MAKE fills you with rage?\n\nI am a nanny. I have been with this kid since he was five, and sure, his sounds bothered me, but in the last week or so, it is become unbearable. It started with him learned to beatbox. And I thought it was just the beatboxing sounds that did it. But no. He is also just started clicking and snapping and trying to whistle...\n\nBut even his normal sounds send me straight over the edge now. He was eating chips while I put the dishes away. Normally, I could have dealt with him doing that, but nope, not anymore.\n\nTime to invest in some kind of ear plugs, but with my sensory sensitivities, I am worried about stuff in my ears.\n\nStruggling. :( Omgomgomg. This is happening to me with someone who lives in my house. It is at the point where I just do not want to be in the same room as them. I pretty much try to leave shortly after they arrive, leaving a delay to make it non-obvious. And I feel really bad &amp; guilty for it because they are a great person who has not done anything wrong, but every -- single -- sound -- fills me with anger &amp; anxiety. Used to be completely fine, now it is everything. I have no idea why. I will blame it on being stuck inside because of a year of covid lockdown, but I totally share what you are going through...", "My whole family does not understand I hate... and I mean HATE with a burning rage eating sounds; smacking sounds and anything to do with it. Whenever I hear it; I just want to claw at something and I end up playing it over and over in my head; torturing myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI keep telling my family I HATE these sounds and it makes me so anxious and annoyed but they do not understand. They just keep doing it and tell me to get over it. My sister thinks it is personal and tells me \"WELL DO YOU WANT ME TO NOT EAT?\"  My dad once started to lick pudding and IT WAS SO LOUD. I kept telling him to stop and I turned up the music but I could STILL HEAR IT. I said repeatedly for him to stop and I hated it and it was driving me crazy but he did not stop. He kept doing this for an hour. When he finally came over to where I was, he said to me \"Who are you talking to?\" LIKE HELLO?! I WAS TALKING TO YOU!  \n\n\nThe worst part is NOBODY even understands or CARES. My grandma laughs and smiles because she THINKS I am joking which I am NOT. My parents say it is just eating noises and it is no big deal. My sister does not even care at all and thinks I am taking it too personally. Are you me?! Going through the same thing. I do not know your situation but I am trying to move out at the moment to find my own place, I cannot WAIT not to be exposed to this on a regular basis. If that is feasible in your situation, might be worth considering because often people without misophonia just do not accept it as truly legitimate )because they do not understand it) and think we are being fussy for no reason. So they never get better, and so you do not get better either. \n\nEarplugs can help but honestly I am at a point where I cannot sit at a table with someone eating no matter how good the earplugs are. Either my ears try their very best to pick out sound (thank you brain) or even the sight of a family member chewing is really angering. Longwinded way of saying get out if you can. I am so sorry you are going through this! That is super messed up how they disregard what you are going through! You deserve better than that.", "How I feel on public transportation.

I will just be labeled crazy by even the nicest people I know, they are quick to say someone is a drug addict or schizophrenic the moment they do not like the look in their eyes. \nBut I do not even care. I just never want to have to hear them again. I never want to have to see and hear actual people again. \nI hate myself for wishing I was deaf, but a lot of resources I need for learning are audio without or with inaccurate subtitles and I hate the way I have to live because of my own irrationality and lack of self control. I always managed to keep finding rational ways to stop myself from suicide back when I was actually depressed and suicidal, but what if the rationality in me just vanishes like it always does? What will become of my dreams then?\nSaying this makes me feel even worse for my most amazing friends who help me with everything and do not mind when I hang out with headphones on at times. But knowing they are there does not really help since we are not the type to sit around in the same place forever and they will all soon be gone chasing their own dreams. &gt; I will just be labeled crazy by even the nicest people I know, they are  quick to say someone is a drug addict or schizophrenic the moment they  do not like the look in their eyes.

", "the neverending sound DAE continue to hear the offensive sound after it is over?\n\nI have a neighbor whose alarm clock wakes me up. oftentimes she does not turn it off, so it will continue for up to 2 hours. sometimes she snoozes it, and then back again and the cycle continues. you know the drill.\n\ni will hear the sound all the time now, even hours later i still hear her alarm in my head. is this normal? (the irony of that question is not lost on me) Yes. I will swear to hearing the same sound or generalizing so badly that any random sound I will perceive as a throat clear or cough. sometimes i press my ear up to the wall because i am sure it is going off, and i hear nothing. Soul mate. Was doing this earlier in my new house. It is making all sorts of ridiculous sounds", "Do I have this? I came here because I think I might have misophonia, but I am not quite sure and do not want to recklessly self-diagnose. If I do, it is likely a milder form of it, however. \n\nI was diagnosed with anxiety, and I have sought help for it. I am a lot better than I used to be. But certain sounds and the sights associated with them have always really bothered me to the point of annoyance or mild panic. The sounds in question are usually loud chewing, clicking/grinding teeth, or knuckles cracking. Sometimes, especially when there are other sounds, I can manage it. I do not like it, but it is not really panic-inducing. I can stand the noises when they come from me. But when it is quiet and those sounds are one of the only things I can hear, or when I am forced to endure or stare at it happening, the reactions happen. I realized that some of what happens overlaps with what happens when my anxiety ramps up. The longer I am exposed to a noise, the more panicked and desperate to get away from it I get.\n\nI tried saying something as a child when my parents or sister would chew really loudly or with their mouths open, but I was taught that I was just being rude and had to put up with it no matter how it bothered me. I try so hard to ignore, drown out the noises, or remove myself from the area, but I will not let myself say anything about it because I do not want to be rude or inconvenience anyone by asking them to stop. Besides, they would probably just think I am weird. \n\nI want to talk to my therapist about this, but I am worried that I will just get dismissed because it is not an official disorder or something and it is (kind of) a self-diagnosis. I am mostly just not sure how to cope with what I experience or how to deal with it. It sounds like you might have misophonia. My GP was quite dismissive of me when I told him as a kid that I react in panic or anger at certain noises and and even sent me in to do tests for hearing loss which was funny and odd to me, but in hindsight a lot could have been avoided if he took me seriously at the time. If I am being triggered I will not sit there and let it escalate but I would leave the room. I also have a set of noise cancelling headphones that helps. Definitely try to see someone about this but be prepared for your misophonia to be dismissed (which a lot of people with the condition have experienced).\n\nEdit: also there is not much that a doctor or therapist can do to treat it as it is a newly discovered condition but they can diagnose you so that you can provide medical proof for work or school related reasons. But there is things that you can do yourself to make life more bearable like buy noise cancelling headphones, ear plugs for sleeping, and one particular device that acts and looks like a hearing aid for those with misophonia (I cannot remember the name but if you want I can try to find to find it for you) Thank you so much, it is nice to know that it is not just me. Sometimes I cannot really do anything while being triggered (for example: someone eating loudly right across from me during a lecture and not being able to leave or ask the person to stop without feeling bad), but I have been trying to cope as much as I can. It is just really difficult. I am relieved to know that there is a name for it, but not being able to do much about it is frustrating. It is ironic, really- I am a musician, I adore sound, but specific ones make me want to tear my hair out No problem! Had I known that there were also others like me when I was younger, it would have helped me immensely. Is there any way that you could avoid these situations before being triggered, such as sitting at the front and near the lecturer so that you do not have to listen to people eating? Students at the front are not going to be eating or chewing gum out of respect for the lecturer. Learning your triggers and finding a way to work around it has helped me, and as another example, I have learnt to sit in a quiet corner of a restaurant rather than in the centre in order to avoid any triggers. But of course you can adjust this to fit into your daily life and what triggers you!", "s2 euphoria hi friends this is for my babes out there,,the new episode of euphoria that came out last night has soo many triggers in the first half, like the \u201ccommon\u201d ones if yk what i mean. \n\nwhen fez and sweeney are in the kitchen together just fricken mute it okay \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\n\nbut for real have ur volume control on standby the entire ep for real. stay strong soldiers. \n\ncan we talk about how every new indie show or movie includes like hella m**** noises for no reason? ughhhhh what is thatttt", "Misophonia and the movies Hey guys, I have not been to a movie in forever but I was just thinking of all the sounds in there that I hate! \n\nDoes anyone else eat their popcorn strategically to block out the other peoples sounds or is it just me \ud83d\ude02 Yes and every time it is quiet I stop eating so I do not hear anything unless my family is eating for some reason my mom told us respect and manners like eating with your mouth closed but she never does her eating is the worse and it hurts to hear it it is so gross and she does not close her mouth unless it is around church people or something I have repeatedly told her about my problems but she does not care. I do not know how much I can take !! I have not been to the movies since before my misophonia developed and I have heard so many horror stories that I am not sure I ever want to try. I have had to deny trips to the movie theatre with my friendgroup in the past. Thankfully, they are understanding I always wait to eat the popcorn until it is quiet and the movie starts, with the noise of people talking the crunching is not as bad but during the movie it is unbearable and running out of popcorn is not an option. I just take notes at the same rate as the people around me to drown it out. I do not go a lot for a bunch of reasons, when I do go I choose off times when there is less people and now that I have my own money I purchase the refillable popcorn so I never have to stop munching. My chewing will cancel theirs out lol I can just about handle it, but often need to change seats away from anyone chewing, sniffing etc. Sometimes I just cover my ears, as the movie itself is loud enough to still hear it That is the opposite of me though it does make sense. The only thing though is the movies I go to is $1 meaning older movies but still new. So my mom does not wait to eat once she sits down she is ate almost half the popcorn (a little) so I do not want the popcorn to run out I eat during the movie because it is loud and the people are usually quiet.I do not even like the sound of my chewing my family made sure of that. I usually annoy myself with my own chewing when it is quiet in the movies.. if that is any indication of my level of hatred for chewing. Depending on what I eat, I annoy myself. The only beings in this world that get away with chewing sounds is my kids. Their little crunching is so damn cute sometimes\u2026I was actually terrified before I had kids that they would trigger me so hard. I almost always have movies ruined by misophonia, However yesterday I had a 10 mg edible before Dune and managed to get throught it with a loud fan + guy eating chips. \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41 me reading this 22 weeks pregnant worried about my misophonia so thank you for this I even had another kid! \ud83d\ude02 you are so happy once the teeth breakthrough that hearing those crunches is a relief. It should be tolerable if not it is a great opportunity to gently teach them table and eating manners. You got this girl! Cannabis to the rescue, my favorite coping mechanism! i do not go to the cinema either but how bout some earplugs? like not completely noise cancelling but enough to hear the film Lmao definitely\u2026. even at home I will eat strategically so my own noises block out others\u2019 chewing sounds \ud83d\ude02 I always have to sit in the very back and as far away from other people as possible, if someone is eating behind me, forget it! I wear earplugs in the cinema. I can still hear the movie but not the noise. Plus I sit in the back row in a corner so I do not have anyone around me except hubby and he rattles a candy bag. I just want to stab him sometimes!", "Having a family discussion about misophonia My youngest son (11) has misophonia. Looking back I think he has suffered from it since birth. I can remember times when he was only a year old and would cover his ears all the time because of noises. We have discussed misophonia within our family to try and get his older brother (13) and dad to understand, which they do to a certain extent, but do not try as hard to be conscious of it all the time. \n\nLast night my son and I were talking and he asked if we could try and talk about misophonia with our family again so they would realize how serious it actually is. I showed my son some of the posts on this site to show him he is not alone and he asked if we could show those to his dad and brother. Dad and brother are open to this and we all talked a little about it today but not an actual sit down.\n\nWas wondering if anyone would be willing to share how their family effects their misophonia, especially during meals or eating in general. Another trigger for him is heavy breathing which my husband does all the time. I feel like them hearing what other people deal and how it makes them feel (raging, anger, crying) might make it sink in a little bit more. I just want to help him as much as possible and show him that we take it seriously and are willing to try our best. \n\nAs I am writing this he just ran out of the living-room to his bedroom because his brother is eating chips. Ugh, I feel so bad that he has to deal with this. Thank you for being such an understanding parent and for taking him seriously. That alone would be making a world of difference in his life and he is a very lucky kid to have you. \n\nAs for your question - I always felt trapped by things like family meal time, or any miso-inducing situation I was expected to stay in. To make people understand, I say it is like being locked in a room with people scraping their fingernails on chalkboards. I also find people understand more when I describe it like a phobia. It is the same as being arachnophobic and having a bunch of tarantulas coming in and out of your house. \n\nThis is just my completely nonprofessional opinion so take it with a big grain of salt but I think the best thing to do is help and encourage your son to tackle this head on (seeing a psychologist was a huge turning point for me and I 100% recommend it) but let him do so at his own pace. If he wants to eat seperately from the family or avoid movie night that is ok, forcing him to confront it when he is not ready WILL make it worse. Thank you so much for sharing! That makes perfect sense to describe it like a phobia. He has noise canceling headphones he wears for meals but he gets up and paces all the time. I am realizing now it is probably the misophonia making him pace. He never is frustrated or angry when he gets up, he is just talking about normal daily stuff that is why I never associated it with it. There are many times he gets angry from it though. I would hate for him to not eat with us! He is crazy and random and asks the most off the wall questions all the time. I love it! Makes dinner time more interesting, life would be so boring with him not around. \n\nHe was all set up to see a therapist, saw her one time before all this virus stuff happened and they rescheduled his appointment. I have suffered from misophonia for a very long time. I first noticed it when I was younger when I would be enraged if I heard breathing/snoring noises. I also could not have anyone breathe on me. As I got older, I could not listen to eating noises, particularly from my family. This made family meals extremely difficult. Not to freak you out, but I think that it is important to share. I did start to harm myself at dinner by digging my nails into my leg to distract myself from noises. I told my mom about my issues with noises, and I ended up seeing a therapist (cognitive behavior therapy) to help cope. \n\nAs another user said, hearing a trigger noise is very intense. At least for me personally, it completely takes over my brain, and I immediately feel overwhelmed and panicked. I either need to leave a room or I get upset and will react physically. I listen to music while I eat now to take some of the stress out, but it is still rough sometimes, especially if I am stressed about school. \n\nI think it is important to note that he should adjust to noises at his own pace. Being exposed to a lot of noises at once in order to adjust is extremely overwhelming. \n\nIt is great that you and your family are supportive, it makes misophonia sufferers lives a bit easier!! Your son is not alone! If you or your son have questions, feel free to DM me! I have got the perfect thing for this! \n\n What??? You are SO kind!!!! I\u2018m 13, so I am the child in this particular situation. My dad *lip smack* does not *food eaten* care *foot shuffle* and *click click* honestly I think he tries to make it worse for me. My mum says \u201eomg omg miso what what? Ok I do not care because it is a self diagnosis means you certainly do not have it. It is not possible for you to be smart enough to diagnose yourself or for that matter think\u201c or I mean, those are vibes I get. My brother... well... he just gets angry and crunches in my face. My friends do not give a fuck, and they do not have to anyway because it is not theirs, but they could at least not lip smack in my face when I am on sensory overload (I do not use those words anywhere else other than here because then people say I am being dramatic) and laugh at me while I have a nervous breakdown (everyone does this. I am just used to having them everyday and hiding them). I do not have anyone to talk to. There\u2018s literally nobody that cares, believes, or for that matter they just make it worse. Now they think I am crazy and I do not have any headphones. So... well... sorry about my rant, I am just so angry. But at least I have Reddit. think I am going to fuck up my already deformed brain one day. I just have to keep my posture for 5 more years. Then my overprotective dad can go fuck himself. In conclusion, you are the most caring, wonderful parent I have ever heard of. You deserve hugs and a thousand of those #1 Parent mugs. Thank you for understanding your child. I usually suggest this as a starting point for your discussion\n\nLetter to Friends, Family, and Co-workers\n\n(\n\n*Before* the meeting make sure that they know that you have a **PPP** of \n\n**Purpose** of discussing the disability, the\n\n**Process** being that you will review and discuss the Letter with them, some of his triggers, how it is like being stung by a wasp so he cannot always control it, things that they do that actually help him cope, ways that he can ask for help that does not trigger him or get him emotional, and\n\n**Payoff** being that everyone gets along better with more love. And more importantly that he understands that this is a disability that is not his fault, but is his to manage with the help of others and that he should NEVER be ashamed to ask for *and demand* help from others. He should learn to recognize when people use it against him as abuse and neglect and that he is worthy of love and attention. Thank! This is perfect. The end goal is the Payoff. I just want everyone to get along better and be understanding. Thank you for sharing! Sounds like you had a supportive mom that helped you out. That is what I am trying to do and would like the whole family to be as supportive as they can. I am hoping that if he feels like he is safe with us here, to be able to talk about it, he will not get to a point he has to self harm or hide away as much. I understand he will still have moments where he needs some quiet time though. \nSchool is a hard thing for him too. I did talk to his teacher about this because for a while he had my son sitting next to the Tissues so all the kids would come over by him when they blew their nose. I figured this out because we kept getting calls from the school that he was having terrible headaches and wanted to come home. By the time he was home he was fine. We now have something worked out where, if things become overwhelming, he can go to the office to decompress for about 20 minutes then go back to class. This seemed to help a lot. I am sorry your siblings did that. We only have the two boys and I do not want my youngest to resent or have hatred for his brother because of this. That is why I want my oldest to get a clear picture of how serious this is. I am so sorry things are like that for you at home. That really really sucks. I grew up in a home with overbearing parents who I could not open up to or talk about things. They are very strict, bible thumping Christians. That is why I want to make sure our boys know they can talk to us about anything and we will not just dismiss them or make them feel alone. Hang in there and reach out if you ever need to vent or just want someone to listen and take you seriously. Please please please help him develop the courage to demand help and to never be ashamed. There is something about misophonia that brings so much shame with it that people do not ask for and get the help they need, help that is available. It is a disability. And as such he has rights. \n\nAnyone who can help and will not are Rats. Be the Dog. Eat the Rat. He owes abusers nothing. Thankfully he is very open with me and talks to me about everything. I am hoping if we can give him a healthy living environment at home it will give him more confidence everywhere else. Misophonia, unfortunately, is not the only thing he deals with. He has had 2 major surgeries when he was younger for unique, uncommon things. Has minor sensory issues that even his therapist says he is right on the line where medication could help but it might not be necessary. I would rather not medicate if we do not have to, I do not want anything to dull him. And this last fall he was just diagnosed with epilepsy, thankfully fully controlled by medication. He asks all the time why all the weird stuff happens to him and nobody else in our family. It breaks my heart. I do not want him to feel different about himself, I get nervous about depression as he gets older. I am trying to build him up and give him all the confidence he needs now so that, hopefully, it will not be so hard for him down the road. Thank you, it means a lot.

I believe this is in part because of being homeschooled by her in a very toxic home encironment for much of my childhood. I could not escape her or her noises. These days she knows full well what my condition is and still takes every opportunity to poke fun at it. Say we are visiting as a family and she decides to start snacking while talking, I will try to quietly walk away without drawing too much attention to it. She will then outright laugh at me and \"joke\" about how I cannot handle her chewing. This happens literally every time we eat together, to the point that my whole family knows about my miso and makes fun of it. It makes me miserable, and I think the lack of empathy and respect has actually made my miso worse. To be clear, my misophonia should not be someone else's problem. But when I try to cope the only way I can, I do not appreciate being made fun of for it. It is exhausting. No one in my family really seems to take the condition seriously at all, and family dinners feel like minefields. I think this has actually made my miso worse. I find myself triggered more and more by the sight of chewing, which makes my job hard to cope with because my job allows people to eat at their desks, and even with headphones in, I am still constantly working around triggers. I am just so tired of this, but it seems like there is nothing more I can do. Nobody seems to understand just how miserable misophonia can be unless they have it themselves.  I cannot be the only one who struggles with this. I just do not know what more I can do. Wow your family sound like real assholes. How long before you can live independently? And how have you explained misophonia to them - have they seen medical information about it or articles explaining how traumatising it can actually be?\n\nShow them absolutely zero tolerance for that kind of immature behaviour. You can walk away and refuse to engage. I can only offer this, see if this helps\n\n( I have lived on my own for several years now. I am mostly referring to holidays and family visits in my post, which only happen about once a month at most, but are still frustrating when they do happen. I have been far too passive for the sake of trying to not rock the boat, not make other people uncomfortable, etc. but honestly, fuck that. It is not my fault that I struggle with this. I have not shared articles or medical info as of yet, but I do plan on it. I have explained misophonia to them, mostly my mom since she is the one who causes the most problems, but it is not taken very seriously. I think I need to show that I take it seriously and expect others to take it seriously as well. I have a history of letting people walk all over me (has a lot to do with the toxic home environment referenced in the post), which i am working on and getting better about. The zero tolerance approach is a good idea. If expressing my needs offends someone, fuckem Yeah I realized afterwards and edited my comment, sorry for misreading! I understand, it is so hard to stand up to people. But you are right, they need to understand the seriousness of it. My advice would be to stay as calm and logical as possible when standing up for yourself because any display of emotion could just be used as ammo by them. \n\nI have friends who have done the same to me (but less severe) and they realized after I said \"guys you need to stop, this problem has such a terrible impact on my life that I am going through cognitive behavioural therapy to attempt to treat it\". This is really solid advice, thank you. The fact that taking that approach worked for you makes me more optimistic thank you for this! please let me know if it helps, good luck my friend! Hey, I just wanted to add that this may take a lot of courage, but it is courage that you have more of than anyone that you know since you confront your triggers all the time and have to deal with them. Confronting friends and family should be easy for you, just keep your cool and do not freak out if you still get push back. Wow, I had not thought of it that way. Thanks again!", "Misophonia brings the worst out of me. I have had misophonia for a long time. Some sounds I can just get up and move away from or I just tell someone to stop. I hate snoring, chewing and drinking.\n\nLately my anger has been building up. Every time I hear a trigger sound I get really tense and start tearing up.\n\nYesterday a girl on the bus was slurping up an empty cup of McDonald\u2019s drink, I asked her to stop.She replied \u201cpiss off loser\u201d.  My airpods (which are the only things that help me) ran out of charge. I am a little guy and I never try to get into arguments, but after another 10 minutes of the constant slurp sound, after 10 minutes of torture and tears my anger built up so much that I got up and grabbed her by the shirt and started punching her constantly. I was pulled back by some men and shortly after I was kicked off the bus and police came and picked me up, luckily I had no charges put on me.\n\nMisophonia turns me mad. It is like I am a man that I despise to be. My anger is so short termed now that I turn into a monster when my trigger sounds are played.\n\nI hate this. I hate this. Misophonia is the worst thing to exist. I would pay any amount to get cured of it. I just want to run away for ever and never see another human again. I clicked on this thread to tell you to chin up, and that we all deal with the flood of anger at our trigger sources. But damn, dude. It sounds like you need some extra help. ....no way. Ya, and headphones/earbuds that do not need to be charged when you need them to avoid trigger sounds. Good luck, I hope it gets better for you. Yeah, I am having trouble believing this. If you actually did this, you need professional help. Rule number 2? Man, I am sorry that your experience is so overwhelming. It really is a horrible disorder that takes over your whole emotional processing. It makes me feel like I want to hit dogs that I am house sitting with so I understand the rage.\n\nHave you ever set up any therapy? It might help in other parts of life to lessen the stress you feel so you might not have such a strong response and have another outlet instead. Also, even writing stuff down that is stressing you out sometimes helps so your brain does not feel like it has to juggle all this mess on its own.  \nBest of luck in life! It sucks but at least it is becoming more known about..maybe someone will figure out something to help us all. Dude, no. All of us misophonia people get enraged by sounds but we do not start punching people. It can take all of your self control to hold off until you can get away, but that is what you must do.\n\nIt does not sound like you have seen a therapist. If you are at the point where you are physically violent with strangers, you know that you cannot just hope it goes away or that it gets better on it is own. The only thing you can do is to develop some coping mechanisms and a therapist can help. Also, get yourself a portable battery pack (under $25)  to carry at all times. This is not just misophonia. This is an anger management issue. You have both anger and misophonia and should see a therapist to learn how to deal with each. Misophonia is a trigger for anger (I also deal with anger and misophonia is a trigger for me, though I have not had violent urges toward people before). I am leaving this up because it does not break Reddit's content policy as far as I know.  There is nothing here that entices or encourages violence - in fact, it is pretty clear that OP does not like what allegedly happened.  \n\nThe motivation behind rule #2 is to abide by Reddit's content policy while still providing a place to vent and maybe get some advice as well.  \n\nAs far as believing OP's story goes  - that is what the downvote/upvote button is for, not the report button. You are right. I am going to sign up for weekly therapy sessions, hopefully they can tell ways to deal with my anger and misophonia. I just want to be able to sit and eat with people. If someone did something to trigger a ptsd episode for someone and did not stop, they would get beaten up by other people. 10 minutes of her slurping and that about equates a bit too much. I know bc my experience with ptsd and miso and 10 minutes of hearing that would bring me to a worse breakdown than someone grabbing me ever could. I always compare misophonia to ptsd because for me it is similar except it is unfair how ptsd is more understood when for me at least it is nothing to misophonia. I have started to cut up my arms and legs again because of it and that with being bulimic is the only thing that makes me feel anything. I cannot get a job because what if there is some house nearby who likes to party. Or just even one day they decide to blast music. In the least, they should be able to help offer ways to deal with the anger portions because it definitely sounds like you could use another outlet. I have gone myself and it can really help to even just have someone to vent to about all the shit you are worried about.\n\nSide note, if you do go and after a bit do not feel like it is a great fit try another therapist. I like to think of them like friends, there are some that you will mesh with better than others so just keep trying if that is the case.", "My mom My mom: \u201cchew with your mouth closed!!\u201d\nAlso my mom: *slurps a burrito bowl* My mom : \u201cif it bothers you then just ignore it.\u201d\n\nMe : *the \u201cyou do not say\u201d Nicholas cage reaction face* my dad really do be like this too :( how tf does one manage to slurp a burrito bowl lmao My dad is like this, always tells me to chew with my mouth closed at dinner but he is the loudest gum chewer I know!", "Does the sound of people coughing drive you insane? I am not sure why but it really invokes a rage whenever I hear people cough. It seems like everywhere I go multiple people are coughing every few minutes. How is this so common? It is especially irritating if it is one of those phlegmy, blood curdling hacks. Stay home if you are sick!!! It probably adds to my rage that I know they are likely doing it into their hands \ud83d\ude16 My husband was offended when I told him my greatest fear about him getting Covid was the coughing that comes with it. Apparently I was supposed to be more worried about the side effect of DEATH. Listening to him cough endlessly would have caused MY death. \ud83d\ude02 LMAO before sick/flu season comes around I dose my whole household with vitamin d/zinc/bone broth, garlic etc etc because.... you know... I want them to be healthy.... \ud83d\ude2c Coughing is not the worst for me. I would give it a 3/10 on a trigger scale. If I were in an environment where I had to listen to someone cough all the time though, that would definitely have me fucked up. Exactly, I am sure it has nothing to do with the sniffles and sneezes and coughs and phlegm\u2026 Omg yes. I cannot stand when my husband gets sick because his coughing sends me into a rage. We also currently live with his mother due to some financial problems and every morning when she wakes up, she has a coughing fit for seemingly no reason. She is never been a smoker or anything like that so I do not understand it, but it drives me absolutely batty. It is not the coughing for me. My Fianc\u00e9 blows his nose so much because he works around a lot of rust and dirt.\n He always blows his nose in the middle of our conversations, or when I am trying to eat and it rubs me the wrong way because it is so loud! :( \nI wish I was not bothered by something like this. It seems so trivial to most people. Yes omg it suckssss so much. Also people clearing their throats constantly drives me insane \ud83d\ude2d I have found my people! Chewing does not bother me much, but \"sick noises\" (&gt;!coughing, sneezing, sniffling, throat-clearing!&lt;) make me want to depart this world, not just because of the sound, but also because they can be a sign of contagious illness. What is worse is so many people do not cover their mouths. Maybe it is respiratory allergies? You could gently suggest that she sounds uncomfortable and ask if she is tried talking to her doctor. Allergy meds can help. It does not sound trivial to me. Blowing your nose while someone is eating sounds unhygienic, to say the least. You could say that it makes you uncomfortable (using \"I\" statements), and politely ask if he could step out of the room when he does that. Could he wear a dust mask at work, at least during the dirtier tasks? I have heard some people do this who work in landscaping and construction. It is one of my lesser triggers but yeah.

If someone sniffs once, or makes a trigger noise once, I am usually ok. But after two or three, I am listening for them. I cannot *NOT* hear them. My concentration disappears.

After that he started hacking loogies about 5 - 10 times a day.  I asked him about it and he told me that he is been getting incredible mucus build up and that he has to do that in order to breathe.\n\nOnce lockdown hit that 5 - 10 times day morphed into MULTIPLE TIMES A MINUTE.  And it is not just a polite \\*AHEM\\* \\*AHEM\\* throat clearing.  The man does it in the most guttural, visceral way imaginable and it is so loud that wearing ear plugs or headphones with music does nothing because I can hear him do it from all the way across the house.  I even heard him doing it from across the street one time.    \n\n\nI have explained to him how grating the sound is, and he initially agreed to try to cut down and find help for his mucus build up problem but since then has simply denied that he does it that often.  It interrupts my train of thought whenever he does it, which is bad enough since I already have severe ADHD.  It screwed me up on my final projects and studies towards the end of my last semester of college because I did not have the option of going anywhere else due to fucking lockdown.  Nobody wants to come over because of it, and even people I talk to in discord VC have complained about it.  He also does this shit when he is on discord with his friends and even on the phone with his boss / graduate advisor who for whatever reason have not called him about it.   \n\n\nI will be moving out shortly because I cannot take this anymore, and it really has started to push me back into the \"learned helplessness\" state that has screwed my life over multiple times in the past.  It legitimately feels like divine punishment at this point. Guy prob has tourette's or acid reflux. I am so sorry you are going thru this. I had a coworker who did the same guttural throat clear/grunt sound every 1-3 seconds for hours. Weirdly enough some days it did not happen, other days it lasted all day long. I think it was something done out of nervousness. Either way it drove me to tears and so when I came home and I would binge eat to soothe myself. It was hell.\n\nDef move. Do not stay if you have the option to get out. This is why I never wanted roommates, because I cannot handle stuff like this. I hope you find relief Oh boy. Had the same thing happen in university. Our dorms are basically one small room that 2-3 people share, and one of my roommates developed that same thing, coughing every few seconds up to 4 am, since she did not go to classes in the morning. Took me 6 months to get the fuck out but it was SO WORTH IT. Please get out of that situation, your mental state will recover. Hell, i did not even see how much it affected me until i moved. I feel for you. Pre covid there was this asshole at my gym who did this in the shower every damn day. It is literally the most disgusting sound. I cannot imagine living with someone doing it multiple times a day What I want to know is how do people go on coughing/hacking up loogies every 1-5 seconds all day without realizing it is a problem ? See a doctor, my gosh. Nobody wants to listen to that. Apparently, according to all people i spoke to about them triggering me, they do not notice the sounds they make. Lucky them, huh? Must be nice. ! My brother does this all the time! I did not even know this was a thing.", "triggers does anyone else accidentally trigger your own triggers?? it does not happen all the time to me but i find that sometimes the sound of my self chewing or even just swallowing triggers my miso. it is so.... frustrating. i cant even sit with family to eat dinner without getting triggered now sometimes i cant even bare to eat because i trigger myself. i just want to live a normal life but atm i do not think i can Yes when I smack my own lips by accident I hate it Yes, especially misokinesia triggers.

Hell, there is one who will facetime his wife while on his lunch break, so he smacks his lips and talks for the whole hour. I am actually getting frustrated just typing this out.\n\n  Not saying it is strictly a race/culture thing, that is not my intended meaning. My dad is a white guy and he cannot chew quietly to save his life. I have even explained to him how uncomfortable it makes me, but he just makes fun of me and does it louder. I wear hearing aids, and if he notices me turn down the volume or turn on my noise filter setting, he just intentionally chews louder to make sure I can hear it. If I take them out, I cannot talk to my mother (we do not sign). Do you think it would be out of line to make sure I eat in a room separate from him for every meal? \n\n(For the record, I am in my early 20s, and I will be moving out soon, but I just cannot stand him anymore. Sorry for any mistakes, I am just a dumbass.) Not at all. If he is going to be such an asshole that he, your father, *purposely* causes you, his kid pain just for the fun of it, he does not deserve to be your father. I know that sounds extreme, but that is a real dirtbag move. I think that it is totally fine for you to eat in a separate room, away from someone who is so inconsiderate. Maybe your dad is a great guy otherwise, but if he is going to do that, you do not owe him anything. Can you eat in a different room than your coworkers, or at least wear headphones? That might help. I do not usually stick around long for family meals, it annoyed my parents at first, but they got used to it. It is something they can get used to, you cannot get used to misophonia. Do not feel bad for having to leave. My dad used to do this to me as a kid, but with making his face a resonance chamber (I hate the word). Our relationship has been severely damaged since, I would suggest distancing yourself as much as possible if you want to avoid even more disdain for your dad.", "Unsure whether I should open up to my family about my misophonia or not I am in high school right now, and my misophonia is starting to get worse every day. I am always having to go to school wearing ear plugs or earphones to block out noises so I can study, but that is usually not enough for me, and I am left feeling exhausted and anxious whenever I come home\n\nHome is not very trigger-proof either.

I have a white noise machine in my room which helps, but I really just want silence sometimes instead of constant white noise.\n\nI am feeling more and more miserable every day, and even more desperate to talk to someone about this. But neither of my parents even know what misophonia is. I know they are both sympathetic people and they would probably understand my situation, but I am still afraid to talk to them about it.\n\nI have read too many horror stories on this subreddit, \"My mom intentionally triggers me\" this, \"my dad makes fun of me for my misophonia\" that, I am just so scared of that happening to me.\n\nBy directly telling my parents about my misophonia, I am making myself vulnerable, they *could* use it against me. I know for sure they would not, but I keep thinking \"what if\"\n\nI do not know how to approach them about it either. I am thinking of starting by talking to my mom about it since she is the \"easy one to talk to\" and trying to see if I can maybe talk to someone or at least help weaken my misophonia. I am not going to ask her to downright stop making trigger noises, I know that is unreasonable to ask of her, because I am not as quiet as I would like to think I am. That would just be hypocritical and controlling.\n\nThinking of all the possibilities that could happen is making me anxious, what if she does not believe misophonia is real? What if she thinks I just need to \"learn to tune out noises\"? What if she gets angry at me for being agitated about the noises they make?\n\nBut the biggest thing I worry about is making a fool of myself. What if I look stupid for trying to explain misophonia to her, and make it sound like I am crazy? What if she thinks the articles and research about misophonia are silly?\n\nOr what if nothing happens afterwards? She just forgets about the whole talk, and I am completely out of people to talk to? There is nobody else I am comfortable talking to about something like misophonia.", "could this possibly be misophonia? i posted about this in the anxiety subreddit and was pointed in this direction so i want to talk about what i am going through on here and see what you guys think. \n\ni have always been easily startled by loud noises, and it will take me some time to recover from them because of how anxious they make me. but lately i am not just anxious about loud noises, but practically any noises that are out of my control. \n\nhearing people walking around gives me anxiety attacks. the tv playing in the background makes me want to scream. when my stepsister opened and closed her door earlier i nearly bit myself to stop myself from crying or yelling. my mom just opened and closed the closet door and i did end up biting myself and afterwards i sat in bed and sobbed. \n\ni do not know what to do. i am constantly on edge and anxious because i live in a pretty noisy household - three people and two dogs. i am desperate for relief. even when wearing earbuds listening to meditations or music it is as if i am hyper-aware of the noises i do not want to hear and i cannot even concentrate on what i am listening to. it feels like torture, going through this all the time. \n\nso, is this maybe a misophonia thing? or maybe something else? tell me your thoughts and if anyone has tips on how to cope with this please share, i am desperate. \n\n(marked NSFW in case any of this is triggering to anybody) Being startled does not sound like misophonia, but the rest does. Do you know why they startle you?  \n\n\nI do not think many people will be able to help with coping, that is one of our biggest problem areas... we do not know how. I think talking to your family is a good start, even if you are afraid of what they will think. Good luck to you &lt;3 yeah i used to be just startled by noises but now it is full blown anxiety and panic. i am not really sure, i think i am just a jumpy person. \n\ni talked to my mom about it a bit today and she said \"well i do not really know what you want me to tell you\" haha. i only briefly brought it up though. i will go more in depth with them when i can the chance. thank you! \ud83d\udc96 No worries, it is always best to talk to your family about it when you are relaxed- it is easier to explain and get your feelings across that way! My husband and I rent a basement apartment from his parents and my MIL closing the bathroom door upstairs without turning the handle makes me angry every time. Also when she runs up the stairs loudly. Also whenever she drops something on the floor, which seems to be often. Also whenever their dog jumps off the bed and sounds like a bowling ball falling on the floor. \n\n\nPanic or anger about sounds is most likely misophonia. The only suggestions I can offer is trying to figure out the circumstances surrounding when you get the most anxious. Did you get enough sleep? Did you eat something that did not make you feel good? Do you have some other physical need or circumstance making you anxious? Take care of those things first and your anxiety may lessen some. Other suggestion is something I think I actually read here. Whenever you get triggered, actively relax your entire body and focus only on that. It helps lessen the tenseness in your mind. \n\n\nI am sorry you are going through this. Misophonia is a painful mean curse to deal with. I have the same problem! my upstair neighbour footstep noises makes me anxious and if it is repetitive it is makes me anger and rage. My problem is a bit different only upstair neighbour noises makes me angery or anxious. So two weeks ago I decided to ask for help to psychiatrist and she recommend me to a book called \"It did not start with you by Mark Woolyn\" so in that book author mentioning that this kind of behaviours can be transmitted from our parents or their parents. So I decided to do a bit research and suddenly I noticed that my father used to have \"EXCATLY SAME THING\" he always knocked on the wall or punched to the wall to let our upstair neighbours walk slowly. So that moment I figured that this can either be \"social learning\" or behaviour transmitted from my father to me. So currently I am trying to contact with my father to understand and find the root cause of the problem.  \n\n\nSo during this time. I started to do meditation to be more mindful about noises and feelings. So I also recommend you to just give it a shot for a month. You are not alone and you will get through this. If you hear this noises constantly you can also open White, Pink or Brown noises so in the background it can consistently play and it helps a bit to absorb those noises. You need brown noise ASAP. i find that i get a lot more angry and anxious about the noises when they wake me up from sleep. i cannot really think of a way of helping this except for maybe sleep aids, because i am such a light sleeper and when i take sleep aids they do knock me out pretty good. they used to give me bad dreams, but i will try taking some melatonin again and see if that helps. and thank you for the last tip as well, i will try that next time i start to feel panic come on! \n\nthank you, i am just glad to finally find a community of people who understand. i did not know about misophonia before yesterday and thought that i was alone in how i was feeling. i am finding a lot of comfort knowing that there are people who feel the way that i do. thank you! i meditate every night to fall asleep, but sometimes the noises get in the way of hearing and enjoying the meditation videos i listen to. i will definitely try out your last suggestion and see if it helps is there a big difference between brown noise vs white noise, pink noise, etc? i do not know much about this stuff so not sure what will be best Well brown noise covers most noises for me, and it is easily ignored.\n\nPink and White noise sounds too abrasive to me.\n\nI find even having a fan or a computer left on 24/7 stops me from \u2018searching\u2019 for noises.\n\nTry it today, I hope you will really like it.\n\nIt is really helped me.\n\nYou sound hyper vigilant, did something happen to trigger this? Or have you always been like this with noise.\nMyself, I got hyper vigilant after my neighbour knocked on the walls at 2am every night and woke me, now I am scared of that happening again; even though I have moved house, it is just anxiety.\n\nOne day you can have your own home where you will not have all this noise around you all the time, it is something to look forward to :) got it. thanks, i will try that out! i keep my fan on pretty much all night but it is not enough for me, i will try out brown noise tonight. \n\ni do not know, i feel i have always been like this but not to this extent if that makes sense. i feel like something in me just.. cracked. and while before noises would irritate me a little bit sometimes, they are now making me hurt myself and making me panic. i am not sure if something specific caused me to crack or if it is just the stress from the current state of the world right now. \n\nyes i cannot wait to move out. i need my own space for peace and quiet lol. It will definitely have something to do with being on lockdown and everybody being home 24/7.\n\nThings will get better soon when there will not be so many people around all the time annoying us :)\n\nI also found saying to myself or out loud, when something annoys me; \u2018it is still daytime so it is normal and absolutely fine that my neighbour is listening to music right now\u2019 (because my main trigger is loud music), it really helps me realise that noises are normal and nothing is trying to hurt us or annoy us personally.\n\nPlease do not hurt yourself &lt;3 you are not alone, there are hundreds of thousands of people who feel exactly like you/ us.\n\nPs my favorite video for brown noise:\n\n", "Banging sounds. Intense anxiety, fear and then anger at the person who banged. Is that treatable? I get all furious at sudden loud banging noises. But not all.\n\nI hate unnecessary and pointless banging. Heavily putting a cups on the table, for example.\n\nI hate parents who allow their children to throw their plastic toys over and over again. And not laying carpets to reduce the noise. I hate parents who allow their children to run around in the apartment constantly, while they could do this shit outside.\n\nI hate when a person starts banging their home appliances, so \"it would work again\". Like it could fix the issue.\n\nI hate children with those scooters who do tricks throwing this shit in the air and then slamming it back on the ground. It is like a recipe for disaster. You could hurt others. And are not you get tired of this?\n\nWhat else... you name it.\n\nIs that treatable? I cannot deal with it anymore, my neighbours are like that, I have been putting up with this shit for 5 years, and I see no end to this. My worst recently has been the people living above me. They walk so damn loud and I hear every step. It is a new one because I have never been on a middle floor so I never even thought about it before. Such intense anger I clench my jaw and just end up burying my head in my hands until it stops. I have to keep background noises on in my apartment at all time because any sudden random noise kills me. \n\nOh, and I have two little shits who live in my complex that like to ding dong ditch regularly. The best way to get them to leave you alone is by ignoring it but I\u2026cannot\u2026 so me going from me being this young nice girl to cussing them out every time has only egged them on. Makes. Me. So. Mad. \n\nWe have the lawn maintenance people come once a week at my complex and somehow that is never bothered me so I feel you there with the construction noise. If I have someone over at my apartment and they are the ones making the sudden noise, it does not bother me, only the small mouth noises, shaking legs, etc bother me with people I am at home with. But if it is coming from someone else I cannot stand it. I have to turn my tv up like crazy just to tone out my below neighbors talking loud as fuck on their balcony. Like\u2026.just someone talking??? Why is this my life. \n\nWorking from home has made me go fucking insane. Noises I never knew would bother me\u2026.everywhere. \n\nI wish I had found a solution. I just rely on loud tv + music on at the same time (awful) or my airpods. It is tough when the noises in your own home are a trigger though, much harder to be able to tone them out every time.\n\nHope you find something that helps you soon! Sorry for my ramble, my neighbors were just stomping their way around so I had my anger built up lol", "My mother is insufferable to be around, and I cannot confront her about anything. Tonight my dad and I were watching the season finale of a show that my whole family enjoys. We kindly waited on my mother because we wanted her to join us. Midway through, she starts biting and picking at her nails noisily. It is something she does all the time and it droves me up the wall. I asked her to stop, it was no use. She kept at it all through the show. At the very end, say, five minutes left, I could not stand it anymore. I calmly turned to her and asked her to PLEASE stop, just take her hands apart for a few minutes. Practically begging her. I told them both that if she did not please stop that I was probably going to lose it. I tried to tolerate it the whole time (it ruined the show) and I just could not anymore. So, here is how it always goes\u2026 instead if simply taking her hands apart for five fucking minutes, she throws a fit and storms off, as if I chased her off. It is always \u201cyou just hate me!\u201d or \u201cfine if you want me to leave I will leave!\u201d And shit like that. My dad always takes her side and tells me that if it was bothering me either a) I should be more tolerant or b) I should have left and watched the show elsewhere. I wanted to be watching the show with my family. Ya see, I am not really the problem in this equation. I may be neurologically intolerant to noise, but if somebody could have just just acted like a fucking adult and not storm up and twist my words, which she has complete control over, it would have all been fine. This is why she is so miserable to be around. Not only is she a noisy, obnoxious person by nature, but whenever I have a problem with it\u2026 it is a lose-lose situation because she will go and make it ten times worse whether I choose to leave, endure, or even politely ask her to be considerate. The nail biting sound is so bad, and that is not even to mention how unhygienic it is. I understand your situation all to well. I want to be with my family but if I say anything I am the jerk, or my choice is to sit by myself and I am still a jerk because I never \u201cwant\u201d to do things with the family. Exactly.", "My dad becomes annoying. He eats too loudly, fast, he looks like a homeless person who has not eaten for days. It really annoys me. My mom always telling me to try not to notice it. But that sound is irritating like the feeling when someone is snoring loudly, I cannot stay calm and not try to stop him. Until now. I wanted to try something to stop him. I always try to stop him but he does not even care like he is too immature he even eat much louder for a purpose (to annoy me more). Oh my god. We eat together and this is our rule. To eat together at dinner or lunch. But I really cannot take his manners anymore. Oh my god please help me. When I hear that eating sound or snoring sound, I am easily irritated, hot-headed, I cannot stay silent. It feels like I can do something out of control. I really wanted to tell something in here but I do not want to violate Rule number 2 in this subreddit. So this post is kind of incomplete. Headphones with your version of \u201chappy music\u201d Yes, one time I really did that. Even if I am not able to focus on our family discussion.

The world is made for obnoxious people who do not care how their actions affect others.  All us highly sensitive people can do is try to survive. That is right. The worst is your family will not even try to understand you. This is the worst. Right now oh fuckkkkkkkk. I told him to stop he even eat fucking louder. I say fuck in front of him. God. I cannot handle my emotion and vent. Holyshit what kind of father is he. he annoys me to the point i really want to do someting bad about him. I would calmly explain the situation to your mother when the two of you are alone.  Say that you have a medical condition that causes uncontrollable stress in response to the sound of other people eating and that you are physically incapable of eating dinner together with them.  Arrange a time when the three of you can sit quietly together after dinner without anyone eating. I did that a few hours ago so we had a condition. I would not be able to join them in the table. It is up to me and I chose that. It is okay with my mom. I do not want to talk to my dad. It is awkward and we are not close. He works abroad and came here for a vacation. I feel you. When I lived with my family, my mother opened her mouth to eat her food and her bones (mouth area) made a sound which drove me crazy. And hearing her chewing gum is unbelievably hard.\n\nCan you eat separately from your family? Maybe then your father will pay more attention to your problem and then change his eating habits.\n(This helped me, I hope you can fight this.) Oh! I forgot to mention that bone sound when eating! It sounds like a cracking jaw! I eat separately from my family. My father does not care about that. He never pay attention to my feelings. The way he makes a slurping sound when eating pasta makes me want to shout or slap him. He is so insensitive and very immature for a 57 year old man. He never change since I was a child and I find his eating habits irritating, he just shout at me. I am sorry to hear that. And my mum does the same sound with her bones from her mouth area. I did not know the correct description of the sound but you described it perfectly: like a f*ck*ng cracking jaw!\nHe must not shout at you. Talking to him will not change anything, I guess. I thought that you could maybe listen to music while having a meal with your family? I wish I could help you better because I know how depressing such a situation can be. I did that but I would rather eat alone. He eats like a man who has not eaten for day. Very not mannered. Why some older people are so childish in a way they want me to respect them but they do not act respectful.", "I hate living in an apartment The person above me is driving me insane.

My headphones are not helping either \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I used to live in an apartment where the people above me played music all the time, sometimes to the point where the bass literally shook my apartment. It is the only time I called the cops for a noise violation, and if it gets too bad for you maybe you can report them? One time I lived in apartment where my neighbor mext door would play music like that at around 2AM.  One time I went over to knock on their door about it and his upstairs neighbor was there too for the same reason.  Asked him to stop, and he did not, so next time it happened, I called the police. I had the same and I politely asked them if they could keep it within reasonable hours, and turn it down when possible. They were nice about it so I bought them flowers as a thank you! my downstairs neighbor has a broken metal screen door that her adult caretaker son bumps every time he goes in or out, it sounds like a huge gong and triggers my ptsd every single time. he is hyper and does it at least ten times a day. I asked him nicely to try not bump it  against the wall, and he was nice and understood, then forgot all about it a few days later. he is not being malicious, he is just oblivious, and has a hyperspazzy brain. so I just wear my headphones when he is around. Aw, I am glad that they responded positively. That is so thoughtful of you as well! I suppose I could do that if I really need to Oh man. It is honestly not that loud is the thing - it is just really rhythmic and annoying.

Mostly I get the normal old \"just ignore it.\" But my sister, who is unfortunately anti-vaxx, suggested that vaccines were causing it. Anyway, I am just curious. That is pretty absurd from your sister. For me, it is just your average \"just do exposure therapy to make it go away.\" Surprisingly, the condition that causes you to hate everyday noises does not go away when they drive you mad for the millionth time since you do not fix neurological disorders that way. If it worked, those everyday noises would fix it quickly since they are so often heard. I get that one often too. Living my life is exposure enough. I feel you on that one One ENT I went to told me to \"just calm down\" and \"stop being so angry\" because \"we all experience anger\".\n\nO.o Heavy metal \u201cdetox,\u201d Ayurvedic herbs that I am allergic to, an expensive pancha karma retreat at a TM center, and white noise machines that I find unbearably triggering. Ah yes, I know that phrase well. Some people have zero ability to imagine people experiencing something they have not. Oof, that is bad. And that is awful that white noise does not work for you, it is the only thing that got me through some bad times, so I cannot even imagine. I cannot even begin to count how many times people have said this to me, or things like \u2018anger is a choice\u2019. If I could choose between having misophonia and not having jt then you better know I am sacrificing all I own to get rid of it. It ruins my life and they say it is \u2018all in your head\u2019, where else is it even supposed to be? My fucking legs?! Just stop listening \u201cYou do not need to try and make it go away, you should not just teach yourself to put up with anything.\u201d\n\nThat was from an ear specialist I went to in the hopes of sound therapy, but because I do not get anxiety attacks (which I do, but he completely ignored me when I told him multiple times) he would not help me. exposure therapy  that is like blowing on a fire, you would think it works but it ALWAYS makes it worse with misophonia. it can be classified as torture, even with good intentions with both parties. risperidone. My psychiatrist prescribed me it and it did not work at all. Genuine curiousity:\n\nAre you also triggered by other \"calming noises\" like a night forest, or thunderstorms, or oceans, or is it white noise specific? \"Healthy diet and excercise\"\n\nI was young and fit once, still raged out whenever someone ate an apple around me.\n\nEdit:\nOh, another one! \"Why not just deafen yourself\"\n\nThen i read about people who did and were still triggered and that sounds like some twilight zone horror show shit. There is like a background static sound on any low quality recording or speaker, which all the white noise machines I have heard are. If I play a high quality recording of forest or rain sounds or whatever on a loop on a high-quality speaker it is fine. I never could play it at night though. That pause between loops always woke me up. The more I hear them the worse it gets! Hypnosis was one I heard. I will just call up any old random hypnotist and get right on that... \n\nThe amount of times I heard \"just deal with it\" because they \"cannot control\" the way they smack their gum or chew with their mouths open is astounding. \n\n\"Just deal with it!\" THANKS! IM CURED! Asshats. Vaccines are 100% not causing it and there is science behind that but I doubt it would mean anything to your sister.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents used to tell me all the time that I would just have to put up with it politely until I grow out of it.  Not only did I never grow out of it, but it is gotten worse with age.  Studies have shown that typically it does not even start for people until they are at least pre-teens, so yeah, that tip from the folks had no merit. Yup, my parents also insisted that it was a phase. Going on 10 years of having misophonia, so that was a lie. My family used to tell me to just deal with it and would force me to sit at dinner. Also my Grandmother thought my misophonia was caused by anime :/ I am sorry that your family made you do that. And that is definitely the first time I have heard that someone thinks anime causes miso They are more supportive now and I am in a different house with my mom and step dad :)", "How to recover from an intense fight response Sometimes I get way too intense fight responses from my triggers (which I will not present). How have you guys dealt with this anger? I heard on another post that meditating could help. Any experiences? Probably the most triggered I have ever been at work has been in my current job. When I am in that rage space, all I can do is remove myself from the situation for a few minutes. So I go outside without a coat, and it is freezing, and somehow this calms me down.\n\nThat is a response in the moment. To prevent these kinds of things from happening in the first place, I use a combination of industrial ear plugs and an herbal remedy which I am fortunate is legal in my state. One of these days I will write a more specific post about my experiences in this regard. I guess I meditate, but it is more like mindful relaxation and deep breathing. I have learned that I can control how I feel immediately after I experience a trigger when I acknowledge what is happening and stay hopeful. In the moment the feeling is so intense that it is hard to think, but over the years I have trained my brain through meditation to just go back to normal after and that I do not need hold onto that fight response after the noise stops. However, I do not think meditation for Misophonia is for everyone because it takes a lot of willpower and self-reflection, kind of like how psychotherapy does not work well for everyone.  \n\n\nEven though Misophonia triggers anger in a way that might not seem normal, anger is normal and (I think) anger can be controlled the same as bouts of anger caused by other means. For some people it might mean removing yourself from the situation and overloading your senses with something like the cold like u/sometimesitsbullshit mentioned. I have a similar issue. My same coworker every day like clockwork will eat s bag of chips from the vending machine. So I either put in headphones at that time or will take my lunch or a short break while he is eating. Typically by the time I get back, he is done (or almost done) and I am in a much better spot mentally where that anger has dissipated. Two things i have learned for my situations like this:\n1. Daily meditation is a massive booster for self realization and confidence in handling your anger. It is okay to genuinely talk to yourself in your mind. Mentally ask yourself, \u201cwhy do i feel this?\u201d \u201cWhat could be the root of this specific trigger bothering me?\u201d \u201cHow silly is this! It is nothing to get angry at\u201d\n\nWhile asking these and contemplating these will not *fix* the issue of Miso, they will help you to reason with yourself. \n\n2. Meditation works as a general overall coping mechanism. In the moment if it becomes too severe where your previous meditation does nothing for you, DIVERT DIVERT DIVERT. \n\nIt takes so much willpower, but force yourself to divert your thoughts towards anything other than the current situation. It might be cliche, but the classic \u201cthink of your happy place\u201d method can be very effective. \n\nPut yourself at home on your computer alone. \nPut yourself in a quiet cabin in the woods. \nPut yourself on a relaxing beach with soothing waves. \nPut yourself anywhere that brings peace of mind. \n\nReally focus on the details of the location of your happy place. What do you hear? What do you see? How does it smell? Is there a peaceful fireplace? Are you by yourself unwinding? \n\nAsking these questions to yourself when any negative/violent thoughts come to mind can bring you back to earth and peacefulness. \n\nGood luck and positive vibes \u270c\ud83c\udffc", "My family is making me go crazy This is obviously a rant, I did not checked for grammar or anything, I just need to take this out of my system. \nI do not even know how to start this. I am not so sure about how long I have had misophonia, although I discovered about it only a couple years ago. \nI believe my dad is what started it all. He is always been an extremely loud person, he is a loud eater, he burps extremely loudly literally 18 to 22 times a day(trust me, I tried counting during a short period of 4 days), he always picks on his teeth after eating, and cannot walk without stomping his feet everywhere he goes. I think I started getting extremely annoyed when I was around 7 and just got gradually worse since then. \nI cannot really eat with anyone in my house anymore, everybody knows about my misophonia, but nobody takes it seriously, especially him. My sister tells me I need therapy in a mocking manner(which I actually already do btw), my mom tries to understand it but she still calls me weird and tells me that I need to learn how to be \u201cnormal person\u201d and my dad just simply does not care. Whenever I call him out on his burps (which are the worst for me, next to the eating sounds), if he is feeling good, he will joke about how he only burps to call me or even fake it with the exact same sound but louder. If he is in a bad mood, he will get really pissed and tell me how much of a pain in the a** I am and how he is living in a prison and cannot do anything anymore and then he will stop talking to everyone for the rest day \nI am an university student, but my university\u2019s close from home so I still live with my parents. But now, with quarantine, online classes and no one being able to live the house, I am sure I am going crazy. It is starting to ruin my whole day, I feel extremely stressed after one burp for a total of 5 to 15 minutes. Which is also the period of time it takes for him to burp or do any other thing that will trigger me. I just want to grab all my really small amount of student money and move out because I am sure I wont be able to take a few more months, but I know I have no other choice than to just suffer alone to the point I am sure I will not want to stay in the same room as my dad for a long while. Wow I am so sorry that sounds really terrible :( I totally feel being \"out of service\" for an extended period of time after a trigger just waiting for the next one you know will come.\n\nI obviously do not know your living situation, whether you have a backyard, what your stay at home order is like, etc, but you could try working outside depending on the work.

I have begged him to just cough up the phlegm bc the sound of coughing does not trigger my misophonia, but he still does it and it is made me now hypersensitive to even normal swallowing sounds.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have never had a sensitivity to swallowing sounds before, usually my main trigger is just eating and other mouth noises but this is getting to be unbearable and I do not want my misophonia to make me ruin my relationship.

Like I cannot hear conversations at the moment but I can hear him swallow.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have combined type adhd and associated sensory processing issues alongside my misophonia.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am not quarantined with him but it is ruining any time I do get to spend with him bc it is just so distressing.

I have read a few pages online and several posts about what Misophonia is and the gist tends to be \"strong emotional response to certain audio and visual stimuli\" and it seems to affect people with specific sounds e.g. chewing or rattling. However I find myself being enraged by almost any noise when I am already slightly stressed or emotional generally. \n\nFor example my wife and I share a home office, something with my work was not quite working out and I could tell I was getting stressed, she was quietly watching a video on Twitter and that was getting me more stressed, combined with the traffic and construction sounds from outside I ended up flipping out completely. \n\nDoes this mean I have Misophonia or is it a different condition, perhaps linked to stress? \n\nThanks in advance for any advice you can give me Yes I am not an expert, but that does not really sound like misophonia. Misophonia, while affected by mood, makes you go absolutely insane over specific noises even if you are perfectly calm. It is not really characterized by annoyance over noisiness when the suffer is under stress.\n\nAgain, take what I say with a grain of salt. I am not an expert, and misophonia varies quite a bit from person to person. ", "Could I have Misophonia? Please Read! Would mean alot to me! Hey everyone, never posted on reddit till now. I dont want to assume I have misophonia till i hear your guys thoughts since I know this is something serious. For almost months or years now its been hard for me to live my life and do my work  i should be doing here at home. When I tend to do my tasks noises such as my dog playing with its toys, barking, or my younger sister being so loud, or anyone near my room where I work or just being around, Tend to REALLY aggravate me and makes me so stress and tense. When i hear car doors closing I get stressed, when its footsteps coming around my room i get irritated. Anytime im completely alone at home i get so happy just knowing that theyll be less noise and I can do my own work but its just so rare. Just now i was watching tv in the family room trying to concentrate till i then hear my mom making a loud noise and my sister being playful and a bit loud with my dog all around me, it then escalated for me to go to my room to the brink of crying because this has been happening to me for months now. I get scared, anxious, stress literally my day becomes so negative that i dont want to leave my room. I just cant function with the loud noises, but theres only so much i can control really :(, it wasnt till now i googled and realized misophonia that it resonated with me. Past months i just envisioned how much peace id feel if i was in a mountaintop just on my own and no one around. When i hike or bike Im 100% at peace mainly for the fact that all this noise goes away hence also listening to calm music with my headphones. Leaving the house or people around or the noise outside just stresses me and makes me want to be back in my room aswell. Maybe you guys feel the same? What do you guys think on what ive mentioned?

I cannot really give you any advice, but I am sorry that you are going through this. I am the same way with my upstairs neighbor who randomly startles me awake and then I cannot fall back asleep because I am upset. Have you tried earplugs yet? I have posted on here myself and another redditor suggested finding high quality earplugs with varying expansion pressure if they are uncomfortable and that helped a bit for me. I hope things get better for you, OP. My best friend in highschool was on some medication that gave him a sinus infection 100% of the time. I did not know misophonia was a thing then and was just as confused as he was at my emotional outbursts when we had lunch or when he sniffed a lot. We are not friends anymore and that sucks.\n\nAnyway I guess the upper hand you have in this is that you know about your condition and can let your friend know what your experiencing and let them know it is not personal and you are not really mad AT them - no matter how angry you get in a moment. I am really sorry you are dealing with this. It must be hard.\n\nIt might be repetitive, but here is a link that might prove helpful: (\n\nMy daughter (13yo) seems to have this, and our next step is to find a counselor. We took her to an ENT, and they suggested cognitive behavioral therapy. I do not know if you have access to that, but I would look around. If you are attending school, try the health center. Start somewhere. When a sound like breathing is a problem, you need to find some help.\n\nI do not know your living arrangements, obviously, but can you make changes there? Can you or your roommate sleep in a different room? If this guy is your friend, he should understand and want to help. Sleeping on a couch will not hurt anybody. I know you cannot remove all the sounds, but look around at what changes you can make. Can you eat separately at least sometimes, for example? Can someone say, hey, I am going to eat, and then you can go into another room?\n\nMy daughter uses noise-canceling bluetooth headphones and listens to brown noise at mealtimes. This really is not so bad, as it allows us to even have a normal conversation, we just need to raise our voices a bit. There is a spectrum of sound, so you might fare better with pink or white noise, but it really seems to help.\n\nI have also read that misophonia may be tied to anxiety. I do not know if you have other anxiety issues, but again, perhaps a counselor or therapist could help.\n\nFor sleeping, have you tried sleep headphones? They are usually flat speakers in a band that you can wear while lying down. There is a Sleepphones brand that is expensive, but I had a set and used it for three or four years. There are cheaper versions on Amazon. I heard about them via a podcast, Sleep with Me, that I listen to every night. Not sure the podcast would help, but if you had the sleepphones, perhaps you could listen to some kind of noise that would drown out the other sounds while  you sleep.\n\nGood luck.

I am 20(f) and out of school now but I definitely made use of headphones with music/noise in high school. \nHe is been sleeping with me because my stepbrother was staying with us but he is back at his mo\u2019ms right now so we will be sleeping in different rooms for now. He and my family are super understanding of it now, after a few years and are good with letting me be and not taking it personally, which I am super grateful for\n\nAlso thank you for introducing me to brown/pink noise! I have never heard of those before and will now find playlists and some good sleep headphones/noise canceling ones. maybe even both lol\n\nI am already doing CBT for some other stuff (like Tourette\u2019s/anxiety) but I may look into it for misophonia.

If you have not already, tell your therapist about the misophonia. If they cannot help with that specifically, maybe they can point you in the direction of someone who can. It is tough since misophonia is not an official diagnosis. Our ENT put down \"hyperacusis\" as a diagnosis, which is when sounds cause physical pain. You might want to look into or discuss that with someone, just for a starting point on coping mechanisms or something.\n\nThere is, as I said, a whole rainbow of noise.

Would you have any suggestions?\n\nI have just arrived in Belgium and I am not a native Flemish or French speaker, so I am having a bit of a hard time with finding a therapist... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny kind of information will be very much appreciated! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all!", "The Phrase \"Oof\" Hi there,\n\nI really get annoyed when I hear people say this.

Why cannot I be allowed to find my inner peace again? I just want to be at peace. I wish we could all live in a community together. It would be amazing. I feel for you, I am in the exact same situation. Its very hard to feel calm and happy, and I have yet to had success with meditation myself. I suffer from panic attacks and a lot of self hatred after coming to University, because student housing is hell for  misophonia. I had it before university but it summed to about three triggers, and now its around eleven. \n\nThe only thing that helps is constant distraction, like going on walks even if you do not really like them, and lately I have been finding some new music which I can get absorbed in without needing it too loud.

Sweetie, you are the one who should be worried. You are 30. Time's running out, old bitch. Hmm that is odd because I am married, have a gorgeous house (I moved out), great job and car and amazing husband. I do not think times ran out for me :-) and you have just insulted about a million people on here who are 30+. 30 or not, you are a categorical loser at life and you keep replying because you know I am right :-) Oh yeah, I believe you\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nThere is no one who would want to be with you willingly, sweetie.

I am curious, is the bird sanctuary you went to in Gold Creek? I know it is one of many in aus but maybe if you wanted to go see some animals in that area you could visit the reptile zoo that is basically right next to it! its serendip Sanctuary in victoria just 1 hr drive from melbourne (i dont live there) Ahh, okay. I am really sorry about your dad, my best advice would be to find a few links to articles and whatnot about misophonia, that really go in depth and explain what it is and how it affects us.  \n\n\nOne of the ways I like to explain it to people is to compare it to something. For example, my dad has carpal tunnel. He sometimes gets bad pains in his hands and cannot really move them well, so I tell him that when I hear a noise that triggers my misophonia, it causes severe distress and upset that I cannot just 'ignore', like he cannot just ignore his carpal tunnel pain. Misophonia triggers actually give me headaches, so the pain comparison does work for me but might not for you.  \n\n\nIf so, compare it to your dad being mad at you for, say, not cleaning your room. He gets mad and he cannot control that, you get triggered, which in turn makes you mad/upset/distressed, and you cannot control it. thank you for saying this\u2728 I hate screaming too, ur not alone trust me! Although I am sure you are mostly in the right in this situation, I do think your dad has a point. If you keep on avoiding these triggers, the worse it will become in the long run. Now I can understand that when you are at a bird sanctuary for your birthday, you might not to have your day ruined by something as stupid as misophonia, but at some points you are just gone have to face your fears head on. glad to see i am not alone", "New Moderators and Rules Hey everyone!\n\nu/TelephoneMelon and I wanted to take a second to introduce ourselves as the newest moderators of this subreddit.\n\nWe have been talking a little this morning about our expectations for this subreddit and while we are still working on official rules, we wanted to pop in and say hi to everyone to let you know that we are working on getting this subreddit up and running as a place that you can go to to share more personal anecdotes and issues you may be having.\n\nAs a sufferer of misophonia myself, I understand how frustrating and down right angry I can get when something triggers it. While we want this to be a safe place where you can talk about these things, we also want this to be a safe place for others. A big focus of ours here is going to be positivity, and because of that, until the official rules are up, our two rules for now are:\n\n**1. No violence or self harm in posts or comments.**\n**2. Be kind to each other.**\n\nWe will remove anything that breaks one of those rules until the official rules are listed in the subreddit.\n\nOther than that, just know that we are here to help. If you have any questions or comments about this post, any rules you think might be necessary, or any suggestions for how things should be run, please leave a comment below. Thanks for taking up the mantle :)\n\nI LOVE that *be kind* is one of the rules! It is the best place to start, and everything else will flow from there Thanks! I think it is an important one that will stay once we have the new rules up. We are still working with each other to figure out the rest (especially defining what makes a post or comment \u201cviolent\u201d or if it is just ranting) so if you have any suggestions, let us know! Nice. A million thanks for doing this! Absolutely! I think we all want this to be a place to voice our concerns and help each other. We just have to work out a couple guidelines to help keep people positive and safe. :) I have a question regarding the first rule. Is it *everything* that mentiones violence that is not allowed?\n\nI posted this in the post that Imperceptions made earlier:\n\n&gt;I cannot stress enough that I do not think we should encourage violence, but I feel like this is a difficult subject given that anger is a symptom of misophonia, often accompanied by a feeling of wanting to hurt someone. Disallowing everything mentioning violence would then mean that we would not be able to discuss a very big part of this condition.  To be completely out in the open with you, I saw your comment before and we have been discussing a way to address this. For now, I would say no posts about violence toward yourself or another person in general, at least until we post our official list of rules. If you (or anyone else) has an idea of how we can fairly moderate posts involving violence, let us know. Perhaps it could be allowed to express how you feel, and discuss the feelings we get, whereas encouraging someone to do anything violent, or outright say that you will actually do something, should not. Another user commented about this in the other thread. \n\nIn my personal experience, most (but I hope all) of us would never go though with it, but if we are supposed to have real conversations about how we feel and experience misophonia, it would be a shame to have to leave out things that can have a big part of it. \n\nI cannot remember where, but I saw a misophonia scale where to be a 10, you would have to had done something violent as a reaction to being triggered, and I cannot help but think that disallowing any mention of violence could potentially make people who are high up on that scale feel unwelcome - here of all places - because it can be such a big part of having misophonia. \n\nSome examples of what I think is and is not okay:\n\n- Someone posting \"My coworker has been chewing gum all day and I really just want to slap him!\" - Okay, as it expresses their feelings, and is just venting, but is not actively encouraging. \n\n- Someone else replying \"Yes you should totally go over there and and slap him\" - nok okay, as it encourages violence.\n\n- A post stating that they want to hurt someone, where they make it clear that they will go though with it - not okay, as it encourages violence. Ah, yes. ( I am very familiar with that. I agree with you though. There is a huge difference in enacting violence and expressing frustration. We are talking about a few different ways to deal with it now. And fortunately, violence does not really start coming into play until you hit an 8 or higher on that scale. Flair such posts with Vent? Are the old moderators(and their puppet accounts) staying? Because if they are I want no part of this place. As far as I am aware, they are staying for now, but they are not actively moderating any posts. The two active mods (u/TelephoneMelon and myself) are working on rules right now. If you decide to stay, you are more than welcome to share your input! Good idea! We are looking into things like this as we speak :) No thanks. Last time I got involved in a subreddit for misophonia it was hijacked. And they are primed to do it again. Good luck but I am out. Okay! Have a good day! In my opinion, there was only one moderator causing an issue and they are not staying in r/misophonia or r/misophoniasupport.   One may have been worse. But both worked together to hijack the sub and enforce their vision of what it should be on it, with no consideration of what its users wanted. The remaining mod refers to the subreddit as the \"internet's hate machine\", is opposed to venting and seems primarily interested in promoting their own site. I agree with this. Plus, the moderator that they are referring to does not seem to want to have anything to do with moderating this subreddit, other than keeping it civil and posting the same resources in a pinned post. It is not a puppet account if the alt is declared, which I have. I am not hiding anything, nor do I wish to be active in this sub (despite creating it) and thus I had initially passed it off to my alt account when it died. I do not really know what to say about that, honestly. We are not those mods and we are doing our best to make sure this is all going to be fair but safe for everyone. u/StressedCoder, you were banned from r/misophonia for consistently making insulting posts, berating moderators, and constantly trying to create trouble. You had absolutely no interest in discussions, and you have been sour since the very second we arrived on the scene. u/StressedCover, I think any further discussion about this specific topic should be taken to direct messaging. Thanks! This is exactly why I was permanently banned. One post, not \"constantly\":  I probably deserved the ban.  But I would post it again. Sour? Of course, I would had previous interactions with rob where I was insulted just for being part of the subreddit. Most of you are familiar with his personality now. I give it 3 months before he is back as a puppet account. The person you are upset by was removed as a moderator, and you are continuously throwing out accusations. I would be willing to allow you back in r/misophonia if you were willing to be respectful, but I feel we are past that. Look, I get that it is frustrating. We are willing to let you vent here, as long as you follow the rules that we are writing now. The mods that you are referencing as staying on as mods here and in the post that you linked have nothing to do with the rules that u/TelephoneMelon and I are writing. They both came to the decision of the changes to /r/misophonia, and although /u/Imperceptions seems more reasonable than rob... why are they staying on with mod powers if they want no part in modding this subreddit? And they have two accounts with mod powers, at that. That is a question only u/Imperceptions can answer. Mainly in response to your edit, I do understand. My concern is that some members of the community may not appreciate that one of the mods that is perceived as not having the community's interests at heart is effectively remaining on here, too. This is certainly true of the more outspoken people. \n\nAnd a problem I have is that this subreddit was setup by that mod in a calculated manner well in advance to simply be an off shoot from the larger sub. Effectively using this one how we have been using the old one for years now. I appreciate you and TelephoneMelon taking it on as you have. Trust me, I have already expressed the same concerns to u/Imperceptions.\n\nAs this sub has different rules and active mods than r/misophonia though, I feel like it will be dealt with in a better way than it has been in the past and I hope that u/TelephoneMelon and I can work with everyone who is looking for a place they can vent to move past the trouble that has come up with venting posts on r/misophonia in the past. Ultimately, neither subreddit would exist without it is users, so I would like this to be a collaborative experience for everyone involved so we can have a safe place that people can trust. I would rather have r/misophonia with sane rules and moderators. The current mods of r/misophonia are pushing their own high and mighty agenda and censoring everything else as \"venting\" often without notice. They are not even consistent with their censorship. Their cybersquatting of r/misophonia is harming the community. It is unfortunate that Reddit does not have a vote of no confidence for moderators.\n\nI have posted about misophonia in r/anxiety before because r/misophonia is so unreliable. I did not receive as much feedback but at least the post did not disappear 1984 style.\n\nThe r/misophoniasupport subreddit will remain dead; take a look at r/depressionsupport and r/depression as an example. I do not know what to tell you. You do not have to use this if you do not want, but I am doing my best to make this an open place for people to talk about things.\n\nIt is up to you if you would rather post on r/anxiety, and you can express questions and concerns over how this subreddit will be run, but please do not bring negativity here. It is not necessary. ", "Misophonia is destroying my marriage, how do I carry on?

I have taught him what to do and what to not do, so he stays safe. He is 2 now. \nBut since its gotten colder now he wants to stay in, and I hate this freaking smacking and mleming soubd he makes when grooming. It drives me absolutely crazy. It gets so bad that he wakes me up at night. Always specifically at 4 am for some reason too. What do I do? Put him outside your bedroom. And NEVER respond to meows to come inside or get food.\n\nHe is probably waking you up on purpose because he wants food or attention at 4am. Cats are very good at cause and effect. I would suggest putting him in a different room or sleeping with earplugs. Not much else can be done, you cannot just make a cat stop grooming itself. I do this with my own cat when I need to sleep but she is a shithead that is either trying to push my button on purpose or is too stupid to remember(which is likely the case, she is by far the dumbest cat I have ever seen).\n\nI have a spray bottle for misting my reptile tanks and if she scratches on the door I always warn her to stop and if she does it again(which she usually does) I have to spray her to get her to stop, which might seem cruel but I cannot get to sleep when she cleans herself for almost an hour and it is the only way to get her to stop meowing to come in all night. They have bitter apple spray at Walmart, it is completely harmless to their health but it does not taste good and will keep him from repetitively licking himself. Sadly, there are no walmarts in my country. I live in poland, but thanks fir the advice. Ah, I am sorry to hear that. You can also find it at pet shops, but they would probably charge you three prices."]
