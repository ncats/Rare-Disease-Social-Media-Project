I recently was hired at a local school as a paraprofessional for a kindergartner who has Spinal Muscular Atrophy. I am really excited to meet him and his family and I want to make the transition from home to school as smooth as possible. I was just wondering if I could get any advice and ideas for the playground and during P.E.  I am a music major at my university, and I was wondering if there was anything I could do with that, as I play multiple instruments too, like ukulele or something. I did not know how a person's finger moves or how well.  I am just trying to think outside of the box and I want him to enjoy coming to school. I have been doing lots of research and reading and of course want him to be successful. Any tips or anything will be helpful. I appreciate it :) Hi there. I suppose it kind of depends on how much strength he has, but I know when I was at school it would have been kind of cool to learn the ukulele. Really though, if you are just there to help when he needs it, to be a grown-up friend, yet not get in the way too much so that he can play with his mates like everyone else\u2026 I think that would work just great. One of the most important skills he will need to develop is self-advocacy, help where he needs help, but encourage him to ask his peers for help when appropriate. Also make sure you give him plenty of space so he can hang out with his friends without an adult around. Given the current situation in the world I would also encourage you to be vigilant regarding his health, specifically his respiratory system. Please for the love of God get vaccinated and encourage everyone in your household to get vaccinated as well. Respiratory illnesses like covid are no joke for SMA.", "#below3sigma | Help unlocking the cause of neurodegenerative diseases ", "What now?

Get in contact with your local MDA. They will refer you to a clinic near you where you can see a neurologist. Luckily a new drug has recently come out that has shown to have great effects on stopping or significantly slowing the progression of SMA. Life with SMA isnt ever really easy but there is no reason you cant live a relatively normal life especially with the drug advancements coming out. Yes, as wh33lybrdy has already mentioned, definitely get in contact with your local Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA). Your family can request services, if they have not already, by calling  1800-572-1717, if they live in the U.S. If they live outside of the U.S. you may still be able to connect to muscular dystrophy groups by filling out the form here:\n\n\n\nThis new drug is called Spinraza.

In addition to Spinraza, which is the only drug that treats SMA, there have been many recent advances in medical technology that are saving babies with type 1. \nUntil December 23, 2016 there were no medications approved to treat SMA. Now there is is one (Spinraza). So things are changing for the better. \nThere is hope.\n Google: Spinraza do it!!! it is probably \"the cure\" and dont wait", "Merry fucking Christmas to you too, CDEC and INESSS motherfuckers. Approximately a year after the best and maybe only good news most of us have ever received (FDA approval), Quebec's INESSS decides no coverage, period \n\n...and the CDEC denies coverage to all but infants likely to develop Type 1 under 7 months of age who never needed invasive ventilation.\n\n\n\n\n\nExtremely happy for those who qualify, but pissed and depressed beyond belief that the rest of us are not \"cost-effective\". \n\n Fuck.

Ridiculous, I am very sorry to hear this and I am certain it will not be the last we hear of such decisions. Have you considered sending out letters to politicians and the media? Perhaps googling to find Canadian health equality advocacy groups that could bring light to this issue? Ultimately, if this was a novel cancer or HIV drug (or a drug for any other \"hot\" disease) this would be all over the press and health equality advocacy groups would be falling over themselves to speak out first. Sadly it looks like we are going to have to really push to get SMA the attention it needs or we are going to have to wait a while to see if the data on long-term outcomes for people with SMA2/3 is more convincing than the trial data.

", "Update on my neurologist visit So I finally saw my doctor and I have good news!\n\nAs others reported, some patients are having the treatment administered via live CT scan in cases where direct injection is not possible as a result of spinal fusion. My doctor originally wanted to implant an Ommaya reservoir, but has decided against it. I brought up the option of using a CT scan because I wanted to avoid surgery at all costs. She said that this really is not a good option, at least in younger patients due to the repeated exposure to radiation. In my case, I am 31, so she is all for the CT scan as long as I am willing to do it, which I am. I have a few more sets of lab work to go, a specialist/radiologist that is willing to administer the treatment, and I should have the treatment going in a month or so.\n\nShe reported to me that her younger patients are achieving incredible milestones and that some of the older patients are taking a bit longer to notice the results, but that they are happening none the less. She said that most of the patients experience a very decent growth in core strength (mostly in back/side/ab muscles) and that it seems to take a while for the medication to reach the extremities. I guess this makes sense.  Anyway, she was really hopeful in the treatment and has no doubt that it will work immensely in older patients as well (most older patients have not had the treatment longer than 6 months, so it is hard to say at this point) and that there is already a whole bunch of other treatments in the works which demonstrate a lot of promise. This was important because she mentioned that the CT scan approach does have some very minute consequences, as it requires repeated exposure to radiation, which is why she so against this method of delivery in younger patients (albeit very small exposure).\n\nAnyway, I thought I would give you guys an update even though I have not received the treatment, but will probably receive it in the coming months or so... as soon as I finish my lab work and my insurance approves it. Hopefully this is not much of an issue! Great news!! Yes!!!!! That is so great, I am very happy for you as I remember a while ago you were not certain it was going to work out so fingers crossed things go a bit smoother from here. Keep us posted! Thank you very much for the update. Information sharing is hugely important. Good luck! Thank you! Yeah, let us hope everything transitions smoothly. I will definitely post back as soon as I have an update. Indeed! Brilliant to hear. Thank you for feeding back this information, it really really helps! That is fantastic! Would you mind telling me where you are that will administer this? I am in Nebraska and nobody will do it here. I finally got all of my records to St. Louis and they told me I was INELIGIBLE for Spinraza due to having my fusion. So I have spent much of this year super depressed. Like here is this miracle drug after having SMA for 30 years, and now I cannot have it. But reddit says people with fusions ARE getting it. My neurologist is from San Diego. She was on board with doing this procedure as soon as I mentioned it. I think the biggest hurdle was finding a radiologist who was willing to do the procedure with the fusion. It only took about a few weeks to find one at a nearby hospital. I am guessing it was probably one at Rady's Children's Hospital, where I believe they have done the treatment on younger patients that also have a fusion. I am guessing your best bet is bringing this up to your neurologist, and if he or she still against it, you should try to find another one.\n\nAnd just for reference, I am in my early 30s and had my spinal fusion done at 13. Also, according to my CT scans, my rods are super calcified but reaching my spine is still possible with CT guidance.", "Writing on behalf of the parents of a 9 month old baby ", "CureSMA Campaign t-shirts. A girl I know has SMA and just launched this merch herself. She is not on reddit, so I am just spreading the word! ", "Post Doctor Visit - Sharing Info  Doctor is really confident about Spinraza, and claims that a whole bunch of doctors are doing their best to get the medication out ASAP. In my particular situation, I have a spinal fusion (since 17 years now), so I am having a CAT scan done to determine how they will infuse the medication, since my bones calcified and grew on the rods; preventing intrathecal injection. So instead, doctors are resorting to a surgery where they implant some sort of device that allows delivery via exterior injection. I guess I am going with that.\n\nMy Doctor says that they are seeing improvement with patients all across the board, and they do not really have a priority set for infants at this point. In California, they are trying their best to have the medication available for everyone. I am hoping I can have the surgery done a couple of months, so I will be good to go as soon as they approved the treatment. I will keep you guys up to date with any updates. Hey there, thanks for all this feedback. I too had to spinal fusion and was wondering how they would get around that; would be very interested to hear more when you get extra info.\n\nit is wonderful they are seeing improvements in all age ranges... i really did not expect that at all. I was told that most patients with a spinal fusion run into this problem: the bones/spine calcify the metal, preventing access to the spine. One interesting thing to know, was that just recently (doctor. literally said a few weeks ago) they discovered that administering the treatment through the mid-spine rather than the lower back actually seems to yield better results than administering through the brain, which is the case when the spine is not available. In any case, it seems that the solution is to introduce some sort of pump/access to that remains inside permanently (directly attached to the spine), allowing doctors the ability to administer treatment whenever needed. Basically, it is an internal IV.\n\nAnd yes, the doctor said that they are seeing significant improvements all across the board, which is why they really have no preference at this point as to who gets the treatment. My doctor brought up a good point: it makes sense to give infants the treatment as priority, since Type I/II get it the hardest, but at the same time, giving older patients with Type III/IV a chance is also something important to consider since it significantly reduces future complications (e.g. pneumonia, hospitalizations, breathing machines, etc.). I really hope that insurances get their act together and roll this out for everyone. Soon. Thanks for the update, very thoughtful of you.\n\nI am a little dismayed at the idea that a surgery is needed. When I had my spinal fusion surgery the anaesthesia went kind of badly and for some reason I was conscious through the whole surgery and could feel pain but was paralyzed. The idea of having to go through another surgery absolutely petrifies me beyond belief, I mean it is been 15 years and I am still traumatized. Did they tell you much about how long the surgery will last, what the recovery from the surgery will look like and what the risks are? Thanks for sharing! Did your Doc say anything about how willing  insurance companies are  (or are not) to pay for Spinraza? \n\nIt all sounds really positive. Miraculous really.  Now that is the sort of details i was looking for, much appreciated JmGx! It makes it all sound like its really happening... sounds stupid but its quite hard for me to grasp that its a bonafide treatment \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nAnd yeah, although this is expensive, so are all our disease related ailments for the however many years we keep on breathing. Just hope your insurance and our NICE over here in the UK see this benefit... yikes, that sounds horrific! I had a similar thing whilst getting a tracheostomy once but managed to flicker my eyelid. Really cannot  imagine what it was like going through the whole thing awake...  I just got back from the MDA Clinic at Duke after not going to one since I was 17 (I am 28 now) and saw the head of the Pediatric MDA Clinic and is running the review committee to get the drug there. As a type 2er he was sure it would have some effect, how much, he would not make any promises. The first step for me is a genetic test to confirm my diagnosis. \n\nRegarding spinal fusions he is brought in an amazing Neuro Radiologist and the Duke Cancer Center to help write the protocols since they do these type of injections all the time for chemo. He made no promises in terms of getting a needle into my spine and only briefly mentioned surgical options. He did say if that Neuro Radiologist cannot do it, nobody can. I think that is why he is brought in the Cancer Center, to explore alternative delivery options. He is prioritizing type 1 babies but it sounds like that is just a matter of supply and scheduling. Since this all dropped over the holidays everyone is still playing catch up, but he thinks they will be up and giving Spinraza by April. \n\nRegarding cost, apparently what happened in North Carolina with that DMD drug was the private insurance industry told the drug company to fuck off (due to cost and the frankly shitty data) but NC Medicaid said yes. He thinks the same thing is going to happen with Spinraza since the adult data is so limited. So it might be a good time to get onto Medicaid. \n\nBesides Spinraza he is the most excited about a form of gene therapy that is in the pipe. It is a one time IV infusion of a virus the inserts the SMN1 gene into our DNA, and since Spinraza works on SMN2's RNA, you can get both treatments.  When I had my gtube inserted I got a collapsed lung, that is why two years later for my Spinal Fusion my pre op lasted 3 days to make sure everything was good. If I need surgery I imagine they will take the same precautions.  Thanks for this update dude, really appreciate hearing about how you guys are finding the whole experience so far (also a type 2er, and about the same age as you so that is nice too). Good luck, really hope the neuro radiologist can get shit done for you.  Hey fellow UK person - just in case you did not know and are interested, you can write to your MP to ask them to ask the EMA to hurry the fuck up with their decision on spinraza approval. That will not change anything with NICE but it might at least push the EMA to get on with it already. A template for the letter can be found ( All you really need to do is sign it, add any personal info if you want to and then send it off. According to the doctor I saw, I am not the only one to come out of the wood works. As long as I had everything under control, he really did not care that it is been so long. He just wants me to see a pulmonary doctor once a year.  Hello to you too! \n\nThanks for the heads up and i will indeed ask her to ask them to hurry the fuck up :) I now regret giving her twitter grief about brexit over twitter... hopefully she will not know its me :\\ I was told that they are still working out the details, but again, there is no real priority as to who goes first, and insurances will have to comply one way or another because this is not some cosmetic procedure; it is a lifesaver. At least that is the thought here in Southern California. I was told I would be getting a call from my doctor personally as soon as a few conferences finish and they decide how to proceed with the treatment. I know. The news really bummed me out as well. However, I have made up my mind that this is necessary if I want to remain in relatively good health, so I am proceeding with it regardless. At least it beats infusion via the brain, which is what they were doing with some toddlers :(.\n\nAlso, the doctor did not really go into details, since a consult with a neuro surgeon was required first, but it is basically a procedure that is often done and it should be very effective, considering the recent results they received from administering the treatment through the mid-back.\n\nI hate surgery as much as you do, though unfortunately our experiences are a world apart, so I honestly cannot relate, but you have to remember that this is completely game changing... What I find most interesting is that this treatment not only \"plateau's\" the condition, but patients are actually getting better slowly over time. Just consider that Type I/II babies are not only not using ventilators, but gradually building muscle over time and remaining healthy! Defo not the only one! I stopped going 15-20 years ago. I went to the clinic, asked the doc if there was any treatments in pipeline... he said he did not know but that i could check on this new thing called the internet :/ Kind of thought, what do i need you for then? Infusion via the brain??! Ha, no thanks. \n\nGood luck with the consult, I hope it all goes well. Let us know how things are going! Ahaha, no worries, I am sure she will not know it was you. \n\nOn a sidenote (relating to your other reply to me about clinic attendance) - if you have not been in a while then you may not know that there is a new clinic in London that focuses on adults only. The purpose is to integrate various specialties into one centre (based on evidence from Denmark that this sort of setup is an improvement over previous setups where the focus is just neurology). The centre is at Queens Square (part of the UCLH national hospital for neurology and neurosurgery). I know they see people from all over the UK so you can probably get referred there if you want to get back in the game so to speak, even if you are a distance away. I got referred there a few months ago and my experience was good so might be worth a shot if you are not currently under a particular specialist. Will do, and thanks! Ah, that looks really good... I am up in sunny Lancashire and have started going to a specialist of sorts at my local hospital, so will mention it to him. He did mention something similar in Manchester i think... Hey, is not it great that we actually need to start thinking about this stuff!\n\nOne more thing... Was it easy to travel to? As in, trains/parking/access...  Ah I see you are a North West coast person, I hail from the North East but live in grimy old London now. \n\nIn terms of travelling - if there is a direct train line from somewhere in Lancashire to Kings Cross or St Pancras station, the hospital is not a very long walk from there (about 15 minutes) so that would probably be your best option *if* you want to come in by train. Other tube stations close by are Holborn station and Russell square but they are not accessible.\n\nParking seemed all right, despite being in central London the area around the hospital is very quiet by London standards so even if there is less parking around the hospital one of the side roads should have decent parking. \n\nI also saw, whilst I was there, that they had like special transport for people coming from far away. Like some kind of weird mix between an ambulance and a wheelchair accessible van. I do not know how you go about asking for one but it looks like it might be an option?\n\n( And ( Did you have any trouble getting the treatment approved through your insurance? Last I heard, doctors are having conferences regularly to determine where the treatment is needed most. Of course, my doctor says that every patient needs to have this treatment ASAP, and mentioned that most doctors feel the same way. At this point, I do not think doctors have actually tried to run the treatment through insurances, as they are still setting up deliveries and logistics for getting the treatment out. excellent, great info stormcloud. Will look up the transport thingy... No problem, happy to help (that goes for the future too). Good luck, I feel like we really need it right now with everything going on in the UK and with all this uncertainty. Really hoping the whole Brexit thing does not further delay spinraza hitting UK markets and that all these cuts do not end up causing the people who assess these things to decide that the cost of the drug outweighs the benefits. Just got to sit tight for now...which is what we are used to I guess! Hohoho, what a hilarious joke. Take care!\n\n Yeah, dark times, scary times. We have had to be patient so a while longer will not harm... Or we could just rob a bank  and bugger off to the Bahamas to get the op done! Excellent use of the term \"thingy\" sir.  A highly under used word in this day and age. It is indeed a much maligned word these days... Just going my bit to bring it back into modern parlance! Am I weird I would prefer this to a needle in the back? Dunno about weird but perhaps more badass than me anyway! Some news about Insurance covering: (", "Comparison of Risdiplam, Spinraza, and Zolgensma: Yet another update  I was finally able to incorporate the presymptomatic for Evrysdi which was released in June and I updated data for the presymptomatic Zolgensma trial. Again I felt this was the best way to compare treatments (in essentially the most ideal circumstances for each drug, dosed prior to the start of significant motor neuron loss). The caveat here is that to truly compare these treatments you need head-to-head trial using the same starting population randomized to these various treatments.\n\nSome initial takeaways: 1) EVERYONE IS ALIVE. Its remarkable how far we have come for this previously fatal disease. 2) Spinraza and Erysdi seem to be leading the pack with Spinraza perhaps having a slight edge? although really tough to say. 3) The Zolgensma data is very curious and I really would like to see someone do a head-to-head trial (see above) to figure out if its underperforming Spinraza or Erysdi. 4) In spite of these fantastic results early in the disease we do not know how long these treatments will remain effective (ie will this level of function be maintained for decades?). Spinraza certainly has more longterm followup data (since it was the first FDA approved treatment), and the longevity data does look solid, but who knows if this trend will continue.\n\nAnd as always please let me know if there are any mistakes in this data. I tried my best to check for errors but its a lot of data! Is there any info on confirmed effects for adults on these medications? Great. Seems, on first look, evrysdi and spinraza have pretty similar effect. Couple things: The data are similar, with Spinraza having a slight edge. However Spinraza skews towards more two SMN2 copy patients so if there were more 3 or even 4 copy patients the data would likely look even better. Also the number of patients is so low in the Rainbowfish trial so there is always a chance that this cohort represented patients that were going to have an excellent response to treatment anyways. I would really like to see more patient data. Finally as I said even though these treatments work well up front we simply do not know how long they will last, which is arguably the most important piece of data. There are studies but need to pay attention to baseline characteristics at the start of treatment  (ie a type 3 with significant weakness is not the same as a completely normal type 3). The reason I chose this presymptomatic comparison was try and remove those inter study differences. My nephew is type 1, will start his treatment on his 2 week birthday, what should I expect for life expectancy and motor skills. Will we ever be able to play catch? You have to be careful with this simple (i.e. naive) interpretation of these study results. You may want to have a look at the few indirect treatment comparison (ITC) that are out. They try to control some of the key confounding variables (i.e. pronostic/treatment modifiers) and may offer a more robust interpretation of the available data. If need be, I can help you out with this. Please post the reports that you are referring to in your post. \n\nThe whole point of this type of comparison is to control for some of those prognostic modifiers by matching disease status (which in this case is no disease) at the start of treatment. Trying to compare data in patients with different amounts of disease progression, in my opinion, is ripe for bias, in spite of attempts to control for baseline characteristics.", "Risdiplam in Older SMA Patients Raising Protein Levels in Ways That Seem Durable, Researcher Says of Early Trial Data  \\&gt; After a median 14 months of treatment, data showed that SMN protein levels in the blood peaked within four weeks and were maintained at about two times the levels recorded at baseline or the study\u2019s start. Fantastic. Now let us get it out there for everyone Damn right. I hope they hurry and get this out ASAP. (I am going downhill the last couple years, and Spinraza is not working for me for some reason) Same here dude. Got pneumonia and everything started getting worse more quickly. Wonder why Spinraza is not working for you? When you say \"Same here\" do you just mean your also getting worse or that your getting worse despite getting Spinraza?\n\nAnyways, no idea why it are not working. Not going to lie, probably been too lazy to do the proper exercise and stuff throughout my life. But even so, I have heard at least it should reduce drooling and help your breathing, none of which is happening.\n\nDrooling is getting worse, almost choked to death a couple months ago. Food keeps getting stuck in my throat, swallowing is getting harder etc...\n\nWorst part is my reaction times on Rainbow 6 Siege have tanked. Not getting Spinraza here in the Uk so just a sharp reduction in abilities. I do not know what is worse... Not being able to get the drug, or getting it and realising that it has no impact \u0ca0_\u0ca0\nThe choking thing is a fucking nightmare is not it? Never thought I would have to concentrate when eating and swallowing food.\n&gt; Worst part is my reaction times on Rainbow 6 Siege have tanked.\nLol, the true cost of Neuromuscular conditions :) I think not getting it at all is worse. At least right now, I do not know if I would be worse off without it, maybe it is still slowing me down?\n\nI had really counted on that other new drug that just got approved, but was really disappointed to see it was only for toddlers. I hope they can get that working/safe for adults soon ish. Yeah, was incredibly disappointed as well. We do not exactly have all the time in the world... Bit depressing really. Hopefully this oral drug will come soon and actually do something. Fingers crossed bud. I literally cannot wait for this to get FDA approved.

I am constantly being told that I need to eat more. My appetite can only handle 2 meals. Haha yeah. I am not tiny, but I am not obese either. I look fairly healthy, but I could lose a good 15-20lbs. For SMA, it is important to eat smaller amounts more often. OMAD will lead to more muscle wastage and hasten the prognosis", "Oral Drug Increases SMN Protein in Spinal Muscular Atrophy  I find this one very interesting. No invasive surgery *and* seems to be focused a little bit more on adults with the condition. I cannot see the article. Is it Avexis? Ah sorry, no it is Roche RG7916. Here is  the article:\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 An investigational drug significantly boosts the amount of survival motor neuron (SMN) in infants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who are deficient in this protein, initial results of a new study show.\n\nThe researchers found that at the highest dose tested, the drug increased SMN by 6.5-fold.\n\nImportantly, all doses explored so far have been well tolerated and none of the study patients lost the ability to swallow or needed permanent ventilation.\n\nLiquid Solution\nRG7916, formerly called RO7034067, is a centrally and peripherally distributed small molecule that modulates SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing to increase SMN protein levels. It is a liquid solution administered orally.\n\n\"It acts by modifying the splicing of the SMN2 gene at the mRNA level, thus allowing the inclusion of exon 7 and promoting the production of a full-length functional SMN protein,\" said Baranello.\n\nThe mechanism of action is similar to that of another drug, nusinersen (Spinraza, Ionis Pharmaceuticals/Biogen), already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SMA. Both drugs promote the production of SMN protein by the SMN2 gene. **RG7916 is orally administered**.\n\n\"This may have a double benefit,\" said Baranello. For example, it could facilitate adherence because the drug does not require administration by means of intrathecal injections, so there is no need for sedation or to access a hospital.\n\nBut this new oral drug could also be valuable because it is distributed in the body and reaches different organs, he noted. Increasing evidence suggests that SMA is not limited to motor neurons and the central nervous system but could be considered a multiorgan disease, said Baranello.\n\nThe FDA has granted orphan drug designation to RG7916 for the treatment of patients with SMA.\n\nThe multicenter open-label exploratory study, FIREFISH, includes infants with genetically confirmed SMA type 1 who have two copies of the SMN2 gene. Part 1 of the study enrolled 21 infants aged 1 to 7 months who were given the drug every day for 4 weeks at different doses.   \n\nThe aim of this study phase was to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RG7916 at these different dose levels.\n\nThe results indicated a dose-dependent increase in SMN protein levels in blood. There was up to a 6.5-fold increase in levels from baseline after 4 weeks of treatment at the highest dose (range, 2.0 - 6.5).\n\nThese results are very encouraging, especially in comparing the increased protein levels to those in patients with SMA type 2, said Baranello. He noted that children with type 2, which is less severe than type 1, have about twice as much SMN protein as those with type 1.\n\nThe study provides proof of mechanism for oral small molecule SMN2 splicing modifiers, he said. \n\n\"The robust increase in SMN protein seen in the current study supports the possibility of having sustained improvement in motor function and in clinical benefits for these infants,\" said Baranello.\n\nAt the time of the analysis, 19 infants were still alive. The two deaths were disease related and not considered due to the investigational drug, the researchers note.\n\nThe average study duration for the 19 babies was 4 months but ranged from 1 month to 13.5 months.\n\nNo safety problems required infants to be withdrawn from the study.\n\nWhile follow-up was limited, no study patient has lost the ability to swallow, required tracheostomy, or reached permanent ventilation to date.\n\nThe 2-year confirmatory part 2 of the study will enroll 40 infants with SMA type 1 and investigate the clinical benefit of the selected dose, said Baranello.\n\n\"This second part of the study has already started and is currently recruiting patients,\" he said. \"Further updates will be provided at scientific conferences during the year.\"\n\nOther pivotal trials are investigating the drug. The SUNFISH study in adult and pediatric patients with SMA type 2 and type 3 is a placebo-controlled, randomized, ascending-dose study with 36 patients lasting at least 12 weeks. It is investigating the safety and tolerability of RG7916 and determining the dose for the second part of the study.\n\nThe second part of SUNFISH will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, confirmatory study in patients with SMA type 1 and type 2 for up to 24 months, followed by an open-label extension. The primary objective of the second part of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of RG7916 compared with placebo.\n\nAnother study, JEWELFISH, is an open-label exploratory safety and tolerability study that is recruiting patients with type 2 or 3 SMA aged 12 to 60 years, who have participated in previous studies with other SMN2-targeting therapies.\n\nThe current study was supported by Hoffman-La Roche, the developer of the drug. Baranello served as scientific consultant for PTC Therapeutics and Sarepta Therapeutics; he is currently principal investigator in the following clinical trials in SMA: BP39055 and BP39056 (Roche); CLMI070X2201 (Novartis); AVXS-101-CL-302 (Avexis); SMA-001 (Catalyst).\n\nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2018 Annual Meeting. Emerging Science Abstract 004. To be presented April 24, 2018  Awesome! Could somebody please get me a gallon of that stuff?  I did a paid for telephone survey a while back and am pretty sure it was about these guys. They asked me a lot of very detailed questions about how I would prefer to take the liquid. They even went so far as to ask whether I would prefer the liquid to be syrupy or more water like.\n\nIn the end I felt like saying I do not care, just give me the damn stuff :) Are you in the clinical trials?!  Unfortunately not but am going to send them a cheeky tweet to see if I can get involved... cannot harm (\u30c4) Good luck lol I had read some blogs about the same issues and found that its also cause disorder characterized by progressive weakness of the lower neurons in our muscle that result in weakness and atrophy. This disorder affects mainly adjoining muscles, including intercostal muscles, which can lead to serious respiratory complications. At Physician Partners of America their is a blog section where you can find many article written on Spinal Muscular Atrophy.", "Cure SMA's Coronavirus (COVID 19) Community Webinar from March 27, 2020  A lot of the advice is intended for US residents", "Carriers of SMA type 1 My husband and I are having our first child and I am 6 months along. We found out around last month that I am a carrier of Spinal Muscular Atrophy and they did testing to see if my husband is also. I got the results back today and he is also a carrier of the same type.. \nWe were told with just me being a carrier it is a 25% chance our baby will have it and with both of us it is 50%. We are at a loss, and have no idea what to even do. I am scheduling a consult with the genetic counselors from where we had the genetic screening done but my doctor said there is not really any testing that can be done to see if the baby will for sure have it. Are there any other parents who are carriers or have kids with SMA type 1? We could really use some advice and experiences.. Congratulations on your pregnancy :-)\n\nAssuming we are talking about 5q SMA (SMN1 associated) your doctor is wrong, testing for SMA is simple and you can do it prenatally. They are also wrong on the risks, since you are both carriers there is a 25% risk of having a child with SMA, 50% of having a child that is a carrier like you and your husband (so otherwise healthy), and 25% chance of getting a child that does not carry SMA.\n\nFortunately, you are in luck as we now have extremely efficient medical treatment of SMA when given presymptomatically. The current treatment options are ongoing treatment with Spinraza, or a one-time genetic transgene therapy marketed as Zolgensma. Look these up. There are other drugs in development as well.\n\nGet prenatal testing and if your infant carries the SMA genotype get them on treatment as soon as possible after birth. The difference between an SMA1 child treated soon after birth and a classic SMA1 is literally night and day.\n\nOtherwise if prenatal testing is not an option for you, get your child tested after birth. Chances are good that this is still early enough for a very effective treatment.\n\nBest of luck! Exactly what this user said. 25% chance of an affected child, 50% of an unaffected carrier child, and 25% chance of an unaffected non carrier child. Your genetic counselor should be able to help you understand the results and what they mean, and will likely educate you on the available treatments that this poster mentioned. Hey, I have SMA type 2 and was adopted. I know that sounds like it sucks but fast forward 35 years and I am married, work, and own my own home. Never met my birth mother, in fact she only learned of the diagnosis because of the agency. I am not going to bullshit you, it is work but it is honestly up to your dedication, like any other child. You need to be honest with what you are able to handle. I know this is blunt but so is life. Good luck! Message me if you want more awkward information! My wife has SMA. I am not a carrier, although we did not find that out until I was tested when our daughter was pregnant and the genetic counsellor advised I be tested then. \n\nThere was zero chance our kids would have SMA, and a certainty that they would be carriers.  \n\nAs it turned out, my son in law is a carrier, but the child did not have SMA, although she is a carrier.  My daughter was terrified that her baby might have type I. \n\nFor my wife and I, we decided we wanted and looked forward to our children regardless of SMA or not, and did not explore prenatal testing.  Having a disability is inconvenient, but not a tragedy to us. \n\nSMA is double recessive, so if only one parent carries the gene there is no possibility that a child will have SMA, and a 50% probability that the child will be a carrier.  \n\nIf both parents are carriers, there is 25% chance that the child will have SMA, 50% chance they will not have SMA, but will be a carrier, and 25% chance that the child will not have SMA and will not be a carrier.  \n\nAnd the good news is that with current treatments, the effects of SMA can be decreased.  My advice is to look forward to having children, and never mind SMA.  You can cross that bridge if and when you come to it. \n\nBest wishes to you and your family.  \n\nFeel free to ask questions. Here to agree with everything cuco1981 said. Lost our first baby to SMA1 at 10 months. We are both carriers, making each pregnancy a 25% chance. We got pregnant another time and opted for the ( around 10 weeks. We found out pretty quickly things were ok this time.\n\nAs carriers this is the burden we face. Fortunately there are developments in treatments and I cannot underscore cuco's point enough that early treatment is vital. Hopefully your state is now doing screening for SMA at birth as well. Hold onto hope. If the baby is positive, lean on genetic counselors, palliative care, your very closest friends, and each other to make the best decisions. Congratulations on being parents! Thank you for your response and the information! We are definitely going to consult the genetic counselors to get more information since my doctor did not really give any. I really appreciate the help! Hi, I am pretty new to this I have two sons recently diagnosed with SMA3. We receive Spinraza. The main thing is time lost is muscle loss. If your baby has SMA1 it is not the death sentence it once was. There are some children if caught early and treated early will have zero deficits from SMA if Zolgensma is given right away. Also SMA is rarely inherited from a single parent carrier not even 25% chance of that. The chance of being a carrier is 25% but not having SMA. SMA is double inherited. My ex husband and I are both carriers two children and both have SMA. My other two children with my husband now do not have SMA. One is a carrier and one is clear completely. I was adopted too. SMA carrier with two SMA children. Any chance you were adopted in Alabama? Unfortunately I am in Minnesota.  Would not have that been crazy? Lol yes especially considering I know my bio mother had a twin sister that gave up a child several months after I was born and your age lined up. Do you have insurance? We were told by the genetic counselor that it is extremely expensive and when I looked it up it is incredibly expensive. Currently I am on medicaid so I am not sure if it would pay for it :( It depends on the state however we have BCBS with secondary coverage through Medicaid for our sons. Both cover the Spinraza they are on. However with type 1 it would be a different treatment. Generally you can find out in your state just with a google search", "My mom's friend's son has SMA.

Spinzraza has not been helping me and my strength has been declining more. It seemed to have plateaued for awhile but now it is getting worse. How bad could it get? Unable to feed myself, move fingers, breath on my own? To put it bluntly, it is not great. But everyone is different. I have been on spinraza for about 2 years and I have not really changed at all. Some people make incredible gains which is amazing. It is nothing to feel sorry about. The good news of course is that there are many new treatments coming down the line that could help people who were not as affected by spinraza. I hope the spinraza at least slowed it down. At the end of the day that is it is purpose. Just know that new stuff is on its way and to try not to get yourself down over it too much. Yea it is just hard. I was pretty alright for quite a long time. Not losing anything and being pretty happy. Then I went on Spinraza and did not notice anything. Then it started to deteriorate. It is been so long since I last started losing muscle that is it is just been very rough to go through it emotionally speaking. Absolutely. I have always had relatively ok fine motor control and never huge problems with moving my hands or fingers in general. But not a few months before I started spinraza I noticed that I could not fully open all of my fingers on my left hand. My index and middle fingers would go up but my ring and pinky would barely go halfway. It was super disheartening because it was one of the first times I lost something that I had. It did not help that I looked funny when I raised my hand in school. Spinraza did not fix that. But I have not had issues with any other fingers. For stuff like that you have to realize that you think about it wayyyyy more than anyone else. No one said anything to me about it when I raised my hand not because they were just being nice but because no one analyzes how other people raise their hands. Everyone is too busy thinking about their own insecurities. Losing stuff like that is really hard but just think of all you still have and fingers crossed that one of these new treatments will be even better and you will start to gain things. That is crazy I have had that exact same thing with my hands. I mainly only raise one of my hands because it has stronger fingers. The thing is I think my fingers have been getting worse. Not hugely but my index finger has been just a little bit lower than normal. And other normal things i do becoming harder as well. It is just so awful and depresses me a lot. My grades have been getting worse because I have just been trying to forget that I am losing strength and do anything that will make me happy even for a short while. It really is crazy how many times I have read someone is story about SMA and how close it is to what I have experienced. For instance, the depression. I think it is pretty common to feel hopeless when you face as many obstacles as we do. I know I personally struggle with the simple fact that people always say the stereotypical \u201cyou are such an inspiration\u201d I feel like I let people down when I just cannot do something because I am down. School really is hard plain and simple. There are so many things that we have to think about that the average person does not have to. Trying to forget about degrading strength can actually be a detriment because it begins to absorb you. I can definitely tell you that giving up ends up making things worse. Try just focusing on grade and happiness will hopefully follow. Take pride in it. Hi there,\n\nI do not in any way mean this is a total downer, but thought the perspective of an older person might come in handy. I have type 2/3 and am 45 \\ and could walk up until about seven years old. \n\nAnd now at the stage where I can Just about lift one arm enough to use my mouse, but pretty much cannot move anything else below my neck to any great extent \\. I do not really have any trouble breathing unless I am tired, but I do have to make sure I only eat soft-ish food so it is not a choking hazard.\n\nSo, yes, it is all a bit shit and I can absolutely relate to every other thing you and Floop are talking about... The emotional strain, the depression, the horrible embarrassment of how we appear to others. It sounds trite, but you are not alone.\n\nUnasked for advice: The only real way I have coped is to learn to anticipate, absorb and adapt.   Think about it, but stop when it becomes cyclical. Not sure how effective it is been but hey :) This might sound rude, but how are you not depressed? I have had major depression and suicidal thoughts with my strength to still do many things. I would not want to live with barely any movement below the neck I just cannot find happiness in good grades anymore. Other stuff is so hard that school. The truth is, and I have been scared to tell anyone this, but I have been planning on killing myself when my strength gets below a certain point as I do not think life is worth living then. And so I just want to enjoy what I can now since I do not know how long I will continue for. And also you know what I need to get this off my chest. Life sucks like crazy for people with SMA and I think we deserve to have some things be better for us. I know it is best to make us as equal as possible but you know what it is fucking horrifying to lose strength without anything you can do so fuck it I deserve to have it easier in some places. Sorry I just needed to rant about this. Hey feel free to rant. SMA is hard and unfortunately none of us had any choice in it. But it truly is not all doom and gloom. I know it sounds cliche but life is worth it once you find your passion and purpose. But please do not do anything as drastic as that. If you ever need someone to rant to please please please DM me. I can totally relate with how your feeling and could hopefully help some. Sending the best vibes I can :)  Not rude at all. The thing is, I am not depressed *now*, but have been in the past many times\u2026 from when I had my spinal rods done to when the condition meant it was too hard to work any more. That was such a bad episode that I had developed from ideation to actually planning my suicide. The thought of it scared me so much that I was actually going to do it that I started speaking to people. This was only about four years ago.\n\nThe mad thing is, I have been on antidepressants for about 20 years, yet the depression still keeps on resurfacing every once in awhile.\n\nI read in your conversation with Floop that you were planning on suicide when you have reached a certain level and it made my heart sink as I had exactly the same plan. The moment I cannot wipe my ass any more, is the day I am going to do it, I *always* thought. The thing is, when that moment actually came there had been lots of other little steps in between, so it did not seem as massive thing as it did before. That makes sense? Do not get me wrong, it was still bad but you know what? I do not give a shit any more \\. \n\nRegarding the movement thing, myself at your age would look at me with horror probably, but the weird thing is, I am probably happier now as a person than I was then\u2026 even with all the limitations. \n\nDo not really know what I am trying to say except that like everything else depression comes and goes. From experience, I recommend you getting some professional help\u2026 I am an introvert, but I did find even talking therapy to be very useful.\n\nSorry to ramble. &gt; I am probably happier now as a person than I was then\u2026 even with all the limitations.\n\n  \n\n\nYes, yes, yes! Body is getting worse but the mind is getting happier. We must understand that the body's suffering is completely different from your mind - the mind only suffers if we choose to suffer (subconsciously). And we can very well choose to not suffer and be happy instead. Meditation has helped me a lot!

I was watching videos from the channel \"Special books by special kids\" on YouTube and they featured a couple in which one has SMA. That video led me to their channel \"squirmy and grubs\", excellent content by the way.\n\nAfter watching a handful of their videos, something came to mind... I have never seen Shane's joints perform a full range of movement and I have not seen a video where Hannah moves his arms or legs past a few degrees.\n\nMy question is, does someone with SMA have a full range of movement in their joints but are unable to due to the atrophied muscle? Or does it also affect the joints to where it seemingly to be locked in place?\n\nThe two reasons that I am asking this is because of curiosity but also something of a capstone research of sort. I wanted to see if the technology for biomechanical prosthetic would translate to this. It is because of the lack of movement, when i was a kid i could stretch my knees fully, now that i am 21 it is only around 45 degrees, it is simply because we sit down all the time They are called contractures I do not think a prosthetic would be able to help once the contractures have set in but people can have surgery to have their contractures fixed (not common though). It is generally something that is left alone because they are almost clinically irrelevant in the large scheme of things and usually do not impede a person's life *too* much. Thank you for all the input! I am curious to see whether it is feasible to have the same technology used to read input signals to control muscle contractions for limb movements (or devising a similar method) would have any application to SMA.\n\nThe most common scenario would be an \"exoskeleton\" that would be attached to a limb wherein it would use signals read from a \"probe\" acquired from the user to act as the muscle.

Permobil is pretty crappy and cheaply made, but I guess it meets my needs. I would be hesitant to use a brand that is less common and less tested. I do not want to be breaking down in the middle of the street! I had a Permobile C300 and loved it...  I am trying to transition to a Permobile F3, which I am still not used to.  It sits higher, so all my tables and counters are lower when I pull up to them.  The seat has a negative tilt, which means it tilts you forward if you want.  That would be okay if the display showed you what degree you are at (like -3 or +30).  The worst part is that the EZ Lock bolt is a good 4 to 5 inches further back.  This means I have to pay to get my EZ Lock bracket in the car moved and I will not be able to use my old chair as a backup when driving.  The bolt placement also is dumb because instead of being under the axle, it is further back and catches on everything when driving over a small bump, such as a door footer or even the ground at the top of a ramp... I just got a new van and did not get those tie downs because I was worried about it catching on things. I am more active outside. I have to navigate on sidewalks and curb cuts and grassy areas and I did not want to get stuck anywhere. With your other wheelchair, did you have any problems with it? I have had permobils for years and years. But this time around I went with something different. I have a Quickie QM-710. It has elevate, tilt, recline, and articulating footrest. It is 8mph. It is mid wheel drive and has \u201cspider suspension\u201d which I absolutely love. I would pick this wheelchair a million times over again. It is by far the best chair I ever owned.  QUICKIE Salsa-M2. A great chair. Solid, compact yet nice and responsive. My C300 rarely got \"caught\" on the ground/transitions because the bolt is under the main axle, so as I roll over an object, the bolt clears it as well.  The F3 sucks because the bolt is in between the front tires and rear wheels. That is just ridiculous! It is like any attempt at independence is squashed by such stupid things. I feel like someone in a wheelchair should design more wheelchairs. Any takers?", "Roche provides regulatory update on Risdiplam for the treatment of SMA (", "Question about family planning for carriers of SMA This is more a question aimed at both parents who carry the SMA Type 1 gene. In late 2019 I fell pregnant with my darling baby boy.\u00a0 Everything was going well, until I took the NIPT test and discovered\u00a0I was a carrier for SMA Type 1.\u00a0 My doctor told me not to be alarmed, and that my husband would have to be tested as a precaution but the likelihood of him also carrying the gene was slim. Well, he did test positive as a carrier.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI decided to get an amniocentesis done (I was 20 weeks pregnant at this point, a huge oversight by the doctor's office and genetic counselor who failed to inform me earlier that my husband also tested positive -- but that is a story for another time).\n\nAnyway the waiting period to find out whether my baby would have SMA Type1 or not was probably one of the most, if not the most, anxiety inducing experiences of my life.\u00a0 Fortunately, he was of the 25% of those that do not even carry the gene,\u00a0and is a healthy lively\u00a0bouncy baby today.\n\nMy question is for those parents who have the gene and want to grow their families:How did you decide to go about having more children after you gained the knowledge that you and your partner are both carriers of SMA?\u00a0 In Vitro? Naturally? Did you decide to not try for anymore due to the risk? Why?\n\nI feel like I have so much soul searching to do - while I would love to grow my brood, is it irresponsible of me to go the natural route and try for another, knowing I could potentially have the outcome of SMA Type 1? Should I go with in vitro\u00a0- despite the cost - and test the embryos to make sure they are healthy,\u00a0but go into debt to do\u00a0so? (Insurance would never cover this). Should I just forgo having another, and make peace with having only one?\u00a0\n\nThese are my thoughts - and wondering what other parents with the gene have decided for themselves when it comes to family planning, if they are willing to share?\u00a0 We have a Son type 2. We have not been genetically tested yet. Our son received Zolgensma(Gene Therapy) after his diagnosis and has made amazing strides in his muscle recovery. His recovery is what made us decide on expanding our family. Zolgensma is an absolutely amazing treatment. Now that we know at least one of us are carriers we will have the amnio and if it shows SMA we will be immediately referred to our sons same care team to get any new children Gene therapy as soon as possible. If the child receives Zolgensma presymtomatic they usually develop the same as a normal child. Feel free to ask me anything. Forgot to add. When I went to my Obgyn for family planning advise about this she told me that invitro is also not 100%. Our insurance only covers one shot even if it is not successful. That also helped us decide our path. Please consult your obgyn. I am not sure if genetic testing can actually determine the SMA type the child could potentially be. I could be wrong though. \n\nLike another commenter mentioned, with Zolgensma there is likely going to be a chance your child would develop typically. Your chances are even better if your child is treated pre-symptomatically. I believe some insurance is even approving dual-therapy with Zolgensma and the oral medication, Eversdi (Risdiplam in trials). \n\nOn the other hand, gene therapy (Zolgensma) is fairly new and I believe the oldest kid from the trials is maybe only 5-8 years old now. There was also an article posted in this subreddit that seems to reflect a possible poor outcome of Zolgensma long term. It was a really hard article for me to comprehend though. You could join the FB group for Zolgensma babies and ask for info there as well If you have not done so already. \n\nAnd finally for the question about family planning. Our son is a weaker type 2. We did not do genetic testing nor was my son diagnosed pre-symptomatically. My husband and I have discussed a second but we are just so undecided. Sorry I do not have a better answer. Personally, I am leaning towards wanting another despite the high chance we would have a second child with SMA. It is definitely a complicated decision and no one knows what the future holds in regards to research and the long term outcome of Zolgensma. \n\nHope for the best for you and yours. Probably I misunderstood your post and you are aware of this, but both you and your man are carriers of the a broken smn-1 gene. That is wonderful to hear about your son! I have tried to look up the literature on Zolgensma and either I am just not looking hard enough or it is not there regarding how children develop after taking it post-infancy. I have only read babies reach their developmental milestones, but I cannot find much for after. Granted it is a relatively new treatment so maybe they just do not know? I cannot tell if it means they develop completely normally or if they still face some limitations? Right I know invitro comes with it is own risks, but I do not know if I should explore this route solely to explore PGT on embryos. Unfortunately my insurance would not cover this, but I have heard some people make a case to their insurers and got coverage so maybe. Thank you. I will check out the Facebook groups. I feel the literature on Zolgensma is not as direct as I would want aside from the piece I read about Zolgensma babies treated at less than 6weeks old all reaching developmental milestones. But nothing after that. I cannot tell if there would still be some limitations or if this is essentially \u201cthe cure.\u201d It is not defined as such, but if babies are developing normally then why would not it be? Unless they do not after? I guess it is too soon to tell. Hoping for the best for you and yours as well! Not necessarily. One of us may actually have SMA and be asymptomatic type 3 or 4. That is out biggest concern. Most development is normal only if they receive treatment before they present symptoms. There are multiple studies by Novartis Gene Therapies. Our son presented symptoms at 7 months old but we were able to receive Zolgensma at 8 months old. He is gaining milestones he has never had like sitting independently and rolling. We are beginning to strengthen his legs in preparation for him to begin walking with assistance. They list all their clinical data on their web page. It is most definitely worth asking your insurance. Maybe with a patient advocacy group they can help get it covered. Oh yes, I have not considered that one. In that case both of you would be carriers of at least one broken smn-1 gene. Now it should be correct I guess. I just want to clear up some misconceptions being said here. SMA is a recession genetic disease meaning both the male and the female have to be carriers to be able to pass on the disease. If only one person has the gene, then the worst that can happen is you pass on the recessive gene but not the disease. The chances of having a baby with SMA is 25%, the chances of having a baby that is a carrier like yourself is 50%, and the chances of having a baby with no recessive gene 25%. So, there is only a 25% your baby will have the disease and you cannot be a carrier of any one type. Your baby would have equal chances of having type 1-4 because the type is dependent on how many copies of the SMN2 gene they have for the most part.\n\nAlso, as someone with SMA I wish my parents would have been more accepting of my disease growing up and not wishing I was like my siblings who did not have it. Having SMA does not make you any less of a \"normal\" person. I was able to go to college, get a degree in chemistry, and live independently with my boyfriend. You may have more challenges in life, but a lot of people do. I just want to make it clear - this post was never meant to be anything disparaging about those with SMA.\u00a0 While I would love all my children equally - SMA or not, the option of whether I would want to make the choice of potentially having a child with SMA is something that would weigh on anyone who carries a gene that is life limiting and could be passed on. I am happy to hear you are thriving and it is comforting to know the disorder has not limited you in the ways that some types can. You are right - you and anyone with SMA are not any less \"normal,\" but knowing that I as a parent could bring a child into this world that could face incredibly severe limitations is not a decision to be made lightly. That is fantastic! So happy to hear that about your son. I think what confuses me is it sounds like Zolgensma is essentially the \"cure\" from what I read, but it is not really defined as such, and from reading what it does - it does sound like it is, even just from reading what you commented.  Sending lots of positive vibes to you and yours! I did not find your post disparaging at all. I just know doctors are bad at explaining how the gene is passed on and it is hard to take it all in. I was never taught this growing up and had to do my own research throughout the years. It is a lot to take in. \n\nI understand the decision is not made lightly, but there is a lot of misinformation out there. Even today a lot of doctors are not fully informed or know about the disease. When I was growing up my family was told by doctors I would never go to college, I would never drive, and I would never live on my own. A lot of people and doctors even still treat me like I am mentally incompetent just because my legs do not work properly. I recently had a neurologist tell me \"I have never heard of anyone like you having a chemistry degree\" and when I went to get my license to be able to get hand controls they made me do a cognitive test first. It is a lot of advocating for yourself. It is as close to a cure as it can get because it stops the progression of the disease in its tracks. However it is a treatment because it does not reverse neuromuscular damage that SMA has already caused. For example, our son lost the ability to raise his head and legs from the floor. He is not likely to be able to gain that function back because of the neuromuscular damage. But who knows! They might find a treatment for neuromuscular damage soon! So true! I am still finding new information everyday! Your life's path and others who achieved their goals through life are what have kept me losing all hope for our son. When we were first told what SMA was we were told what is probably the clinical definition of the disease and assuming the worst outcomes ans assumptions. Thank goodness for the internets ability to connect communities like this. I agree. The literature and info online is not always so clear and if you are like me, I want ALL the info I can get my hands on. From what other parents have shared, it does seem Zolgensma is practically a \u201ccure\u201d for the babies treated pre-symptomatically. I think ppl hesitate to ever label it the \u201ccure\u201d because technically (from what I interpreted) 1. It is like a \u201cshadow?\u201d of the missing SMN1 gene and not the ACTUAL gene and 2. The unknown of what happens to individuals with SMA long-term. \n\nIn the posts I have seen about babies treated pre-symptomatically I believe I have only seen ONE person say it was not 100%. The mom mentioned something about her daughter still having a weaker swallow and struggling with speech. Also, in the case, the daughter was believed to be a type 1 because she only had two smn2 copies. Other than the swallow issue, the little girl was walking, crawling, running, and doing all the typical things for her developmental age. I would recommend looking at adoption. The worlds already overpopulated as it is. And taking the risk of another child who could have SMA is just not a good idea. Not entirely true.\n\nAt 15 months of age, my daughter\u2018s legs were like spaghetti, she could not raise them at all.\n\nToday she walks. There is no cure for spinal muscular atrophy. That is a fact. As frost said it is just a treatment. Everyone makes gains and declines differently. I don\u2018t disagree. But I must say there seems to be a bit of recovery or compensation for the loss, otherwise this would not have been possible. A lot of it depends on how old one is when they start treatment and if they are presymtomatic. It varies case to case, so you cannot really tell someone their experience is not entirely true. I did not say that for this case it is not entirely true - how should I know? - but I said some processes are at least partially reversible or could be coped for to some extent by other nerves. So it is quite the opposite. Sorry, I must have miss read the first thing you said was \" Not entirely true\".\n\nOnce motor neurons are dead, then they are dead. Hence, why frosted said the treatments cannot reverse neuromuscular damage done before treatment, which is true. Whether the body adapts or not is dependent on the person and how soon they get treatment. \n\nA body can adapt even if you do not get treatment too to a small extent and depending on what type you have. I have type III and have adapted my whole life to certain muscles being weak.", "Interesting idea ", "I need some advice regarding a caregiver So I am 21 with SMA Type 2. I go to the University of Illinois and live independently and manage/train my caregivers all by myself. I have been directing my own care  since I was probably 10 or 12 (my mom forced me. Thank god she did though because now I know how to be independent and train caregivers myself). \n\nBut anyway, here is my issue right now: I recently hired a new caregiver through my university\u2019s virtual job board. I do not require any previous training, just a willingness to learn and an open-minded attitude. (To be clear, the pool of people I hire from are also students at the university, as I am in a specialty program for those with disabilities that allows me to hire caregivers paid for through the university). So I suppose when I mentioned \u201ctoileting\u201d in the job description that may not have been clear enough. But in future posts on the job board, I would rather not blatantly post \u201cyou are going to have to wipe my ass,\u201d you know?\n\nI do not want to let her go, she is very nice and i would rather not have to find a new person at this point, so I figured I would ask you guys your thoughts? I usually only do \u201cnumber 2\u201d at night when I am getting out of my chair and in bed, and during the day i just use my catheter, which she is been willing to learn how to do and has gotten pretty good at it. So I was thinking maybe I could just not schedule her for evening shifts? I am not sure, I have actually never had this happen before so I am a little jarred by it, lol. \n\nSorry for the rambling, if anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it!! Are you saying she is not willing to do it?   \n\n\nI do not know what your financial situation is like, but if you can afford it, I bought a pretty nice bidet seat that can go on a regular toilet and is great at cleaning my arse. I can use the little remote to aim where I need it. My husband still gives me a wipe once after for my peace of my mind, but that spray takes care of any fecal matter. As a bonus, I can basically use it as a gentle enema type of thing if I am constipated which happens often from me having little mobility. Would something like that help? It was a few hundred and a one time installation plus it can be removed so it you can leave your dorm room/apartment the way you found it. In future job adverts you could put something like \"I need help with all aspects of toileting and personal care and this is something you will need to be comfortable with\". \n\nAs for the caregiver, I would have a one-to-one conversation with her. I would start by being very understanding about it being a surprise to her but then explaining that this really is part of the job and making the point (in very soft terms) that it is not really an \"optional\" thing for any of us. Hopefully she will respond by trying to self-reflect and get over it.\n\nPersonally, if I had a caregiver who could not get over it I would let them go. I think we compromise a lot and this is one basic right too far to compromise on just because someone is a little squeamish about poo. Like, ugh, snap some gloves on and get on with it, lady.... I appreciate everything you have said here and in all honesty, my response is probably of no help to you at all. However, I can definitely relate to the situation you are facing as I have the same condition and require (from the sound of it) at least the same type of care if not more.  \n\nIf you like her as a caregiver, I thought your idea of having another person for the evening makes sense. Maybe she could even shadow that person if she is just unsure about what is exactly needed. \n\nHere is the possibly useless part of my post.\n\nIt is funny because based on suggestions from my high school counselor at the time, I was going to go to that very same university and would have been in a similar situation. In some ways, I wish I had gone through with it. Not only for the college experience, but for the independent living side of it and getting experience finding, hiring, working with, and even firing caregivers. I opted instead to live at home and commute to a university closer to home and delay that inevitable situation a little longer. One could say I am living in denial and they would be right. In some ways, as sad as it sounds, I hope I am not around for when that time comes because I feel like I would have similar conflicts as you have mentioned here. Okay first of all this response is super long, but I just want to give you some advice. If you are not interested, feel free to ignore, I just wanted to share my thoughts and experiences in the hopes that maybe they could help! \n\nFirst of all, do not think that way! Becoming independent is scary for anyone, disabled or not. It is not always easy. There were (and still are once in a while) times where I just wished my mom was here so I could take a break from explaining what I need and just have someone that already knows what to do, but eventually you develop those same dynamics with caregivers and everything gets easier. You would be amazed how much living independently changes everything. Dating, going out with friends and getting shitfaced, trying new things- whether they be responsible or irresponsible, you get to learn those things on your own by trying them rather than just imagining it. I have made amazing friends, I have gone out to the bars and blacked out like a normal college student, I have smoked pot (which has become a pretty regular hobby), I have dated, I have had sex (TMI? whatever, i do not care), I have made mistakes and had to learn from them. I have done all the things I have always imagined that other people my age do, and that sense of normalcy is something I would not trade for the world. I know it is terrifying, but I promise you that taking that step is worth it in every possible way. \n\nThe issue I posted is a bump in the road, but living independently has given me the tools to figure it out. You do not want to never try just because you are afraid there may be issues sometimes- there will be. There is no getting around that. But those issues can be fixed and you will learn so much from them. \n\nI am not saying you should wake up tomorrow and pack your bags and leave your life behind, but never think that you cannot handle becoming independent, and never think that it will not be worth it because it is. If you are looking for a way to start slowly, make the decision to begin managing your own caregivers if you do not already do so. Do not rely on your parents to figure everything out for you (not saying that you do that, just giving advice). Hire caregivers and if you are not doing so already, make sure you explain what you need from them on your own. It is so much easier to have a parent or other experienced caregiver to explain your cares, trust me I know. But doing those things on your own is a very important step towards independence. If you have not done so already, start conducting your own searches and hiring processes for caregivers. I am lucky enough to have the university give a list of pre-vetted students to choose from, but I still do my own interviews and figure out who I do/do not work well with. In addition, as part of the program I am in we are also required to have at least two \u201cprivate hires,\u201d which are students that we must find, hire, interview, and train completely on our own, either by using the university job board or by possibly knowing a friend that is interested in the job. I find having caregivers close in age to you is extremely helpful. The dynamic becomes more friendship as well as caregiving. One of the people I hired my freshman year has been on my staff for 3 years now and she is genuinely my best friend. She helps me with my cares, but we also do so much together outside of that. We smoke together, we go out together, we hang out and have deep talks while we listen to a vinyl on my record player and drink wine, we go to each other when we need advice, we do all of the things best friends do, and she also wipes my butt sometimes. These connections take time to develop, but creating them is worth it because you will always know you have people on your team.\n\nI could go on forever, but this reply is already hella long and I do not want to sound preachy- I apologize if I already do. I guess the bottom line is this: I get why you are scared, and I get why you are avoiding it. You are not alone. But I can promise you that- regardless of the hardships and struggles that come along with it- taking control of your life and beginning the journey to independence is something that is absolutely worth it. \n\nAlways feel free to message me, I would love to hear from you and am always here to answer any questions you may have, or even just to talk! Stay strong, you can do this! Thanks for this reply and sorry for the delay in responding. \n\nWhat you have said makes a lot of sense and I appreciate you sharing your experiences with myself and others that come across this thread. Just for the record, imo there is no such thing as too much information when it comes to dealing with and trying to overcome these types of challenges.\n\nI will follow up with an equally or possibly longer response soon, but need to go to sleep now as I  have to be up early tomorrow.", "Encouragement for SMA parents ", "Hello, looking for friends Hello! I am pretty new to Reddit but I was hoping I might make some friends in the SMA community. I am a 28/F Type 3 SMA.

I am a type 2 16 year old and I feel that I have been losing muscle recently. I have not really had a routine for excessive and I am wondering what I could be doing. Depending on what part of the world you are in and what you have for insurnace you could try physical therapy. Just make sure the physical therapist knows something about SMA. If you like gaming the Oculus Quest VR system can be a fun way to get some exercise. But whatever you do, do not over exert yourself. \n\nYou should also talk to a neurologist or some other medical professional who knows SMA and ask them for suggestions. \n\nSMA and exercise is tricky.  If you do nothing, that speeds up muscle atrophy.  If you do too much, that also speeds up atrophy. \n\nI would also look into Spinraza/Zolgesma/Risdiplam. I am a big fan of Spinraza.  \n\nBest of luck to you. I have been on Spinraza for awhile but have felt no change. My atrophy seemed to have stop for awhile but now it is begun again. I do physical therapy once a week. I may look into VR now. I have considered it before and my PC is powerful enough to do it. The Oculus will definitely get you moving. \nBeyond that I would only say you are asking the right questions and good for you for being proactive. Keep asking questions until you get decent answers. Which Oculus would you recommend? My son has SMA and got the Oculus Quest all in one VR gaming headset for Christmas. He loves it and gets exercise while playing. It is a win-win. Not me, but my wife has SMA type II.  Her Neuromuscular disease specialist recommends a few nutritional supplements. \nShe takes vitamin D, coenzyme Q10, and creatine in particular for that. \n\nHere is one article about creatine. \n\n\n\nWe could not say for sure it helps, but it does not hurt. When I started spinraza the changes were not drastic, nor was I really aware of them. I had several weak days and my mom even questioned whether or not I should be on it since I felt so run down all the time. Long story short - protein! I ate more protein and I felt soooo much better. Cheese. Eggs. Protein packs if you can eat them. It significantly improved how I was feeling! You can also try pea protein powder in smoothies if you have any food allergies. &gt;If you do nothing, that speeds up muscle atrophy.  If you do too much, that also speeds up atrophy.\n\nThat was what always messed with my mind growing up. Talk about walking a tight rope!\n\nBtw, howdo buck :) Right, like there is not enough other stuff messing with your mind when you are growing up?  Lol\n\nTop of the morning to ya Wheelie Dave! I have SMA type 3. I found our when I was 17. My mom did so much research and she came across stem cell therapy. We decided what the heck? Why not? Cannot hurt. Worst it can do is make me already weaker than I already am. I could walk but very slow. It seemed like it got rapidly worse after I over exerted myself from walking home from my high school. My Junior year I had to start taking the elevator everyday. The summer going into my senior year I had my appointment to go get stem cell done. I had to go to Mexico, since the US does not allow stem cell. Let me tell you. Such a difference!! I was able to climb stairs regularly. Walk regularly. And the biggest change is I would over power my boyfriend when we would wrestle. I mean it was like I hadnt had the disease. I felt great. I have already been 3 times. Right now I am just doing maintenance and it is been about 3 year since I went to get my treatment. Wow, Mexico has stem cell? If you do not mind me asking, did you receive it intravenously, intrathecal injection... Or how? Also, is it expensive? Too bad my stem cell (umbellical cord right?) was not preserved. We wanted to get stem cell too... How much creatine is she taking? :P One scoop, about 5 grams, once a day. You can still get stem cell. My cord was never preserved. And they found that umbilical cord causes more issues. I get the placenta stem cell. What if even the placenta was not preserved? I think mine is not. Thanks. I think I will try it out. I must admit I am surprised this is not more talked about. Most of my \"research\" about stem cells resulted in something along the lines of \"there is hope that in the future they could be used as a therapy\" or \"beware of stem cells treatments advertising, they do not work/are dangerous\".\n\nInteresting story nonetheless, I am happy that the treatment has worked so well for you! Same! It is not talked about because it is not accepted in the US. They do stem cell in China and Mexico. I go to Mexico since I live by the border. If you need any information do not hesitate to ask me!! Yes. They take your blood and get what kind of blood type you are. Then whatever is donated or what supply he has he will match it to you. It is incisions in your arm bends and your leg bends. He will put the stem cell there. Then he does shots in your back with your blood mixed with the stem cell. I am pretty sure I would be in a wheel chair by now if I didnt have it. Yes! I love the stem cell! No no ask away please! It was injections! So he will match your blood type with the stem cell. Then he will make small incisions on the bend of your arms and legs and place a pocket of stem cells. Then we will mix the stem cell with your blood in a big syringe and inject it in your spine. It is pretty simple. And my very first treatment was 15k but then a year or so later I went again and it went to 12k and so on and so forth it gets cheaper. The doctor is SO NICE!!!! 10/10 recommend it. Good thing about it is it is not deep into Mexico. It is like you go through the border and 20 ft from the border is the clinic. Hey, thanks for the reply. I actually asked my neurologist last week regarding stem cell and she immediately shut down the idea :(. Yeah I didnt ask mine and when we told him he kind of brushed us off:( but I am the type to think if it helps why not do it?", "So, I have questions... My little niece was diagnosed with SMA type 2 this week - she is not even 2 years old (I think she is around 16 months). This has brought up a whole host of questions for me and my sister - namely, where did this come from? We understand that to inherit the condition, both parents are typically carriers, therefore my sister must be a carrier. And we have since discovered that my mother's older sister Kathy, who died at 7 years old may have also had this condition, leading us to believe the SMA gene must come from my mother's side of the family. My question is, how likely would it be for me to be a carrier? My sister and I do not have the same father. I already have two children of my own who are both typical, active, fiesty boys (no signs of SMA), so I am not really concerned that they may have inherited the condition, I am more concerned about potential grandchildren. I am planning on getting myself tested, but am concerned that should I be one of the 5-10% of carriers who are not detected in the SMA test, my children could still be carriers themselves. Do both parents typically have to be carriers to reproduce a carrier? Or can it be passed on from one parent? Is it worth me getting my children tested as well? Before yesterday, I would never even heard of SMA, and now it is all I can think about. I am so devastated for my sister and my niece - particularly my niece who has barely begun her life :( I have been told she will be treated with lumbar punctures every 4 months for the rest of her life...!! Ah, it is just heartbreaking! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, any kind of advice/information people could provide would be much appreciated, I am at a loss of how to support my sister other than to start putting aside money for my niece's future needs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for your time! Hey there. Sorry to hear about your niece. It can be traumatic to discover that your loved one has a lifelong disease like SMA. Please take care of yourself and your sister too.\n\nNo doubt that SMA is devastating but there has not been a better time to be diagnosed with SMA than now, with lots of new medical research providing extremely effective therapies that will give your niece many more years of close to normal functioning than has ever been possible in the past. The lumbar punctures you mentioned are to administer Spinraza, a drug just a few years on the market which has achieved some amazing results in real SMA patients. Other people here can provide more first-hand details on Spinraza. Coming from a draconian country far from the United States, there is no Spinraza available for me.\n\nAs for your carrier status, the best thing would be to get yourself tested. You can test your kids too, since you are worried about their offspring. It is possible for someone to be a carrier if just one of their parents was a carrier.\n\nLet S be the SMA gene and s be the non-SMA gene. A carrier configuration would be Ss, an SMA patient would be SS, and an unaffected person would be ss.\n\nWhen two carriers reproduce:\n\nSs x Ss = SS Ss Ss ss\n\nThere are four possible ways that the genes can combine. The child can inherit S from the father and S from the mother and become SS, an SMA patient. The child can inherit S from the father and s from the mother and become Ss, a carrier. The child can inherit s from the father and S from the mother and become Ss (you can think of it as sS, but the convention is to put the big letter first), a carrier. The child can inherit s from the father and s from the mother and become ss, an unaffected person.\n\nThis is why they say there is a 25% chance of a child of two carriers getting SMA. Out of the four gene combinations, one results in the child having SMA. Two result in the child having carrier status. One results in the child being neither an SMA patient nor a carrier.\n\nIf a carrier and non-carrier meet:\n\nSs x ss = Ss Ss ss ss\n\nApplying the same method as above, the child has a 50% chance of being a carrier and a 50% chance of not being a carrier, and it is impossible for the child to have SMA.\n\nI hope this helps. Hi! I think that the commenter above did a great job explaining that. May I recommend you suggest Zolgensma to your sister for your niece.. it sounds like they would be treating her with spinraza. Today there are two treatments, like you said the lumbar puncture.. the other is a one time infusion. I would see if your sister could advocate for that! My daughter is 7 weeks old, she was just diagnosed type 1.. we were treated with Zolgensma Wednesday. It is a one time, hour long infusion that replaces the gene she does not carry. We are extremely hopeful.. it was just approved by the FDA May 24.. 6 days after our little one was born. Best of luck Also... advocate for newborn screening in your state!!! Time is if the essence with treatment for this disease. Especially with Zolgensma. The faster a child gets it, the better odds are for their symptoms not to progress. Zolgensma is currently only available for children 9 months and younger in the US. I am so happy for your family that your daughter was able to receive it! It is approved for children under 2. There was an older (still under 2) boy dosed just yesterday. It was on good morning America. For some insurance companies they only have policies for younger babies That is so great! My son just turned 3; wish he could get it. Thank you all for your info - I think I will definitely get myself tested and go from there. I should have mentioned also that we live in Australia, so treatment options may be different to where you are, although I did confirm with my sister yesterday that my niece will be treated with Spinraza. I am not sure if the other treatment option is available in Australia, but I will mention it to my sister (I sent her a link to this reddit group yesterday also). I am so glad to hear prognosis for SMA is much brighter these days!! Especially these days Okay this has happened in my family. I have SMA2, diagnoses at 6yo. No ONE NO ONE in my entire family tree showed signs. My mother and father are carriers. I know on my mom\u2019s side is female and my dad\u2019s side is male. YOU ARE A CARRIER.

This is how it was explained to me. Get genetic testing done if ANY disease runs in the family so you know the possibilities of the future children. Okay, so what you are saying is, in my family line (on my mother's side), the carrier gene is passed to female descendants? Therefore, my mother, her sister and their female children are all carriers? Does this mean that if my children (both boys) do not appear to have SMA (8 and 9 - I am aware that type 3 and 4 can appear later in life, so I am feeling a bit concerned about that), they are not carriers? Or could they still be carriers? My main concern is making sure my kids and their kids are okay, although I will not lie - the cost of testing is also an issue. Obviously, testing needs to be done, I am just not sure if it should be me who should be tested if, as you say, it is highly likely I am a carrier. Perhaps it should be my kids? Ahh, it is all so confusing! Actually, no, I have no idea what is even going on lol! I really should have paid more attention when we covered genetics in school - I get recessive + recessive = passing it on (like for eye colour), but that is about as far as my brain processes -\\_- Haha Eh, SMA is not the end of the world. As you may have read here, many adults, including myself, live fairly normal productive lives. Also, with treatment (especially toddlers), it is almost as if they are not even really affected at all.

I guess that these types of SMA are far more aggressive and obviously are present much more at earlier stages in life. From one video I saw on YouTube, one little kid with Type 2 was only given my 10 months of life, and with the treatment, he is already starting to walk and feed himself at nearly 2.5 years of age IIRC. So it obviously combats the degradation of muscle, but to what extent it is still unclear. Perhaps with Type 3 it will either slow down significantly, a little, or maybe completely; allowing muscles to regenerate and grow to an extent. The latter is obviously amazing, but even the former is nice. &gt; I think it depends on the severity of the condition. For Type 1 and 2, from videos I have seen, infants have nearly 0 strength.

They look at the cost to insurance companies and governments. In this case with SMA patients some of the costs (adaptive tech, hospital case, nursing home care to name a few) add up to BIG money. Then thow in premature death, an incalculable cost.  Also the cost to bring Spinraza to market must have been huge. Pharmaceutical companies have been working on a cure for SMA for decades without success until now. There is a cost associated with that research.  \nSo Biogen floats a big price tag, but it is one they think insurance companies and governments will be willing to pay. \nThere are other drugs in the pipeline. Competition lowers prices. Now that one company has found something that works other companies will have something to work off.

Apparently infants had the same percentages of increase in functionality as much older kids.  \nThe data is out there but it takes some digging to find it and you have to know what you are looking at which all makes me wish I was smarter and studied harder in school... Wow, that is great if true. i thought it did decrease in usefulness by age so that is great for us old buggers.

I do not want to seem like a quitter, but I was at peace with this before spinraza and now after a drawn out fight I think I am ok with it again.

Almost wished I would never heard of the treatments tbh. I hope you can get something resolved. Biogen has a program where if you are denied three times they give you Spinraza for free. Have you asked your family access manager about this? Was already told they were planning on doing that, but that was 6 weeks ago. Then 4 weeks ago the new story was they were back to messing around with insurance. Now cannot get ahold of anyone. I am just over the whole mess. I total agree with wishing I never heard about this. I am sure for kids it is great, but at least in my case the doctors are not telling me the whole story of how hard it is for adults to get it. I get a new story every other week and it is plain stressful. Sorry if that sounded all a bit down Harley. The truly good thing I take away is that kids being born now will grow up \\ free of this bloody condition. I think part of the problem is that they have not done many tests on adults so do not have hard results to see if it is 'cost-effective'. Maybe one day soon, but till then the stress cannot be doing you any good at all. I get what u were saying. I just needed to vent a bit with people who understood. They make it sound like it is better in the US and it really is not. I asked about switching insurance companies because I have two options at work and I did not qualify on the other brand either. \n\nI do not really have anyone that understands what it is like living with SMA. My BF is supportive,  but he just defaults to what I want and it is not his fault. He knows certain things are hard for me and I have bad days, but not what it is like living like this. Honestly, some days I cannot wrap my mind around doing something one day, then the next my muscles will not respond. Yeah, venting to someone who is not in our position only seems to get uncomprehending stares or pity. Neither is helpful :) Can make it lonely at times I think.\n\nIf it is any consolation, I cannot wrap my head round it some of time either... It is almost like it is just too big a thought to parse! I do not want to get too personal but if you want to message me I may have a couple ideas, depending on where you are located. \nIf you are in the US I know some states have an appeal process. The insurance companies are regulated by state agencies within each state government. You may be able to appeal the insurance denial to your state's insurance regulatory authority. \nYou may also be able to appeal insurance denials in Court and there are some lawyers and law firms who represent clients for free. \n\nI wish you all the best.

That is someone is choice on what treatment they choose is best for them. Also, most people cannot afford the cost of Spinraza or Zolgensma (Only approved for kids under 2 yr. old) and neither one works on everyone. I have been fighting for 8 months now to get on Sprinraza, but that was a hard choice for me. No one can afford any of these medicines. Insurance companies or governments have to pay.

Spinraza with a patient than cannot cope with IT injection)... so in the end, it is good to have the choice!\n\n We are not there yet but ideally, the patient should be allowed to select the therapy that works best for him/her.

I am not at that point, however, I do have my times where chewing/swallowing is not easy and I choke on damn near anything that goes in my mouth. \n\nOn those days, I drink smoothies that double as meal replacements.

The spinraza might help your jaw/throat/mouth muscles if you continue to exercise them. Keep in mind that I am in no way a doctor so take this advice with a grain of salt. Give a meal replacement drink like Soylent or Huel a try. You can get them pre-bottled or a powder that you mix yourself. If you go the powdered route I would recommend Soylent over Huel. It mixes more smoothly and is easier to swallow, and you can add more water if you want it a bit thinner. why those 2 specificly? There are other brands, but these are the only two I have tried personally. I am near quadriplegic  for over 15 years. Completely relying on Ensure Plus through a gtube for nutrition. how healthy are you? ensure plus was near the top of my list. how much do you get per day? do you feel good throughout the day? I get 8 oz 3 times per day. Nutritiously, I guess I feel fine. I am not hungry. When you do not have much physical activities, you can get by with very little calories. Soy lowers testosterone in men, testosterone makes your muscles stronger. Not a good idea for males with SMA. There is no evidence that soybeans raise or lower estrogen or testosterone levels. Then explain why men who consume them have weaker muscles and no facial hair/balding? My above average testosterone level is the only thing keeping me walking, I have never gotten a single treatment for my SMA (except for some vitamin injections at age 2 which seemed to help) and I have not had any therapy and yet I am still able to do anything on my own. &gt;Then explain why men who consume them have weaker muscles and no facial hair/balding?\n\nAge. Bad genes. Underlying health issues. Anecdotal bullshit.\n\n&gt;My above average testosterone level is the only thing keeping me walking\n\nI am sure you had this measured and the doctor said \"Wow you are so manly you beat sma.\"\n\nYou just have a less severe type of sma, bud.  It is common for Type 3s to be able to walk well into their 20s and 30s.\n\nPeople get scared because of the *phyto*estrogen in soy and think it is the same as injecting the hormone estrogen into your body. \n\nDo you know what else has phytoestrogen? Coffee, tea, bourbon, beer, carrots, broccoli, beans, peanuts, almonds, walnuts, vegetable oil, and the list goes on I do not use a gtube and my swallowing is fine, but I still supplement my meals every day with Ensure Plus because I am teensy tiny and need all the calories/nutrition I can get.

Have you tired cbd oil and has it helped the aches? Tried * I have the same issue. The soreness is from sitting in one position for too long. Adjustment/repositioning is necessary to relieve pressure. Taking cbd oil is not going to really solve anything. It might help the pain a little bit but eventually you need to move or your skin breaks down and you get pressure sores witch are very difficult to heal. \n\nWhat kind of bed does he use? A memory foam mattress and/or hospital bed could help. \n\nAs far as pressure relief in the chair, my chair has a recliner and leg rest elevator that helps a lot. \n\nSpeak with a doctor or OT/PT about these options Thankyou for your response. he does have a memory foam and his wheelchair does a recliner, he tells me his legs get tired when In one position lying down. if anyone has any tips or medicine that can relive this pain, please share them. Sorry this is kind of part of the deal, I have nights I need repositioning every 45 mins other nights it can be every three hours.\n\nHis discomfort is from pressure and being in one position for too long. Even if he was numb he would still have to move because staying in one position will damage his skin and cause pressure sores.\n\nRepositioning and pressure relief is extremely important. Thankyou for your response. Yeh I guess we just have to deal with it. hope your good :) An electric hospital bed may also help. You may be able to get one through medicaid if you are in the US An air cushion might be better for his chair, and is he using the best mattress he can? Also, my neurologist prescribes me tizanidine to help with pain and better sleep. Have you tried using extra pillows at night? I used to get pressure sores on my heels, the cheap and easy fix was a pillow under my calves to raise my heels just off the mattress. If you can, try different sizes and densities, travel pillows have really been helpful for me. It might buy your brother some extra time between repositioning.\r  \n\r  \nIs it possible to find a thicker memory foam? I used to use a 4-inch thick egg crate memory foam on my bed. \r  \n\r  \nHow old are the mattress and seat? Have you tried checking to see if they have become compressed? If your brother's seat is made from gel it should be massaged regularly.\r  \n\r  \nThere are also alternating air mattresses that can greatly help with both pressure sores and the general discomfort you get when you are in one position for too long. Fair warning, these mattresses can be very expensive.\r  \n\r  \nI use both CBD and THC to help with pain (I have a prescription). Cannabis does nothing to help me with the acute pain that comes with prolonged pressure, it does however do wonders for the aches and discomfort that comes with being immobile.

My neurologist will need to get on the same page as my physical therapist, but then it will be UP TO ME what I want to concentrate on first.  For me, I want to work on my core, my arms, and my hands.  Any other ideas for muscle groups to work on?  I am all ears.\n\nAnyways, that is all for now... Next injection is in 4 months in chilly December!\n Congratulations!  \nPlease keep posting as you notice any differences in strength, up or down, or if you hang on to status quo. Thank you and good luck! Huge thanks for the update. I am sure the therapy will help immensely. Personally, I would prefer improvements adding more core level (e.g. lungs, swallowing, torso in general). Of course, any improvements in the extremities, particularly the hands, are greatly welcome. Wooo! Go you, that is fantastic. I hope you treat yourself to something nice after!\n\nAs for what to work on in physio, I would add working on your vital capacity. I have no idea to what extent our shitty lungs are affected by bad posture/scoliosis and to what extent it is affected by poor muscle tone (I presume mostly the latter) but cannot hurt to try. Work those coughs. That is what I would go for alongside hands/arms. Oooh oooh, also your neck muscles. It is always good to maintain or improve head motion/support. Get that head bopping and swinging like the finest pidgeon.\n\nI also recommend you ask your physio about elastic training bands. I have a really long one, like two metres or something and it is super thin (not like the ones they have in sports shops which are thick) and I can alter the resistance on it by making it shorter or longer. I wonder if they might be able to get you one of those. You can hook them up to things at home and use them for resistance training (after advice from your physio) so you are doing some exercise even when not in your physio sessions, might help. \n\nYou are going to get jacked!* Like a beast!* Get them gains!*\n\n*Note this lingo may be outdated and was borrowed from my brother's vocabulary during his teen years, using this language elsewhere may cause dramatic declines in social relationships. Yeah, good ideas!  When I showed up for dose number four, my neurologist immediately said \"You are posture looks so much better!\" which was interesting to hear.  Vitality is a good idea.  I rarely get a chest cough, but when I do its a major pain, so strengthening the muscles to aid coughing will go on the list as well...  I chatted with the PT a little and he wants to include water therapy as well.  I will look into the bands too -- thanks! This is the most excitement I have felt for a stranger in probably forever! Thanks for the posts so far, and of course, keep us updated!  This is all great stuff and so good to hear. Thank you for taking the time to keep us informed. It really gives us all a bit of hope!  Great news about the posture! And water therapy sounds like a brilliant idea, helps exercise the full body and strengthen the lungs. Good luck and let us know how you are doing (only if you want to, of course)!", "European Medicines Agency (finally) approved Spinraza  In case anyone is wondering what happens next: This decision will need to be approved by the European Commission (which may take a little while) and then, for those of us in the UK, NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) will then need to review the drug. They usually evaluate benefit of drug versus cost. The drug getting to the UK market may also be hampered by the fact that new regulations recently came in which allow the NHS to delay introduction of costly drugs, even if they are beneficial. &gt; new regulations recently came in which allow the NHS to delay introduction of costly drugs, even if they are beneficial\n\nmarvellous \u0ca0_\u0ca0 Marvellous indeed, just like everything going on here at the moment! /s\n\nOn the bright side, at least it got approved before we lost the EMA and before the scramble to create an equivalent UK agency.

He sent me for a chest x-ray. \n\n x-ray)\n\nAfter looking at my chest x-ray, he said that my lungs and heart were okay. When I asked him about the cause of my chest and back pain, he remarked that it might be due to my musculoskeletal condition(I presume he means my SMA type 2) or muscle sprain from overexercising. However he did say that my arms and legs were a bit weak compared to my cranial control( My head muscles???)\n\nHis advice was to gain weight and exercise to increase my muscles to prevent degeneration. He prescribed me some meds, most important being vitamin b complex which he said would increase my appetite and strengthen my nervous system. He also referred me to a second spine surgeon for a second opinion. We will be visiting that guy on November 30.\n\nSo yeah, that is about it. I feel kind of relieved but I know there is still more to come. Congratulations my guy glad you are getting a second opinion Thanks! I will make another update about the second opinion.

So in Norway today (my home country) Spinraza just got approved for treatment of SMA in patients under 18 years old.\n\n The reasoning that  patients over 18 years would not get the treatment, was that there is no publicized research about Spinraza having any or significant clincal effect in treating adults with SMA.\n\nDo anyone know of any publicized research supporting Spinraza having clinical effect in treating adult SMA, since it seems like adults with SMA are being treated with Spinraza in the U.S? I do not think there is a lot of information to go around quite yet, at least as far as clinical studies go, but my doctor has reported significant improvement in many of her adult patients. There are many YouTube users out there that post frequent videos in which they share their experiences. Most users seem to report very slight improvements, but then again, most people have only been receiving the treatment for a few months. Other people seem to have more significant improvements, so it is definitely possible that it varies by the severity of the condition or some other factor that is still to be determined. From what I am hearing is that spinraza is actually having an amazing effect on SMA 3 in adults \nBut my country is being even more strict they will not  fund it for anyone over 7month of age \nAnd they have said a few times they have no plan to fund it for anyone else \nI am sure they will not even fund it if doctors/researchers proved it helped adults  From what I am hearing is that spinraza is actually having an amazing effect on SMA 3 in adults \nBut my country is being even more strict they will not  fund it for anyone over 7month of age \nAnd they have said a few times they have no plan to fund it for anyone else \nI am sure they will not even fund it if doctors/researchers proved it helped adults ", "Hi, which is your opinion about spinraza on sma2  I am sma2, been on spinraza 1.75 years or so. Seems to improve my breathing and I have not lost any strength/abilities since taking it, which was happening rapidly the three to five year-period beforehand. Tks, how old are you? How many injections to do?", "Invitation for Virtual Webcast (Spinraza Support and Treatment Education Program ", "Spinraza Hi,\nI have Sma type 2. Which is your opinion about spinraza and therapy genetic? Does your insurance cover it for type 2 patients?  If not Spinzera what other treatment options exist? I see many opinion about spinraza some positive some negative. What negatives? Post injection and do not have results. Right? Injection issues are very situational, I have a complicated spine and have had no issues at all (they use CT guidance into the foremana). Dose 6 was the most painful but comparable to a flu shot. I only get a slight headache after but it is nothing. \n\nNot seeing results is itself a result. The goal is to slow or stop progression, gains are just a bonus. It is better to start spinraza or wait therapy genetic? Gene therapy is only currently going through the approval process for babies up to 9 months due to dose limitations. A dosing method for older kids is still years out. If/when it is approved we do not know the label the FDA will apply and how insurance will cooperate. It took me 15 months of fighting to get Spinraza after the approval. \n\nGet Spinraza now. Get it. ASAP. For those of us who have already lost the majority of our strength, it is basically impossible to get it back, or at a super slow pace where you will not even really notice the difference. In my case, it is the latter. I have not really noticed any improvements, though I am barely starting physical therapy. But what I have noticed, is that I have not gotten any weaker. In fact, I would save my upper body dexterity has improved slightly.\n\nI believe my lung function has also improved by 5%. Regardless, there are no real downsides to the therapy, so take it regardless. It is worth it. Years you say? Aw man.... Adults and children over 9 months need to be dosed in the spine (like Spinraza). The gene therapy dosing method that is currently going through the final FDA approval process is an IV into the bloodstream, but after 9 months old the necessary dose becomes dangerous to the liver. The spinal injection version is only in Phase 1 of 3.\n\nRisdiplam (basically Spinraza in pill form) will probably get approved before spinal dose Gene Therapy, but same issues as Spinraza and Gene Therapy apply (what is the FDA label and how insurance cover it), meaning it could be over after FDA approval after you get it. \n\nIf you are worried about the needle, do not be, it is easy ,and that is the only way you are getting Gene Therapy. Not worried about a needle. Worried cause I am 25, body is going downhill fast, and Spinraza is not doing much to help me after a year and a half of taking it. Heard great things about the gene therapy and was looking forward to it hoping it might help me get just a little bit stronger. Did not realize the danger to the liver and that it was years away for adults. Risdiplam is your best bet, especially if you can get approved for combination therapy (Risdiplam and Spinraza). Since Risdiplam is in the bloodstream it should get more places than Spinraza (limps). Spinraza, Risdiplam, and Gene Therapy all have the same biological end goal: more SMN Protein. We have no idea which drug creates more and if the location of the drug matters (Spine for Spinraza and IT Gene Therapy or bloodstream for IV Gene Therapy and Risdiplam) and what is the proper SMN Protein level (at what point is more not effective). Hopefully that gets approved soon.

My mom was so upset she told me though.  My nephew got zolgensma at 8 weeks. My nephew is now nine months and my sister and her husband still have not \u201ctold me\u201d about his condition, which I completely understand, but I am babysitting my nephew now. I love him so much. I spend almost everyday with him. And I am absolutely terrified about his life expectancy. If I did not know any better I would think he was just a normal, lazy baby. But the problem is I DO know better. According to my mom, my nephews dad said that the doctors told them that my nephew is progressing slowly but he is on the right track. \nI have just been so so worried. Even more so now as he is getting older. I do not know exactly what I am expecting from posting this, I just need to rant. I need someone to be able to talk to about this. (Since I cannot talk to family) This is a terrible situation for everyone. I would assume that they are still grieving this news, and trying to take the time to process without needing to be strong for others right now. I do not get the feeling that you are per se, but I hope that you are not taking this personally. I have never been in their position, but I would almost guarantee that this is absolutely not about you at all here. That having someone look at your child as broken or disabled is a special kind of heartbreaking. I think they probably just want to try and feel like things are normal, and that is a lot easier to do when people are ignorant to your situation. \n\nThis does leave you in a bind though. You are also grieving this news because you love this little baby too. At least you have your mom to talk about this with. You guys can learn about this disease together. Family and support are everything right now. (32 years old SMA2)\nFirst let me say welcome to the SMA community. In addition to this sub there are excellent SMA facebook groups I would recommend. \n\nOne thing that I think is important to remember is that this is a whole new world for SMA, we have gone from no treatments to 3 in just a few years. It is also important to realize the type system is kind of dumb, so just because he is a type 1, does not mean anything given the intervention he is had and could continue to receive. Your family is going to have to fight like hell for him as his advocate, but SMA kids are little badasses. He is not broken, you are going to have moments where he is going to do things that blow your mind, others will not get it, but you will.", "Breaking news (?) AveXis just released a statement on their application for FDA approval of a gene therapy for SMA, type 1.\n\nI cut the below text from the interweb:\n\nAveXis Issues Community Statement on FDA Filing for SMA Type I\n\nDear SMA Community,\nAveXis, a Novartis company, is pleased to let you know that we have submitted regulatory applications for AVXS-101 in the U.S., Europe and Japan for use in infants with SMA Type 1. This is an important and exciting initial step toward the potential approval of AVXS-101, a gene replacement therapy candidate for the treatment of the underlying root cause of SMA.\nData from our pivotal Phase 1 study conducted in SMA Type 1 formed the primary basis for these submissions. Based on the data included in the applications, our expectation is that the initial label will be for intravenous (IV) use of AVXS-101 for infants with SMA Type 1, as IV dosing has only been studied in clinical trials in infants. Our clinical development program is designed to help us understand the safety and how well AVXS-101 works in a broad set of pediatric patients with SMA. For example, our study of AVXS-101 in SMA Type 2 (STRONG) is ongoing, and data from that study will help determine the final study design for the planned study in children up to 18 years of age (REACH). Please see the table below from more information and updates on our planned and ongoing studies.\nAveXis is excited by this progress, and we want to thank everyone in the community for your ongoing interest in AVXS-101. We especially want to thank the patients and families who have participated in our clinical trials it is because of you that we are where we are today, and we are incredibly grateful\n\n Pretty cool news. I wonder if this will be like spinraza and approved for all ages/types. Also heard since this is a one time treatment the price is going to be insane, estimated at 3-8 million. Yikes. Excellent stuff. They certainly seems to be quite a flurry of information at the minute, which is all good for us. Spinraza has a sticker price of $125K per dose, and requires loading doses that = $750K the first year.  Then it is $375K a year every year thereafter. So around $4 million the first 10 years. And that is not counting the cost to deliver the drug, often times to babies in a hospital setting, or the cost/risk of repeated lumbar puncutres. \n\nThat is just the sticker price.  I am sure insurance companies, hospitals and governments will nehotiate that down a bit.  Still, if Spinraza is the only other option, a one time gene therapy treatment for a few million bucks might be the most financially sound way to go. \n\nIt is a frustrating, expensive, mess.  But 2 years ago we had NOTHING, and maybe soon we will have two options,  so let us try and look on the bright side.  Oh yea I am definitely excited. All these drugs are coming to fruition. I am pretty hopeful the estimated sticker price wont be the real price. Just like spinraza is negotiated down by insurance companies. Also the one time dose will look more appealing to healthcare providers in terms of pricing Article I saw made it seem that the first approval would be for kids &lt;9 months old since that is what they have the most data on. It seems they are going to seek a separate approval, possibly for IT delivery for older kids/adults.", "Let us Help Him Smile - This needs to be done. ", "Here is a new SMA croc video.

Nice work!", "Winter is coming! So, for those of us in the northern hemisphere (which as far as I can tell seems to be most or all of us?), winter is coming and bringing flu with it. Yay. I am sure everyone knows all this anyway but just wanted to put up a reminder!\n\n-\tGo and get your annual flu vaccine! If possible, get as many of your friends and family members vaccinated \u2013 and your caregivers too. \n\n-\tIf you have never had a pneumococcal vaccine or have not had one in a while (&gt;5 years) then you should ask your healthcare provider about having it done. This varies in some countries (some will only vaccinate you once, some specify that we must be vaccinated every 5 years). If you were vaccinated in childhood or a long time ago you may need to check with your provider because the childhood vaccine protects against 13 strains whereas the newer adult vaccine protects against 23 strains.\n\nSome additional points:\n\n-\tFlu vaccine is never 100% effective and varies every year, it also does not protect against colds. So make sure you wash your hands regularly and ask those who care for you to do the same. When outside, you can carry some sanitizer with you, although be aware nothing is as good as hand-washing.\n\n-\tFlu circulation is normally at its highest for 8 weeks sometime between December and March \u2013 though sometimes it can be earlier or later. The flu vaccine takes 2-3 weeks to work after you have been injected so do not leave it too late to get vaccinated.\n\n-\tA tetravalent (covers 4 strains instead of 3) vaccine has been available for a couple of years now. Ask your healthcare provider if you can have that one instead of the trivalent one, it will give you protection against an additional strain.\n\n-\tThere is some new evidence that suggests that protection of the vaccine declines quicker than we thought (after about 3 months). Some countries will allow you to be vaccinated twice throughout the winter, although this is entirely dependent on the country you live in.\n\n-\tBe aware that flu can infect people and not produce any symptoms at any point. To be on the safe side, if you have contact with somebody who seems well during the winter period it is always a good idea to still wash your hands afterwards and avoid sharing food, cutlery etc.\n\n-\tA person with flu is infectious from the day before symptoms begin for up to a week after the first day of symptoms (this is much longer in children). Infectiousness is usually highest in the first few days of the flu. This is similar for colds. A good rule of thumb which I follow (in terms of socializing) is that a person is infectious until all their symptoms have cleared. \n\n-\tWhen people with SMA get the flu, our inability to clear our lungs makes us more prone to developing a respiratory bacterial infection. This is entirely dependent on your provider but I have an emergency supply of antibiotics at home which my doctor has prescribed for me in the case that I get ill over a weekend or over a holiday and am not able to quickly see a doctor. Of course, I would still see a doctor as soon as possible, the antibiotics are just for emergency use and peace of mind. Speak to your specialist or doctor about this if it is something that you worry about. It is obviously up to them, they may prefer that you go straight to Emergency if you are not able to see a doctor near home and I would not want to encourage spurious use of antibiotics - but it is an option that can provide some reassurance. Obviously, we should always see a doctor asap if we get a respiratory infection.\n\nThat is all, take good care of yourselves!\n Excellent post! I have never heard of the tetravalent vaccine, but I will make sure to ask when I go in for my shot. Kill me, I am arguing with a bunch of anti vax mothers of SMA kids on the Spinraza Facebook group... Oh for fucks sake, really? I literally work on the safety of vaccines like flu vaccine, it is probably my duty to go over there and try to help but I would rather blow my brains out....\n\nDare I ask what their top conspiracy theory is?\n\nPS - Nice to see you about, been a while since I saw your name pop up! \" My girl is 9 and only once had the flu shot, that year she got the flu and it was horrible- \nSo we as a family DO NOT get the flu vaccination - \nDecision supported by all of our doctors.\"\n\nI told her that doctor is going to get her kid killed.  Doctor is either a moron or incapable of standing up to the mother. Anti-vax parents annoy the hell out of me but healthcare professionals  that share in those sentiments and do not correct false assumptions are not fit to practice or fit to act in the best interest of the patient. Ugh. Excellent post! I have one thing to add though and hopefully someone can benefit from this. \n\nAfter my most recent terrible pneumonia I got a ( and I have been praising it non stop ever since.\n\nOP you mentioned the inability to clear out our lungs and for me that is always been the number 1 reason to develop a pneumonia, but with this machine I feel like there is finally a way for me to get rid of all the mucus my lungs produce. I use it regularly and when being ill or struck with the flu I use it simply as much as needed. It helps me fake the strength of a decent cough to clear my lungs. \n\nCan someone relate to this suffocating feeling of there being simply too much fluid and you not being able to get it all out? Couple of sessions with this machine and HALLELUJA I CAN BREATHE WOW MUCH OXYGEN VERY AIR :-) Excellent post! I have one thing to add through and hopefully someone can benefit from this. After my most recent terrible pneumonia I got a ( from the hospital and I have been basically praising it non stop to anyone who will listen ever since. I use it regularly and when being ill or struck with the flu I use it simply as much as needed. It helps me fake the strength of a decent cough to clear out my lungs, and keeps the mucus from building up and causing infection.  I would love one of these by my neuro said \"not yet\" (according to her, my peak flow needs to drop further before I am given one - honestly I do not see what the use is in waiting but anyway). Do you feel like it helps you feel more confident about overcoming colds/flu? And, I do not mean to sound really stupid but does it really make you feel like you can cough like a normal person? My mind is honestly blown that stuff like this exists and I cannot understand why it is not offered to all of us. I also had to thoroughly convince them to give me one. I have heard that they are reluctant to hand them out especially if you do not have tracheotomy because there is a risk of suffocation, as the machine \"sucks out\" the air with quite some force. Apparently it can go wrong if there is a mucus \"clump\" and this blocks your airway. With tracheotomy you can continue to simply suck that out manually. I do not have ventilation of any kind, and I was instructed to just keep the mask on and let the machine continue to push in and suck out the air until the airway is cleared, either by pushing the clump or whatever you want to call it further down or by getting it out. Also, but I guess this greatly depends on where you live, the Cough Assist is not covered by insurance here in The Netherlands. It was the hospital's ventilation department themselves who gave me one.\n\nThe Cough Assist really does give me confidence now to overcome colds and the flu lurking around during these months. Usually my lungs would slowly fill up because of some cold and that would then eventually turn into a pneumonia, and with this you actually prevent that from happening. I am not afraid anymore when my nose starts running :) Also, regarding your question about being able to cough like a normal person; this is what I imagine normal coughing would feel like yes. It is not particularly pleasant but it is nowhere near painful or actually uncomfortable, and the amount of satisfaction and relief to feel your lungs clearing up and eventually going \"wow, my lungs are *empty*, I can breathe properly\"... I am a BIG fan!  Thanks very much for writing this out - I really appreciate it and it has given me something to think about.\n\nI had not thought about the possibility of mucus clumps but now that you have said it I remember having pneumonia as a teen and I was coughing (on my own) and a clump got stuck in my airway - it was so terrifying. The idea of that happening again really really scares me so this kind of makes me feel less positive about the machine. On the other hand, I am also very scared of having a tracheotomy (never had one). Yay, all the options sounds so nice! Although I suppose, if you start using the machine straight away and you make sure you thin the mucus out by breathing in some steam or using mucus thinners then the chances of a mucus clump problem are somewhat diminished...\n\nIt is good to hear that despite the above you still feel confident, it sounds like you really see/feel the benefits very strongly. That must be a great psychological booster honestly - I often feel like my anxiety when I get ill prevents me from recovering as quickly as I could! Yep, basically all options are simply delightful, are not they :) And that does sound thoroughly terrifying, I am glad I have never experienced it but it sounds horrible...\nBut to be honest, my doctors just instructed me to keep on using the machine if a clump would ever get stuck, but they also told me that the chances were pretty *tiny*. Especially if you use it regularly to keep any big amounts of mucus from building up, and what you said about by using cough syrups or mucus thinners is a great idea too. Also, perhaps consider this: when recovering from that pneumonia I had a lot of mucus, maybe 1-1,5L a day (I kept an eye on how often they would switch the 1L \"collection bags\") and it never once happened back then.

Not saying that we are not normal but sometimes I watch people walk, run, go up stairs and wonder how it would feel to do that? I have SMA type 3 so I live a cautious life. I do not know if it is just me but I get MAJOR anxiety if I am invited out of town or out with people because I do not know of the uncertainty of what is going to happen? Like what if I fall in the middle of walking and there is no chair to crawl to or no one to \u201chelp\u201d pick me up. I think we all handle our condition a bit differently. While SMA clearly limits us physically, and can act as a stressor that can inhibit or give rise to anxiety in some people, others are just better at coping and dealing with their limitations and emotions. For example, I would not dream of going exploring more than a couple miles on my own; even in my own town. However, I know of some individuals that are relatively similarly able-bodied and feel calm undertaking much more on their own. \n\nWe are lucky to have cell phones. We are even more blessed to live in a society where people are generally sympathetic of others and have no issue providing assistance to those in need. I would not stress the small details in all honesty. But that is just me. Yeah your right. Made me feel better thank you.

I will keep the cup stable between my legs in my lap so as not to let the cup tip. I will pour the coffee by tipping the pot while it is resting on my right leg. Then I have to hold the hand towel in a way that it does not dip into the coffee cup but I can also use it to protect my hand from being burnt when I have to lift the pot. Then I have t muster all my strength to lift the pot back up on the counter and shimmy it back into the coffee maker. \n\nFor a normal person this looks incredibly tedious and painful. For me, it is just a morning routine I do 3-5 times a day. \n\nWhat I am trying to say is, I think it all depends on your outlook on life. I have all my basic needs met. I have good friends and a decent family. My dog is cute and good at picking up what I drop and I am happy living most of my life online. True, I am probably more stoic than a lot of people but that is just the way I am built. Do not compare yourself to normies. It will just make you miserable. \n\nI will leave you with a quote my late grandfather gave me while I was young. I think about it often even 20+ years later.\n\n*Imagine being stuck in the waiting room of a doctor's office. While you wait, you look down and notice you need new shoes. Then you look over to see the person next to you has no feet.* I should also tell you another story. When I was young and able to walk I would go back and forth through a huge parking lot to see my friends almost daily. In the middle of winter one time, I slipped on the ice and fell. Normally not an issue, I knew how to fall. I did it ALL the time. I was good at falling. Now at this stage in life I could still get up very slowly and with a lot of work by myself by getting my lower body to stand up straight while my hands were on the ground. Touching my toes essentially and pushing against my leg and knee to stand up again. That is not the point though. The point is, this patch of ice was hhhhuuuugeee. Like skating rink size and I was stuck in a dip so I could not really crawl off the ice. I was stuck. Good a truly fucked. Kids did not normally carry cell phones back then so my only option was to wait. I was too stubborn to cry for help though. Idk, maybe an hour passed and my mom called my friend's house to yell at me but I was not there and I had not been there for a while. So my mom knows the route I take and she comes and finds me. Laughs at me and then drags me home. This is not a sour memory for me. It was just a shitty mistake I made. I never once remember being scared or upset with myself. It just was what it was. \n\nI have a trillion different stories just like this and I am still alive and kicking. Did I ever get lost? Yes. Did I ever get hurt? Alllll the time! Do I regret any of my stupid, crippled adventures? Not even a little. Thank you for your story!!! It really helped! Yeah I used to be able to get up from the floor too. At one point I didnt even need to use the ground or anything. I always compared my life to others and I know I shouldnt do that because I am different than others. Thank you so much!", "AVXS-101 article ", "Stuff going up the back of the nose when swallowing Recently I have started having a problem with swallowing. As far as I can tell, the top part of my throat is not closing tightly when I swallow, and it tends to pop open and allow air, and occasionally bits of food and drink, to spurt into the back of my nose instead of going down the esophagus.\n\nI am very certain that I do not aspirate anything into my lungs though, because I keep my breath held firmly and my epiglottis works perfectly. But it is troublesome because I cannot seem to get everything to go down properly the first time and have to swallow multiple times after a single mouthful. And with each swallow, some alarming sounds caused by the flapping of the loose tissue in my throat will ensue, and I also have to deal with the food, drink, and saliva churning around in there. I also noticed that the problem is lessened somewhat if I put my head on my left shoulder, almost as if I were lying down.\n\nI did some Googling because who does not? I think my problem is called nasal regurgitation, which is caused by velopharyngeal incompetence. The overarching issue is known as neurogenic dysphagia, which is an effect of SMA. I am a 20-year-old Type 2, by the way.\n\nI have got an appointment with the ENT next week. I hope to discuss treatment options with him that do not involve a feeding tube, such as pharyngeal flap or palatal adhesion surgery or palatal lift prosthesis. I am aware that the tube is a permanent and effective solution to all feeding and nutritional problems related to SMA, but I view it as a nuclear option that I will only agree to as a last resort because eating and drinking forms a major part of my quality of life and losing that ability would kill my spirit completely. Besides, like I mentioned above, I am not in danger of pneumonia induced by aspirated food because I am always very careful with such things. The last time I had pneumonia was 2005, in fact.\n\nDoes anyone have similar experiences or gotten medical advice about this before? Even if you do not, I would still appreciate any thoughts you may have about this. Thanks! Hey there, very sorry to hear about this, sounds like a really unpleasant and worrying experience. I have not had this particular experience (though swallowing is becoming increasingly problematic) so cannot really suggest anything specific but just wanted to say hang in there. I do know what you mean about swallow problems being improved or worsened depending on the position of the head/neck and I have never quite been able to figure out what the deal is with that. You say that enjoying food is a big contributor to your quality of life and I reckon that is probably true for a lot of people so it sounds like you are doing the right thing to explore all the potential options before committing to a tube as a last resort. Let us know how it goes dude, hope the ENT visit is helpful. Thanks for your kind words. It really means a lot to me. The internet is really a blessing to those of us stuck in far-flung corners of the world where medical knowledge is less advanced than in the West. Not that I am complaining: my country is a first-world economy and we have very good healthcare, but understanding of SMA is still very lacking.\n\nI will post an update next week after the appointment. :) No worries dude - it is the worst feeling like you are the only one going through something. I know SMA is different for everybody but I think we can all relate to each other's experiences so you are definitely not alone in what you are dealing with - even if sometimes it feels that way because we are so rare. I am from the UK but when I was a child I lived abroad for a while in a country that, like yours, did not have much understanding of SMA at all. That can be a tough experience and quite isolating because there are even fewer people with SMA around to turn to (or maybe it is more that there are not well-established support groups to help you connect with other people going through similar experiences). Anyway yeah, hopefully this group can help with that a little - it has certainly helped me. Have not really had the same experiences as you, but I when I go from a sitting to laying down position, I can feel my nasal cavity close up a bunch and think it is sinuses or something.     \n\nI got prescribed some fluticasone in the past but do not think it really helped.    Too bad that appointment is next week, since that sounds like more serious issue to get looked at ASAP if anything involves breathing and swallowing.       Let us know your progress and hope you get it soon! Hi! My name is Taylor. I am 24, and I have type two as well. I am occasionally experiencing the same thing. It does not happen often enough to be of deep concern for me, but it can be unpleasant, especially with foods and drinks that are particularly spicy or acidic. I also find it easier to swallow with my head tilted to the left.\n\nI am not supposed to eat anything that is not \"mechanical soft\", or drink anything without it first being nectar-thickened. I do not follow orders, and I have not had pneumonia for a long time; not without it being consequential to another sickness (flu, cold, et cetera). This is for the same reason you have for not wanting the g-tube. To me, the benefit outweighs the risk.\n\nI am interested in hearing the result of your appointment. Would you mind letting me know how it goes? \n\nGood luck to you! Yes, I will definitely post an update. :) I went for the ENT appointment today. He did an endoscopy by putting a camera on the end of a rubber tube and pushing it into my nose until it reached my throat. It was observed that my palate is shorter than it should be, meaning that it fails to seal off the opening between my throat and my nose during swallowing. The doctor speculated that the palate might have wasted away as an effect of SMA and became small. I am scheduled for a more thorough feeding clinic examination. No treatment options were discussed but I get the sense that the doctor is not keen on surgery or prosthetics and will probably rely on rehabilitation therapy. Hey, just posted a new comment to update. :) Just posted an update as a comment. :) Just posted an update as a comment. :) Ooof, sorry to hear about the endoscopy, how unpleasant! I am just really squeamish though, you are probably much braver! Good to know what the issue is for now. How do you feel about it? No idea what rehabilitation involves, is that like exercises to try to strengthen the palate? Nah, the endoscopy was a piece of cake. The worst part was the local anaesthesia that they sprayed into my nose. It lasted for a very long time and totally killed all sensation in my throat too.\n\nTo be honest, I am a bit disappointed that the doctor is not more gung-ho about fixing the problem. He saw with his own eyes that my palate is too short, so I would assume that the logical next step is to go in there and make it bigger again. After all, such procedures do exist, such as for children with cleft palate.\n\nRehab will probably involve doing exercises to strengthen the throat muscles, dietary modification, and behavioural management strategies like eating smaller meals but more often. But again, I fail to see how exercising the palate will solve what is now essentially a structural deficit. The palate is not going to miraculously grow back to its proper size just because I worked it out.\n\nOh well, they are the experts. I just hope they know what they are doing. I have an appointment with the speech pathologist who is supposed to do another endoscopy, but this time I will be eating and drinking with the camera inside. Hopefully they can diagnose the issue properly this time and I can get some actual treatment done. No such luck even with the follow-up. They failed to diagnose the problem and instead recommended intubation. My answer has been and will always be no. Case closed. I will live with the problem and cope with it myself. Oh man, i am very sorry to hear that they went straight to intubation. I can totally understand not wanting to go down that route. I hope you are doing OK, it is obviously a shitty time. Yeah I am fine. I just have to adjust a bit, but I will still eat anything and everything I want!

Looking back, I just was not eating nearly enough. I think I was also riddled with infections so it might not have been just my weight.

Please /u/tinylittlestormcloud, translate away. To me that is just 'Blah blah blah blah blah SMA blah blah\" :) Hey, so the reason it sounds like it is \"bla bla bla SMA\" is that it mostly is \"bla bla bla SMA\"! There is not much material here but I will do my best.\n\nSo sometimes before you carry out a trial (even if it is a phase 3 trial as this one is) you might want to try out your drug dosage and your delivery in a small number of people before committing to a full clinical trial. Primarily this is because you want to know the dosing of the drug is safe before you expose dozens of people to it. Sometimes though you might also want an indication that the drug is showing some sort of positive effect because trials are expensive and risky and having some positive data can help calm investors.\n\nWhat it is basically saying is that they had 3 kids receive the drug and those kids were not harmed by the drug (and possibly showed some improvement, though the article is not at all clear on whether that was the case - either way a sample size of 3 is not something we can draw conclusions from). Based on that, they are now going to move on to conducting the full trial. They likely have a pool of potential trial participants. However, the condition of those conditions may have changed whilst they were waiting for the results from the 3 kids. So they will screen the potential participants and pick those that fit their criteria (for example: they will exclude those with very low weight, those with a tracheostomy, those with swallowing issues). The screening process usually also involves completing a lot of paperwork and just getting everything in order.\n\nOther than that, the article says this is a phase 3 trial (so the final stage before seeking approval to be sold on the market) and that for those with SMA2 there is a phase 1 trial. Then there is some legal stuff at the bottom about how investors should not take the press release as a guarantee that the drug will perform well in the trial.\n\nAs for how AVXS-101 works, they do not discuss that much in the article. Basically though, they have the \"healthy\" SMN gene and they stick it inside the shell of a virus. They can inject this virus into you (intravenously or into the spinal canal like with spinraza, not sure which one they are going with but both are technically possible with this kind of virus). The virus then gets into your cells, such as your motor neurons. This way, the DNA gets delivered to your cells and your cells can start making SMN protein from it. Thanks!

Please read, leave a comment, and share the blog with others. Thanks!  Good article. All very grim but needs saying. Have shared. I warned readers about that. To add, drug prices are likely continue rising with no exception to treatments for rare diseases and others. Novartis acquired AveXis back in May of 2018 so that they would not only provide a treatment for SMA like Zolgensma, but also treatments for cancer, blindness, etc. This will not come at a reasonable price as we might expect. Once one drug company enters the market with a drug priced at this astronomical level, other drug makers are likely to follow, unfortunately. So this is important matter for all. Thank you for sharing the story! Such greed. I have all but given up hope of receiving any treatment for this condition but it is maddening that kids cannot get access. Absolutely. This all calls for an action of change. While insurance companies take burden off of parents in the US and a few other countries may cover the drug through governmental programs, the majority of the remaining countries do not. Novartis needs to fix the price of the drug by assessing the effectiveness and safety of Zolgensma. This has NOT been done yet. It is a very unethical drug company that takes advantage of the situation to fast-produce profit. If the price were assessed properly more countries would cover the drug while at the same time providing an immediate access to the treatment.", "SMA and exercise My boyfriend has type 2 SMA and during the lockdown he got a little weaker as he was not walking anywhere. We started going to the gym this week to help him regain and maintain his strength and I was wondering which kind of machines would you recommend trying to strengthen his leg/arm/chest muscles, which are not too difficult for someone with SMA. \n\nAlso I think he has been overdoing it a little with the arm exercises as after the gym his arms were stiff and painful for days, is this normal and useful in long term or doing too much exercise is harmful?\n\nI am sorry if I worded this wrongly we are very new to this whole thing, he is 23 diagnosed SMA 2 at 21. I am guessing you mean type 3 because 2s do not walk. I would recommend very low impact stuff and do not do a lot. Because of the poor nerve connection the muscles may not recover properly Supplements to help? As someone else said he probably has type 3.   \n\nThere is definitely a Use it or Lose it component to SMA.  But it is a balancing act. Do not do enough and you speed up the atrophy.

I am dying to know what the new medicines will mean for people with SMA who want to exercise to increase muscle mass. SMA 4 if he was not diagnosed till 20s and is still walking.  I have gone through spurts of trying to exercise more, it is important to stretch well &amp; hold stretches before and after exercising to avoid sore muscles.  I do not know about chest/core exercises but I found exercise bikes to be a maintainable exercise when I was still ambulatory as a child. The jury's still out on how beneficial exercise is for SMA. It is pretty well understood that there is such a thing as too much though. For now just do normal daily activities, but do not be lazy. Get up walk around the block or house, do chores, stretch, whatever he can, but do not work to the point of exhaustion; and definitely do not try to \"feel the burn\". Eat healthy and get plenty of protein. \n\nTalk to a neurologist. Preferably one who works with SMA / MD. They will be much more up-to-date on the benefits of exercise and nutrition.

I always had lots of cough, but lately it has worsened a lot. I use a phlegm suction machine from some years now, but recently it takes all of my energy to cough. Can use medicines to dry it all up, but doctors advised against using it regularly. What do you guys do?  Lay up side down, let gravity help you out.  I sometimes use a cough assist machine. It looks like this:  I have that. I find it tires me out, though I have only tried it once. I do not know about you, but I find that laying flat on my back helps me cough a lot better and makes expelling all the nasty stuff a lot easier. I also find that sitting up for extended periods of time let us all the phlegms build up? Hi Preformerr,\n\nAs strawbrery commented, I too use a cough assist machine that looks exactly like the one that was linked. I only use it if something gets annoyingly and partially lodged in my throat during consumption. And also when I have to cough out some mucus either due to a cold or when food goes down the wrong pipe consistently. \n\nIs your \"phlegm suction machine\" not as effective as you would like? Hmm..yes it can still be tiring to cough even with a cough assist machine. But coughing independently without any assistive device is much harde rmost likely, especially if you are feeling more fatigued than usual or generally due to a cold. \n\nLaying flat on your back while using a cough assist machine is also an option. I remember that was pretty effective when I caught a cold last year. Do you build phlegm consistently on a daily basis even if you do not have a cold or flu JmGx? No, I do not. Personally, and not to be gross, I shower with hot water and that seems to loosen up all the stuff in my esophagus, so I go to town while in the shower (cough up/spit all the stuff out/blow my nose excessively until it is clear). It is not gross at all! Have you ever had an ear infection? My doctor told me that blowing nose excessively makes the mucus travel to that side. \n\nAfter I stopped blowing my nose, it stays clogged 24/7, which is very irritating.  I used to have infections on and off, but that was a long time ago. I have not had an ear infection in nearly 10 years now. Here is the thing though, I would imagine that blowing your nose when you are all congested would lead to the mucus spreading out, but since I do it with hot water, I do not really put much effort into it and everything flows out fairly easy. It might be different for you, but my method usually works for me (i.e. running really hot water over my face while I blow my nose). I used to do that when I had a cold some years ago! It is a great idea, but my baths are very short now, as I cannot sit much anymore... so I will not get any time for it.  Thanks for the suggestion, but my chest and back is deformed (no spine surgeries) so I cannot do it. xD Thanks, I will look into it.  Looking for the cough assist now. My suction machine was sufficient some years ago, but my chest mucus has increased drastically since then. Now I cannot even sleep properly as my chest fills up overnight and I have to suction at dawn. \n\nWe attach a small catheter to the pipe, and insert it into my throat. It cannot go in much so I have to cough a lot.  If at all possible, can you lay on your side while in bed? A small container with some really hot water ought to do it. Yes, I can lay on my side for some minutes. Do I have to submerge my nose?  Nah Man, just have it close enough so that the vapor hits your face. That should be enough to hit your nasal cavities. I have never tried it before, but I reckon it will help! Let me know if you do it and it helps! Thanks, I will definitely try it out!  If you are using the cough assist then I presume you have already tried the \"Lung Volume Recruitment\" (LVR) kit and it does not work? I have been told to use the LVR kit daily (at least in the morning and if possible in the evening) to keep small airways open and apparently this helps keep phlegm in the upper airways where it is easier to cough up than in the lower airways. Are you doing something like this daily to try to reduce overall phlegm levels? If not then ask your physician to look into it.\n\nOther tips:\n- Clean, sterile bowl. Fill it with water from a kettle. Put in some of that chest rub stuff or some eucalyptus. Lean over it with a towel over your head (wait for a bit for water to cool down a bit, like let us not burn ourselves here!). Take in deep breaths and try to stick with it. Make sure you are able to take towel off (or have someone nearby who can do it if you cannot do it yourself) in case you get very hot. You can take breaks but the aim is to moisten the phlegm and loosen it up so you can bring it up easier.\n\n- Chest percussions. Do you have a helper person that is trained in these? You can find decent visual guides online if not (although if they are not trained I would recommend seeing a chest physio to get them some training). Lie in bed if possible, chest percussions should go from the base of your lungs upwards - never downwards. Do *all* your lungs. In strips going upwards. You can do the same strips of lung over and over, just do not go downwards. If you are like me, you will have problem areas in your lungs. Spend time on all areas but spend more time on the problem bits. Roll onto your side to get to the back and other sides. Put on an album of music you enjoy. Try and make it until the end of the album with chest percussions. It is tiring to have someone beat on you but it can really help to have some pump up music (if you are feeling well enough). If you can tilt your bed so your head is at least a bit lower than your feet it helps. Or use some pillows or something to elevate your hips above your head. Then get into whatever position you are most strong in and do the coughing with your machine. Sometimes people find it useful to have someone press their diaphragm as they cough using the butterfly hand technique.\n\nYou can combine the above. It is a process and it is all about prepping that phlegm to come out, even when using other devices. \n\n- Moisten phlegm and loosen it (steamy bowl)\n- Dislodge mucus and move it upwards by upward chest percussions\n- Get your feet/hips higher than your head, does not matter if your spine is twisty, just a little bit of slant can help.\n- Position yourself in your strongest position (for some people that is sitting, for others its lying down) and expel those phlegmy bastards.\n\nCoughing itself is even more tiring if the phlegm is not prepped to be brought up so perhaps focusing on stuff like that can help overall? Thank you very much for the detailed reply! \n\nI had asked a doctor about the cough assist machine the last time I had pneumonia, but he did not know about it. I have not heard about the LVR too, which I will look into now. \n\nI used to take eucalyptus steam before, but I cannot sit much now so I do not take it anymore. As for the chest percussion - my mom does it on me sometimes, but it never seemed to help much... maybe she is doing it wrong? I will see some videos with her.  Hi, no problem!\n\nIt may be the case that you need to do the percussions for longer (or maybe a little bit harder if you can handle it?), or maybe it is simply a question of technique.\n\nAs for the steam - another option might be a plug-in humidifier that you could put close to your bed (you might want to discuss with a doctor first, it might be one thing to inhale some steam and another to have a humidifier on all day). I used to have one when I was younger, for chest infections. The only thing about them is they need to be cleaned regularly and thoroughly or else they might increase the risk of catching something.\n\nHope you can figure something out and feel better soon! The percussions hurt so much (even the mild and slow ones) that I find it hard to cough afterwards. So I thought it was inefficient and stopped doing it regularly.\n\nA humidifier, that is one more thing to look into, thanks. Have you tried using a nebulizer? I only use it when things start getting too difficult, as I did not want my body to get accustomed to the medicine.  That is fair enough, completely understandable why you do not like them then!\n\nI have not used a nebulizer I do not think. Is that like one of those devices you put between an inhaler and your mouth? Not actually sure what it does!\n It is a device where you can get a medicine in the form of mist, commonly used for asthma I think. Like getting steam, but it is in a liquid state instead, and at medium temperature (not hot). You put the nebulizer medicine in the machine, put the mask on, and inhale.  My fiance (sma type II) cannot use the cough assist because he had a collapsed lung recently and he still has a bit of the pleural effusion that made his lung collapse (out of no where, has anyone ever heard of that?)\nWhen they tried using the cough assist he could not breath for a few seconds...the cough assist is dangerous in this case. So if you have a sharp pain and reduced vital capacity, do not use, people in icu almost got him killed because they did not know what they were doing (they thought it was mucus, did not realize there was fluid under his left lung)\n\nBut this thread has been very interesting to see the alternatives to the cough assist. I will buy a nebulizer and see if I learn the techniques. And for those who can make use of it, I totally encourage, it will reduce chances of different kinds of pneumonia", "Spinal Muscular Atrophy PAID ONLINE SURVEY!!

Turns out my friend's kid has Type 1 SMA and I have been googling and seen some \"generic\" spinraza form shady pharma companies in India. Is any of it real?

I am a 21 year old SMA type 2 living in denmark, and i do not even get spinraza yeah but they do not have the money to buy legit spinraza. I do not know how it works with the healthcare for example in Norway if you just go there. The numbers do not work. I do not know what the fake \"generic\" price tag is, but let us say its $20K. The real stuff has a sticker price of $125K.  Even if the big insurance companies or governments who are paying for it negotiate that # down to $75-$100K, you know if there was a generic option for $20K they would be dropping another $20K on travel packages to India. \n\nTotal scam by horrible people.  Honestly, i think if they move to norway and get residentship, they could probably get spinraza through taxes. If it is not straight from BioGen, it is NOT legit ... it is a bit more than shake an bake biochemistry. The compound looks like its very difficult to make", "Had my first Spinraza injection today and I was fairly nervous going in, but the procedure was not bad at all! What are your experiences with Spinraza? \n\nWhen do you start to notice improvements?\n\nDo you do anything to \"workout\" daily? I never really noticed any improvements myself personally, but I definitely noticed no further decline, which I was noticing more and more in the past couple years. This is what I was really hoping for the most, so I am definitely happy there.\n\nHowever, I never went to physical therapy, and my neurologist only suggested some light work using my hands. I have not really done anything else because I am primarily lazy, but also because I am pretty busy with school and other affairs. I also doubt I would see any improvements since at this point I am essentially 100% sedentary, and I am guessing any improvements would take years and years--but that is just me. Patients with more physical abilities could probably benefit from working out more.\n\nOh, I guess I did notice one improvement; chewing and swallowing. Prior to starting treatment (January 2018), swallowing was becoming an issue, and now it is definitely not as challenging and feels like it is fairly \"normal\" to a degree. Coughing and clearing my airways has also seen some improvement, though it was never much of an issue. friendly reminder,\n\nthe procedure is not easy at all. I had no problems the first time, but the second. Holy shit I had the worst headache of my fucking life for 6 days. Christmas in bed this year, really sucked.\n\nSo please, stay down for 24 hours. lay flat on your back and dont move, take caffeine pills and drink alot of water to avoid that pain\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngood luck &lt;3 I have had 5 doses so far. All of mine went totally fine with no side effects side from mild back pain for a day. I would suggest doing very light physio. That is what I am doing and I have seen improvement. I do as many reps as I can with small weights, like 300-500 grams only. Also do breathing exercises which can be found online. \n\nThe important thing right now is to get yourself moving as much as you can without straining yourself. Nerves take months or years to repair so do not expect anything quickly, but over time you will see changes. That is why I am afraid of starting Spinraza. I keep getting told that there are no side effects and the procedure is easy, but then they throw in at the end if you do get a headache you have to lay down till it goes away. I cannot afford to not get paid for a whole week. \n\nI am also not convinced about how well it works in adults. The facility would never give me details. When I asked about the results in walking adults all I got was that everyone they have used it on has improved, which is not what I am hearing. I am type 2 and almost 30 years old. I have had 4 doses so far. My headaches have been mild, lasting about an hour, and if they come back I take tylenol and just recline for a few minutes. I am not bed bound until they go away. I have definitely noticed improvements in my stamina and breathing which is huge for type 2.  I think it is definitely worth starting for anyone with SMA until something better comes out. I guess it is for everyone to decide for themselves whether they take it or not. I just find I have more negatives than positives that would come out of it. I am kind of a workaholic and would find it really hard to even be down for a day. \n\nI do not really trust the doctor that I would have to go though either. I was told I would have to get an EMG after each dose, which I have never heard of being a thing, and magically he has grants on the line for a study with EMGs and SMA. it is probably better for you to wait until the treatment has improved.\nthere are or can be pretty heavy side effects nobody tells you about. I know that they are trying to develop a method in which you do not have to inject into the spinalchord anymore, should have waited for that too Of course it is everyone is own decision. I just hope no one foregoes the injection out of fear of discomfort.  \n\nMost of the discomfort people experience during the procedure is from awkward/uncomfortable positioning on the table due to hip and knee contractures, and having to work around any hardware from spinal fusions.  IIRC, you have type 3 with some hip pain, but are still able to walk some, right? It will be much easier for you to get the injection than majority of people with SMA, and will probably be more beneficial.\n\nAnd honestly, your condition will get worse without treatment. The closer you get to 30 the faster it progresses.  And the worse your condition gets in the future, the more work you will miss trying to adapt to the changes. IMO, missing 4 days of work within the first 2 months now, and then 1 day every 4 months after is the better deal. \n\nOf course, you know yourself and your situation best, and it is not my job to convince you one way or another.  Maybe the best course is to wait and hope Risidplam comes through in the next couple years. But Spinraza is available now, and I do not think anyone considering the treatment should avoid it out of fear of pain or discomfort and end up regretting it later. We have SMA, our lives are already full of pain and discomfort, so what is risking a little more? At least with this, there is a solid chance of something beneficial at the end of it. \n\nAnd I understand people have dozens of other considerations that impact their decision, but again, I do not think fear of discomfort should be one of them. I never said that I do not have a lot of issues and that I will not get worse. Walking is a curse not a dream. Spinraza is not going to fix arthritis and torn cartledge from falling all the time. I am screwed no matter what and I was at peace with that a long time ago. I am who I am and I am not ashamed for it. It is not just four days of work missed. There is the testing before the injection, the injection, weekend overtime missed because of the injection, and follow up apts. If I have to find a new job that works better for me as I adapt to SMA through life, then so be it. \n\nNot to mention Biogen should be ashamed for exploiting people. I fought for a long time to get on Spinraza, but all I was doing was making myself miserable fighting with them. There is a little kid with SMA or someone with a curable disease that could use a million dollars a year a lot more than me. \n\nI do not mean any offense, but I hear crap from normal people all day and I thought other people with SMA would understand and be supportive. I respect people who have chosen to try it, but I am just not sure it is for me or that it shows enough improvement in adults. For now I may be miserable, but I am doing what I want and I do not have anyone dictating my life. Everyone can also hope better delivery methods will come, but you be you. If you want to continue with it great. If not then be you and do not be ashamed. Actually do that no matter what. Msg me if you ever have a bad day and need support or to bitch. Im pretty good at bitching lol. I am usually up weird hours too. Your original post said you were afraid of taking Spinraza because of the side effects and the difficulty of the procedure. I tried to make it very clear that those were the points I was addressing. It was not an attack on you and I am sorry that you felt that it was. Do you have recommendations for the weights? I guess I do not know the right keywords for searching, I just found calibration weights, which I guess would do the trick. Injections were very rough for me at first because I have spinal fusion. Before I could get an injection I had to have a hole drilled in my spine which was done through surgery. The first injections were super painful but eventually they began sedating me so they are fine now. \n\nI have noticed absolutely no changes and it is pretty depressing. Hope yours works better. Sma type 2, just had my 5th injection.  Have not seen any strength gains.  I have felt more energy and more stamina.  \n\nNo pain or headaches at all.  I get cervical injections.  Ive been told lumbar injections are more likely to cause headaches.  \n\nIve been a lazy bum with exercising but theoretically what I should be doing is using a hand cycle at the gym and 1 pound free weights.  Another exercise thing I tried is supporting my arms from the ceiling via therabands and then it is easier for me to do arm movements to work out and im not fighting gravity.\n\nOh, also swimming, swimming is the best exercise.  I honestly believe im as healthy as I am now because my mom forced me to swim as a kid.  For a long time as an adult I didnt do anything to work out and now I feel like spinraza is motivating me to get back into it.", "International Funding for Zolgensma I used to live / volunteer in a small town in Ukraine and recently found out that the parents of young boy there are pursuing Zolgensma to treat his SMA. \n\nI was asked if there are any charitable organizations that can help pay for this treatment.

I would definitely do it again.\n\nI think a problem these days is that the dose is rather small.

He has SMA Type 3 and was just diagnosed with neck cancer. (Very tough, statistically what are the chances of having both in your lifetime?) He starts radiation and chemotherapy soon and is wondering how the side effects will affect his SMA. At this time he can still walk and is independent but is concerned about the toll the cancer has treatment (extreme fatigue) will take on his body and what to expect. Does anyone have any experience with something like this? Hi there! Is he on or trying to get on Spinraza? Never heard a case like this, but I would think that a drug like Spinraza could at least \"compensate\" any toll caused by the treatmeant in terms of fatigue or weakness. He has tried but was told that the drug was only available for type 1 and 2. Before his cancer diagnosis he had really been enthusiastic about the drug. Now he is wrapped up in his treatment there. I do not know where you live but the drug was initially approved for all types. The best thing you can do is speak to your neuro. They might not know specifically for SMA but they might have had a couple of muscular dystrophy patients with cancer. They might be able to give some sort of idea of how it affected others. In any case, if it has not happened already, I would recommend that any oncologist is put in touch with any doctors your dad has been seeing for his SMA. It would be good for those lines of communication to be open.\n\nOn a cellular level, the way chemo works is to kill off dividing cells (cancer cells are basically cells that have gone rogue and are dividing far too fast). The chemo targets the cancer cells but will also affect other cells in the body that divide - e.g. cells in the digestive system, cells that are part of the immune system etc. Chemotherapy side-effects (nausea, hair loss, weakened immunity) are a result of the chemo affecting these healthy dividing cells. Chemo will not cause neurons to die because these types of cells are exceptional in that they do not divide so that is a positive. \n\nHowever, side-effects such as nausea and digestive issues will decrease appetite and food intake and that can lead to muscle loss. I do not know how easy it is for type 3's to regain muscle but that is something to look out for and be aware of. I do not know how it works where you are but there are hospital dietitians who can advise on how to try to keep food intake as good as possible whilst the treatment is underway. In general, you would want to increase calories and protein intake (whilst keeping fat intake low) but they can advise on how best to do that. I imagine eating proper meals might become hard, I know there are some people on here who use those liquid nutrition thingies (I think they are called huel? soylent?) so that might be something to consider as something to sip on. In addition, because chemo causes a lot of fatigue as you say, reduced activity can also lead to muscle loss. It is not going to be easy, but trying to keep activity levels and range of motion as good as possible for as long as possible is likely going to be important.\n\nI am sure this has happened already but I think it is important to just inform the oncologist (and their team) that muscle loss is a big deal for SMA people and they need to be really conscious of the fact that you need added support in tackling that in the best way possible - both in terms of nutrition and activity levels. And definitely let any SMA doctors you have know as well.\n\nGood luck to you and your dad!", "Anyone else ambivalent leaning towards not in support of this?  Why would you not be in support? Honestly cannot say I like the guy, but then again, I do not like comedy movies either. Not sure how he will do replacing Jerry Lewis, but I am sure he will do just fine. The article also says there will be lots of other stars. Whatever brings in the money! &gt; I do not like comedy movies either.\n\nI know 2020 is bad but you have got to hold on! The Jerry Lewis telethon presented people with disabilities as objects of pity who deserve charity and were incapable of living a valuable life.  Overall an ableist sob fest that utterly failed to present people with disabilities as complete human beings. Ugh.  No ambivalence here.  \n\n This article has links to more.   Sorry for the delay, reddit did not alert me of the comments and I forgot about this.  To expand\n\nThe telethon in general propogated the charity model of disability which equates to any given non-disabled person's preconceptions of people with disabilities as helpless and pitiable.  Pity is a dangerous emotion that does not lead to understanding, empathy, or acceptance.  The charity model keeps distance between society and the disabled.\n\nAt the same time part of my life is certainly moulded by having received help from the MDA: is all of 2 hours really going to raise enough? Is Kevin Hart going to be able to balance stepping back to be serious about the actual cause interspersed with  as Jerry Lewis once did?\n\nFor that matter has there been any evolution of the charity model?  Will people tuning in and donating learn the slightest fact or even misconception about MDA diseases?  Or has the nature of awareness movements and challenges for awareness changed the charityy model into even more ignorance about the disability than before?\n\nThese last questions I ask because\nA) recent awareness movements and challenges for awareness do not seem to encourage people to actually learn about what they are \"becoming aware of\"\nB) I cannot find a single person in the comment threads of the shared articles mentioning MD or other diseases, or commenting on other MDA campaigns that still happen, or anything slightly intelligent.  It is mostly putting down Kevin Hart, or backing him up, or lamenting the loss of entertainment in previous telethons u/braindeadzombie is absolutely right.  I do not object to charitable causes in general but the way that charity is most often perpetuated (especially charity for disabilities) is through emotional blackmail that paints the disabled as helpless, non-contributing members of society, baggage that everyone else is responsible for, not valid people, etc\n\nOther reasons for my ambivalence in a new comment to the post I generally lean in this direction, and definitely detest the religious and charity models of disability more than anything, and the 2 overlap quite a bit.\n\nBut...I have also benefited from the MDA. I went to MDA camp until I was 16 and enjoyed it for a healthier social environment than I felt at school.  I cannot count how many tire changes and battery changes they have bought for me.  I have a backup manual chair thanks to the MDA.\n\nI believe in the cause and the aide it provides, and I do not think that people now should be deprived of the help just because I am more socially educated than when I used them for help.  I just do not believe in the methods.", "Spinraza and insurance  There is some info in this article regarding how US  insurance companies are looking at Spinraza. \n\nThey want to make sure it works for the individual patient and are prioritizing some patients over others. \n\nIt is as new to them as it is to us so things may change with new info and/or some lobbying by the SMA community. \n Well damn.

What has your insurance said? Will it cover it? UPDATE: I met with my neurologist about a month ago and got the paperwork started.

Did your insurance pay any of the testing?", "This is where I, a 21 year old gal with a rare neuromuscular disease, share my scattered thoughts, as well as my progress with the use of Spinraza. Care to join me? ", "Caution for Zolgensma as above-normal levels of SMN shown to cause neuronal toxicity  What does this mean? It is hard for me to comprehend. So anyone who took zolgensma is basically screwed? Zolgensma consists of the SMN gene driven by a very strong promoter, not the endogenous promoter. That means the amount of SMN protein generated in the neuron would likely be reflective of that promoter choice (above-normal). \n\nGiven this data in this Nature Neuroscience paper there may be a similar SMN limit in humans and therefore we may similar pathology in human patients who receive Zolgensma. Too early to know for sure but certainly not a good sign. ELI5 So I understand the basics of Zolgensma and with what you are saying it honestly still does not make much sense to me. \n\nIs it saying that there is a ceiling on how long that SMN1 gene can go for and it might basically fizzle out with age?  Zolgensma is not just the SMN1 gene. It consists of the SMN1 gene and an artificial promoter. The promoter can be though of light a dimmer switch on a light. The stronger it is the more  SMN protein gets generated per second. Since Zolgensma uses an ultra strong artificial promoter it may lead to above normal levels of SMN protein in the cell. And this paper may suggest that that could lead to problems. Ok I think I am beginning to be on the same page. That is really interesting and scary. It leaves me with two thoughts/questions which there may not be answers to yet. \n\n1) I wonder if supplemental therapies like Spinraza or Risdiplam would help individuals down the road who received Zolgensma.  \n\n2) Does the paper go into detail about what kind of problems specifically? May actually argue that you would not want to use Spinraza or Risdiplam as that would increase SMN even more. Although I believe the rationale for added these therapies was because Zolgensma will not get into ever neuron and therefore some motor neurons would be unprotected (which then could be rescued by Spinraza or Risdiplam). Oh wow! That is so interesting. I wonder if this has been posted in the SMA Support System FB page. I am curious to see what everyone says/thinks as well. \n\nCan I ask... what is your relationship to the SMA community? Thanks for the explanation. Really pulled it off. So zolgensma should probably only be used on strictly type 1 sma overall? Interesting The paper was specifically assessing a Zolgensma-like viral gene therapy. They saw neuronal loss and motor dysfunction. \n\nShould Zolgensma be used for any SMA subtype if it could potentially lead to neuron loss in humans? That seems to be the opposite of what the treatment is trying to accomplish. \u201c Unlike approaches aimed at correcting splicing of endogenous SMN2 and therefore subject to an intrinsic limit of SMN induction, the potential for SMN expression beyond physiological levels is uniquely associated with AAV9-SMN gene therapy.\u201d Have you experience with risdiplam? Too much of anything is bad First off, the viral vector they used has a different promoter for the SMN gene (promoter determines how much the gene is made). Here we have GUSB while Zolgensma uses the CBA promoter, so I would advise caution in drawing conclusions about a totally different genetic construct. A paper this study is largely expanding off of (Hinderer et al., 2018) also had different conditions (different promoter and viral titre) than is used in patients. There will be different expression levels of SMN and this is not addressed in the paper, which is sus. Also, the mice in this study display defects early in life with the gene therapy, which we have not observed in humans. This also appears to be a different titre (concentration) of virus than used in human patients. Results from one experimental condition should not be generalized to different conditions.  **Most importantly**, the toxicity defects shown in the figure in the preview are WILD-TYPE ANIMALS! **As in they already have SMN**! You **cannot** say that adding more SMN to neurons that already have SMN is toxic, so therefore neurons **without** SMN might have the same toxicity with added SMN! It is like saying 1+1=2, so 0+1 must also =2! \n\nThey state here that milder SMA cases might be more likely to have this neurotoxicity due to higher levels of SMN, but do not provide any evidence to back this up. There are mouse models of mild SMA, but these were not used here? Again, sus.\n\n\\- a graduate student with SMA researching SMA &gt;Here we have GUSB while Zolgensma uses the CBA promoter, so I would advise caution in drawing conclusions about a totally different genetic construct.\n\nThis is correct. And the authors directly addressed this point:\n\n&gt;While different from the hybrid cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken \u03b2-actin (CBA) promoter present in the FDA-approved AAV9-SMN vector for SMA gene therapy9,16, GUSB is a weaker promoter than CBA for AAV-mediated gene expression in vivo.\n\nGiven this clarification their experiment is even **more alarming** as the Zolgensma promoter would expected to be **even stronger** than the promoter that they used (read: more SMN expression).\n\n&gt;**Most importantly**, the toxicity defects shown in the figure in the preview are WILD-TYPE ANIMALS! **As in they already have SMN**! You **cannot** say that adding more SMN to neurons that already have SMN is toxic, so therefore neurons **without** SMN might have the same toxicity with added SMN! It is like saying 1+1=2, so 0+1 must also =2!   \n&gt;  \n&gt;They state here that milder SMA cases might be more likely to have this neurotoxicity due to higher levels of SMN, but do not provide any evidence to back this up. There are mouse models of mild SMA, but these were not used here? Again, sus.\n\nI am very confused by your interpretation. A SMA mouse model was used throughout the paper. All major findings were shown in this model. Wild-type mice were used as a control to confirm major findings seen with over expression of SMN in SMA mice. Additionally it seems like they used the wild-type mice as a tool to better parse the pathological mechanism of supra-physiologic SMN levels. Regardless the motor neuron loss/motor dysfunction in SMA mice treated with a Zolgensma-like gene therapy is concerning and we certainly need to be investigating whether or not this is happening in human patients treated with Zolgensma. I am unaware of GUSB being used in other viral vectors. It is predicted to have lower levels, but I would personally have liked a western to compare the two promoters.\n\nFor Figure 1F-K, Figure 2A-C, and Figures 3-5, the neurotoxic metrics are all in wild-types given the drug. Yes, they used an SMA model to show the virus corrected phenotypes in the beginning, but all other figures say WT. They also used the severe delta7 model, which recapitulates SMA type I. There are mouse models for milder cases and these should have been used for analyzing the supra-physiologic SMN levels instead of wild-type. Wild-type humans will not be getting the gene therapy, so why did they look at wild-type mice? In the discussion, they state the implications the study has for milder forms of SMA. Why not use a model for these forms then? \n\nTo your point about still seeing motor neuron loss/motor dysfunction in SMA mice given the gene therapy (Figures 1A-E), SMN is needed in utero for proper neural development, but we cannot safely give the gene therapy in utero (at least that is what we have observed with a large mammal model). There are still SMA-like defects present because SMN was not there to stop all of said defects when they occurred. This therapy was also given at a lower titre than the Zolgensma studies, so it could be less effective at rescuing. \n\nI agree that this needs to be studied, but I am skeptical of how Livio and George went about this and their interpretations. &gt;I am unaware of GUSB being used in other viral vectors. It is predicted to have lower levels, but I would personally have liked a western to compare the two promoters.\n\nIts widely accepted that these viral-based, artificial promoters lead to far greater expression levels relative to endogenous promoters. I am not aware of any data to suggest the opposite but perhaps you know this literature and can add a citation to the discussion.\n\n&gt;Wild-type humans will not be getting the gene therapy, so why did they look at wild-type mice? In the discussion, they state the implications the study has for milder forms of SMA. Why not use a model for these forms then?\n\nWild-type humans do not get the disease but context is important here. This study was designed to investigate a potential mechanism of neuronal loss/motor dysfunction seen in prior studies and preclinical trials. If SMN is truly toxic at supra-physiologic levels then you would expect enhanced pathology in wild-type mice vs SMA models that start with sub-physiologic SMN expression. Additionally studying this process in wild-type mice would eliminate confounders (ie motor neuron loss/motor dysfunction) seen in SMA models. I agree the data has limitations but every study has weaknesses. This data now provides a fantastic future direction to validate these findings in additional models (ie mild SMA animals models).\n\n&gt;This therapy was also given at a lower titre than the Zolgensma studies, so it could be less effective at rescuing.\n\nThe recommended dosage of Zolgensma is 1.1 \u00d7 10\\^14 vg/ kg which is comparable to the 5 \u00d7 10\\^10 vg / g or 5x10\\^13 vg / kg dose used in this study.", "A boy from my hometown in need for help.

Hope they can come to an agreement :/ From twitter... *Norway also say no to Spinraza \"we will say yes to the drug, but we are going to have to say no to the price\"* If that is Norway's position, that they will approve the drug for public consumption but not pay for it, it will be interesting to see how Biogen reacts. \n\nI have zero idea how Biogen will deal with this in Europe but in the US, at least when Spinraza was first roled out, they had a term called \"functionally uninsured\". What that meant was that after the FDA approved Spinraza if a person with SMA was insured by a company that refused to pay for it, and the person dealing treatment had exhausted all appeals and avenues to get their insurer to pay for it, Biogen would essentially give it to the patient, subject to some caveats. The idea was they would make the patient jump through hoops and hit every deep pocket they could, but once they did that Biogen would get them the drug. \n\nI hope something can be worked out here. So frustrating.  Me too. \n\n*sigh*", "This kid rocks!  * full disclosure, he is my kid ;) What an inspiration! I am so glad Spinraza has been making such a difference. My Dad has Type 3 and has lived a full, great life! Love to hear about people like your dad thanks! This made me super happy to see/read - it is super awesome that you are seeing results! Also good to put faces to names! Glad you like! Thank you!", "Toning belt ", "Reddit, my niece was diagnosed with SMA Type 1 and we desperately need all the help we can get to raise awareness to her cause. ", "Spinraza approved in Israel!  Nice! Any links to the source of your information? I cannot find anything using Google :(. Every article on this subject is in Hebrew. ( Nice one Israel!", "I am building a voice control module for hospital beds and need your feedback I am working on a product that will be helpful for disabled people (like myself) and I am looking for some feedback.\n\nI have SMA and as a result have almost no muscle strength or dexterity. I am still able to use a computer mouse and drive my power wheelchair using a low-force joystick, but that is about it. I use an electric hospital bed and it has become difficult for me to use the standard pendent control. I have a hard time holding it and pressing the buttons. Last year I created an interface for the bed using a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. It allows me to control the bed using Dragon voice control on my desktop computer. It works really well for me, and has been a big quality-of-life improvement. I am now working on a simpler and more reliable version that is controlled via Amazon's Alexa device (\"Alexa, raise the head of the bed.\") that I can make available to other disabled people.\n\nIt will not require much set up (plug-in a few cables, use your cell phone to get it onto your Wi-Fi network and link it to your Alexa account), and you will still have the use of the standard pendent control for your bed.\n\nWhich brings me to my first question: would anybody be interested in such a device? The version I am developing now will work with any hospital bed that uses the same Invacare pendent (I think the one mine uses is very common, but I do not think they are universal). I may be able to develop other versions to work with other hospital beds if there is interest.\n\nDo you already have some device that solves this problem for you? I know there are environmental control modules that support voice recognition. Has anyone built a hospital bed interface yet?\n\nWould you have any worries are concerns about using such a device? Is there any aspect that seems dangerous or problematic?\n\nAre there any features that you would like to see incorporated in it?\n\nAny other thoughts or comments? I am really at the beginning stages of this and appreciate any feedback at all, positive or negative. Feel free to post your comments here, or send me a private message if you prefer.\n\nThank you very much for reading this. I look forward to hearing what everyone has to say!\n OMG that would be so amazing! I do not have any concerns as long as there are no positions that would be dangerous in case the systems bugs....like the bed would not turn upside down out fo the blue right? Who\u00b4s working with you on that? let me know if you need help This is not the feedback your looking for because I do not have SMA, but I have to say you are a genius and this sounds fantastic.  Great idea! If you have not looked into patenting and marketing this you might want to.  I have been using my prototype for a year now. It only bugged once, causing the bed to go all the way up and the motor kept running. We just unplugged it and rebooted it and it was fine. The version I am developing will be more robust and easier to install.\n\nThe way it is designed, you still have full use of the normal pendent control that came with the bed. It continues to work as normal. There is also an on/off button on my device that disables it in the event of a problem.\n\nI am working on the project with a friend right now. We are pretty far along and have not run into any serious problems. What I need now mostly is feedback to make sure we create an item that people will want to use. If you think it is something that would be beneficial to you and that you would use, it would be super helpful if you answered a few questions for me. Feel free to reply here or send me a private message if you prefer.\n\nWhat type of hospital bed to you have? My device, as it is designed right now, will work with Invacare beds that use a particular type of pendent control. Depending on the response, I may develop other versions for other brands of bed.\n\nHow do you adjust your bed now? Can you do it yourself, or do you have to get somebody else to do it?\n\nDo you have an Alexa device already? Thank you for the comment. It is always nice to hear something positive. I have considered patenting it, but for a variety of reasons decided not to pursue that. I will definitely market it though. My primary goal is to get it to everyone that can benefit from it. If it works out well, I will look into developing other assistive devices.", "Who is not getting Spinraza and why? I am working on a project. I want to know who is keepibg Spinraza from the people that need it. And I will stipulate that if Biogen priced it at $125.00 instead of $125,000, access would not be a problem. But that is not what this post is about. \n\nWhat I am looking for are the government agencies and  insurance companies who are saying No.  I would also like to know if there is any particular people who are being difficult. A specific member of parliment on an important committee, or the head of a particular insurnace company that does not want to pay for Spinraza, for example. \n\nSpinraza works and is a life saving and life altering drug.  It is not perfect but for now it is all we have got.  The people witholding it from those who need it should be ashamed of themselves. \n\nSo whi's up for some public shaming? I know this is not exactly what you asked, but I have not pursued getting it for myself (49-year-old with type 3). I have insurance that would probably cover it, but I have not seen enough evidence that it would help me to justify the risk, discomfort and cost. I suspect that I am not alone in this decision, but I am interested to see how others answer. This is going to sound like I work for Biogen (I do not) but having seen what it is done for my son I would tell anyone with SMA to get Spinraza if they can. \nDefinitely not a miracle cure. But it helps and I would say it works well enough to make it worth the risk, discomfort, and cost. \nI am not saying I would not make the same call you made if I was in your shoes though. If you are doing well and have made peace with SMA I can see why you would pass om Spinraza. Everyone has to make their own best call when it comes to their own situation. \nMy beef is with the people not giving it to the people who want it, and the parents who want it for their children. Anyone who tries keeping Spinraza from people who want it should go take a warm bath with a hot toaster.  I live in Ontario and at my age (25) they do not consider it to be worth the cost plus they say it would never work on someone my age \n\nThe oldest person I know of in Ontario that got it was 7 and they convinced their insurance company to pay for it I am on disability so it is a 100% no I will NEVER have access to it and I am still angry  That is what I am talking about, thank you. My son was 11 when he first got Spinraza. It is been over a year since his first shot and it is still working. Demomstrably, objectively, documented, working. \n\nHe gets a physical therapy evaluation before every injection.  The numbers have all been going up. And there are people in the US in their 50's who are getting it who say the same thing. \n\nTo cap coverage at 7 years old is idiotic. \n\nWould you mind sharing how things work in Canada?  Like who/what branch of the governmemt is responsible for you not getting Spinraza?\n I do not know much because I do not get access to it but  the Ontario health insurance plan (ohip) will only cover it for type 1 SMA and a VERY small percentage of type 2 so no type 3 coverage because they claim that it is not useful I am type 3 so it is not worth the cost \n\nI have tried since it is released to find a loop hole and get my hands on it but they have flat out told me that unless I pay for it myself I will not be getting it\n\nThis is the same thing I have heard from 3 other people who are around my age with type 3 and 1 girl with 2 but they claim at 12 she is too old for it to work \n\nIt is complete crap  I am from India, and its not available here...  Does India have goverment run healthcare or private insurance? Or both?\n\nI am learning things today lol\n\nLet us play the blame game. Whoever is responsible for witholding Spinraza needs to be called out.  Hey, 24pointbuck, just a quick heads-up:  \n**goverment** is actually spelled **government**. You can remember it by **n before the m**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Hey CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:  \nYour spelling hints are really shitty because they are all essentially \"remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word\".\n\nYou are useless.\n\nHave a nice day! My son has type 3 and it has been beyond \"useful\" so they are maggots for saying that. MAGGOTS. And it is not like Biogen, Cure SMA and the US FDA are keeping the data quiet.\n\nWho runs OHIP? Let us call them out.  \n\nWhen I was a kid my favorite movie was The Great Escape.  Ir's about Allied prisoners of war in WWII. There is a line from that movie that applies here. It was the sworn duty of the captured Allied soldoers to \"harass and confound the enemy to the best of their ability\".\n\nAnyone keeping Spinraza from people who want it and can benefit from it is the enemy.  So let us harass them as much as we can, within the bounds of the laws of our respective countries. \n\nCall  them out... Touch\u00e8 lol Ha! Mostly private insurance. I do not think they will support Spinraza. In any case, it needs to be available here for them here first, I think.  My guess is that the reason it is not available in India is that the party or parties responsible for payment have not been able to come to terms with Biogen. $125K is the asking price but like most things that is likely up for negotiation. \n\nMy suggestion would be to reach out directly to Biogen and ask them what is up.  I do not believe they would just not send it to India.  Also in Ontario (30 years old, Type III) - I was told the same thing by my doc (too old, would not work) - and I am okay with that for the time being. But I am excited to see where it goes and develops from here. Shoot me a DM - would love to connect with another Canadian. I know of a pharmaceutical supplier(ODAK ECZANE PHARMACY) that supplies spinraza( Nusinersen ) at a great discount. When i heard of this suppliers, i was like feeling skeptical to make a step in ordering the product for my son. I reached to the supplier and i was paranoid about the procedures i was told. \n\nDue to my son predicament, i had no choice than to give it a try. When i did, i received the package at home from the supplier via DHL. My son was administered the product and the results were great. \n\nI will advise you to do same.\n\nYou can pv \n\nI will definitely help you with directives to the supplier. Bullllllllll shit\nFuck off mate I personally dont have the 5q gen so my sma is not confirmed (like 5% of the sma patients are not comfirmed with the gen but are only assumed to have sma) Spinraza can be gotten without gov't approval  but you have to get it discreetly and off the records. My friend's daughter is so much better today thanks to Spinraza. She wasnt approved by Ministry of health to receive treatment so we had to buy it overseas and discreetly. We got it from Jan CO . You can reach them at \n\n(  JAN47584  \\*at\\* GMAIL \\*DOT\\* COM  ) and they will help you get it. They are disreet and reliable. They helped my friend's daughter and they can help you too.\n\nI dont know why some gov'ts keep this away from people A couple reasons. 1. It does not seem to work the greatest on adults. 2. I am pretty stable and happy right now and do not really feel like taking something with so much possible discomfort attached to it, that is not really even curing anything, for the rest of my life. I am more willing to wait for gene therapy options. That all makes sense. You lay out a sensible thought process as to why it is not right for you.  I have no issue with you or anyone else in your spot who comes to the same conclusion. \nMy issue is that it should be up to you, not someone else. Particularly when that someone else has little to no background or expertise in the field. And I really do not trust those people who say Spinraza should not be available because of concerns about safety and/or efficacy. The data is out there at this point, and I have seen it with my own eyes on the pediatric level.  It works for kids and anyone who says otherwise is talking garbage. \nYou may be right about the benefits being greater in children, from a certain point of view. The difference between a child being able to continue walking versus an adult being able to move their hands is huge.  But for some adults being able to move their hands means they can still work. So for them that is huge. Also the many children out there who have been getting Spinraza and benefitting from it will soon be adults, and I would like to see them be able to keep getting treatment. \nSo my position remains give the option to everybody. ", "Adult sisters with SMA getting Spinraza  \"When Geraci first started his medical studies in 1991, he said, doctors in his field were taught to help SMA patients pick out wheelchairs and ultimately plan for their deaths.\"\n\nJesus, what a charming fellow. \n\nI am sorry but I really cannot stand the way some medics talk about SMA. It is not a fantastic disease, let us not kid ourselves, but that has got to be one of the most exaggerated, flippant and insensitive things I have heard a doctor say in a while. And no, with the exception of SMA1, most top SMA specialists in the early 90s were optimistic about patient lifespan and quality of life. Do not know what rock he was living under at the time, what an asshat. Glad he was not my doctor :|\n\nI was told when I was about 10 or so that the only way I will find a partner was if they were willing to care for me, so I will probably never get married.

Muscle loss has not been dramatic - I am weaker now than when I started but its very hard to distinguish muscle loss from that versus just general SMA muscle loss. We decided on cypro because the alternative in Aus was spiro, which, as a diuretic, meaning more bathroom visits, would not have worked.\n\nFor estrogen I am on 100mcg patches - we went with patches to help avoid clotting issues.

It is awesome you already feel some symptoms of the drug making it is way into your body. I am truly happy for you. May I ask which country you are living in, how old are you, how you/your family could afford the high cost of the drug, and whether you took it with anaesthetic or sedative? Great stuff. So you have noticed a noticeable improvement? Fantastic news! I absolutely will. :) Indeed, I was even surprised myself as the doctor told me that I should not notice any change until after my second if not third loading dose. This drug is extremely liberating while at the same time confining. I do not mind answering questions with that said I am a 32-year-old with very strong type II symptoms however I am genetically type lll with three SMN2 markers; I walked until seven and then used a manual wheelchair until 13 when I received my first electric wheelchair. Thankfully I do live in the United States specifically on the West Coast so as far as it goes regarding the cost my insurance covers it completely without any question (this is one of the reasons I fight against a national health system in the United States). Now as to whether I did it with anesthetic or sedative it was done with a local anesthetic around the injection point and because I have had severe spinal issues in my past I was also semi-sedated with fentanyl (I was conscious and alert the entire time). I hope that answers your questions. Thanks! It is great to hear that the drug is effective even on older SMA patients such as yourself. What you said about your healthcare system in America is quite true, and one of the reasons why I have resigned myself to the fact that I will never have access to the therapy is because our government here in Singapore hates spending money on medical subsidies as they fear turning us into a welfare state.

Also have the philips you talked about, very easy to pack, no external battery you have to remember, looks good. \n\nBoth i have been very happy with What is this nippy clearway you speak off? Also, why do you need two separate cough assist machines?\n\nIs it safe to use the machine while lying down? I am mostly bedridden. This one: \n\nI am lucky enough to live in Denmark, so the hospital just gave me them. I have one in a backpack most of the time i use for when i am going out, and the other stands on a nightstand next to my workstation.\n\nYes i use mine when i lay down too, never had a problem, might be a bit overwhelming at first when you lay down\n\n I see. Is there an approximate price you can give me? Any features that are must have for us? Any safety precautions? I have no clue what such a machine cost, i imagine they are pretty expensive. \n\nNo, it is a pretty simple machine, blow in, blow out. That is it.\n\nDo not use them if you are drunk and on the verge of puking, it wont end well &gt; I have no clue what such a machine cost, i imagine they are pretty expensive.\n\nThey seem too expensive, going to blow a huge hole in my parent's budget. :(\n\n&gt; Do not use them if you are drunk and on the verge of puking, it wont end well\n\nSpeaking from experience? Hahaha.  If they are that expensive that it is not an option, try and see if they still make the pegaso cough assistant, one motherfucker of a machine that i used to use many years ago, might be able to find an old one laying around. But really, the hospital should give you one.\n\nYep, had to change the whole machine &gt; Pegaso cough assistant\n\nWill check.\n\n&gt; But really, the hospital should give you one.\n\nHow does that work, is it government funded? I do not think we have anything like that here in India, but I will have to check.  In denmark at least, the hospital gives you the equiment.

Everyone with SMA is different, so your best bet would be to ask the parents directly. Feeding and helping to go to the bathroom are common things that SMAers need assistance with. It is mostly going to depend on what the parents want, nurse or companion. Type I might be more care intensive but it will depend on how managed everything is.  This is not an exact answer to your question but to the extent you follow any of the major religions and/or believe in karma, helping a child with SMA is a beautiful thing with rewards way beyond financial ones. \n\nIt is also a chance to, hopefully, be in on something historic. The first ever treatment for SMA was aproved by the US FDA in December. So you might see a child with SMA do things that no child in similar circumstances has ever done before. Again, a beautiful thing. \n\nHaving said that it could be a lot of work.  Also kids get attached so if you are not in it for at least the medium haul, if not the long haul, it might not be the right thing to do. \n\nBest of luck!", "The life time solution ", "Anxiety of sma Hey guys i am a hypochondriac and HA sufferer \nDiscovered sma and thoughts started running is this condition only affects by birth or can onset later in life? I feel bit weakness in my spine and creating fears can anyone shed some light. \n\nThanks! Most types present at birth or early on in development. There is Type 3 which usually presents in older patients around 8-15. Type 4 also exists but does not present till very later in life and has almost no effect on your life. Also, weakness in the spine is not a symptom of SMA progression. If you had it you would lose strength in your outer extremities first like your legs and arms. I am pretty sure you are not affected by SMA You do not have sma, you would know.... I think you would benefit greatly speaking to a psychiatrist instead of worrying yourself about this kind of stuff OP. You do not have SMA, but you do have hypochondria and health anxiety. Get help from a psychiatrist. I know what you are going through is rough and I hope you feel better. I feel weakness in my arms and legs but i feel these are from my anxiety which used to be on a severe amount of level anyways i guess you are right brother i must be overthinking! The mind is a very powerful thing. Trust me, if you had SMA you would know it. The best thing you can do is to seek some therapy or mental help for your health anxiety.", "Friend was recently diagnosed with SMA type 3 She is taking it really hard but what is the actual prognosis? Especially considering the fact that she is 22 and has had no symptoms at all as of yet. She only found out she has SMA because of a random genetic test.\nWhat are the chances that she will continue to be able to walk normally for the rest of her life?\nWill she eventually need to use a wheelchair?\nAre there any promising cures of the horizon? With that late of a diagnosis and onset it sounds more like SMA 4, may want to double check you did not get mixed up.\n\nMuch like 3 though, the course and severity depend on how many extra smn-2 copies she has to compensate for missing smn-1 genes.  My understanding is that many with 4 have symptoms that 3s do in childhood, end up walking or standing from a sitting position a bit funny from adapting to loss of motor control and muscle weakness.\n\nYour friend should follow up with her neurologist for prognosis though, and whether or not they recommend further appointments with physical therapists, dieticians or pulmonologist. I think she has 3 SMN2 copies. Is number of SMN2 copies actually a good indicator of the potential severity of the disease?  I am about to marry a type 2. She is carrying our first child. We  have a Honda Odyssey and an f150 we both use regularly. We have three cats, two kittens, and a dog. We are also about to re-model our home that we are bargaining to rent to own with our landlord. We are hoping that after the pregancy we can start one of two new gene therapy treatments. She is also 25 and we met 5 years ago. we have been through some rough stuff but we never let stop us from living a decent life. Have your friend look into both Spinraza and Evrysdi. One is an injection that you get in your spine ever 4 months or so and the other is an oral medication you take daily after a meal, the only real drawbacks are the method of administration. My Fiancee will not ever walk again, but your freind stands a very real chance to literally stay standing. I do not want to get hopes up beyond reality but I have close contact with specialist who have seen children who would have never been able to sit up progress to the point where they are walking and running. The fewer copies of the backup gene SMN2 the more sever the case, though the number of copies does not directly reflect the Type of SMA.", "China\u2019s negotiation on Spinraza price, 2021 ", "How is everyone?

It does not have to be SMA-related (or it can be, if you want).\n Yes, I too had gotten used to the increased frequency of posts, and checked the sub everyday for new posts. \n\nFor some weeks now, I have been reading investment books.

That is my first choice for an internship too, but I might have to take what I can find. I am getting really bored without a goal.  \n\nI will start looking into setting up a Discord channel.

Have also arranged from my dad to take her to 'strictly come dancing'. My poor father!\n\nLike /u/Preformerr I dabble in stocks and shares. Have traded since the 2008 crash, but now that I have finished work I am looking to do it more aggressively so I can use the dividends as income...\n\nWatched the Tick on Prime and have just started watching Preacher, which is surprisingly good so far. Just finished reading '( which was really good but kind of melancholic, so need to get me a bit of comedy or sci-fi next :) Awesome explanation and good idea, thank you! Good luck, applying for grad school can feel super daunting. What are you applying for? Fingers crossed that your exams go well tomorrow, I always have a lot of anxiety around anything pulmonary so I feel you. What is your graduate degree on?\n\nI have mostly just been working to be honest, although have been feeling pretty demotivated lately so trying to figure out a way to inspire myself into being excited about what I am working on! Hellooo, I am all right thanks, just chugging along really!\n\nAw, sounds like your mum's going to have a fantastic birthday! I love the sewing box and the strictly idea is brilliant too (although maybe not for your dad, ha)!\n\nI am really interested to hear if you or /u/Preformerr have any advice about where to start with reading up on that kind of thing. I have been thinking about it myself for a while but I am completely clueless about anything related to stocks/shares and have always found it a bit overwhelming. My dad tried to teach me some basics when I was a teen but I was too busy being angsty (or whatever it is teens are) to pay attention. \n\nPreacher actually is surprisingly good, as you say - although I have not seen the latest season yet. I have been watching The Defenders on Netflix but have not been super impressed. Also been looking for some comedy as I have needed a bit of a laugh lately - have been watching a lot of \"would I lie to you\" because David Mitchell always managed to slay me. Also discovered some stand-up by Joe Lycett. It is kind of silly stuff but I really enjoyed it. I am hoping to be able to get properly into going and watching stand-up, getting a car soon so should finally be easier to get around! I just started recently, so I cannot give much advice. I first read *Learn to Earn* (absolute basics), and then *One Up on Wall Street* (value investing philosophy and basics), and just started *Beating the Street* (I heard that it is about the practical application), which is the last book in the series authored by Peter Lynch. \n\nI do not even have the very basics down yet, so trying to cover those first. I was supposed to start studying this at 13, but it was too overwhelming for me. I regret not learning this back then, and I am almost 20 now. It is better if you start sooner, as it gives your money more time to work for you. You do not have to gamble with real money at first, there are several websites/apps which let you do virtual trading.\n\nLooking forward to /u/wheeliedave's reply on this.  Thank you, I think I will actually have a look at those books, see if I can get my head around the basics. Good to know about the virtual trading, might hit you up on the names of the websites if I get past the basics! Thank you! It will be my second masters. I am applying for a masters in social work.  Yes, chugging along describes it perfectly :)\n\nI started with ( book and then just basically searched the web to expand upon it. There are people who try to predict where the stock will be based on technical indicators, or fundamentalists who just use actual information about the company. If you can just learn a little bit of both  you are good to start having a go! It can be a bit of a rollercoaster of a ride tho and can seriously fuck up your day sometimes! I lost 7 grand once. Was not a happy chappy. I use  Pretty good so far!\n\nDo not think I will bother with The Defenders as I have been over Marvel'd a bit! David Mitchell is a comic genius! Love them both in ( scene :)\n\nAre you getting your car to drive yourself? What are you getting?  Great info, thanks! I would definitely not be happy if I lost 7 grand, that would fuck me up for more than a day :(\n\nAh that scene has me in hysterics - \"Stop! It is going down the cracks!\". And poor Olivia Coleman at the end! \n\nAnd yeah, the intention is to drive myself. It has taken a good year to get to this point but it is nearly finished going through its adaptations for all the complicated controls. It is a VW Transporter. I am kind of terrified to be honest but when I went for the test drive a year ago I actually really enjoyed driving so I am hoping the terror will fade?? My instructor had to keep telling me that I do not need to pull over every time I see another car and that I am entitled to my bit of road so....errr....we will see how it goes! You rock Stormcloud! I was always far too much of a coward to learn to drive... It was always far easier to just get a taxi :P Will you get to drive it using a joystick or do you have to strength to use the steering wheel? Are you getting it on motability? Yeah it is all on motability. They have been really good to me so far. Initially I was going to go for a car without any of the drive-from-chair adaptations, just one that my carer could drive for me. But a friend of mine with SMAII has been driving for a few years and he sort of put my mind at ease.\n\nHonestly though we will see if I actually have the guts to drive 90% of the time! I may decide to chicken out and just tell my carer to drive (although the current one does not have a license). I am so very nervous about it working out. \n\nIt is all done by joystick (two joysticks actually, one for accelerating and breaking and one for turning - which takes some getting used to). But you can stick a steering wheel in if you want someone with full use of their arms to drive you around! Hey Pref, you are right about it being overwhelming! I have tried the daytrading thing but it was far too risky for my liking. Playing for the long game and taking profits when you can is a lot less likely to cause a heart attack.\n\n\n\nI have long-term holds that i skim if they get to 40% profit  and then just leave them to their own devices. I tend to have at least 15 of these as when one sector goes down another one usually goes up so it evens itself out. And then I have some risky ones... ones that will either skyrocket, or go bust :)\n\nMy only advice after doing it all this is\n\n1. Do not be too greedy, a profit it is a profit after all.\n1. Do not panic and sell if you are sitting on a paper loss. Things can quickly turn around. I have one share that is \u00a33000 down but I am fairly sure it is good company so it will get back to its price one day...\n1. Sometimes it is better to sit back and just ignore them... If I had of just kept some of the shares that I had bought after the financial crash, I would be a very rich man by now :(\n\nGood luck dude! That sounds awesome. Is it too geeky to say, because of the joysticks, it sounds like you are flying an x-wing or something?! If you get a chance would it be possible to send me a picture of the setup in the car? I would love to see it :) Haha not geeky at all, that is definitely how it feels. I will send you some photos as soon as it arrives, will be a month or two until then though! Master of Science in Computer Information Systems &amp; Business Analytics. I am eager to finish my degree so I can find a nice job (hopefully), and hopefully find an online teaching position. This is what motivates me at the moment. Remember to take a break from work here and there to avoid getting burned out. Thanks for your tips from the other comment! \n\nDo you think reading the book you linked can be helpful for the non-beginner? I have a lot of holes in my fundamental understanding, mainly the parts which are related to accounting like the financial sheets, ratios, and their analysis. But I like to think that I have most of the other basics down. \n\nI know I need to be looking up stuff a lot, but it is kind of troublesome from mobile... so I tend to prefer reading books instead. \n\nDo you have any other favourite books?  That sounds great and super employable. And thanks, I will definitely try. Good luck with your tests today! &gt; Do you think reading the book you linked can be helpful for the non-beginner?\n\nProbably not, but once you have a basic grasp of the fundamentals I would not bother looking into it any further TBH. This may sound a bit cavalier but I just look at what the brokers say, they are the ones who have degrees in business finance. If they say a company has strong fundamentals I then just usually wait until a good buying opportunity shows itself.\n\nSo, for example, I have ( at the blue line. Its a strong company and according to all the broker/journos is not going to collapse in flames any time soon... it is currently bouncing between a ceiling and support and as you can see 1520 is at the moment a support. It is also quite a strong support because it has already bounced up once or twice already. \n\nIf all goes well, it will hopefully bounce up to at least the 1586 ceiling, or maybe up to the 1702 one. If it does I can sell my \u00a34000 pounds worth of shares and make, say \u00a3300-600. Take off stamp duty and charges and I am left with at least \u00a3200 profit and that is still 5% which is better then you are going to get from the bank.\n\nAlternatively, if it falls down to the 1400 support I will probably buy more when it gets there so I have an average of about 1450. You then have to wait for it to go back up to the ceiling again. Unfortunately you might have to wait quite awhile...\n\nThe only downside to this is that you need large chunks of cash to play with and if something catastrophic does happen, you stand to lose a lot of money.\n\nAlternatively, just buy a shitload into a tax-free account  and forget about it for 10 years :)\n\nTL;DR Shares are scary and fun at the same time... Hmm. That kind of strategy *could* be okay for someone without time, I guess. But it feels to me like the worst of both worlds combined (Self research &amp; Mutual Funds). This is just my opinion, and I do not mean any offense by this. But please allow me to tell you why I do not like following online calls. \n\nAs far as I know, the stock analysts only have to be right about 70% of the times, and they do not actually care about your money - in which case getting a mutual fund seems much better. Even if you are half-doing your own technical analysis, simply put you are just trying to predict the future based on the current trend and past performance - and no one has been able to do that consistently enough. Betting my money on someone who does not even care about it is too much risk for me, and doing that for only about 2-3% extra seems unreasonable. \n\nFor that I like fundamental analysis more - if the company itself is good and undervalued compared to the stock price, the price is bound to rise sooner or later. \n\nAlso, following random calls will make you miss most multibaggers, which are only made when you hold on to stocks even after getting some profits. People  sell their stocks after some profit as they do not want to lose what they have already gained. Here, it helps if you have a solid understanding of the company itself and know that it can grow much more. When you know your company is good, you can hold on to your stocks even when the price is falling, only to buy more when the price hits a low. \n\nOf course, you will definitely have to study a lot to be able to evaluate companies; but once you are done, the knowledge stays with you and you only have to allot a fixed time for research in your weekly schedule (one to two hours should be enough). \n\nPeter Lynch says in *One Up on Wall Street* that your profession gives you a significant edge at finding promising new companies, compared to the average stock analyst. For example, a doctor will notice it much faster when a particular drug or medical equipment is popular compared to an analyst who is just playing with charts or numbers. Obviously, it does not automatically mean that the doctor should immediately go and buy the shares of that company - but it gives him a starting point to investigate more. And remember: multibaggers are made from relatively unknown stocks. If then after a lot of research he thinks that it is a great company, it is reasonable to invest in it. If his research is on point, and he keeps checking the company's story (he should sell it if it is taking a permanent downturn), there is not a lot of risk in it, even if it is a relatively small company.\n\nNormally, an analyst would have found this company after it has completed it is main uprun and mostly caught up with it is true valuation. There are too many stocks in this world, and even with their fancy degrees they cannot afford to do very in depth research of each and every stock. So the research they give us (at least the reports available for the small investors, institutions can get more access) is not supposed to be that deep. Would you bet your money on such a multibagger recommendation when you know nothing about the actual company? Those are smaller and have more risk.  And that is why some people like fundamentals and some people are chartists. There are no hard and fast rules, just find whatever you are comfortable with and that makes you some money. I might get caught out one day but it works for me so far! Besides, that is just one of the ways I dabble, i currently have UKOG.L at 400% up, so am not adverse to a bit of research and multi-baggers :)\n\n Nice! Good luck to you.  Good luck to us both :)", "/r/SPINALMUSCULARATROPHY Personal Posting About Your Medication Experience (Oral or Injection) Hello everyone!\n\nWith the recent options for new medications regarding people with spinal muscular atrophy I thought it would be interesting for people to post their journey, results, or even personal stories regarding the medication. By doing that I think it would be important to establish a few guidelines, not necessarily rules that you have to abide by, but suggestions that would benefit the readers as well as protecting the posters from people who may have issues with the results. Not that I think anybody's in danger but the internet is a wild place so we should think about protecting those who are willing to submit their experience.\n\nFirst off, why would this be necessary?\n\nLet me start by saying it is a fascinating time to be alive. The option of medications for the treatment spinal muscular atrophy have been a long time coming. When I was a kid that did not seem like anything that would be possible but now that I am older it seems to be picking up quite a bit of steam and people are interested in what is going on. Specifically people who are also suffering from spinal muscular atrophy. Personally I have gone through quite the journey to actually get the first available drug and now I am working switching to the second. During my experience trying to get the first drug it was basically a nightmare. Between the insurance companies and the state insurance, mix that in with the fact that the drug is insanely expensive there is a lot of hoops to jump through. And yes this is my story, it coincides with what I have heard several other people say. Because of this I think it would be very valuable for users here to not just share information but share their experiences with the drug itself. I have gone through Facebook and was not a fan of how it was handled. It really felt like a fight for social media exposure of whoever wants to post anything to gain some kind of following, being less about what is going on with the actual treatment and more about the people getting exposure. Not only that there was a lot of misinformation or frankly questions and answers that were completely ridiculous. I believe that Reddit could be a better place for a straightforward approach to people sharing their stories as well as information to help others in the same situation. All this information is highly relatable for people with SMA and because of that I think is highly valuable information. You could definitely be helping your peers and that should be the hallmark or at least a very necessary reason for doing this.\n\nSo what I am going to say is I encourage you, if you feel like sharing your story and your experience either getting, taking, or switching between medications, or anything in relation to post here. If you are like me and you do not like the type, dictate ( and pasted into your post. That being said I think it is important to protect those people willing to share information. So here are a few suggestions or guidelines that I think would be valuable to anybody who is going to post about their journey and results through taking either the oral or injectable medication. Again this is totally optional but I think it will benefit everyone seeking out this information.\n\nSuggestion:\n\n**Titling**\n\n* Let us start with titling your posts, if you are going to post something long-term like a diary of what is happening along with persistent updates (we can definitely change it) but let us start with \"Medication Progress\" and then title it however you see fit. So for instance if I was going to make a submission and follow up with my experience taking whichever drug the title of my submission would be something along the lines of \"Medication Progress - Scotch's experience on SMA drugs\". This is just a suggestion, but I think if we are able to come up with a similar titling scheme that if somebody were to use the site and go through the search function they would easily be able to come up with hopefully a few people's experience taking the drugs and be able to relate to that information or maybe learn something. \n\n**Posting Your Story**\n\n* Instead of making multiple posts consider making one post and using the edit function. Every time you want to add an update consider adding an edit, dating that edit, and adding the new information from your experience in a paragraph. We will try to add everybody's submissions to the sidebar to make sure that they are easily accessible do anyone who is quickly looking to see other people's experiences with medications. If you plan on sharing your story via text post submission please make a post below in response to this and we will make a list of links starting here of people who are going to be doing this. \n\n**Personal information**\n\n* Try not to post any personal information that you are not comfortable with. That means if you do not want to say your name, do not. If you do not want to say where you live, do not. If you are not comfortable with give away certain information do not feel you must.\n\n**Medication**\n\n* I am pretty sure everybody knows the names of the two drugs that are available for spinal muscular atrophy. However I think it would just be better just to go by the oral version or the injectable version. The reason I say this is because I do not want anybody to get into legal trouble or something regarding libel. Again the internet is wild place I do not want anybody to get in trouble.\n\n**Your Feedback**\n\n* These are just off the top. If anybody has ideas or suggestions for ways to either format or convey information better through everybody's format when they post their story please put suggestions below.\n\n**You made it this far!**\n\nIf you went this far, thank you so much! I do plan on following up on this as closely as possible so if you do have any information that you would like to share or questions about how things are going to be posted please either post here or send me a message and I will do whatever I can to get back to you.\n\nThanks for reading and good luck! I am going to make a post. I started Risdiplam (oral liquid, aka Evrysdi) on Friday. I will cover as much as I can.\n\nI am curious what turned you off of Facebook. I have not seen a lot of attention seekers (other than one woman who tried to claim it would give you cancer since it changes your DNA which is both wrong and dangerous) Awesome, that is great to hear.\n\nWhat turn me off to Facebook was when there was this post going around that somehow Spinraza causes seizures. Now I went to two different doctors to ask for their opinion in terms of what would be potentially causing this or what the deal was. Both doctors, both of them being neurologists, came to the same conclusion that it was probably - obviously they cannot 100% prove it - but they both said that it was something having to do with the patient without Spinraza. Meaning it was something pre-existing condition that what is causing a seizure which coincidentally was around the time that they were on the medication. Unfortunately because it does not seem like a whole lot of research goes into a lot of anything regarding Facebook besides the routing out of your personal information and selling it to third parties, is that something as simple as correlation will all of a sudden be true. That is what scares me. That turned me off completely. Because anybody who is hoping for some information from what seemed to be a fairly big community could be very much affected by something as simple as this post believing that by taking Spinraza you can also be having seizures as a result. Fortunately I had Facebook back in the Glory Days when you had to have a college email and so I have seen the changes. I ended up getting off around 2010 and fired it back up a couple years ago (fall of 2018) when I started Spinraza just to see what the communities were like and at first it was great...but is that wears on you just see a lot of self-promotion and not a lot of substance when it comes to all the posts.

Personally I do it too, I do Twitch for my World of Warcraft addiction and used to do a YouTube thing but it really seemed like that was a lot of people were just after a social media following. I guess when you get old all that stuff wears thin.\n\nAnyway, thank you for making a submission of your medication Experience. I hope for all the people that find their way to this sub it is valuable. I am going to try to make sure that everybody who has made a submission gets on a list that is posted on the sidebar. Out of everything that is happening in the world of SMA, these drugs are easily the top of what is happening to our people. How are people? That sounds kind of weird. But yeah, I am going to try to make that happen. Thanks again! I have not heard anybody worrying about seizures so it sounds like that rumor fizzled out but there are definitely people who throw things at the wall until something sticks. I think the most important thing to note is that with side effects they are required to list anything that might possibly happen even if it has nothing to do with the drug (like how respiratory issues are a side effect with Spinraza, when in reality respiratory issues are a symptom  of SMA, so people who take the treatment for SMA will be more prone to them) If you do not know that going in it can be confusing. Anyway, I will keep my note updated. I have been really tired and stressed lately so I am hoping this will help a little, although, navigating insurance has just added to the stress.

My 16 month old daughter Braelynn was diagnosed at 14 months as having SMA type 2. The diagnosis has pretty much destroyed me and my wife. We are hopeful however with Spinraza showing a lot of promise, and just praying it is approved in Canada soon. My best friend and his wife have two beautiful young daughters. They now live in Kelowna BC while we live just south of Winnipeg Manitoba. They were out here for the May long weekend and got to meet Braelynn for the first time. Yesterday, they launched a website to make and sell bracelets in support of SMA research.  This caught me out of the blue, and I cannot believe how amazing two young girls can be. Please check out their website, and if you or anyone you can, please support them in this endeavour. Me, my wife, and Braelynn will appreciate it more than anyone can ever know. \n\n\nThey are also on Facebook so you can like them on there as well.  One suggestion, as a father of a child with SMA who is now getting Spinraza.\nIn addition to prayer, which cannot hurt, I would suggest pushing every button you can think of to get Spinraza approved in Canada. \nContatct politicians, the media, and everyone you know. Make a complicated situtation very simple.  There is one, and only one, drug that might help your child and you want her to have it. \nI wish you and your family the best of luck and I will be buying a bracelet.  Thank you for the tips. We will be contacting politicians shortly. It is expected the Canadian government will have an answer within the next few weeks, then it will be up to our insurance and provincial drug program to cover it. Thank you so much for buying a bracelet. I greatly appreciate it. Do you mind me asking how the drug has been working for your child?  I do not mind at all, but it is a hard question to answer. He has only had 3 shots to this point. I see things I think are good signs, but like most kids with or without SMA he has good days and bad days. Are the good days Spinraza related? Too soon to say I guess is my answer. He had a PT evaluation prior to starting treatment and they took some measurements of his strength levels. In another few months he will have another evaluation and I will hopefully have a better answer then. \n\nBig picture Spinraza is all we have got as parents of kids with SMA. It is not, according to all the research, going to hurt them, and it might help. That is why the FDA in the US and their counterpart agency in the EU approved it for public consumption.   So anyone with SMA should get it.  Some chance is much better than none.  Thank you for the response and your support.

(Mainly from those who cannot eat or swallow anymore) Hey, I have never really talked about my SMA with other people (besides close friends and doctor of course) but today I really need advice from other people with SMA. I am 18 years old with type 2 SMA, and the last 2 month have been pretty bad for me. I have had phlegm that does not want to go away since the end of September. I also had an acid reflux attack which I am assuming is making the phlegm last way longer that it should (I am not sure, I got medicine prescribed for the reflux but it is still on and off, but regardless I am seeing my pulmonologist on Thursday, which so happens to be my birthday, to talk about everything). Being sick constantly for so long has taken a toll on me mentally. I honestly think I am suffering from depression, which I have never experienced before. Thankfully I have an amazing brother who has helped me a lot in that aspect. \n\nThese last 2 days, I have had phlegm that is stuck in the area where like your nose connects to your mouth. It is the area that if you had like mucus in your nose but you felt it near the back of your mouth, and you coughed it up and spit it out. I am sorry I do not know what that area is called and I am pretty bad at explaining things. But that is where the phlegm is, hopefully someone knows what I mean, because it is not in the usual area it is been for the last 2 months (felt it in my chest, brought it up through my throat).\n \nWhat is bad about this is that in this area I just cannot seem to cough it up, which has lead to me panicking and feeling scared, mainly about choking or something bad happening since I am in the stage where I cannot swallow or eat anything by mouth. Panicking and feeling scared obviously does not help me mentally. But anyways what this post is mainly about, has anyone who cannot swallow or eat used their cough assist machine without trouble? The only reason I have not used it right now is because of my fear of choking or something happening. Even though I know it would probably do me good right now since I do not have enough strength to cough up the phlegm in that area I mentioned. \n\nIt is just that since mentally I am not okay right now, it brings up fears I have never really had or thought about. I also do not have those little red suctioning tubes that go in your nose or mouth so if I choke I do not even want to think what could happen. I would really love advice from anyone. I apologize for this lengthy post, it just felt good to let loose about everything. \n\nTL;DR I have had phlegm for 2 months now. Have not had too much trouble coughing it up, just feeling depressed because I have been sick for 2 months without a break. I also had an acid reflux attack in between that. I am at the stage where I cannot swallow or eat by mouth. I am wondering if someone else who also cannot swallow has used the cough assist without trouble? Because for the last 2 days the phlegm has been in a different area mentioned above in paragraph 2. Cannot seem to cough it up in that area, but have not used my cough assist machine because of my fear of choking or something bad happening. I would love any advice or to hear from your experiences. Thank you. Are you using acid blockers, especially the proton pump inhibitor type? A cough assist machine is great for cough in the chest, but you need a suction machine for the post nasal drip (look it up and see if that is what you have). Mucus which resides near/in your nose can be easily sucked with a suction machine. You attach a small soft catheter to it, put it in your throat, and suck the damn stuff out. Yes, cough when it is thick is very hard to permanently swallow - even if you swallow it could easily come up repeatedly. Suck it out! Hey dude. I still have the ability to eat and swallow but do have issues with phlegm and worry about choking. Bloody terrifying is not it? I do totally know about depression though. Worse than our condition I sometime think. It is really good to just let it out and just acknowledge it... talking really is incredibly helpful. Can only recommend that you tell your doctor. I found that difficult but it was totally worth it in the long run.\n\nMight be the hippy in me, but I have found meditation helps with the emotions/moods. Levels things out a bit. Yup meditation is the way to go. Meditation will help you get a distance from your body and mind - so you will be less affected by whatever goes on inside of them. I feel like I slowly start going insane if I stop meditating daily... Just incredible is not it? Something happened before and frustration rose to the surface. Without 'me' doing anything I *automatically* observed it and watch it float away. I was not captured by the moment basically. Quite something that. Good, good. Well I am taking an H2 blocker (famotidine), so I believe it is not a PPI. I will have to talk about that with my primary doctor, because yesterday my pulmonologist said I could need surgery if I am having trouble with acid reflux even while taking medicine for it. Yeah I really need to try that out, because I ignored my weird cough assist fear and tried it today, it helped a bit but not as much as I would have liked. My doctor said yesterday they would send me suctioning tubes, I am hoping that is a catheter like you mentioned. I should have asked but I was not feeling great during the appointment that I forgot to ask. I should have asked about post nasal drip as well, but I did look it up and I am kind of confused as to whether or not I have that. I feel the phlegm in that area I mentioned, but I do not feel anything dripping down my throat. It does sometimes make my voice or throat feel weird like vibrate or something. I think that is called hoarseness I am not sure (English is not my first language so some words I am not too sure about). But I am sure suctioning that out would be great. Thanks for replying. Yeah it definitely is, especially when you start overthinking everything and making in worse that what it really is. I can definitely agree with that. I have gotten used to our condition, it is always the last thing I think about. It is just normal life for us, even with all the problems we have to face. This is the first time I have experienced depression, and yeah man, it is definitely awful. I would put it up there with having to recover from my spinal fusion surgery. Maybe even worse. Typing this and reading the replies is already helping me, even if it is just for a bit. So thanks for the reply. Yeah I told my doctor yesterday but he did not say much. Then again he is a pulmonologist, but still. I will talk with my primary doctor about it, probably have to get a therapist. \n\nI am going to have to try meditation. Because these last two months I have been relying on my mom, brother, a friend I talk online with. But they also have lives and their own problems, and it just makes me feel like I am bothering them because I always want someone with me. Like my mom said, I need to be strong and find a way to help myself, because they will not always be available. Meditation definitely sounds like a good way to do that, so thanks for the advice dude. Most doctors do not know this but stomach acid coming up the esophagus is a symptom of low stomach acid, not the other way around. So taking any kind of antacid will make the cause worse, although it may seem like it is helping you; moreover, it will slowly destroy your complete digestive process. Read ( for how it works. If you are interested you can also read a book on it called Why Stomach Acid is Good for you. \n\nAbout your nasal mucus, try suctioning it for now. Once you have the tube in your throat (it should be a thin tube) try inhaling quickly (as long as you are comfortable doing it) which should cause it to go in the tube... It always amazes me that whenever it pops into my head that the way I react to things must be weird because of our predicament, \\ but then this little community shows me that all our stories are similar... We are just people dealing with a cruel toss of the coin, it has the same effect and we all have similar reactions. I do not think any of that makes sense?? but basically, I feel you brother (\u30c4)\n\nI have found ( very helpful recently. Requires commitment but very positive results so far. How is it going?", "Some more results from a trial. Risdiplam this time.  *\"Patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA typically decline over the course of a year and the increase in motor function by over 3 points in SUNFISH when compared to natural history is exceptionally encouraging.\"* Sound good /u/tinylittlestormcloud? Definitely encouraging for the SMA2/3 group so far but would need to see a comparison with the untreated group to know how strong the evidence is - we will know that when they complete part 2. I am happy to see they have managed to enroll 180 people for that but I do not at all envy the statisticians who are having to deal with the broad age range within that group. Think it would have been a good idea to include more countries in the trial (and therefore more people) so they could get a better idea of what happens in different age groups but I guess it was too expensive. Hope the age issue does not come and bite us back in the butt like it did with Spinraza.\n\nSeparate note: Happy cake/reddit day to you!", "Hey people, I have been tracking my Spinraza progress on Youtube, check it out if you are interested!  Subscribed! I was thinking of doing a journal like this if I ever start getting it. I would absolutely recommend it.  It is my time capsule or just evidence of the shot being more than a 250k placebo.\n\nAlso thanks for subscribing!  I am sure outside the MD circles it is not very interesting so I totally appreciate you checking it out. Ah, the old drive and whip of the head. i know it well (\u30c4) Great vid and really want to see how you progress dude. Subscribed. Be interested to hear how your energy levels are. I would love to see some of your art if you are willing to share! Also thanks for the video. My insurance just approved my loading doses so I will be starting soon. I am a type 3, so I am curious to see how it will work for me.  I was thinking about a video of what I do in my free time, maybe I will focus on some art stuff.  \n\nCongratulations on the loading dose!  Are you psyched!? The drive and whip is basically in the SMA handbook!  Thanks for subscribing.  I have got another progress video at the end of this week hopefully.  Are you doing the injections? Definitely do that, I would love to see your art! I am also an artist, but more music than anything else. I like to paint but I am not sure I am any good at it haha. \n\nAnd yes, totally psyched! Cannot believe it is really going to happen. I am 29 and honestly did not think I would see a treatment in my lifetime. Now there is Spinraza and all these other drugs in the pipeline. It is really amazing.  29 huh?  Congratulations man, the younger the better.  It is a bummer we are in the older demographic but better late than never.  \n\nFor your first injection did they give you any tips or strategy? How can I not subscribe to a chap with such a magnificent beard and flowing hair? I am in the UK, so no Spinraza unless you have a million or so to spare. Look forward to your next vid dude! Better late than never for sure! I have not got any tips other than hydrate hydrate hydrate. Do you have any tips you can give?  I totally have tips, that was also a video idea but I keep spacing.  \n\nSo my best advice and current routine routine was recommended by the genetic counselor and I have had zero side effects.  You are type 3, so my experience is probably a bit different.  You probably have less physical obstacles so you are definitely at an advantage.  Start with getting a big energy drink and get a good amount down before the injection.  If you drink too much water and other stuff in order to stay hydrated you will have to piss while on the table where it is totally not an option.  This can be a problem if they tap a nerve giving you a 'zinger' or nerve shock down a leg.  It is an instant but intense shock that scared the piss out of me...almost literally.  I almost lost it because I forgot to pee beforehand, even if you do not have to, just try.  My third injection took 45 minutes to find an opening into the spinal fluid sack, so yeah, try.  But enough about pee...the caffeine from the energy drink helps against headaches which is helpful in case you do have an issue.  I popped a Xanax beforehand as well but I get anxious when I am cold and operating/procedure rooms are a tad chilly.  Sometimes it is hard to adjust in the position they want so do not be afraid to ask for more pillows because once they start there is no rolling on your back or anything.  My arm I laid on fell asleep each time but it is temporary discomfort.  Afterwards, if you are not covered in terror pee and do not need to change it is standard to stay horizontal for at least an hour.  Do not opt out, I have not had the headache and I have done the hour of laying down each time.  I have also had an empty stomach each time which is not anything special but whatever.  After the hour nap I have gotten a big meal as well as more caffeine just to make sure everything is okay.  I played it pretty low key the rest of the day which cannot hurt.  The most we have done afterwards was going to a sushi joint, otherwise the next day is just another day.  If you are able to walk or just more physically capable, maybe just be careful or aware.  I felt weird almost right after but your mileage may vary.  \n\nDo you have therapy lined up for after the procedure?\n My hair is pretty great...and flattery will get you everywhere.  \n\nSince you are in the UK what is the outlook like?  Is it just not going to happen or is there a time frame?  Question, would you be up for being interviewed for a video about not having Spinraza available?  A lot of us would be interested in what is going on.  \n\nI bought lottery tickets last week, if I had the means to help I absolutely would.  When there are legitimate treatments available it is criminal not to get access. Cheers for the thought dude!\n\nYeah I am not expert *at all*, but this is the gist afaik. So, we have a health service that is free at the point of service. Because of this there is a body called NICE that reviews new medicines to see if they are cost-effective. \n\nThe controversy with the decision to deny Spinraza was that they grouped all types of SMA together when reviewing whether the cost is worth the benefit. I personally thought they were going to okay it for babies with type one, but maybe not for adult with type three and definitely not type four'. But nope. No one gets it. \u0ca0_\u0ca0\n\nI feel the best option we have now is to wait for the other treatments to come the market and bring down the price . Any other brits, feel free to correct me.\n\nHa, I dunno about an interview! In the words of Joe Peschi, I turn into \"a f***in' mumbling stuttering little prick\" when talking on skype etc. (\u30c4)\n That is crazy...   Grouping it all together like that is letting more damage be done when potentially type 1 children or infants could be treated.  Jeez.\n\n Wow oh my gosh, thanks for being so thorough! I will definitely take your advice and pee beforehand. I get these like.. urges to pee whenever I am nervous, whether I have a bladder full or not. So yes, that is some good advice. Also I was not sure if I would be allowed to take a Xanax beforehand, so I am glad you mentioned it. I have an appt with my radiologist on Monday to discuss everything prior to scheduling the injections, so I will be sure to ask him if it is cool that I do that. I will have to take the subway back to my place after the injections/hour of laying down, so I hope that kind of physical activity (bumping around in the train) does not induce any headaches. But I guess we will see!\n\nI do not have any therapy lined up. There is a gym with an adapted recreation program right near my place, so I was thinking of doing some stuff there. I am not sure what I could do exactly, but I think they help you figure that out there. If that does not work out, I will probably set up some PT.  I know, it is utterly disgraceful and heartbreaking  \u0ca0_\u0ca0", "Speech therapy I have problem with Swallowing. Suggest? See an otolaryngologist and do a flexible endoscopy test.\n\nIf the problem is not so severe, some speech therapy might help. The therapist may teach you some myofunctional exercises to work out the muscles in your head that are involved in eating, posture modification techniques to apply during eating which may make swallowing easier or at least safer, and diet adjustments to find the texture of food and drink that is easiest and safest for you to swallow.\n\nIf the problem is more severe, in the sense that eating is so difficult for you that you are expending more energy while eating than what energy you are taking in through the food, or you are aspirating a lot of food or drink into your lungs, the doctor will recommend you get a gastrostomy so you can be given nutrients through a liquid formula straight into your stomach. Yes, ask your doctor to refer you to a speech therapist. I am seeing one currently once a week that comes to my home. Luckily, I do not have major problems swallowing yet but I do retain some saliva in the back of my throat because I do not swallow as hard or as often as what is \"normal\". My main goal with the speech therapist is to open my bite up because I can only open up about half an inch, but we do a lot of swallowing exercises too. I would suggest contacting a speech therapist to get setup for sessions, but I can write up in detail the swallowing exercises I have been taught for you to try on your own. PM me if interested!", "We Carry Kevan (SMA Awareness) Online Documentary Streaming Event Hello wanted to share a really awesome documentary screening that is happening this July. We Carry Kevan (Kevan Chandler) is an organization run by Kevan who has SMA. He and his friends partnered with a backpack company and the created a backpack to carry Kevan all of Europe and China and they filmed documentaries ! \n\n**A little blurb about Kevan...** \n\nKevan Chandler grew up in North Carolina. The youngest of three, he was the second in his family to be diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. In the summer of 2016, six friends joined him in the adventure of a lifetime. They left his wheelchair behind at the Atlanta airport and made their way to Europe, where they spent three weeks exploring places commonly deemed \u201cinaccessible.\u201d Two of the team members filmed the experience as the other four carried Kevan in a custom backpack. They danced in the streets of Paris, hiked through the English countryside, and scaled the monastic island of Skellig Michael, off the coast of Ireland. Around every corner, they were faced with the wonderful reality that when they are courageous and creative together, the world becomes accessible.\n\nTwo years after this initial trip to Europe, they had the amazing opportunity to visit China in the same fashion. From the mountainous countryside of Guilin, where they fished with locals, to the Great Wall and Shaolin Temple, the ancient markets of Luoyang and the metropolis of Beijing, Kevan and his friends were once again encouraged by the enormous potential that friendship and creativity can bring to otherwise limiting circumstances.\n\nAn avid storyteller, he is author of five books, including We Carry Kevan, a memoir of his team\u2019s adventure across Europe. Kevan is also the founder of We Carry Kevan Inc., a nonprofit striving to redefine accessibility as a cooperative effort.\n\nReally incredible what they are doing. They sell and donate backpacks all over the world for friends and families to carry their loved ones. Redefining accessibility ! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTickets are on sale now ! \n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPacks can be purchased here...\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This is awesome! Cannot wait to get one for my son. I have been wondering about how a g-tube would be prevented from rubbing while walking. The current MEC carrier we have is terrible for pulling at his AMT mini. Beautiful ! They are really good at answering all questions as well. Especially Kevan about his experiences with the pack and the comfort. \n\n is a good one if you have questions !", "Risdiplam (x-ray control) Hello everybody,\nI have a doubt. Soon I will have to take the plane for the first time carrying risdiplam.\nI have some doubts and I would like to ask you for your opinion.\nWhen I have to pass the checks at the airport and they have to pass the drug under X-rays, do they risk ruining it? Can he go inside the car? What products did you buy for long air travel with the drug? Send me the links too\n\nThanks so much It would be best to call your doctor or pharmacist about travelling with Risdiplam. We travel with Risdiplam in a secure, cooled medicine case. This is hilarious, I had a discussion with my wife not a day ago about a trip we plan on taking later this year. She brought up the question of traveling with the medication and I did not even think about it. She is hoping to use the cold packs that the medication gets shipped in...but please report back if you got a better idea or if you hear anything! I see many products but I do not idea which is the best. Can you help me? Unfortunately, we lost time home to airport after time to fly and return in hotel. It is need best product. Help me Not really sure what I can do to help, but it is important to keep it cold so if you can keep it in a cooler with ice packs I think that is probably the best way to keep it from spoiling. Otherwise if you can consult with your doctor or whoever prescribed it and ask for their input that might be a good idea. I do not think an x-ray or just going through baggage would hurt it but keeping it cold I remember is a really important part. Unfortunately, I lost more time for flight travel", "There is a lot of interesting Spinraza info here  \"An update on the current status of dosing in states across the US included the following information:\n\nAs of September around 2,000 patients had been dosed, with around 250 and 200 in trials/EAP and support programs \nAges ranged from a few weeks old to 50/60s \n120 sites in 40 states have dosed at least one patient \n230 sites submitted a start form\nIn addition, an update on Spinraza administration sites and access included:\n\n80 sites on list confirmed \n177 sites being communicated with \n29 states (including DC) with at least one site\" Thanks for the link buck. Got to say though, it is incredibly frustrating hearing all this and living in a country that it has not even been approved in yet. It is weird, but when there was no treatment I was quite laissez-faire about where my condition was going, but now that there is one... damn, it is like an itch I cannot scratch...\n\nSorry, obviously not having a good day :| I feel you dude, I really do. I know exactly what you mean about not being too fussed before. Now I am like hyper-aware of my abilities and feeling the fear of further decline. It is very hard to have to sit tight, knowing there is something out there that could potentially help us at least hit the pause button.\n\nWe are the only two UK people on here as far as I know (if there are others reveal yourselves!). And maybe this sounds strange coming from someone you have not met but at least we are kind of in the same boat whilst we are sticking this out? Like at least we are not in the boat alone? I do not know if that helps at all but yeah....stay strong dude, we will get there.  Thanks storm, I appreciate that. I do not mean this in a horrible way but I am glad to have someone in the same boat as well :/ It does make it a bit easier does not it? \n\nHave just been watching a Youtube channel of a guy in America who says he is already showing signs of improvement. To think we may have to wait another few years, if at all, has kind of been on my mind a little bit... ^ok, ^a ^lot...\n\nAnyway it is good to know that you have got my back and I jolly well have got yours! That is horrible, seeing something that might help and not having access to it. \nIf you believe that past is prologue I can tell you that there were many people in the US in your same position when Spinraza first came out.  Some still are. America is a big country and for patients hundreds of miles away from the nearest facility approved to give Spinraza that can be an insurmountable challenge. And some insurance companies still.dont want to pay for it.   But there are patients who struggled for months to get Spinraza in the US who are now getting it so hopefully everyone in the UK will be receiving it soon. \n\nThis is the kind of heartbreaking story that should be told on a much broader level than this platform. I do not know if either of you has the appetite for it, but have you thought of going to the media? I really think that might be a good way to put pressure on whatever governmental body in the UK/EU (not sure who is In charge over there at the moment ;) ) that would be responsible for approving Spinraza.\nAnother thing that came to mind is there have to be more than 2 people in the UK with SMA.  It would be great to get others in your position, as well as their friends and family, to get involved in this subreddit. I am not sure how to do that, but from reading your posts you both are share cookies so you could probably come up with something ;) In these situations information sharing is huge, and more people often equates to more info.\nHave either of you tried appealing directly to members of your government, and if so what has their response been? How about Biogen? Do they have any representatives over there? I am sure they would love to get into the UK market. Maybe they would have some suggestions for you on how to best advocate for getting what you want. \n\nGood luck Wheelie Dave and Ms. Storm Cloud. Lots of people you do not even know are cheering for you.  Not horrible at all, in this together! \n\nI have just written to SMA support UK and asked if they have any idea when the next communication from NICE might be. Even if they do not know what the timeline is it would be good to know if we can expect any info from NICE soon or what stage of the process they are in. They say they will reply in 3 days so I will let you know what they say. NICE has communication channels too though I have not tried that yet. You can also follow them on ( They have not said anything about spinraza yet.\n\n/u/24pointbuck - Thanks for the cheers and the advice, will look into a few of these things and see what can be done. Good idea on the Biogen reps too, had not thought about that! OK. They replied quicker than expected and it helped me understand the process a little better.\n\nSo basically, we are waiting for NICE to announce their \"approval pathway\". The appraisal pathway details **how** and **when** they will assess whether they will recommend that the NHS funds it. I thought that is what they were doing now but it is not. This was expected to be announced in July but was not.\n\nOnce they have announced the approval pathway they then usually take about 34 weeks to make a public announcement on whatever their final decision is. During these 34 weeks, advocacy groups and clinicians will be involved in this process. However we are not there yet so advocacy groups are not involved right now and SMA Support cannot do anything.\n\nI then asked them: When NICE announces their approval pathway, does that announcement give any indication of whether they are leaning towards approval or rejection? Or do we really have to wait 34 weeks for a proper answer?\n\nThey said: \"The announcement may or may not give an indication of what they are thinking. For example, they could announce that at this stage they will only be looking at the possibility of the NHS funding the treatment for those with SMA Type 1, or they may say they will look at it for all types of SMA. So, you might get some broad idea then. However, you will not get an idea until the end as to whether the outcome will be positive and they will then fund. Also, as I understand it, even if they have limited the group they will look at, advocacy groups /clinicians may still present the case for other groups.\"\n\nSo basically, I have no idea what NICE is doing that is causing them to delay this appraisal pathway announcement so much. I am quite tempted to ring/email them and ask to be honest, although I doubt they will be able to tell me. Yes!!!\n\nThey are going to say Yes eventually and they know it. Has there ever been a drug broadly approved for commercial use by the US FDA and the Canadian equivalent that was not subsequently approved for use in the UK? I doubt it. Maybe you can ask NICE??? I suspect they know they are going to approve it. \nJust keep kicking them in their hindquarters in your own polite way until you get what you want.  \n\nFeeling \"irritated\"? I bet! Irritate them back!\n\nGood for you!!!! Ha, your username really does check out!! There is a member of the house of lords with SMA if I remember correctly, so will try to ask her the same question... Force of nature is stormcloud :)  Cheers buck, some good points there. I think we may need to get a bit more proactive if they are going to drag their heels. It does sound strange but for all of our lives we have been told that there is nothing that can be done, so when a treatment pops up it comes as a bit of a jolt that you do not quite know what to do with ?!?  It does not sound strange at all.  It is a perfectly normal human reaction. \n\nI only had a couple years to think about SMA. Then BOOM! Spinraza! \nIf my son had been diagnosed 20 or 30 years ago I am not sure how I would have reacted. I also jumped in with both feet because it was for my kid. If it was for me? I probably would not have done anything. \n Baroness Campbell yes? That is a fantastic idea! I probably should steer clear of her as I recently had a minor tiff with one of her advocacy organizations and I doubt I have endeared myself to her. See, sometimes the username does not quite work in my favour! Let me know how it goes!  Ha, I will take this one then :) Have tweeted so see what she says... What was the tiff? Oh I was upset about that story in the news about the man with motor neuron disease who lost the high court case for assisted suicide. She is the head of \"Not Dead Yet UK\" and they went against him on the grounds that allowing a terminally ill man the right to assisted suicide could eventually lead to that right being extended to the non-terminally ill disabled community. I felt upset at the thought that they tried to protect and secure our rights by going against him and at the way they handled his loss in court. I mean assisted suicide is a sensitive issue (and I am opposed to the idea that it could be offered to anyone in the disabled community) but I felt awful for this terminally ill guy being treated this way by fellow disabled people. So I wrote to them to express my frustration... I thought it might be that. It is a difficult issue is not it. All I know, I want to depart this mortal coil with as much dignity as I can muster... I will let you know what I hear from her... Yeah it is a tricky one. I can see both sides. I hope never to be in the position to have to think about it, honestly. And thanks! NICE just sent a reply to my email. They say they cannot currently give a timeline with regards to when they will make a decision and are still working with Biogen on next steps. Bit disappointing really but there we are. Waiting to hear from Biogen now. Sorry by the way, was not sure exactly which post to reply to with this so apologies for the mess of comments! Cheers storm, lets hope Biogen can be slightly less slippery! I have a couple suggestions, based on my personal experience.   \nPeople will try and blow you off by saying \"We are working with Biogen. Ask then who they are  contact is at Biogen.  Then call and email that person. I say both because calling makes more of a personal connection, but email creates an incontrovertible record. Then when Biogen says \"We are working with NICE\" ask them who they are working with at NICE and hit them up.\n\nEvery authority, person or agency you can call and email go ahead and call them and email them. And if they say it is not their department ask who you should talk to. And do not be afraid to ask their supervisor, or their supervisors supervisor. \nThe internet is your friend here. \nDo not give up until younget what you want.   Thank you, that is great advice, you are super motivating too!\n You are welcome and no thanks needed. Your victories are mine and vice versa. At least that is how I look at it. \nWe are all on the same team :) Sadly, not super informative. \n\nThey said: \n\n*\"Following European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval, the next step is for national health technology appraisal bodies in the UK to assess nusinersen. Submissions are expected throughout the remainder of the year with the first decisions expected in 2018. Biogen are unable to speculate on the specific timing of the decisions. \"*\n Hmmm, looks like it is a waiting game then... I mean, that is a lot of groups to present info. It does seem that there are quite a few in there have very little to do with it, does not it? *Royal College of Anaesthetists* - Why? No anaesthesia needed I thought. And why have *Muslim Council of Britain* or *South Asian Health Foundation*? Arn't these societal/cultural charities?\n\nSo  decision 2018... Once this (FAD) is reached, does it then have to go through any further processes? Not sure about further processed to be honest, every time I think I have just grasped the sequence of events that needs to occur I then get confused all over again.\n\nAnd yeah, I can almost maaaybe understand the anaesthetists, I suppose they might want to consult on the logistics of administering the drug in those with spinal fusions. The other two seem totally off-topic. I am aware of public health bodies engaging with such organizations in order to form a relationship of trust with communities but I am not sure what they have to contribute here. Unless its about thinking about how to deliver treatment to those groups, but surely that would be an issue for later. Kids who get Spinraza get knocked out first so they do not squirm when the needles go in. There may be some adults who also go under for various reasons.  That is why anaesthestists are included.\nAs far as those other 2 groups go....no comment.  Ah yeah, never thought of that.

At home, the fridge is fine. I did ask the pharmacist on the phone when I was being set up what to do when traveling and they recommended keeping a few of the ice packs it comes with in the freezer and potentially keep 1 of the foam coolers too if you have the space to spare, if not, any cooler you have would do.

I did the normal prep of no fluids or food 2 hours before and arrived at the hospital around 1 p.m. There was a bit of a hiccup as I had a temperature of 100f and then 100.5 when they checked about 30 minutes later. My doctor said however that as long as I was asymptomatic then it was no big deal. They proceeded with the lumbar puncture and the head of the MDA clinic for St.Louis observed my doctor giving me the treatment this time as apparently I am one of few adults with SMA II  in St.Louis getting Spinraza. Overall there was even less pain this time. My doctor used the same spot as last time and it took only about 15 minutes to get everything done. I took Versed (Valium) again but this time it didnt make me lose any memory. \n\nToday I have minimal side effects. My lower back is less sore than last time but my head feels a bit foggy and has some periods with a very small headache. Overall I have not felt any improvements as far as I can tell but my doctor said it typically takes about 3-6 months before you can really see any differences. If anyone has any questions let me know and I will try to answer as best as I can. Thanks for the update. Looking forward to hearing your results! Do you have a spinal fusion done? Not currently no What type of SMA do you have and, if its not to personal, how old are you? \nThanks for sharing this. The more info out there the better.  Type II. I am 23 Good to hear!  \n\nI agree with your sentiment, my first dose was the hardest and most painful...  It does help that they \"know\" where to do the tap on subsequent doses.

It is really good to hear these stories. ", "My Spinraza story (with spinal fusion) I have a full spinal fusion. There were a few options I considered: opening a port in my rods, getting an Ommaya resovoir catheter and going through the side (foramen). Going in through the neck seemed like too great a risk, so it was not even considered. \n\nThe option to open a port was too risky because if I we are to get an infection in the procedure, I would have to redo the spinal fusion surgery. That sounded like a very bad nightmare. The option of the Ommaya resovoir was very seriously considered. I had three issues with it. \n\n1. It is messing with the brain. \n2. I may not be able to breath on my own after I wake up from the surgery. \n3. I, and the doctors, do not know if Spinraza injected in a place other than the lower back would have different effects than those shown in the trials. My doctors actually contacted Biogen and they had no answers. \n\nI was left with one option. Trying to inject Spinraza under live CT. Here is my experience:\n\nI got to the hospital and was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit. There I was monitored through the night to check if there were any irregularities in my condition. Blood and urine tests were taken. In the morning I got into the CT machine and after he applied the local anesthesia, my invasive radiologist tried to perform the Lumbar Puncture from the back, that did not work. So, after a few tries he got in from the side. Those tries hurt, but not so much. He went in from the foramen, so when he hit the nerves, it sent some zaps down my leg. \n\nAfterwards I had to lie with my head lower than my body for 30 minutes so the difference in pressures in my CSF would not give me a headache. I was discharged two hours after the procedure. \n\nI am writing this about 8 hours after the procedure. My pain level is a 4/10 and has not changed since I got out after the procedure. \n\n*English is not my native language.\n\nEdit: Answering some questions.\n\n**Q: During the procedure, how high did your pain level get to?**\n\nA: The strongest pain I felt was during the aforementioned zaps. It was 7/10 for a total of 3 seconds. Mostly, it was like 3/10 and 4/10 during the insertion of the needle. \n\n**Q: What type of SMA?**\n\nA: 2\n\n**Q: How old are you and when did you get your spinal fusion?**\n\nA: I am 19. I got my spinal fusion in 2009.\n\n**Q: How long was the procedure once you got to radiology?**\n\nA: ~45 minutes. They scanned my back, looked at it, then started trying to get in.\n\n**Q: Were you sedated or given any medication to relax you?**\n\nA: All I got was the regional anesthesia. It was enough. This is fantastic! So happy for you that you are getting Spinraza.  Good news!  This is really helpful as I know there a many here with spinal fusions &amp; rods who are very interested in how they can get the medication.  Going through the foramen seems like a very delicate procedure.  I had to look this up on (\n\nI got my infusions via a normal lumbar puncture/spinal tap using flouroscopy, which is similar, but different from a live CT scan I think...\n\nSome questions if you do not mind:\n1) During the procedure, how high did your pain level get to?\n2) What type of SMA?\n3) How old are you and when did you get your spinal fusion?\n4) What country are you in?\n5) How long was the procedure once you got to radiology?\n6) Were you sedated or given any medication to relax you?\n\n **Intervertebral foramen**\n\nThe intervertebral foramen (also called neural foramen, and often abbreviated as IV foramen or IVF), is a foramen between two spinal vertebrae.

Like they went in through your actual side rather than your back? I just want to confirm that I understood correctly!\n First off your English is great. Secondly thank you for the info and you doing it immediately after the procedure was a good idea.  Memories fade over time. Please continue to share as you go.

Thank you so much, get some good rest now, must feel great to have got the first one over and done with!! Wow, so it looks like they have to go a lot further through the back tissues and muscles to get to the spine as opposed to the (relatively) short trip directly behind the spine.  It kind of looks like they start just above your hip.  Now I see why it still hurts! Thanks for all the information! I am hoping my procedure does as smoothly as yours did.

Especially after the historical announcement of the FDA's approval for Spinraza (Just in time for Christmas). I thought I would contribute to this subreddit by detailing a summarized version of phase 1 clinical trial of Spinraza (Which I believe was first initialized in December of 2011). If anyone was interested in the results pertaining to the first clinical study of Spinraza, here it is if you have not read it already:\n\n**Objective of study:**\n\nBecause this was a phase 1 study, the purpose of the study was to largely determine 4 things: \n\n- Safety \n- Tolerability \n- Pharmacokinetics (how Spinraza moves or spreads within the body once administered) \n- Gauge the preliminary clinical efficacy of Spinraza \n\n**Study design:**\n\nWas an open-label study, meaning there were no qualifications of having to belong in a previous study in order to join this one. There were 4 escalating dose levels (1, 3, 6, 9 mg) of Spinraza. Each participant was assigned to belong in a single dose group. In other words some participants were only injected with 1 mg of Spinraza, if you were assigned to be in the 1 mg Spinraza dose group. Following the same idea, if a participant was assigned to be in the 9 mg Spinraza dose group then that individual, along with several others in the same group, consequently were given 9 mg of Spinraza. Spinraza was administered intrathecally or directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  \n\n**Participants:**\n\nEligibility was largely determined by several factors: \n\n- If an individual displayed symptoms of SMA. \n- If an individual genetically expressed a lack of or deletion of the SMN1 homozygous gene.  \n- If an individual was determined as medically stable to complete the study. \n\nBoth male and female participants aged 2-14 with SMA were included in the study. 6 participants were each assigned to the 1, 3, and 6 mg dose groups. 10 participants were assigned in the 9 mg dose group. And so a total of 28 participants were enrolled in the phase 1 study. The average age of participants was about 6 years of age. No participants with type 1 SMA were included in the study. Only type 2 (15 participants) and type 3 (13 participants) were enrolled. Of the 28 patients in the study, 36 percent were ambulatory or could walk.  \n\n**Clinical outcome measures:**\n\nThree different clinical assessments were used for this study to determine whether or not the administration of Spinraza at 4 different dose levels resulted in clinically meaningful changes. These assessments were of the following: \n\n- Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) \n- Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) \n- 3.0 Neuromuscular Module \n\nIt is important to have some kind of method in determining whether or not a drug shows clinical effectiveness in carrying out what is intended. The HFMSE, and other assessments like it, are essentially manuals that trained individuals (like physical therapists) can use to determine the physicality of people with SMA type 2 or 3. Evaluations of strength, balance, etc are measured by observing what these individuals can physically do in different situations. For example, in test item 3 of the HFMSE assessment the instruction or physical task asks the SMA patient to raise one hand to the head and above the ear without bending her or his neck while sitting on the floor. Depending on the patient\u2019s ability to carry out the task a scoring of 0-2 is given. The HFMSE has been shown to be sensitive and effective in measuring the physicality of individuals with SMA, which makes the manual and its procedures standardized enough to be used in most patients with SMA type 2 or 3. In the case of this study, HFMSE was carried out by trained physical therapists. \n\n**Results \u2013 Safety and tolerability:**\n\nNo serious adverse events (AE) or medical complications were documented during the course of the study. It was the case, however, that 89% of participants reported AEs but were mild in severity. Five participants reported events that were moderate in nature and none that were severe. The most common AEs reported or observed were: \n\n- Headache (39.3%) \n- Post-lumbar puncture headache (21.4%) *Lumbar puncture, otherwise known as spinal tap, is a   procedure that collects cerebrospinal fluid and was administered at the beginning and middle of the study.* \n- Back pain (17.9%) \n\nThe above most commonly reported symptoms are not considered as being associated with Spinraza as a drug. Two AEs were, however, considered potentially related to Spinraza: mild paresthesia (a prickly sensation usually caused by pressure or damage to the peripheral nerves) in the 1 mg group, and palpitations in the 3 mg group. Both events resolved spontaneously. No clinically significant changes were observed in evaluating the health of participants. \n\n**Results \u2013 Pharmacokinetics (How a drug spreads within the body once administered)**\n\nConcentrations of Spinraza within the body for all participants were measured periodically over the course of the study. It was determined that Spinraza concentration were sequentially higher in groups that received higher amounts of the drug in mgs after 7 days of initial dosage. It was documented that Spinraza rapidly spread from the initial point (CSF) into systemic circulation of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) within just few hours of initial administration of the drug. Spinraza concentration overall decreased slowly for all dosage levels but the amount total seen through the course of the study depended on initial dosage of Spinraza. \n\nMeasurement of SMN protein levels (necessary for the health and continuation of motor neurons) when analyzed through the taking of cerebrospinal fluid samples resulted in no change in the 1 or 3 mg groups. But for the 6 and 9 mg groups SMN protein levels more than doubled at 9-14 months postdose compared with the amount that was seen before the drug was administered (baseline).  \n\n**Results \u2013 Clinical outcomes**\n\nAs mentioned before, clinical outcomes were largely measured by using the 3 clinical assessments designed to gauge the physicality of individuals with SMA. It was determined, for the HFMSE assessment, that an improvement score of 3 and above when compared to baseline (pre-dosage of Spinraza) yields significant clinical change, thus designating Spinraza to be clinically effective for that particular individual. No significant or clinically meaningful changes were observed when using the HFMSE assessment in the 1, 3, or 6 mg groups. However, the 9 mg group was found to be significant as individuals within that cohort demonstrated an average increase of 3.1  in HFMSE scores when compared to baselines at day 85 of receiving Spinraza. An average increase of 5.8 points was found in the same group at 9-14 months (Probably after receiving another Spinraza injection as part of the extension study).  Individuals with SMA demonstrated a range of 3-7 points of improvement in score. Improvement of HFMSE scores were found throughout the entire span of patients receiving the treatment drug in the 9 mg group. By 9-14 months after starting the treatment process, it was notably the case that not a single participant in the 9 mg cohort declined in HFMSE score. This is important to recognize as the other dose groups gradually declined in HFMSE points, indicating a more normal progression of SMA in its natural history of decline in muscle strength. In addition, the overall range of improvement for these individuals was 1-14 points.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI know, old information now that the drug has actually been approved, but I thought I would still put it out there.\n\nThe full text of the above information can be accessed through this web address for free in the journal of neurology:\n\n\n\nCheers.\n\n Thanks for the thorough summary! Do you have any information on the AVXS-101 treatment?  Hi Strawbrery,\n\nI do not have any summarized information on the actual phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101 that was done recently. But CureSMA did release some information about the results that were shared to them. You probably already read that one but I will still link it below here:\n\n\n\nAs follows (Taken directly from the above web link):\n\n**No New Treatment-related Safety or Tolerability Concerns Identified:**\nAs of January 20, 2017, AVXS-101 appeared to have a favorable safety profile and to be generally well tolerated, with no new safety or tolerability concerns identified.\n\n**No New Events and 15 of 15 Patients Event-Free at 13.6 Months, including 12 of 12 Patients in Proposed Therapeutic-Dose Cohort:**\nAs of January 20, 2017, 12 of 12 patients (100%) in the cohort of patients who received the proposed one-time therapeutic dose of AVXS-101 (Cohort 2) had reached 13.6 months of age event-free, where the expected event-free survival rate based on natural history of the disease is 25%. The median age at last follow-up for Cohort 2 was 20.2 months, with the oldest patient at 31.1 months of age. \n\n**Rapid and Sustained CHOP INTEND Improvements Above Baseline:**\nAs of January 20, 2017, mean increases from baseline in CHOP INTEND scores of 7.7 points in Cohort 1 and 24.7 points in Cohort 2 were observed, reflecting improvement in motor function. In Cohort 2 there were mean increases in CHOP INTEND of 9.8 points one month after gene therapy and 15.4 points three months following gene therapy. \n\n**Cohort 2 Patients Consistently Achieved and Maintained Key Developmental Motor Milestones:**\nAs of January 20, 2017, 11 of 12 patients (92%) in Cohort 2 achieved head control, nine of 12 patients (75%) could roll a minimum of 180 degrees from back to both left and right, and 11 of 12 patients (92%) could sit with assistance. For the end-of-study assessment, AveXis evaluated three validated and well-established measures of sitting unassisted for periods of increasing duration. Nine of 12 patients (75%) could sit unassisted for at least five seconds, seven of 12 patients (58%) could sit unassisted for at least 10 seconds and five of 12 patients (42%) could sit unassisted for 30 seconds or more. Two patients could walk independently, and each had achieved earlier and important developmental milestones such as standing with support, standing alone and walking with support.\n\nThe results seem very positive. I believe all the patients treated in this phase 1 trial of AVXS-101 were type 1 infants. Mind you that the makers of this particular drug (Avexis) are initially focusing on targeting SMA type 1. Then they will gradually see if it is effective in other subtypes of SMA. Interestingly (and someone correct me if I am wrong) they are also proposing a one time intraveneous treatment, as opposed to Spinraza's continuous and lifetime administration.   Thanks for the info! Is my understanding correct that it is possible for a person to get both the Spinraza and AVXS-101 treatment? That is a good question. Unfortunately I have no idea. I remember reading something in an journal article about the likelihood of taking multiple different treatments of SMA. In it the author(s) expressed the opinion that insofar as there being a single cure for SMA, it may be more likely that we will reach a point where multiple drug therapies or treatments are taken to efficiently subside the symptoms of SMA. So...in that sense, yes I think it is possible to take more than one drug that treats SMA. But like I said I cannot answer the question of potentially taking both specifically Spinraza and AVXS-101. And I also expect that insurance companies might not be so willing at first to cover another drug in addition to what was already covered initially. But this is where advocacy groups come in and lay the grounds to say, \"Hey this is where the future of treatment for SMA treatment is heading and the data strongly suggests it.\"\n\nHope this helped. That is great thank you.\nDo you have a sense of how the early data on Spinraza compares to the early data on AVXS-101?\nI bombed science in school so dumb it down if possible.\nThanks! Hi 24pointbuck,\n\nThanks for asking this question because I too want to know. Upon going back to what was published on the CureSMA news page about the results for phase 1 on AVXS-101, I noticed a hyperlink that directed me to the full press release of this drug. In it there is much greater detail about the phase 1 study.\n\nYou can access it here:\n\n\n\nSo let us take a look at AVXS-101's clinical trial study design and compare it with Spinraza:\n\nBoth are phase 1 studies, open label, and implement the use of escalating dosage of said treatment.\n\nDosage:\n\nIn the Spinraza phase 1 study there were 4 escalating dosage levels used (1, 3, 6, &amp; 9 mg).\nIn the AVXS-101 phase 1 study there are 2 escalating dosage levels used:\n\n- Low-dose cohort 1 (6.7E13 vg/kg). \n- Proposed therapeutic dose cohort 2 (2.0E14 vg/kg).\n\nWe know that the official dosage of Spinraza is at 12 mg, whereas in the phase 1 study of Spinraza it is capped at 9 mg which is not the official dosage used today. Something to be mindful of. On the contrary, I believe AVXS-101's proposed therapeutic dose of (2.0E14 vg/kg) which is used in the study will be the official commercial amount administered if it is approved by the FDA. Or at least that is what I assume is the case by the phrase, \"proposed therapeutic dose,\" as written in the press release. \n\nTotal Participants:\n\nIn the Spinraza study a total of 28 participants with SMA type 2 and 3 aged 2-14 were given treatment.\nIn the AVXS-101 study, a total of 15 participants all SMA type 1 infants.\n\nResults - Safety &amp; Tolerability:\n\nA total of 72 Adverse Effects (AE) were reported in the Spinraza study.\n- Of the total, 2 mild AE were reported and potentially related to Spinraza and resolved spontaneously.\n- Of the total, 0 serious AE were observed for any patient throughout the study.\nA total of 256 AE were reported in the AVXS-101 study.\n- Of the total, 5 AE were observed and thought to be related to the effects of AVXS-101. 2 were considered serious and 3 were considered non-serious, in each case was treated successfully with prednisolone.\n- Of the total, 52 serious AE (2 of which were potentially treatment related as noted above) were reported. \n\nThere is a sizable discrepancy between reported AE for both the Spinraza and AVXS-101 study. 72 vs. 256. In addition, with the Spinraza study there were no serious AE observed related to the drug, whereas in the case of AVXS-101 there were 2 serious AE related to that particular drug. But it is important to note the patient population for both studies. SMA type 2 and 3 individuals ages 2-14 participated in the Spinraza phase 1 study. However, in the AVXS-101 study eligible participants were restricted to infants with type 1 SMA. Due to the faster progression of SMA type 1, it is expected for the AVXS-101 study to yield more AE (In this case almost 3.5x more with a smaller patient sample). Other than the 2 serious AE potentially related to AVXS-101 (Which were treated for), similar to Spinraza the results of the phase 1 study indicated no real danger to its safety and tolerability.\n\nResults - Outcome Measures\n\nIn the AVXS-101 phase 1 study they proposed 3 different kind of outcome measures to gauge whether \nor not the drug is clinically effective:\n\n- \"Time from birth to an \u201cevent,\u201d which was defined as either death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively.\"\n- Video confirming the ability to sit unassisted or independently\n- Objective assessments using a standard motor milestone development survey and Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND).\n\nFor the Spinraza study only 1 kind of outcome measure was used to assess clinical efficacy, which was the use of objective assessments (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory). \n\nWhen comparing the 2 drugs and its clinical effects when measured by objective assessments, in my opinion a direct comparison to determine which of the 2 is more effective as a drug does not bode well. Primarily because these 2 drugs were given to very different subtypes of SMA and the age in which the drug becomes administered probably plays a big role. Had these 2 drugs been administered to individuals with the same subtype of SMA and similar ages, then yes in my opinion the comparison would be more fair. \n\nBut regardless both drugs resulted in motor improvements above baseline and sustained such gained motor achievement beyond what is normally expected as suggested by the natural progression or history of the disease. As mentioned in the CureSMA post, 2 SMA type 1 patients had achieved the ability to walk independently in the AVXS-101 phase 1 study. As far as I could make out in the phase 1 study of the Spinraza study none of the initial non-ambulatory patients were able to walk independently throughout the duration of the study (I could be wrong here, but nothing was mentioned). \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHope all of the above made sense and answered your question. I am by all means not an SMA expert or a science person, but just a dude with SMA type 2 who has way too much free time. :)\n\n\n\n I have been told yes. Spinraza targets the SMN2 genes' mRNA while AVXS inserts the missing SMN1 gene. Well you are doing something productive with that free time thanks!", "Uk to offer Nusinersen to people with SMA3 and who cannot walk  Did not think this would happen so will have to start letting my brain think about this again. Your brain is definitely bigger than mine, and I am sure you will make the right call for you, but for what it is worth I would say go for it. \nHaving seen with my own eyes how well this works for some people I would say it is absolutely worth a \"shot\".\nSorry for the horrible pun, could not resist.

It was an awesome surprise to see it so active when I popped back in! So I was wondering if anyone wanted to take over as moderator? Cheers :) I can definitely help. I am available if need be", " How do you manage using the bathroom, especially people who work outside of home? I hope I am not asking too much of a personal question here.  A few years ago, I broke my leg and have been wheelchair bound since.  Prior to that, I was able to stand and walk a little with the use of a walker. My family and I thought I would be able to regain my strength after my leg healed but this has not been the case.\n\nAs such, I need a lot of help using the bathroom and doing daily transfers.  I have been entertaining the idea of going to work but one of my biggest concerns is needing to use the bathroom, which I absolutely cannot do independently.  \n\nTL;DR: Are there techniques or adaptive equipment you use to be able to use the bathroom?\n\nThanks! I carry one of ( inside a shaving kit bag so that it is discreet.  Clean it out daily with soapy water when you get home. \n\nI am assuming you are male, I do not have any advice otherwise.  I am not, but it does look like there is a (  Part of me wants to see videos of how to use it but another part is like, ehh that sounds gross. Haha I do not blame you. Hey, check wikihow or something. They have *everything*. Female here. Honestly, if you require the use of a hoist to be lifted and positioned on the toilet then I have found there is not much you can do aside from hold it in (or you could get a catheter). If you are able to raise yourself from your seat using your hands then a pee bottle like the above might work in which case I would totally go for it. Glad I have friends who work at nursing homes, those are expensive otc. They cost medical places only 50 cents a piece or so. Good idea, thanks!  Yeah my in home physical therapist pretty much said the same thing. As of now, there does not seem like any options for independent bathroom use  Yep, I just get mine from CVS and keep them clean. Soap and water every day, and bleach once a month.  Yeah it sucks, and to be honest there is not much awareness about it. Colleagues often ask me why I never drink coffee/tea/water at work and why I never seem to leave my desk to go to the bathroom and are shocked to hear the disabled bathrooms are not universally suitable for all disabled people. They then usually tell me about how we have equality laws now and how I should ask the place I work to adapt the bathroom for me. They have no idea that I would literally have to be the CEO to get the bathroom adapted for myself. It is actually kind of funny how much people believe we are protected by equality laws. If you do not mind me asking, what do you do when you have to go? Or do you work specific hours to avoid needing to go at work? I am concerned about that problem if I ever do start working out of the home.  Honestly, I have just become really good at holding it in - I can usually do 8-9 hours but can go up to 12 hours on a good day. It is a serious problem for work - I am lucky that my current situation is flexible so I can work from home if I really have to leave to go home and pee but it has not always been like that and it will not always be like that. It is something that worries me a lot and I have decided I need to try to look for work that is flexible about working some hours from home when my current position finishes...\n\nSorry, wish I could be more helpful. Really feel you. Oh wow that is impressive although I cannot imagine that being good for your bladder.  And do not worry about it, your feedback was really helpful because it gave me a rough idea of what other people with SMA are doing about working and using the bathroom.  So thank you! Female here with really weak hand function. I have a suprapubic catheter since about one and a half year now. It is one of the best decisions I have ever made :) I can now independently use the bathroom wherever I am. However I do not have a \"sack\" thingy attached to it. Rather it ends in a little \"tap\" so I position myself next to the toilet and just open the tap. When done I simply close it and put it back underneath my clothing. \nI do not know if you were looking for this kind of more radical options, and if not I am sorry then just please ignore this :) No this helps a lot, thank you! I am curious to all solutions that people, specifically females, with SMA are doing to use the bathroom.  Heh, we got to be inventive :) Better than the alternative!  Female here, type 3. Use to be able to stand, sit on toilet, then park my chair in front of the toilet and push myself up to a standing position using the seat and armrests, then sit back in wheelchair, but I do not have the arm strength anymore. Now I use something called a Freshette female urinary device and stand to pee, but number twos are still out of the question. The Freshette can also be used while in a seated position, so can be used from the wheelchair if seated on the edge and wearing a skirt, and also works great at night (with an empty bottle) when I am way too tired and weak to get out of bed to go when I have to. Thank you for your input! I will definitely look into this product!  No problem. It is seriously the best purchase I have ever made and has saved me a lot of stress and worrying about using public toilets or drinking too much before bed. If you are in the US I think the cheapest and easiest place to buy is REI for $22. Unlike the other female urinary devices on the market, these are hard plastic instead of rubber with a long and high back so are a lot easier to use while seated on the edge of a chair/bed. I just noticed that the Freshette website sells them too in a \"Medical\" package that comes with an extra long tube along with the smaller one. Pro-tip: test it at home first, and point it way down so the back is snug against you. When you use it in bed, are you sitting or lying down?\n\nAlso, thanks for the tip! I was planning on testing all these products in my shower chair to prevent a mess from happening on my chair.  I also recently got a suprapubic catheter. Where do you place the catheter beneath your clothes? I currently have it tucked underneath the waistband of my pants. However, the way it is placed makes the tube a tad too short for it to reach the toilet. I have to use a urinal/disposable bag. Just wanted to compare notes in case there is a more efficient way to be doing this! I just tuck it inside my pants too. Pretty close to the \"opening/wound\" whatever you want to call it I have it taped onto my lower belly for safety reasons, that way I cannot pull too far or harm anything, and then I just have it underneath my pants. Whenever I need to use the bathroom I pull my pants forward and take it out, and it is just long enough to reach the toilet with slightly pulling on it and leaning forward a bit. I have learned that it is easier to park on the side of the toilet and point either left or right, because that distance is smaller than reaching the toilet when you would be positioned right in front of it. Do not know if this is helpful, but I really hope so. If you have any more specific questions or if this was not entirely clear please let me know :) I sit on the edge of the bed with my feet on the floor, with it pointing down into an empty bottle that I stick the hose into, then just dump and wash both as well as the plastic pouch you store it in (included) with soap the following morning.   \n\nNot sure it would work lying down without having a way to flow down and out.", "If only SMA came with a handbook So in January I fell down stairs and broke my foot. Not a fun way to get down the stairs lol. I felt so bad for my poor BF because he was getting weird looks from all the medical staff at the urgent care when I said I fell down the stairs. Unfortunately, it has not really been healing and now three days ago I fell again and re-messed up what little healing had happened. I was not really wearing the air cast like I should have because it is near impossible to walk in. After this fall I finally gave in and asked for a surgery consult. Not really what I want, but I am so over this lol. Living on the couch for the last three months has really taken its toll on what little strength I had left. It would be nice if living with SMA came with a handbook. I need one that says do not try that dummy at the end of each page highlighted and underlined.\n\nI like my ortho doc, but I can tell he does not totally understand the limitations I have with the SMA. Some of that may just be that I have never really been the best at explaining it. I guess I would much rather have a good doc who does not quite understand, than docs who understand more-ish and are total a\\*\\*holes. I had my annual neurology visit in February too. I should say annual loosely, since I procrastinated for close for two years. I swear I never see the same neurologist twice and this year was really weird and probably borderline inappropriate with what the one doc was saying to me. My BF went with me because of my foot and he was kind of shocked at some of things the doc said. I was supposed to see my neurologist and I somehow got stuck with him. I guess sometimes you just have to roll with the punches. I am glad for my awesome primary care doc and nice ortho doc otherwise I would lose all hope of docs if I was only going to neurology.\n\nSorry, I did not mean to have such a long post. I just started typing and it all came out lol. I am a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n-  (\n\n&amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and do not vote in the other threads.) ^\\((/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^(/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* From personal experience (two broken femurs and tibia that required surgery), I would daresay that people with SMA take longer to heal broken bones. My orthopedic surgeon told me that I would be back to 100% in six months, but it actually took about a year and a half. Two years later, my bones are basically back to normal and it feels like the injuries are completely gone.\n\nNow, if you look at it logically, our bones are not as dense and are much more fragile. I assume this also means they take longer to heal. Make sure to take vitamin D supplements, as well as multivitamins. In your case, I would suggest One-A-Day Women's Multivitamin Tablets, and also eating plenty of protein and calcium (make sure you also drink plenty of water to avoid calcium buildup in your kidneys).\n\nTake my advice with a grain of salt though; I am not a doctor and I am only speaking from personal experience. Give yourself grace. I used to stand and pivot to get out of bed and into my wheelchair and fell once when I was 20. That one fall fractured my femur (and both big toes) because I had no idea that I had osteoporosis and should have been on something for bone density. I never recovered the strength I lost while laid up recovering, so I used to berate myself. But there is not much you can do besides be kind to yourself and do what you can. I already take a multivitamin for women and magnesium. I am kind of dreading if I have to get the surgery, but I want to get it fixed and not hurting at the same time. \n\nI might get curious at my next appt and ask if he thinks the SMA could slow things down. Like I said I have not been good wearing the boot and I hear foot bones are slow healing already because of bad blood flow. My feet are always freezing even in the summer, so I know my feet have bad blood flow. My BF always gets mad when I put my cold feel on him lol. Ouch! That must have really sucked.\n\nHow I have not broken more bones is beyond me. Mostly just torn my hips up falling so far, but I have been able to adjust to it somewhat. I wish doctors would have warned me when I was younger about the joys of getting older with SMA or MD in general. It is a neuromuscular disease, but not a type of MD. Do you have a doctor following your progression? My point was that I heads up about some commons issues would have been nice. Pretty sure I covered the neurology issue in my post, so yeah I do. Right, I mean IS there someone you could go see more than once? Hard for them to help you know what is coming if every appointment is their first time meeting you and they cannot see changes in you from year to year. Oh, I gotcha. Yeah, a new person every year is annoying and not helpful at all. That is why I hate going to neurology. I have never had any luck with them.\n\nI have been going to the same GP for about 4 years now and he is told me he does not know to much about SMA other than what he has googled lol, but if I need anything he is more than happy to help or put in referrals. He is a really good guy. So I kind of manage it myself and ask for help when I need it. Not ideal, but I guess it works for me. Just make sure you keep as much muscle as you can active by exercising. The last thing you want with SMA is lying on couch and doing nothing, believe me. Hope everything goes well. Take care!", "SMA or not? I am confused I have been going through different tests in the last two years ( currently I am on hold because probably they forgot about me).\n\nTests have indicated that something it is wrong with my nerves and not with my muscles so they suspected SMA. I went through the genetic testing and it came back negative. They said that some genes might be mutated so they ordered a second test which I do not have the results for, in months.\n\nI am slower than other people when I have to do stairs, I am a slow runner (I am running pretty weird and can not run for more than 50 metres without getting tired, or even less) and also I can not get up from the ground or a from a squat without the help of my hands. My arms are weak in the matter that I can not lift a box and keep it on my arms but I can lift a bag of 10 kilos (harder than others but I can). My hands are shaking all the time and my posture is a bit bad (mild scoliosis. But other than that. I live normal, I walk normal and I can walk for many kilometres but I feel limited to some degree.\n\nMY QUESTION IS: Is anyone here that is experiencing the same symptoms and has been diagnosticated with SMA? Everytime I am trying to look out for similar people with SMA on youtube, I see people that are very advanced with their symptoms and that does not give me any clue and I am really confused. I had somewhat similar symptoms when I was younger, but everyone is different. There are a lot of different muscular dystrophies out there. I have type III, which is milder. It has still gotten worse over the years and especially the last two years or so. I was never able to squat and have never done stairs normal. I have always had to take stairs one at a time and had to use my arms to get up from sitting. My arms have never really been affected beside my hands shaking. My thighs are super weak and I have never had reflexes in my legs. I have just learned to compensate as best I can over the years. \n\nI would say typically, but not always, it is usually your thighs and trunk of the body that get weaker first, then it kind of goes out from there. My arms are also weak but only to a certain degree. The fingers are weak especially. How did your symptoms evolved? How weak are you now? My fingers have never been an issue. Usually SMA effects the things closest to the spine first, but I am not a doctor. \n\nOver the years my main issues have been my legs being weak especially my thighs. I used to be able to walk pretty long distances, but now I can only go a few hundred yards and have to stop to rest. My balance is awful. I can still do stairs, but it is a million times harder than when I was little. When I was little I used to be able to get off the floor with just the help of my arms, but now I was to get myself to a chair then I can get up from there. \n\nJust mainly a general slow decline of my legs and my back somewhat. For everyone it is different though even within the different types people decline or stay steady at different rates. Do you have access to a good neurologist?  My son has SMA type 3 and we saw a lot of Docs who could not tell us what was going on, until we got to nephrology. \nSpeaking only from personal experience I think a qualified neurologist who has access to the right testing equipment should be able to tell you definitively if you have SMA in pretty short order. This sounds exactly like my 17 year old SMA 3. Do you have access to the invitae testing for SMA? It is much better than a lot of other DNA test out there from our experience. Granted we only did 3 DNA test to get an answer. How old are you now? How old was your son when diagnosed? I do not know. My neurologist did not contact me since the first results. I am in Denmark and the healthcare system here is free and therefore they are doing what they consider is suitable. When my first results came she said that all my SMA genes look good and she will resend the tests to find out if any of them are mutated. Yeah that is not good, some DNA test do not/cannot test for deletions which is exactly what SMA is. They have to do the test that specifically test for SMN1 deletions. Just like sometimes genes can just be kind of out of order. Only certain test can pick that up etc. regardless of Denmark or US you ha e a right to know what test was performed and how it works? Next up commonly SMA patients are misdiagnosed with Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. I would also look into that 9 years old. My sons were not diagnosed until 16 and 13. What were your early warning signs? I am 27 now. Different gait when he ran and random falls for no apparent reason are the big ones I remember. \nHow about you? Spinraza? Exact same No, been fighting since March to get on it, but at this point I am guessing I am not going to get it or not anytime soon when it might actually help. Cool beans\nSMA kids are awesome and you have two. Congrats! They really are. I wish I could split the level of intelligence in my youngest SMA child between all of my kids. I would have 4 geniuses. What state are you in? I remember someone saying how the SMA kids at their camp were affectionately referred to as \"SMArty pants\" by some of the other non-SMA campers.  Something to that lol Ohio I am baffled that you cannot access it. Biogen has a copay assistance program. Have you applied there? As a matter of fact after insurance declines you three times it is basically  approved with them.", "Nephew diagnosed 2 weeks old SMA Type1. Advice? I am not sure how many SMN2 genes he has, my sister is obviously taking it hard and I am not going to bug her for details.  As I said, my nephew is type 1, will start his treatment, Zolgensma, here soon. He is pre-symptomatic, for all I know, what should I expect for life expectancy and motor skills? Will we ever be able to play catch? Its scary not knowing what is going to happen, especially with life quality and expectancy, it is tough to find any information on life after zolgensma. I see stuff saying motor skills goals met, but what does that actually mean? Will he be able to do his daily tasks on his own?  \n\nI want to try to stay positive and treat him the same as any kid, but I am scared. So many thoughts run through my head, like are my genes not worthy of surviving, will my sisters fun in life end, what do I need to do to prevent her and my brother in law from being depressed. I tell myself a normal life does not necessarily equate to a good life, but the way the world is set up there are a lot more challenges, like can they go on vacations and go on roller coasters as a family, etc. Its been hard to have straight thoughts recently, I am scared and hoping this sub could give me some comfort and answers and advice. Thanks I am just a Parent of a type 2 on spinraza-not a doctor, but with such early treatment you can reasonably hope for a normal life span- especially as current treatments will hopefully be replaced in time with even better things. \n\nI do not believe anyone knows how each child will respond, these treatments only do so much by themselves and it is hard to separate that result from the vastly differing amount of physiotherapy kids are able to do/access. Once again, starting at such a young age gives a lot of hope for a high level of Independence. \n\nFamilies all go through the trauma of a diagnosis so differently so I can only share my experience. It took a year for everyone outside the house to seem to get over it, and three years on Mum and Dad in the house are starting to have more normal lives again, our pathway to treatment was harsh and if it had been straightforwardly would have likely helped immensely. \n\nStay positive the best you can,  this is not the past and kids with treatment are  not facing the the same things that a google search of sma(especially type 1) being up Welcome to the wild west of SMA with treatment. As a 33 year old with SMA2, the important thing to remember is that kids and adults with SMA can thrive with the right support (good high paying jobs, relationships). Starting treatment that fast is a great start, going forward what I would advise is focus on him developing the skills he will need, such as self advocacy. Socialization is also critical, be that cool uncle he can just talk to and hang out. Help him develop hobbies and interests that are compatible with his abilities. As for catch, you will will figure it out. \n\nOh, and get vaccinated. Do not be the asshole who gives him COVID. Pulmonary illness is no joke with SMA. Aw thank you so much :) Hahahaha good advice thank you. And of course been vaccinated getting whooping cough vaccine here soon too! My daughter was diagnosed as type 1. We were told she would not live to see her second birthday. She just turned 8 by the way.\n\nWhen she was born, there were no drugs to treat this. I have heard amazing things about these new drugs. I have heard these kids who take them early have better chances of living a normal life.\n\nI am sorry this has happened to your nephew. You are a great uncle for you to come here and post this. Your nephew has good things ahead for him.\n\nYour sister and brother in law are going through a rough time right now. Stay positive friend. Help wherever you can. Help them see the light at the end of the tunnel. Your nephew will be ok. Who knows what kind of life he will live? It will be a good life.\n\nIn the meantime, stay as strong and positive as you can be. Rephrase negative thoughts into positive ones. It is ok to be afraid. Do not vocalize it.\n\nHang in there friend.", "Need smart people interested in SMA type 2.or 3 to read and translate this.  Is this good news or no news?\nAny help interpreting this article and putting it in plain English would be great.  The good news is that in the study that has been done, there has been signs that the drug works and promotes increasing the Gen that people with SMA miss out on. Further study could tell if this helps the patients with better muscle control and strength. Or... It could be that it is not as effective as they hoped. It is all a waiting game. I hate waiting, but thank you.  Me too! I hope my brother can access spinraza soon and try that out. It is a miracle there is even 1 medicine for this incredibly complicated desease The article indicates that the drug is doing what they want it to do at the molecular level (i.e. overcoming the splicing issues in SMA patients and allowing them to produce more SMN2 protein). As a molecular bio person, my first question is \"OK but where? In which tissues?\". They have not clarified that, although maybe that has been published elsewhere. However, they must have some indication that SMN2 protein is being produced where it is needed or they would likely not be continuing with the trials (trials are extremely expensive).\n\nIt also indicates that, so far, there are no adverse effects. It is great that it has shown molecular change during the first part of the trial but it is difficult to say whether that will translate to seeing positive change in the patient in later trial phases. My gut feeling would be that they will likely see at least *some* change in later trials, but it is impossible to say how much. \n\nThese are the things you need to wait for:\n- Does the change at the molecular level correspond with a change in the patient's abilities or maintenance of their abilities?\n- Are there any long-term side-effects.\n\nAny press releases that do not include such information should always be viewed with nothing more than very cautious optimism.\n\nOn an aside, just for general info: In general, phase 1-2 trials are where the drug is most likely to fail. It sounds like they do not think it will fail (these are preliminary results from phase  2). The probability of failure is still quite high in phase 3 (up to approximately 50%) but not as high as the first two phases. Cautious optimism! Wow that was really good thank you. You should have written the article. \nLong way to go but not bad news anyways. \nIf we can get 20 or so drugs on the clinical trial train (which is about what there is now I thimk), even if the odds are not great for most of them, maybe we get one.  And it only takes one if it is the right one.  If anyone needs technical/scientific explanations i reckon /u/TinyLittleStormCloud is your first point of call. I actually just contacted Roche about this possible treatment to see if they could consider applying for the EAMS (Early Access to Medicine Scheme] scheme in the UK. Fingers crossed they look into it. That is a fantastic idea about Roche. How did you go about that?\n\nAlso - this totally reminds me - I have my annual appointment at the neuromuscular centre in September. I will ask if they have heard anything about Spinraza for our age group (I know NICE is still reviewing it but I am sure the doctors must be thinking about what is possible and what is not). And I will ask about this Roche drug (which has a very unmemorable name!!). Will make sure to update you on what they say! Hey you. I heard about EAMS from a youtube vid so thought I will be cheeky and send them a Facebook message. They took all my contact details so we shall wait and see what they say! \n\nThat will be great if you could pass on what you hear!  Hey, looked into it a little further for you. \n\nSo the primary aim of their study will be to look at the change in motor function in the individual, they are still recruiting participants for this part of the trial but are scheduled to have this data by April 2019. The trial will likely continue beyond that to collect further info, up until 2020.\n\nAlso - remember how I said my first question would be what tissue did they see this increase in SMN2 expression in? Turns out they are looking in blood. So I did some reading about whether that is reliable or not (because obviously we care about it being in nerves, muscles etc).  There has been some work done on this and they think measurement of SMN mRNA and protein levels in blood is reliable but the catch seems to be that for SMA2 and SMA3 the level of these markers in the blood do not necessarily bear any correlation to disease severity. So we do not know if this 400% increase in  blood will actually correlate with reduced disease severity until the trial results are out. I wish I could get more details from this paper on the reliability of blood measurements but I am afraid my workplace does not subscribe to the journal where this is published so I am locked out at the moment.\n\nHope that gives a slightly clearer picture though.", "Liam (1) is fundraising for Zolgensma Hi all,\n\nMy name is Pim Coffeng (hence the nickname thenamepim) and I have just started this ( for the Dutch/Polish boy Liam Tomaszewski (1).

It is like a million little things that add up to me feeling like I have regained some part of myself I have been missing. I cannot wait to see what other changes continue to happen. And I sincerely hope that you and everyone else still fighting to get Spinraza can get it soon. It might not be a cure, but it sure is a miracle.  Medicaid recently approved me so I plan on making a post in a few months with my experience! Just curious. How old are you? I am 29 years old. Weakish type 3.  My child has been getting Spinraza since 2017.  It 100% works and we would travel 4 hours or 400 hours if that is what it took to get it. It works, I am 30 years old type 2 and have had 6 doses. I have noticed better breathing, increased balance, and energy. \n\nMake sure they have got a good IR team.  My daughter is 15 monthes type 1 and getting her 5# dose on Monday.  We live 2 1/2 hrs from our treatment site but we would travel as far as we would have to.  She is been making amazing progress compared to where she was before treatment. Hmmm... I am 34 type 2. I am very curious how well it will work. Hopefully noticably well\ud83e\udd1e 34 type 2 here, any noticable effects on your arms? My arm strength has been diminishing a lot the past few years, not that it was ever good but it is been much worse. Hey, unboogyman, just a quick heads-up:  \n**noticable** is actually spelled **noticeable**. You can remember it by **remember the middle e**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. I, for one, welcome our spell-correcting robot overlords. Let us know how it goes! I love hearing about and seeing the gains people are making.  23 when I started, 25 next week. Type 2\n\nI seem to be in the minority. I seem to be the only one who has not improved much if at all. It may have slowed down progression I am not sure. But I cannot tell a difference. I am holding out hope for other treatments in the future.\n\nIf anyone is reading this though, do not be discouraged, I am a very rare case. The overwhelming majority have had substantial life improvements. *OwO, what is this? * It is your **3rd Cakeday** wvnative01! ^(hug) Hoping that future therapies will help you buddy. Stay strong. My kid has been getting it since two months of age. She is type one with respiratory support. She is had five doses so far. Since getting it, we have seen her consistently gain strength. She sprints off the vent. She is starting to initiate muscles in her trunk and shoulder to help roll (cannot do it on her own yet). We see evidence of head control starting. When she is in her adaptive stroller, she now swings her legs. There is much more spontaneous movement than there was and we look forward to that continuing. \n\nIn short - I would fly to the other side of the galaxy to get it for her if I had to. ", "Ukulele Has anyone tried playing Ukulele? I bought one recently and thought I could handle it but seems like I can only play one finger chords. \ud83d\ude14 I really want to try some songs on it. Is there any way that you guys know of? That Is so annoying to hear. I tried playing the uke as well cuz i thought i would be fine and I am sma 3 and still could not really play it, it was very frustrating. I can play quite a few songs on the keyboard tho so maybe try that? Some chords there is no way but 3 finger chords on the piano are fine for me. Hope this helps :) Yeah I did try learning keyboard as a kid too. Even took some home tuitions for it. And as you said, I could only play three finger chords with my left, while I could play some treble notes with my right. It got really frustrating when I could not play any actual song and I gave up eventually. Now my keyboard sits somewhere deep in one of my cupboards. Seems like uke is no good either :( I have not tried it personally, but maybe you would like the thumb piano \n\n That is great. Thumbs at the ready! Oh yeah!! Saw this a few months ago... I should have bought this instead :( This should work fine. Thumbs are the strongest. :) In a similar situation I was really interested in playing a small travel guitar or ukulele until a friend brought me to the music store and I saw that they had harmonicas as well as the neck harness for the harmonica. Basically meaning you can play the thing without having to hold it. If you curious to what I am talking about Bruce Springsteen I think uses one. I am not a Springsteen fan I just have this picture in the back of my head but feel like I remember seeing him with one... Anyways, if the ukulele does not work out harmonicas are pretty awesome! I have a uke! SMA3 btw.\n\nTry checking out the list of chords and try using your thumb for the highest fret instead. If all else fails, make up your own chords and roll with it XD Sounds cool", "Regenerative treatment? Hi everyone. My daughter was born already unable to breathe and with no ability to move anything but her eyes and lips. She had no complete SMN1 genes and only 1 copy of SMN2. \n\nDoes anyone know of any work being done on regenerative treatments rather than just the several treatments that happy the progress of the disease? How old is your daughter? If she is still young she may be a candidate for Zolgensma. She has type 1? Depending on the literature, the severity and pre-birth onset on symptoms is called Type 0 (or grouped in with Type 1). She died at 10 days old.\n\nShe was not a candidate for zolgensma or spinraza--only a regenerative treatment could have helped her, which is why I was wondering if anyone has heard of work being done on one. I am so so sorry for your loss. I have never heard of there being a Type 0, but to be fair, I am 26 with Type 2 and all of the people I know with SMA are diagnosed as Types 1-4. May I ask why she was not a candidate? Being born with Type 0 is rare, and when it does happen they do not make it home. My daughter lived her entire life on a respirator because the damage was so advanced before she was even born--if the neonatologist had not been in the room where she was born, she may not have made it to the NICU.\n\nNeither treatment repairs damage already done, so they could not give my daughter a life. The whole strategy for SMA treatment seems to be to stop it from getting worse, which is why I was wondering whether there is anything better in the horizon. Well, that is the thing. Technically, yes, Spinraza only stops the progression of the disease. However, that is based on their research that was approved by the FDA. Now that there are more people with SMA on the drugs, they have noticed people slowly getting stronger. From my perspective, unfortunately, it seems as though these drugs would not have had the time to help your daughter and it would have been more painful for her for something that probably would not help. As far as treatments that would help faster than these or research being done, there are not any. I am so sorry to say all of this. I am 26 and it took 23 years of my life before Spinraza was founded and approved. It is sad to say, but SMA is not a top priority in the field of research. I believe I read once that Spinraza was the first treatment developed since the 60s. Science has come a long way, but we are still far from a cure. I am so sorry for your loss. I cannot imagine that pain. I was not supposed to live past 5 and my mom and I often talk about those first five years. It is a terrible feeling. I am here if you ever need someone to talk to. I am very sorry for your loss.  Cannot even imagine walking in your shoes. \nYou are asking the same question I have been asking almost since Spinraza came out. I am most familiar with that treatment because my son is getting it. It definitely seems to have prevented any further decline in physical abilities, and may be leading to some small improvements. So it is a miracle drug, plain and simple. But I want more, and specifically I want what you are asking about. Something to get kids and adults to where they would have been, but for the SMA. As far as I know that treatment does not exist yet. \n\nI will be forever grateful for the miracle of Spinraza. But the next big thing cannot get here soon enough.", "How long do Spinraza side effects last? Hi there, had a quick question about Spinraza side effects. In short, do they last over a week? \n\nI just had my first injection last Thursday (6/13) and I noticed 4 days later, my back was really hurting and my foot was tingling. I called my doctor who recommended going to the ER to get some chest x-rays and a CT scan, both of which came back normal. The doctors suggested I take pain meds. It still hurts though and I am not sure why. The pain feels like it is pinching a nerve around my lower back and hip area. \n\nHas anyone else had similar symptoms? I am nervous because my next injection is coming up and I am afraid the pain will get worse. That is not a side effect of spinraza, it is a side effect of the spinal tap. It usually lasts for a week... Hi there, I had the same exact issue my first injection. It is caused by the procedure itself. They think they nicked my sciatic nerve during the injection. My pain was intense, no pain killers touched it. It went away in about a week and a half. The second procedure was a lot better. Not sure if because it was a different doc and he was more careful or what. Thanks for sharing! I was afraid all my injections would be like this and that I would just be in constant pain for about 2 months. Glad to know it is probably just from the procedure itself Thanks! That makes me feel a little better", "Gender and dating with SMA Is it just me or is it a lot harder for women with SMA to find quality boyfriends (read: not fetishy, not into control) than with the genders reverse? What!?  Honestly I thought that the gals had an easier time then the guys.  \n\nHonestly when it comes to SMA, regardless of the gender, I think that the severity of the disease ends up dictating the reality of a relationship. I think for some reason or other dudes with SMA have a bit more visibility - quality boyfriends do exist though. I have seen articles in SMA newsletters about married women with kids, I have got a quality SO myself (10/10) and know another woman with SMA who also does and there is also (Baroness Campbell) who is married. I think in reality it is 50/50 but all I can add is this. I have SMA type 2 and I am also transgender (m2f.) I have had more interest since presenting female. This might be because I am more comfortable with myself now. Personally, I never really struggled with relationships, though I never really had dates or GFs in high school. I was a shut-in back in college by choice and never really bothered dating, though I had an online relationship for nearly 4 years with an average girl that did not care about my disability (we met IRL a couple times). \n\nI am now in my early 30s and happily married. I do not think I did anything special to deserve/win her over, but I definitely did not let my SMA get in the way. I just try to be as \"normal\" as possible and that seems to work out. Just wondering, do you have a paid caregiver or does your wife do all of that?", "My daughter might have SMA, I got questions please My 8 month old daughter has tongue fasciculations and delayed gross motor development.\n\nBut they dont want to test her for SMA because she isnt hypotonic or muscle weakness.\n\nI wonder if its normal for just tongue fasciculations happen before the weakness starts? Does anyone have experience? Is disease-modifying treatment available where you live? You might be able to get testing done at no cost. Source: am child neurologist in the US. Sadly no", "Wrote about my Spinraza Injections, Issues, Progress, etc... Adult, 44, SMA Type 3 Howdy!\n\nMy name is Sandra, I am 44. I have SMA type 3 and I just got through my loading doses for Spinraza a week and a half ago. \n\nDue to the Harrington Rod hardware in my back, I was not able to get a lumbar puncture. The administering doctor had to do a cervical injection. Usually it would be either behind my right ear or lower on the right side of my neck. \n\nLidocaine was used to numb the area but other than that, I did not receive/choose any other anesthetic. \n\nI did have a two week delay after the first dose because the protein levels in my urine were abnormally high (875, when normal range is between 20-161). After getting checked out by my primary to ensure my kidneys were working properly, it was discovered that I just needed to drink more water. Lots more water. After that, my levels returned to normal. \n\nExcept for the second and last injection, where I experienced mild headache feelings for a few hours the next day due to being slightly dehydrated, I have not had any adverse reactions to the medication. \n\nI experienced improvement within 30min of the first injection. I had a hard time breathing while laying on my back but while I was in recovery, I was able to breathe in deeply and comfortably. I usually do not drink fluids while I am on my back either, but I was able to swallow down the cranberry juice they offered me, while laying on my back, slightly elevated. \n\nWithin an hour of the first injection, I was eating and was able to swallow down my food without having to follow it with water or to overly chew it into a liquidy mass beforehand. A bit TMI but going No.2 was way easier the next day. \n\nAfter each injection, I noticed more improvement:\n\n\u2022 my arms no longer felt like they were burning after doing anything\n\n\u2022 I was able to go to the store and do some light shopping by myself. I stopped being able to do that over two years ago\n\n\u2022 I was able to go to GoodWill and rummage through their housewares shelf without feeling like my arms were about to fall off from exertion\n\n\u2022 My joints are more limber\n\n\u2022 I was able to eat a sliced apple with skin for the first time in four years\n\n\u2022 I was able to clean off my dresser top for the first time in 6 years\n\n\u2022 I wrote 7 letters to thank the staff at the hospital, within two hours. Usually handwriting anything leaves me pooped after 20min\n\n\u2022 I am able to now put my Tupperware bowls in the microwave by myself\n\n\u2022 I can now eat crunchy foods with more ease\n\n\u2022 I was able to adjust my arms enough on my own to eat my cut up pizza with a fork. \n\n\u2022 I can sit unassisted in my chair without the backrest or headrest propping me up\n\n\u2022 I can lift up a 3/4 full bottle of water and hold it while I drive my chair to my table, with the same hand \n\n\u2022 at my follow up evaluation, I was able to lift a 200g weight straight off the table and move it to the right without dragging it. I was not able to do that last year or early July this year right before the injections started\n\n\u2022 I am able to move my arm to my controller by myself - have not been able to do that in over two years \n\nAnd so much more. \n\nA few things I think have been key for me:\n\n- my neurologist started me on PT last October, 2x a week. It sucked and hurt pretty bad but I really think this helped my muscles once I started the injections this July. \n\n- I still kept up with the PT while I was getting the injections and I continue with them now. I know this helped me when I got my follow-up evaluation and I was able to gain two points on the evaluation they did last week. The OT and neurologist were really surprised and impressed with my progress. After my re-evaluation, they will be recommending me to continue with the treatments. \n\n- During my injection period, I drank 5 bottles (500ml each) just about EVERY DAY. This kept me from getting terrible headaches and kept my kidneys flushed. \n\n- I am also on a low dose high blood pressure pill - this started independently from the Spinraza treatments. But I think it helps me normalize my BP through all of this. \n\nThis is a picture of me and part of the staff on the last day of my last loading dose. \n\nI am posting because when I was on the fence about starting treatments, I did not see much about older SMA folks and how we did with the injections. There was one young man who I remember posted and stated that he was now able to hold his cup of beer \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 That helped to convince me \ud83d\udc97 \n\nI hope this in-depth post helps someone else \ud83d\udc97\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions!\n\nEDITED TO ADD:\n\nI wrote about my experience on my website. You can read more on the blog section -  they are headed under Disabled Chronicles 2, 2b, 2c, 2d and 2d1 Thanks for all that detail. Just to be able to feel one of those benefits would be amazing, but all of them. Bet it blows your mind!

Any help is appreciated. I am 26 and I have type two as well. And one of the things I miss so much is a possibility of playing videogames. I regret I did not play much videogames when I was able to.\n\nSo IMO if your son can  hold a handheld console or gamepad, a game console would be a great gift. We are all different, I am 26 and can still play video games with assistive technology. Others might lose that ability at a young age. its up to you to determine your sons abilities and interests Yeah I do that. I guess I just thought there might be ideas I have not thought of. An example would be tiny little toys with really movable parts but we have pretty well played that out. Maybe there is a type of toy or hobby we have not tapped into yet. I am 18 and have type one. I always really enjoyed finger painting. You do not have to move your hands to much and it could be a lot of fun to do together. Also as others suggested video games are great when you are younger and have more muscle ability, I have a Nintendo Switch and I am still able  to use it so that could be a good option. Feel free to dm if you want any other suggestions or have any questions about anything really PS 5 will be released soon ;) I have type 2, am 35, and at 5 I remember I was starting my love for video games.\n\nI know back then I was fine with regular controllers I am sure he would be too. I played with Lego, which was good for finger dexterity too. If he is Type 2 (like me), he probably would enjoy something he can actually play with like an iPad or computer. A lot of toys like Legos are harder for people with SMA to play with and put together. Have you ever checked out SteveInSpawn on Twitch? He is a talented gamer with SMA and is the COO of AbleGamers. His charity just got a $1mil donation from Twitch so he can keep hooking up disabled gamers with a setup that works for them.", "UK people: Flu Vaccine Supply Issues Hi guys,\n\nThose of you in the UK may have seen the occasional news article about delays with flu vaccine supplies this year which may be made worse if the UK ends up with a \"no-deal\" Brexit. I do not want to alarm anyone but there is very real concern about this happening. There is nothing anyone can really do about the vaccine but you can do other things to increase your protection in the meantime:\n\n- If you have not had a pneumococcal vaccine in the last 5 years you can consider getting one. In the UK, pneumococcal vaccine is not given every 5 years and a single dose in adulthood is generally considered sufficient until you turn 65. In other countries, people with underlying conditions are vaccinated every 5 years or so. Your GP, who holds your medical records, may well decide a pneumococcal vaccine is not necessary if you have already had one as an adult (though you can always ask, some GPs are happy to give you another). However, if it would make you feel better to have one, you can consider going to a pharmacy for one.\n\n- You can book an appointment with your GP to remind them you are at risk of complications from the flu and request to be contacted immediately once the vaccine is available.\n\n- You can book an appointment with your GP to request an emergency antibiotic prescription (and potentially inhaler). They can provide you with a prescription that you can collect from the pharmacy and store at home so that if you start displaying flu-like symptoms you can start protecting yourself from bacterial infection straight away. They cannot provide antibiotics in liquid form this way but they can provide capsules. These can be opened by your carer and the powder can be sprinkled on some yoghurt or jam to make it easier to swallow (just check with your GP that this is OK for whatever type of antibiotic they prescribe but generally it is thought to be fine for amoxicillin which is the standard). Your GP will still want to see you if you get sick (and can then switch you to liquid antibiotics) but this can provide some protection if you cannot get an appointment straight away.\n\n- During flu season, carers can be reminded that they need to wash their hands each and every time they are about to carry our a personal care task (or cooking/bringing you food or drink) and also as soon as they come into your home. Lots of people can be asymptomatic carriers of flu so hand-washing should be something they do routinely and not just if they are feeling a bit off. Disposable masks from Amazon are also available and can be worn by both you and the carer if they have to work when unwell. Cheers for that Storm and thank you brexiteers for your tireless work at making everyone is life harder. Sigh. Godspeed from across the pond.

A culture in which evidence is willfully ignored, a culture in which decisions are based solely on immediate cost and no evaluation of long-term finances, a culture in which empathy and compassion are lacking and trampling on fundamental human rights principles (like equality of healthcare) is becoming more and more commonplace. \n\nThis is a huge learning lesson for patients and advocacy groups. Advocacy groups in particular need to learn that raising awareness and money for research is one piece of the puzzle. Research does not occur in a vacuum, it occurs in the context of whatever climate the country is currently in. Personally, I do not think the advocacy groups have been loud or angry enough about the entire shambles that has been the process so far or about this final decision. If this had been happening to a HIV or cancer group, it would have been a major headline in the media by now.\n\nI am very glad to see Muntoni and Quinlivan speak on this. Muntoni especially is a huge figure in SMA research and his words carry a lot of weight. Honestly, this is the only decent response I have seen so far because I sure as hell have not seen much from the advocacy groups (aside from to tell everyone to stay hopeful and positive). A damning letter, implicitly stating they will have children's deaths on their consciences. TBH, I am sick and ashamed of my country.

What was it like it after 40 years of losing abilities, to have some come back? I find it difficult to get my mind around the concept of that! In the last 6 months, I had lost the ability to do certain tasks with my hands due to strength issues...  At first, I was like \"Hmmm, that is annoying\" and then would try again a few minutes later and no problem.  However, eventually, I could not do it no matter how long I \"rested.\"  I developed other, less convenient and annoying ways to do the tasks using tools and leverage.  There was probably two months of not being able to do it at all without tools, no matter how much I tried.\n\nAfter my third dose of Spinraza, I started trying to do it the \"old way\" again, and low and behold, I could do it, no problem...  Really weird, but all I can think is that it may/must be Spinraza related.  After losing an ability like that, its never come back... That is incredible. Thanks for sharing. Please keep posting.  No problem..  BTW buck, you were right on my other post, they do not need a full 5ml of spinal fluid.  They really only need enough to know for sure they are in the subarachnoid space.  My last dose was only 3ml of spinal fluid I believe...  Good call on that one... Man, I bet that was an amazing sensation. It is great to hear an actual real-world confirmation that it actually does something... Cheers for the info and I hope it carries on improving. Thanks. I have the advantage of my son being a fee weeks ahead of you in the Spinraza process, which means I have seen more shots. \nPlus he is my kid so I pay attention. If it was me I think I would just tell them to stick me and ignore everything else lol This is amazing. I am having my visit next week, and am hopeful the doctor will get me started on Spinraza right away. From videos I have seen on YouTube, some people are reporting similar results to yours, which is great. I am 31, and I lost the ability to type around 6 years ago (I used to type at 50+ WPM). Now, I use a combination of my left hand along with the on-screen keyboard (clicking with my right hand) when I am not using my voice recognition software, which actually works pretty good. Regardless, I would give anything to be able to type again so I could type on my own and play games that require high APM once again (e.g. SC2). I remember I lost the ability to right-click with my middle finger around 4 years ago, and that hit me really hard as a gamer. I have learned to adapt by using mice that have side buttons and reassigned the right-click to a button I can easily click with my thumb, but even that is becoming a hassle at times. \n\nI seriously cannot wait to try out Spinraza and hopefully regain the small little abilities that mean the world to me. I am also really eager to learn of any progress people are making in regards to breathing function and overall core strength. Thanks to all the people who are coming here to update us on the process, it is so much appreciated and it is so wonderful to hear some of us are already a few doses in.  I am 18 with type 3 and just had my first maintenance injection, 5th injection overall. Before I started my injections, I did a 6 minutes walking test to see how far I could walk in 6 minutes. 6 months later, the distance I can cover in the 6 has tripled. My grip strength also increases by 20-30%. I have made these improvements by swimming and light workouts.

Okay so... this is going to be a lot. Especially since I still do not understand it all. I have been experiencing symptoms since I was a child. I had feeding tubes on and off, migraines, pain, dislocations, weakness, just so much going at any given moment. It is been a slow progression, but definitely a progression nonetheless. \n\nThe first two things I was diagnosed with were Celiac and Hashimoto\u2019s, so two autoimmune conditions. I just could not keep weight on. And my blood work always came back shit. This was around late elementary/early middle school ages. I did do sports growing up but eventually had to quit because of pain, dislocations, and an inability to keep up. I would just get so exhausted by small tasks. I ended up doing hospital home bound a lot through middle-highschool and just overall just missing so much of my childhood stuck in the hospital. \n\nInto my teens there is an onset of weakness and neurological symptoms. By 18 I was experiencing more serious forms of this. There was even one point it felt stroke-like. It keeps progressing to the point where I need a cane, walker, then eventually a wheelchair. For the next 6 years I will be in and out of the chair working to gain strength. Sometimes it works and sometimes the damage seems to be permanent. For example, at one point my foot drop just never stopped. No amount of PT/OT could regain my strength. \n\nAround age 20 I was finally diagnosed with a genetic condition called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome Type III. It seemed to fit all my symptoms. I had a very very basic genetic panel done. Type III is diagnosed in a clinical setting and does not require gene testing because they do not know what gene it affects. They go off medical history, symptoms, and a scale of hypermobility. My insurance would not cover further testing for a full  genetic panel. More of which I will list here that I have not added into the story yet: \n\n-Epilepsy \n\n-Malabsorption\n\n-Colitis \n\n-Urinary incontinence \n\n-Dysphagia \n\n-Blue Sclera\n\n-Gastroparesis \n\n-Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (before medical intervention I was passing out a lot) \n\n-Super-ventricular Tachycardia \n\n-A shit ton of food allergies \n\n-Soft stretchy skin\n\nFast forward to now in my late 20\u2019s: I have a GJ tube and I am mostly in a wheelchair. I moved to a state with great healthcare in a major US city. I am starting to get different answers. Which is interesting because before I left my home state a few doctors were suspecting I may have a different type of EDS because hypermobile just was not adding up anymore based on what is happening with me neurologically. Because I was super hypermobile as a kid but my joints have seemed to stiffen, almost like stone now. My geneticist at the time explained that away by repeated injury. But it always felt like a piece was missing. \n\nToday I did a EMG and nerve conduction study. It showed weakness all over in the hands, arms, feet, legs, and back. She said something is wrong with my spine. I told her all my previous MRI\u2019s of spine and brain were normal. I told her that they were convinced for many years I had MS but could never find it. She said no, it is not MS and that this added up because it is appearing as a motor neuron disease. \n\nThis conflicts with previous studies I have had done. The first one I was diagnosed with CIDP. The second that was taken away. The third it was re-diagnosed. She definitively said no, it is not CIDP and I dunno who diagnosed that. She mentioned the guess she leans most towards is SMA type IIII. I was shocked and asked her how this was possible because I thought it was diagnosed as a child. She said not type IIII and sometimes not III. She said it is unlikely I have both EDS and SMA and that even though I have all these other weird chronic conditions it could just be a coincidence. She did say she cannot definitively say it is SMA but she said most likely. Although there is other rarer conditions it could be. \n\nI am having an identity crisis. I have been settled for many years now into thinking I have EDS. Today just rocked my world. I have a battery of blood work to do and another genetic counseling session (of which she said she will absolutely fight to the death to get me a full panel.) The neurologist wants to meet with me ASAP to sit down with the geneticist after I do the blood work and get her every record I have ever had. I am just so confused and feel let down by the medical care system. \n\nI just do not know how this could have been missed how does someone mistake a genetic connective tissue disorder for a motor neuron disease? It just sounds so insane and unrelated. \n\nI have been at this for almost 30 years. It is been way too insane of a roller coaster. I just want to know how to plan for my life and what is happening to my mobility. \n\nThoughts? Opinions?\n\nImportant note I need to add: my mom and her mom (my grandma) all share the same issues as me. &gt; Important note I need to add: my mom and her mom (my grandma) all share the same issues as me.\n\nYour dad, granddad, and great granddad/grandma would all have to be carriers for you all to have SMA. Seems unlikely. SMA would focus mostly on muscle degeneration. You can exclude the possibility but checking out the SMNA gene. How so? It is my mom and her mom Yeah I am supposed to go back as soon as I can get all my records then I do testing. Read the bottom of  Genetic test is definitely the easiest way to go to rule SMA in or out. I have type III and was not diagnosed till I was 12 years old. It can definitely be tricky and look like other other diseases. SMA is a recessive disease, so both of your parents would either have to have the disease or be carrier. If both of your parents are just carriers you would have a 25% chance of having it and if one parents has it and one is just a carrier, then you have a 50% of having it. \n\nI do not know if it helps, but I can tell you some of my symptoms growing up with type III, but most of my symptoms are just muscular. Growing up my biggest thing was weak thighs and hips. I could walk, but as I got older it got harder and harder with less distance between breaks. I could never really run or jump. Getting up from sitting positions was always hard. Like from chairs or the ground I always use my arms to help.

My first loading does was four weeks ago.  When I first arrived, I had to give blood and urine for testing purposes (now I do this the day before to save time).  I am guessing they want to check your platelet levels before hand since one of the side effects could be anti-coagulation issues.  I think kidney problems could be another, so that is why they take a urine sample.  (I have had no side effects BTW)\n\nThey started out by putting a numbing cream on my back for about 20 minutes.  Then, they had me lie on my side and they pulled my knees up to my chest (or as close as they could get).  This opens the spine for the spinal tap needle.  Some advice, do not look at the needle before hand!  \n\nThey then injected some Lidocaine around the area where they were going to do the tap.  It only stings a bit on the first Lidocaine injection.  Unfortunately, the Lidocaine is only good for the surface skin and muscle, you still feel plenty once the spinal tap needle gets deeper into the spine.  They have to work the needle around bone and cartilage to get to the subarachnoid space, where the spinal fluid is - ugh.  \n\nSo with me, they had a very hard time getting the spinal fluid to come out.  The doctors were certain they were in the right spot, but no fluid.  They must remove the exact same amount of fluid that they are going to inject -- 5ml.  They need to do this to guarantee that the medicine is getting injected into the exact right location.  They tried like three places (ouch - ouch - ouch) and then decided we would go to Radiology...\n\nSo, once in Radiology, I laid down on my front side on a table with a rolled up mat under my belly to open up the spine. After some more Lidocaine, the Radiologist used a fluoroscope to find the exact location to insert the needle.  Basically, the Radiologist watches the needle in relation to the spine on a live x-ray monitor.  Unfortunately, the Radiologist had a tough time finding my spinal fluid as well!  Again, the doctors commented that it looked right and felt right, but no fluid.  I think this is called a \"dry tap\" in medical jargon.  We tried a few locations (ouch - ouch - ouch) and just as I was getting ready to give up, we did one last repositioning and got fluid (and everyone applauded, lol)!  BTW, we had my Neurologist, the Radiologist, a Resident MD, a radio technician, a Pharmacologist, two nurses, and three other unidentified people in scrubs (I think they were other x-ray techs observing).\n\nHow does it feel?  Its not pleasant, but not the worst feeling in the world.  There are some \"Ohh's!\" and \"Uh's!\", but I was not yelling out or anything.  I hear some people are offered a Valium to relax them, but I was not offered this.  I prob would have accepted if they had.  I hear little kids are \"sedated\" so they will not squirm, but not me.  If the needle goes too deep, they sometimes accidentally hit a nerve in the spine and it sends a strong jolt up one of you legs.  Probably the most annoying part is laying face down for however long it takes to find the spinal fluid, in my case, forever.\n\nOnce my spine finally gave up the fluid, my Neurologist attached a Spinraza syringe to the little tube coming off the needle in my back.  My Neurologist injected the medicine and I did not feel it going in at all, so no pain there.  They then took out the needle, massaged the area for a few seconds and then put a standard band aid over the injection site.  They rolled me off the table and back on the bed and wheeled me back to the ward.  I was offered some snacks, some soda and a TV remote control.  I had to stay reclined laying down for about an hour and then I could leave.\n\nNow, since they had tried so many times to get into my spine, later on that night, I had a lot of pain in my lower back.  It felt like I was hit in the back with a 2X4 board.  I took some Advil, stayed reclined and used a heating pad to relieve the pain.  I felt sore but better the next day until I started getting headaches.  For me, they were moderate and pretty much went away as soon as I laid down or reclined way back.  The headache lasted about two and a half days, while upright.  I ended up staying reclined with the heating pad the second day as well.  On the third day I went to a movie, despite the headaches... :-)\n\nOn my second dose, we went straight to Radiology and the Radiologist used the photos from the first time to get the tap on the first try.  Despite drinking a ton of water leading up to my appointment, my fluid came out very slowly.  We had to wait a few minutes and re position the tubing to get all the spinal fluid to flow out.  This time, when I went home, my back was sore, but not nearly as bad as the first time.  Also, had no headaches at all the second time. \n\nI am hoping round three goes as smooth as round two.\n\nHope this helps someone.

Has anyone ever tried using botox to release their jaw? It is getting to the point for me where my mouth is only able to open wide enough to hardly get some food in there. I am definitely going ahead and doing it since I need an operation to get my wisdom teeth out anyways, but just wanted to see if anyone else has tried it and if they have seen any improvements with it. If your neurologist gave a thumb up for this, get a new neurologist care to elaborate a bit? I have never heard of Botox as a solution for tight/constricted tendons. I am curious myself because my jaws are getting up there. No dentist is willing to see me... Even the \u201cspecialists.\u201d It is not necessarily for the tendons, it is for relaxing the muscles themselves (at least that is what my doctor told me). I am not getting the treatment done by a dentist actually, it is a pediatric plastic surgeon who has done it before with other people who have jaw tightness. Maybe look into a plastic surgeon instead of a dentist? Or ask your team of doctors if you have one who they might recommend? My pulmonologist put me on to this guy. That is exciting to hear. Everyone pretty much turns me away, so this definitely gives me hope. Did they tell you anything regarding recovery or how extensive the surgery actually is? So the botox is not actually a surgery since it is just a typical botox injection. Sorry, should have been more clear about that. The surgery I am getting is to get my wisdom teeth out and then while I am under, they are going to do the botox anyways and then manipulate my jaw a bit just to stretch it out. The surgeon did say that there would be a chance of my jaw not being able to close, like slack jaw, because the muscles will be relaxed. He said that if that were to happen, we would just wait for the botox to wear off and then try another course of treatment. Multiple kids in the community have suffered and died after Botox treatment. It is a big NO. Could you link some evidence of this? I have read some medical essays about it being used for reducing saliva and they mentioned the slight possibility of the Botox spreading to unwanted areas, but nothing about any deaths. I swear I read an article on it a few years ago but cannot find it. I highly recommend contacting these two doctors with this question:\n\n\u2022 Kathryn Swoboda, MD (She was out of Utah but appears to be in Boston now. She has first hand experience with this.)\n\n\u2022 Dr. Mary Schroth at CureSMA\n\nIf you cannot get through, ask your doctors to call them. I know of many Type 1 parents who would never try it based upon poor anecdotal outcomes in the community. Thanks for the info! I am type 2 if that makes a difference, 20 years old. There is probably going to be a difference since I am likely stronger and less prone to the effects than a type 1, but I will definitely look into it some more. Thanks again.", "Travel junkies?

I drank my share in college and in my 20s without noticing anything. I hardly drink at all now, but that does not have anything to do with SMA. I suppose dehydration could be an issue, but only if you drank quite a bit.

Thanks to all who respond.", "How is Risdiplam treating ya? Hey, i am 18 and i signed up for Risdiplam. I did not do spinraza because i am not comfortable with that. I am type 1 SMA and a very anxious person. I want to know if it is bad. I just had my first dose of risdiplam after switching from spinraza. I am 27, type 2. It will probably be a little while before it starts showing signs of improvement. I will try to remember to make updates in this sub from time to time. Let me know if you have any other questions and I will do my best to answer as best I can. does it hurts?  I heard it does for some. I assume you mean Spinraza being painful? Because Risdiplam is just a strawberry flavored liquid. The Spinraza injections certainly did not tickle but it was not a hugely horrendous event. Everybody has different pain tolerances and I would consider mine to be low, but still not in my top 5 most painful experiences. \n\nThe main reason I decided to switch off to Risdiplam was more to do with the effectiveness, not the dose method. I was finding that I could tell that the Spinraza was wearing off before the next injection, by like a month and a half early. Risdiplam is taken daily, which makes me figure it will not wear off, unless there are tolerance issues but I have not heard of any reported. Doctors seem to unanimously like the results with patients on Risdiplam and also prefer it because it is easier administering it. \n\nIf however you want/need to go with Spinraza for whatever reason, I will give some tips. \n\n* Bring a blanket if you get cold easily\n* Bring your favorite caffeinated drink, caffeine is said to help mitigate a headache after this kind of spinal tap\n* Bring your preferred pain reliever, 2 of the 5 injections I had left me with a decently strong headache but only lasted about an hour or 2 because I took a Tylenol on the way out. I am 24, type 2. Taking Risdiplam for 2 months now. I started my 2nd shipment. Do not feel any improvements. I do not know how much is needed to start getting any improvements but I will keep u all updated. Similar situation except today is only 1 month mark. I think my drool is thinner but that is it. \n\nI am hoping for the larger dose of Spinraza I have been on Risdiplam for almost 3 months. I am feeling some upper body stability and energy increases. My daughter has improved strength and resistance. She is a year and a half old. Type 1, she is began to swallow on her own. She also got zolgensma at 6months old. You got Zolgensma and Risdiplam? Are you in America? May I ask what insurance you have?\n\nMy daughter was diagnosed with SMA last Friday and we are moving towards Zolgensma, but are being told we will unlikely be able to get both. American. In WV. UMR for insurance. My daughter also got Zolgensma about 6 weeks ago, last week she turned 3. (Germany)\n\nFor starters she will stay on Zolgensma only, but at the slightest hint of degeneration we will get her Risdiplam on top.\n\nHer liver ist still inflammatory, but she is quite stable and we think this is already an noticeable improvement.\n\nIf we were you, we would 100% try Zolgensma. But the efficacy data for Risdiplam seems to imply its inferior to Spinraza. Have you noticed any decreases in function since switching? I noticed a decrease in in function between my 5th and (what would have been) 6th injection. The Spinraza wore off very noticeably a month and a half before the next dose. So now I am playing catchup with Risdiplam. I have been taking Risdiplam for just over 3 weeks now and I can already tell it is helping. My left thumb has been my gauge for strength for the last several years, and since starting, my thumb has gotten a little stronger. Seems to be at odds with the trial data but I guess if it works for you keep using it! Why not Spinraza? It likely has greater efficacy related to Risdiplam.", "Stupid things doctors have said I guess everyone with SMA had to deal at some point with not so informed doctors. I wonder: what did they say/do and how did you react?  The only doctor I have had a bad experience with my previous neurologist. He would spend an average of 5 minutes just talking to me about school or something stupid and never did any strength tests or other examinations. He would always have his students (who did not speak english very well) examine me. So I missed out on alot of care. My neurologist now is great and was shocked at how little my last one did with me. I could probably write a book on the shit I have heard from doctors, specifically those who do not specialize in SMA. I recently had a neuro tell me he knew nothing about SMA and then when he examined me he said \"wow you are so weak I do not even know how you function\". Even more recent than that I had an ortho surgeon ask me how long I expected to live. Funny thing was that I was there for the removal of a toe-nail (sexy, I know), my SMA was actually not particularly relevant. And besides that, he would only known me for a total of 2 minutes.\n\nMy reactions most of my life have been to just get really upset and then withdraw from seeking help when I need it. I have been trying to work on that by a) being honest with new doctors about the fact that I am quite sensitive and that I am looking for help and positivity, b) relying on close friends and family to step in and shut insensitive conversations down if I feel like I am not comfortable doing it myself and c) using rehearsed lines like \"I do not see how that is relevant\" and even just practicing saying \"No I am not comfortable with that\" or \"We will have to find another way because I cannot do that\" (e.g. get onto a table to be examined).\n\nThere is actually loads of research on how people with chronic conditions face barriers to accessing healthcare, both because they are treated differently to \"regular\" people but also because sometimes things just are not set up right for us. I think it is important to let doctors know that their behaviour is not always helpful and that someone is mental well-being is as important as their physical well-being. I also think it is something that is often not really taught or expressed to kids with SMA (or other conditions). If you spend your childhood being prodded and poked and nobody ever stands up for you when a doctor is insensitive then you will not learn that your body is yours and that you have the right to demand that you are treated with respect, or that you have the right to ask questions and request information. To provide an example, when I was 16 I had a sleep study and the doctor looked at the results and spent 20 minutes shouting (yes, shouting) at my parents for not having done a sleep study sooner and telling me that I was terribly, awfully, life-threateningly below normal levels. He looked at my parents and said \"soon *she* will not be able to do anything at all, *she* will not be able to even speak\". She. Like I was not even there. I was so upset that my parents let him speak about me like that that I refused to have any further sleep studies or look into getting a ventilator (obviously now that I am older I realize they were as shocked and upset as I was). I was not old enough to process the situation and nobody helped so I dealt with it by denying it. I did not have a sleep study again for 10 years after that (and funnily, when I did have a sleep study again at 26 I was told by a totally different doctor that the situation was very mild and I did not need to have a ventilator yet if I did not want one). Here is the funny part, I love my ventilator now. Even though my breathing is only mildly impaired I feel like I sleep better. I could have had great sleep for a decade and did not because some asshole decided to scare the shit out of me and fling me into emotional turmoil for years, with no basis whatsoever. I am more saying this for the parents here, but it is so so important to help your child process and handle negative medical interactions because it can lead to years of anxiety if ignored. &gt; wow you are so weak I do not even know how you function\n\nWhat. A. Dick.\n\n&gt; ask me how long I expected to live\n\nShould have said \"about 10 minutes longer than you mate.\" &gt; Should have said \"about 10 minutes longer than you mate\n\nAhaha, love it, wish I was that quick. Legend.   You may be quite sensitive but not wanting to deal with awful Doctors is not a byproduct of you sensitivity.  It is because you are an exceptional and decent human being and want to be treated as such. If someone, Doctor or whoever, does not understand that then it reflects poorly on them, not you. \n\nThank you very much for your insight on what it is like to be a kid with SMA and dealing with Doc and watching your parents deal with them. From a parents perspective we are in a tough spot. Normally I am not interested in dealing with jerks. But if my son's Doc said that me getting hit in the head with a bat would be helpful in treating my kid's SMA I would say fine. You see my point?  Parents do things and put up with things for their kids that they would never do or put up with under most circumstances. I am sure if your parents own Doctors started yelling at them they would yell right back. But the normal rules of life do not apply when you throw kids in the mix.  Some times that is good, other times it is not. \n\nYou have developed some solid techniques for dealing with Docs who do not understand who and what they are dealing with.  Thanks for sharing! Totally man, if there is anything I have learnt as an adult is that it is freaking hard to be a parent. Hell, it is harder than I thought to be an adult! Sometimes you just need that distance and space from your parents to see that they are just people doing their best too. I have talked about it with my parents since actually and it is funny how we all understand each other so much better now that I am an adult!  On the fact that people with disabilities have less access to health care \n\nI was told by a nurse at the group home I lived at in my teens that something like 75-80% of wheelchair bound woman who develop cervical cancer end up dying because they simply cannot get Pap smears because offices do not have hoyer lifts or adequate nurses to help with transfers and getting dressed and undressed \nI have not gotten a proper physical since I became wheelchair bound simply because I cannot get on the table  I tend to write about a TON of detail so I preemptively apologize and I will make sure to put a TLDR haha. \n\nOh my god. So, I am 22. 23 in May. I have type 2 and thankfully I have exceeded all expectations by quite a bit. I actually just started bipap support at night about a year ago. Ventilation is \"nowhere on the radar\" according to my lung doctor and he is just a fantastic guy. A ventilator is actually my biggest fear in life. \n\nBack in September of 2015, I was hospitalized at Methodist here in Omaha, Nebraska. Now, I am of course no stranger to the hospital. This time was very, very different though. This was the first time I had to go to a hospital that was not Children's Hospital. Not only that, but it was also the first time I had EVER been admitted to the hospital for something that was not respiratory...or my dumbass breaking my leg. To be totally fair, I do not use it much anyway. Lol.\n\nSo. I went in due to EXTREME nausea. It had only been about two days before I went in, but it was just a whole new level. A bunch of not so pretty details. I had black throw up. A very very small amount though so I did not think too much of the color at the time. In the hospital they were actually going pretty fast and said that I had \"much more\". I did not know how they knew that, but they were absolutely right. They suctioned my stomach via a tube put down my nose. I turned to look at the CRAZY amount of liquid they had collecting, and then I blacked out. \n\nNot super uncommon during the hospital trips I am exhausted during. My autopilot mode is always so deceptive that only my parents can tell when I have checked out and they said it is still hard to tell. I had some crazy vivid \"dreams\" when I was not fully blacked out. I woke up 4 days later with a bipap on and I was surrounded by my best friends. We are like family, so we had a good 10 people in there. I was very, very confused but I knew whatever was going on was probably bad. So of course in my infinite wisdom I dropped the F bomb over and over again as loud as possible. A bipap just kind of takes the oomph out of yelling though so I stopped and went to sleep after saying hi.\n\nOver the next few days I was in and out like crazy. Mostly out, but whenever I was in, the room was never empty. Once I got enough rest to actually function for a little bit my aunt had asked me if my chest hurt. I am thinking \"how in the hell...\" and I said \"actually, yeah. Pretty bad. Why?\"\n\nShe told me that I coded for 6 minutes, without intubation. Good thing I was sitting down because HOLY SHIT. I was actually laying down. But I like to make jokes. Lol. And I was just absolutely floored. The vivid dreams with body sensations and full thinking capabilities made a lot more sense. I love the medical field and I study it basically for fun during my downtime. So I know just how close of a call that was. Lucky does not begin to cover it.\n\nSo! Over the next month, it was absolute hell. Methodist doctors kept trying to treat my SMA and not what the real issue was. Many arguments. Around week 3 the doctor team suggested that I get a ventilator to reduce the damage of the bipap to my face. I was not super thrilled about it. At all...so I just took the bipap off to spite them. To my and definitely their surprise, I was going all day without it, but I would be awake laying down. Sitting up hurt waaaay too bad.\n\nSo. Near the end of week 3 a doctor came into my room and my patience was suuuuper thin. But I kept it calm. I asked \"hey, so, what is my diagnosis?\"\n\nHE SAID \"GOOD QUESTION\" AND WALKED OUT. He never came back! I was just bewildered. Nobody could answer this pretty simple question. But I started to recover enough to go home at the month mark. No diagnosis but they discharged me in late October. I went home. I told everyone that I was not fixed. But we focused on my ribs because I was just crushed by the pain. From October to March my hair was falling out and my strength was so much worse than it had ever been. My initial symptoms came back and we did not waste time. We went to UNMC instead.\n\nWithin THREE DAYS they said \"You have Staph emanating from the gut\" and I broke down crying and THANKED THEM FOR TELLING ME THAT I HAD STAPH. They were very very confused until I explained the month long stay. By day 5 or 6 I was sent home with IV antibiotics and I will be damned. Hair started to return. Strength came back. I was so, so, so very lucky to have survived the ordeal. What is so odd about this whole thing though, is that I never actually had any open skin. None. I know how important skin care is, especially for these reasons. So I do not know if I got food poisoning originally or what actually happened...but there is no way I got staph via the two usual ways. Open skin, and dirty needles.\n\nSorry for the novel, haha. If you guys want to know more about any of this (the craziness of the hospital stay, the near death experience, etc) please feel free to ask!\n\nTL;DR: After 3 weeks in the hospital I asked a doctor that JUST walked into my room \"what is my diagnosis?\". They said \"Good question.\" and WALKED OUT.\n\nJust last year my neurologist asked me if I could walk. That would have been hilarious, had he not been completely serious. I really hope he is on board with Spinraza or I will have to switch somehow. I have not switched neurologists yet though because in all fairness, he had only met type 3s up until then. \n\nMy pain management doctor asked me that same question after being his patient for almost 8 months. I switched doctors on the spot because he did not even care to Google SMA apparently. Or...just...looking at me and using deductive reasoning?  I am in Omaha, NE. I have never had a good neuromuscular doctor. I know of other people that travel out of state for MDA Clinics because ours suck so much. If you have any doctors, wheelchair vendors, OT or PTs that you like, will you let me know? I pretty much just have my primary care physician follow me because patient care sucks here. :-(  Absolutely no problem at all. I totally understand your frustration too. I am sure neither of us are strangers to doctors, so I can definitely see that.\n\nSo! I am so sorry. I totally forgot to reply to you sooner. I am sending you this right before I fall asleep, so please message me back later today to remind me and I will get you a fantastic list of \"the right people\". I am still a little bit iffy about my neurologist, but I have a WONDERFUL pulmonary specializing in neuromuscular conditions, my primary care doctor, the fact that I flat out refuse to go anywhere but UNMC anymore BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY LISTEN, and the wheelchair vendor I just picked up a few weeks ago should be setting me up with a PT/OT for an evaluation soon, and I already love them. They are wonderfully attentive.\n\nJust remind me please :) Hi!\nI am going through weeks and weeks of unproductive cough right now and am being referred to a random pulmonary specialist at Bergan for a cough assist machine or something to help aid since my lungs are weak and I cannot expectorate. If you would be so kind as to give me your recs, I would definitely rather look into someone who has experience with a neuromuscular patient. Thanks so much! Ahh I am so sorry :/ I will absolutely get you more information, but definitely see Dr. Michael Summers at UNMC asap. He is a WONDERFUL guy. I have had my primary care doctor for my whole life who learned about SMA specifically after delivering me, which is Dr. Nicholas Steier through CHI Health, and while I love him too, I think I would rather have Summers as my primary care physician instead of just my pulmonary specialist. He is such a cheery and very understanding person. I asked him if he had any previous experience with SMA and not just neuromuscular disorders in general, and he said \"yep, a few people actually\"\n\nWe even discussed my occasional usage of certain supplements, and while he could not outright condone it, he was absolutely certain that I would not be risking my safety. So, yeah, VERY understanding and experienced. If you have type 2 I recommend getting a cough assist from him immediately. I know exactly what you mean by an unproductive cough. SMA is wonderful like that. I can confidently say that my cough assist has saved my life numerous times. I have had it for about...9 years? And I promise you that you will be so very happy after you use it. It is definitely a pretty odd experience at first. Pretty tiring at times and you will likely get light headed for a minute if you do it a bunch in a row, but being able to cough harder is fantastic.\n\nI cannot quite recall if you will need a referral from your primary care doctor, but if you do, please insist on Summers at UNMC. Do not let them monopolize your care. I hope you feel better soon! Message me for any questions :) ", "Do you ever rapidly lose function of a muscle? Most of my muscle atrophy has been gradual, but sometimes I lose function of a muscle really fast. My core muscles went within a few days, and it seems like my hip flexors have done the same. Like I was walking fine a few days ago, and now I have a waddling gait. I am also having a real hard time climbing into my dad\u2019s jeep, which has never been a problem before. Stupid legs! Are you on any treatment?", "REALLY NERVOUS Hi! I am Morgan and I have SMA2. I am getting my first Spinraza treatment on July 10th. I am extremely nervous and scared. I am okay with needles but I do not like knowing what is going on. For example, when getting a flu shot I see what the doctor is doing and I kind of give myself a good pep talk of \u201chey, this is fine.\u201d \n\nI am just really nervous of the pain and pressure that is sourced around the injection during and after treatment. If anyone who has had the injection already I would like to know IN FULL DETAILS how the procedure goes. Please, it will help me become ease of mind. \n\nThanks for any replies. I will being getting my injection at Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, PA. I have received 8 treatments of Spinraza. The first 5 or so my doctor would allow me to take Versed which is sort of a childrens valium to calm my nerves. I eventually stopped taking this as the side effects of coming off the Versed were the worst part about the procedure but you could ask them if this is an option for you if you are really nervous about it. Other than that the procedure is relatively straight forward. I get through it ok and I used to be terrified of needles and am still a little nervous around them. Basically they will have you lay on your side and then probably put a numbing gel or cream to numb the skin around the injection site. After waiting a few minutes they will inject you with lidocaine which numbs the entire area of injection much like when you get dental work done. This is probably the most you will feel on a pain scale as it burns a bit when the lidocaine enters your soft tissue but its not that bad. After that the most you should feel is a slight pressure. It feels similar as if someone was pushing the eraser end of a pencil in your back. Sometimes (and this is rarely, it only happened to me once so far) they might knick a nerve which kind of sends a shock through your leg or something but its not too terrible. The pain after is not bad at all, just a little muscle soreness in your lower back. Nothing tylenol cant fix.\n\nSome tips I can give are\n\n* Stay hydrated before and after. You want your spinal fluid flowing well.\n\n*  Try to lay flat as much as possible for at least an hour after the injection to avoid a spinal headache. \n\n* Keep caffeine/tylenol/ibuprofen on hand for small pressure headaches\n\nIf you have questions about anything I might have missed just let me know. Here is a detailed report of (\n\nI get number ten the day after you on July 11, so good luck! Thanks so much!! If they knick a nerve what does that \u2018shock\u2019 feel like? Thank you!! I feel better but then the whole strong jolt in leg has me nervous. Not sure how to describe it. It kind of feels like if you have ever been shocked by an electric socket. At least that is the closest I can place it. Nothing really painful just kind of surprising. Do you have spinal fusion? Are they doing the regular method or with an x-ray to help guide the needle? Not sure what spinal fusion is but I will be doing it in radiology under x ray I got my first injection on 6/19 and the next one will be 7/3. I have a rod in my back so the procedure took 2 tries.  If you have a rod, it may take the doctor a few tries for the first time. wh33lybrdy and wheelman2017 explained it pretty well so I will not repeat it. For me the pain was not bad. It was equivalent to have your blood draw with 2-4 needles. I have had seven injections so far. Due for my eighth on July 11th. Good luck to the both of us.  My first injection, while I was in the waiting room, I was calm and excited to be getting spinraza but once they took me from the waiting room to the procedure room I started to get a little nervous. But that was just me building up scenarios in my own head and all the people that were in the room watching (about 7 people). You are right in feeling a bit nervous. But you said you are ok with needles so I think you will be perfectly fine. The only pain I felt, which felt like a pinch, was the needle going in to administer Lidocaine to numb the area. After a few minutes to let the Lidocaine set in he then injected me with another needle with the spinraza. I felt the pressure of the needle moving around but it was not painful just felt weird and uncomfortable. It took a good while for him to find the spot and I was getting a little anxious but he eventually got it. I did not need anything to calm my nerves. But everyone is different and if you feel you need something to calm you down let your doctor know. I bet after you experience it for yourself you will see that there is nothing to be too nervous about and future injections will be more calming. \n\nAbsolutely do what wh33lybrdy said with staying hydrated. I try to drink as much water as I can the days before my injection. I am talking 5+ bottle a day because the headaches you might get after the lumbar puncture are no joke. They are not like a normal headache you may have experienced before. I have gotten the headaches twice and all I could do was lay down to make it go away. Took about a week for them to go away completely and for me to be back to normal. \n\nThis is an exciting moment for you. Good luck Morgan! It is not a fun experience, I will not lie. BUT the good news is, if you have been living with SMA for a long time, then you have more than likely experienced far worse than a spinal tap. \n\nFULL DISCLOSURE: Every hospital/doctor may do things in a slightly different way.\n\nFirst they will just have you sign some stuff, no big deal. Once they get you on the table under the X-ray, they will simply take SEVERAL pictures before they do anything to you. Then once they feel like they have mapped out your spine well enough, they will put a metal stick to your spine (Just to touch it, it does not hurt, it is just cold, actually not sure the purpose of this). Then they will cover your back in a cold liquid called iodine, that is just to clean it. Then they wipe off the excess liquid with a thin sheet of paper. Next they will simply mark a spot on your back with a sharpie. \n\nThis is sadly where it is going to be rough your first time, but just hang in there. They will put a needle in your spine to inject numbing medicine, this is going to be a sharp pain and it is going to hurt. For me, that is the worst part. They usually stick me a few times to ensure the numbing agent spreads out nice. Good news is, once they stick the actual needle in, you do not really feel it. This is where it will get scary, but honestly not that bad if your expecting the worst procedure ever. They stick the needle in, they take another picture, then they \"steer\" the needle a little, take another picture, and that process is going to repeat a lot. The deeper they go, the more likely is they are going to hit a nerve or two, not going to lie, that is going to hurt, but it will be a quick sharp pain for just a second, and you actually want to feel the pain, because that means they are getting closer to your spinal fluid. \n\nWhen they get to the spot, you might feel one final sharp pain. The hard part is over, the doctor will come in, and suck out some fluid, this sounds scary, but it just feels like a cold sensation, it will not be painful, then he will inject the drug, which will take about 90 seconds, again, it is cold, but no pain. They will clean around the needle, then yank it out, which if they did their job, you will not even feel them pull it out. Your done.\n\nIt is terrifying and because they are trying to focus, you may not understand what they are saying as they use a lot of medical terms during the procedure. But it is not that bad once you do it a couple times. Your going to be okay, I promise. Stay strong.\n\nSome people get valium, but my doctor says no to it. Maybe you will get lucky. \n\nOnce they send you home, you will just be sore for about a week, but nothing that is going to affect you too much. \n\nFinal piece of advice, DO NOT TAKE ASPRIN 48 HOURS BEFORE OR AFTER THE PROCEDURE. Thank you so much! I have had lidocaine before so the first needle I will be used to. The nerve part not so much. My doctor said I can take Lorazepam before I go to calm my nerves. Although I might be a mess my first time, and therefore I hope they allow my husband to be in the room with me. If he is not there I will sob. Thanks!! I actually think I would like sitting up. I have a rare form of SMA where my upper body represents SMA 4 whereas my lower is more like SMA 2. Lately I have stopped walking almost all together. My calves hurt to much and I want to get Spinraza before I stop walking altogether. Thank you for your info! Okay sounds good! No rods. My spine curves when I am slumping over but stays straight if I sit up correctly. Not a enough for rods. They allow me one person to join me. Even if they do not, he will be with you in spirit I lost the strength to walk a little over two years ago. A few days ago a friend of mine from high school took me to a pool. There I was able to simulate walking since I was not putting so much weight on my legs. It felt amazing and I was not fatigued the days after.

Haha I have no idea what I just read. Basically the AAV vector that is used to deliver Zolgensma seems to cause neurons in the hippocampus (the bit of your brain that deals with memory/learning) to die. I think they showed it using mouse neurons so that does not necessarily mean it is the same in humans (full disclosure: it has been a long day and I could not be bothered to read the full paper).\n\nThe key message in the paper is that even though AAV appears to be safe based on the evidence from clinical trials so far, we should continue to be vigilant about any potential issues around safety that we might not yet know about.

I would try to find information on getting a guitar with the lightest strings possible on it and a performing stand so you do not have to worry about supporting its weight or fighting with positioning.\n\nMy personal music experience (it is another family member diagnosed with SMA, not me) is that ukulele is much easier than guitar. The strings are lighter and frets are closer together, so I am not stretching my fingers as far to change chords. The Ukulele Teacher on YouTube has a lot of videos that make learning new songs fun.

I type fairly slowly since I have to use an onscreen keyboard, but I manage. And the company I work for is very accommodating. Hey, not at all! So, I retired at 42 on a full pension  A year or so before this I was bricking it because I thought I would just have to quit and basically have no income for the rest of my life. Luckily tho, I worked closely with the pension service and one of the managers that told me about ill-health retirement. \n\nAbsolutely life-saving information. It essentially means that if you have a condition that will basically kill you off they can treat it as if you are at retirement age. From what I understand, it was largely used for people with terminal cancer, but any condition that falls under life altering/Terminating conditions can trigger it.\n\nThe caveat is that I worked at the local council, had an incredibly supportive boss and managed to get in enough years to get a good pension. I was not even remotely aware that this was an option, so was very lucky and am more than happy to pass it onto others as a possible option (\u30c4). Tell you what, had really hard times but they were worth it, looking back... some great memories (\u30c4) Yeah, giving up the art was a blow was not it?\n\nWhen I could begin to see the end of my career in the distance I setup the whole thing properly... Set up the website, bought the software and advertised on Google! My plan was trying to build it up so that when I had to leave I would have some income. It did not quite work out that, but it still brings in a bit of money every once in awhile. Google is weird \u2014 no enquiries for weeks, the 5 pop into the inbox. Yoooooooo we need to talk... PM'd! :D So I cannot tell if you are in the US or not, but it does not seem like it.  Especially the pension and council topics it sounds like you are outside which might not relate much.  \n\nBasically I am in the situation where it does not seem like I would be working after my current job does not need me anymore.  Feels like maybe they will keep me around for a couple more years, that is a generous guess.  At that point I will have been at this gig a decade.  After the thinking about it my situation is either wait for my current gig to let me go (which could be soon) or collect all the portfolio work possible to prepare for a possible next job.  And truth is I do not think I have it in me to start on a new position from scratch.  With the amount of liberties they give me like working from home and letting me work on my time it seems even tougher  So planning now for an eventual retirement would be great.  Any processes or suggestions of who to talk to would be great.   Ah, yeah, I am in the UK so it is undoubtedly a different ballgame over the pond. I feel you with the predicament you are in \u2014 I was there, knowing I just did not have it in me to start it all over again... I wish I had some advice but I just got really lucky. It might be worth trying to slowly building a freelance client base whilst you still have an income. Cold comfort I am afraid. Well, it is nice to know that even outside my country people have the opportunity to transition into a retirement role without sacrificing.  I have been considering paths about what I would like to do without having to devote 8+ hours a day to a project I am not psyched by anymore, but literally everything sounds interesting.  You are an artist right?  Just out of curiosity can you tell me what kind of freelance work you do now?   Yeah, I was lucky to end up in this position really. Being able to wind down was incredibly helpful. I do less now as everything takes so bloody long but I restore old pictures using photoshop and do the layout for a friend who produces reports for the Japan Times. I may be slow, but I can take my time a bit more. Ohh wow, that is interesting.  Does it take long because of the disability or it is a lot of work?  I get worried about the time I spend on some tasks but there is nobody else right now, but who knows how long that will last.  Are you located in Japan then or do you just send things over?  We are actually hoping to visit Japan one day but with my disability it will be quite a production.  One of the big reasons is the pro wrestling, it is easily the best out of anywhere in the world so I would like to actually see it live some day.  Anyway, I have been meeting people through reddit, facebook, and my youtube channel who have SMA or just MD in general, so I apologize for being so nosey.  It is been fascinating to hear how people live, what they do, and more.  I have been talking to a guy from Germany and that is been really eye-opening.  So again thanks for being open.  Just the disability really, although restoring pictures is not really hampered too much as it is just mouse work. It is quite interesting the (\n \u2014 I live in England, doing work for a Filipino guy staying in Singapore and then supply finished artwork to the prepress dept in Japan... All from the comfort of my desk at home. Small world huh.\n\nWould love to go to Japan as well... Would like to go to an authentic Ramen restaurant and watch Sumo wrestling... Used to love watching that when I was a kid (\u30c4) I hope you get to go one day and watch your wrestling!\n\nNot nosy at all Scotch... It is interesting to see how people in the same boat live their lives. You should pass on your YouTube channel, so I can sub you. Right on, that is a nice gig to have.  Especially when it is on your time.  I thought you were in England but I just wanted to double check.  So you are right in the center of the Brexit situation?  I hope that goes well, from John Oliver, to youtube videos, and eventually reddit posts it sounds incredibly complicated for.  \n\nJapan just seems so fascinating.  Between the culture and the food, it seems like there is so much to take in.  In a weird way I am hoping that if I actually make it there the US finally goes full insanity and closes it is doors and we have to stay.  And then my house teleports itself there too...  My wife is a chef and she is super interested in a ramen restaurants as well.\n\nHere is my youtube:   I am about to go on vacation and hope that I can make some videos about it.  Especially something about getting on a plane, people do not really understand the difficulty for people like you and I to just go on a trip somewhere.  But yeah, if you ever want to talk please hit me up.  Additionally if you would be interested in being interviewed for a video I think it could be super interesting.  But that is after seeing the channel. I mean if you find me to be a huge douchebag do not worry about it.  But talking about the different lifestyles in different parts of the world could be very interesting.  If I am able to retire or quit comfortably some kind of focus on networking with people who have MD or SMA in particular is what I would focus on.   Yeah, brexit is just crazy. It is like were are arguing over how much poorer and hateful we want to make ourselves. Madness. I will come with you if we go full-insane!\n\nWill check out your channel dude. Sounds like a good idea so I hope you can find a way to retire! I am a cinematographer/director.   I have full mobility but very weak in hips and arms at type 4 30/m.

For instance we have replaced joysticks and batteries on our own. \n\nWe had one chair that broke and they no longer made it so we could not get parts so he got a loaner manual chair from the mda until we could afford a replacement power chair. \n\nGood luck! I have a power chair. I rely on the dealer for repairs. So far they have been covered by insurance, but the process is extremely slow. I have waited up to three months for non-critical repairs. First, I didnt even know there was a type 2b! But I know how to replace the batteries (we saw a video on YouTube with a car battery and it THANKFULLY worked, I was worried because those are expensive, like 300 USD!

(I was not there so he had to pay them to do but Id do things as much as possible mshelf because it is cheaper and quicker.) \n\nToday he went to the repair place and they repaired without charging....chair got wet in the rain yesterdat and the buttons were acting weird after that. I was not there to help unfortunately but soon we will live together. Thanks for your reply! Yea, same for my fiance. Tilt actuator was making some cracking noises but they thought it wasnt critical enough....and it would still work for a few weeks until it broke on Christmas last year. We managed to replace it ourselves but it took hours! 3 months later he got the approval and they replaced the new tilt actuator lol. We kept it as a backup Congrats on getting it fixed! Thanks, I am still shocked that we did it What do you mean by SMA type 2b? I have heard of types 1 through 4, but I have never seen a letter appended to the end.  From a pdf on the MDA website: \n\nSMA is most commonly divided into types 1 through 4. (Sometimes further subdivisions, such as type 2a, 2b, etc., are used to indicate grada- tions of severity.)

I have torn cartilage too, which I am guessing is from falling over the years. It really sucks on days when my legs are weak and acting up because I want to sit down but that makes the arthritis really painful. I have been managing it the best I can on my own because I have already been to two ortho docs who looked at me like I was an alien and said I was not a good candidate for injections. Tried PT the one time even though I told them it would not work. The PTs were nice and did not push me too much or ask stupid questions, but ultimately said they could not help and sent me back to Ortho. Obviously surgery is out of the question, so hence managing it on my own.\n\nI have a really hard time finding doctors I like and being stuck with conventional medical treatments that I know would not work for me because of some of the unconventional ways I have to do certain things to get by. I guess I find it personally hard to explain to docs how/ why I use my arms so much because I have done it my whole life and unless you have to do it, then it is hard to wrap your mind around it. My Dad has type 3 and as he has gotten older the hip arthritis is debilitating. He is frustrated because he has compensated and worked hard to live a \u201cnormal\u201d life despite SMA, but he feels like it is the arthritis that is going to take away his mobility and independence, not to mention the pain.\nSorry I do not have anything encouraging to offer, just solidarity. I will take solidarity :). The pain really does suck. It is really hard because you have to fight to against the swelling and stiffness, but do not have the muscle strength to do it.

For mild cases try ginger or an antacid like Tums. There are other home remedies you can find online too. If those do not help, you can try a prescription medicine. My doctor prescribed Dexilant, and that works pretty well for me.\n\nEdit: If the home remedies work for a little while, but the reflux keeps coming back daily, go ahead and see your doctor. I find natural remedy \ud83d\ude05 Tums it is natural? If you take a shot glass with warm water and put a pinch of baking soda in it, it works pretty fast. Not recommended for people with chronic heart burn. Honestly works better and faster for me than rx or otc options. Prilosec from the drug store is good to take on days you know you will have reflux, like when it is pizza night. If tums does not help you, try pepsid. It is like tums on steroids. Believe it or not, chewing gum often helps quite a bit.  Do not eat too close to bedtime, avoid tomatoes, avoid drinking much alcohol, and make sure you are not constipated. Do keep in mind that taking too many antacids disturbs digestion. I have not found a permanent solution for my reflux, but zinc+vitamin c, ginger, lemon, etc helps.

It is probably too early to tell, but it is evident that people out there receiving Spinraza are improving in many ways. I asked my doctor what her experiences are thus far, and she says that it is really hard to tell considering that she does not know many patients receiving the treatment past 6 months.\n\nPersonally, I am extremely curious what Spinraza can bring in the long run. Every patient is obviously different, but generally speaking, what can we see realistically? Is it actually possible for patients to regain the majority of their strength and mobility (e.g. can ligaments and tendons be re-stretched to near-normal levels)?\n\nI would assume that most SMA patients have bodies similar to those who have been in a vegetative state. Muscle loss is obvious, as well as rigid bodies. If Spinraza increases the SMN protein, how exactly does it affect the body? Again, it is probably too early to tell, but does anyone have any idea what sort of improvements people can obtain in the long run? I know that some patients are starting therapies, so does this mean that actually gaining muscle mass and strength is completely possible? If so, to what degree? I reckon we will not know the answer to this for years, maybe even a decade. There has generally been an understanding amongst the scientific community that lack of SMN protein leads to motor neuron death. The fact that some improvements, however minor, are being seen in patients who are far along into disease progression (in their late teens or even in adulthood) has made people in the field question whether the understanding they have had is truly accurate. It all hinges on that really, I think. \n\nWe already know that treatment earlier is better but we have really not had enough people with SMA2/3 in their twenties onwards with a long enough period of treatment. It will be very interesting to see how a patient with SMA2 or 3 who is in their 30s or older responds to treatment over time and I think it will tell scientists a lot about the molecular biology of SMA itself. Adults may not respond as quickly as a youngster but they may show a response over a longer period and start to regain abilities with additional therapy - that is what I am hoping for anyway. I do not know if we can ever get to a point where the vast majority of abilities are returned to us because that is about more than just SMN protein levels. It is about the fact that when one tissue fails, it has a knock on effect on all kinds of things on a molecular level and that eventually translates to huge changes in physiology and development. I guess it is another interesting question - to what extent is replenishing a single factor (SMN) enough to lead to a physiological change on a large scale when the physiology of the individual has been dramatically changed by previous long-term absence of that factor. I bet the people who work on this are like beyond stoked right now at the sheer volume of questions this might answer. Time will tell! On a scientific level, this is pretty huge, I cannot imagine how excited the people who work on SMA are. There is something else going on that might help out. It is got nothing directly to with SMA, but there is a whole industry devoted to keeping people looking younger, longer. In Florida they have \"anti-aging clinics\" that are prescribing all kinds of stuff to people trying to either keep or recapture the physique they had when they were \"kids\". There is a reason someone like Sylvester Stallone was able to have six pack abdominal muscles in his early 60's and it is not just because he worked out and ate right, although I am sure that helped. \nI do not know the biochemistry behind it but with some combination of things like  hormone replacement therapy, synthetic testosterone, HGH, EPO, and even good old fashioned steroids people in their 50's and 60's now have bodies that, years ago, you would not have seen in anyone much past 30. \nLike Tiny Little Storm Cloud said it  will take some time to figure out what medication or therapy or treatment will work best of each individual person with SMA, but there are lots of tools in the medical toolbox. It may be infuriatingly slow, and we will have to give the medical, scientific, and regulatory communities a friendly kick in the pants to get them to move faster, but I am optimistic.  Very interesting points you bring up. I have a friend who is a fitness freak, and he believes that slowly over time it will be possible to regain most of the lost mobility and strength, just based on how the condition affects us. Of course, it is a lot more complicated, but he is assuming that whatever the condition actually does basically translates to the loss of muscle tissue, which obviously leads to other losses as you mentioned. However, if the treatment basically reverses, or makes up for whatever the condition imposes on our bodies, then it is probably safe to assume that the condition is halted at the very least, which has already been proven. Ultimately, I suppose time will tell just what older folks can achieve with this treatment, though I am excited to see what the new therapies will bring, as they seem to work a bit differently. My understanding (I am not an expert, nor am I in the medical profession) is that treatment may prevent further loss of motor neurons, or at least slow the rate of loss. This would result in a halt in the progression of the disease, or at least a slow down of the progression. I do not believe that motor neurons regenerate, so you will probably not see a dramatic improvement in abilities.\n\nAgain, that is just my understanding. I would certainly like to hear what the experts have to say.", "SMA Hello.\n\nMy name is Andrey Chebotar\n\nI am from the Republic of Moldova\n\nI am sick with spinal muscular atrophy, SMA my disease manifested itself for the first time when I was 1.5 years old\n\nI am now 31 years old; the disease has begun to progress more strongly for the last 2 years; I have speech defects.\n\nI had a sister, she also had spinal muscular atrophy. she died when she was 16 due to lung problems. our medicine was simply wretched, she was suffocating, we called an ambulance and asked them to take a device for ventilation of the lungs when they arrived they said they forgot it. and she just choked on the ambulance.

They place you into this program after 2 insurance denials and a screening.\n\n&gt;is it 100% free or are there some other costs you are incurring?\n\nAs far as I know the drug is free but my insurance will have to cover the cost of the procedure.\n\n&gt;if you do not mind revealing, what hospital or region are you doing this through?\n\nI am going through St.Louis Childrens hospital\n\n&gt;do you know what your treatment schedule/itinerary looks like yet?\n\nThe treatment schedule is a pretty hefty one.

I have only heard of children and young adults being approved.  Yes, all I did was email my neurologist who then sent my information to Biogen. They then sent me an application and got me coordinated with my local FAM who is like a representative from Biogen who handles setting everything up for you.

", "Can we talk about hoisting/showering? Looking for new ideas...any tips appreciated! Hi guys,\n\nApologies for distracting from the spinraza posts, just not sure who else to ask.\n\nSo my current living situation (graduate accommodation) is quite good but it is time-limited. I am going to have to move out of where I am fairly soon but am very worried about finding a place that is set up in the right way for me.\n\nThe main issue appears to be showering. Currently, I have a mobile hoist and a huge bathroom with one of those baths on four legs so it has a gap underneath so that the hoist can get under it. My carer will position me over the bath and we will do everything without me having to detach myself from the hoist so everything is quick and safe. This works so well but it is not something I will necessarily be able to replicate elsewhere.\n\nI love my current hoist because I am able to lie down when being transferred and that makes it much easier on my body. A lot of other hoists tend to hold me in a very difficult upright position and because I am quite slim I tend to slip through the sling and it is extremely uncomfortable on my thighs as the slings will then cut into me. Is this an issue you guys have or is it just me? What kind of hoists do you use?\n\nWhat is your bathing/showering set-up? I am struggling to think of how I could do this if I did not have a bath with a gap underneath. I know I probably need to rethink my entire strategy around showering but I am so used to the way I do it I have no idea what other options there might be.\n\nWould really appreciate any insight into how you do it! What area of the world do you live in?  Different regions have different resources. Hopefully someone reading this will know of an organization in your area that could set you up with a similar hoist or other adaptive tech that will work for you after you move.   London, at the moment, hoping to stay in the general area just really need to figure out this whole bathroom situation - bathrooms in England tend to be suuuuuuper small (compared to the US).

My carer guides me down onto a shower chair and hoses me down with glee on her face :) I quite like the look of those wall-mounted fold-down 'beds' as they look a bit safer but have not tried one... \n\nI like my setup as it has a track divider so i can go to the shower or go over the toilet by the pull of a cord. Can take a photo if you want to check it out...  I use a combo toilet chair, I get transferred from bed to the chair and rock right into the roll in shower. It sounds like you will need some sort of shower chair. There are many different kinds. See what you can find on Google. I am fortunate enough to have a large roll in shower and a wheeled shower chair. Works great with some modifications to keep me from slipping out. Me too. \ud83d\ude00 Hey! Thanks, a photo would be great but there is really no rush, whenever you have the time. I am looking into those fold-down beds as they seem pretty dope.\n\nCan I also ask (apologies if too personal, no worries if so) - I assume the shower room is like a wet-room, how did you manage to find a place to live with one of those? I know that a proportion of housing is supposed to be adapted but I never see anything like that   when looking for places online.\n\nAlso, do you feel like the hoist setup you currently have is supportive enough around your head? I always find that my balance is super crappy in track hoists but to be fair I have only ever tried the hospital ones and they have only ever had bariatric slings which are way too big for me... Hey to you too... shower pic is ( and ( is pic of my dog because, well, who does not love a cute dog. Behind the wall to the left is the toilet and you can see that the track has a turn-wheel so i can go in either direction - very handy.\n\nI was lucky as i managed to get it adapted. i would bet there are not many that have a wet-room as standard :( Do not really find a problem with my neck so long as my carer supports my head as i am going up and down. The slings are fairly comfortable and i sit up nice and straight.\n\nI could get all this done as i was lucky enough to be able to buy the property so if you are renting i do not know how you would get the landlord to do this sort of work... Could it be worth getting in touch with local housing association? Great pics thanks! First things first - that is the most adorable puppo!! That is the dream right there.\n\nThanks for the info and pic of the shower, looks like a good setup and good thing I have seen it because it had not occurred to me you would need to make sure the doorway goes all the way to the ceiling. Might try to find a showroom and book a demonstration.\n\nFinding property to rent is going to be a nightmare but I am hoping I have still got 1-2 years (at most) where I am. Housing association is the starting point and I guess I will see where that takes me. In any case, I need to get out of student accommodation because I have spent 7 years/most of my 20s in it in one form or other and i am starting to feel old! Ha, she is the best! Kind of got her as a pet as well as an 'aid' dog but she now: \n\na) Will pick up stuff but will not give it to me as she thinks i am playing .\n\nb) If lying down in front of me and i ask her move, will just look at me with sad eyes... and not move an inch. \n\nc) Will push my feet of my footrest if she thinks there might be a scrap of food there... then not put them back.\n\nWould not change her for the world :) Amazing, love it. She sounds like the best :) I particularly like the urge to push feet aside to get to the food, ha.\n\nMy parents dog is massive and always likes to lie in front of me. When I lived at home he knew what 'get up' meant and he would be really quick and considerate about it. That was the only command he knew, along with 'cheese' because yum. Now, when I visit my parents, he seems to have conveniently forgotten what 'get up' means but somehow knows exactly what I mean if I say 'cheese'...  Yeah, convenient that is not it... clever dog! Funnily enough, i respond that way to cheese as well :) Would love to hear about your setup sometime, like how you hire your carers and what it was like moving away from home. Bet it was a headache! Oh man, where to even begin. Here we go on a long ramble (I am not a concise person!):\n\nMoving away from home was indeed a headache, but most of all I think it was a huge shock to my system emotionally. I was not prepared for how difficult (or maybe unfair is the right word?) things would be in terms of securing my independence. I grew up genuinely believing I would be just like everyone else and, it sounds kind of silly, but I had to adjust the way I had imagined adult life was going to be and that took a long time.\n\nMy parents have lived abroad since I moved away as well, so that has complicated things because I guess I have had to figure out a lot of things on my own. I know they would come out to me if needed but there certainly is an added element of insecurity. The first year away from home was rough, it was the first time I had carers and I had no freaking clue what I was doing. I did not know how to set boundaries and I felt really quite vulnerable being so far from my parents so I let my carers walk all over me. They soon found out that I would give them everything they asked for and I ended up draining my finances pretty quickly! So that was a bit of a disaster but I ended up getting rid of them and the agency they were from. That was independence phase 1.0 and it sucked but it was pretty clear to me that I had to grow up fast. \n\nIt has been almost 7 years since I left home and things are better but I am still finding my feet. I hired a different agency and I have had slightly better luck with them in terms of carers (barring one carer who I had to get rid of because she did not understand the concept of being on time and needed guidance on her personal hygiene!). I currently have 1 live-in carer. She likes to work long periods (like 8 week stints) so that gives me a lot of stability which I need emotionally as well as physically.\n\nThe only issue at the moment is that I do not have a back-up carer so my mum has to fly out if there is an emergency or the carer goes on holiday. Given that my mum has a job and is getting older, it is not ideal. I do not know how it is for you, but it takes a long time to train someone to handle me safely. I have had carers pick up hoisting in a couple of days but they are usually the very experienced ones. Most of the carers I have had take 1-2 weeks to learn all the moving/handling and personal care. So, in the event of an emergency, my carer obviously does not have 1-2 weeks to hand me over to someone else. Also, if my carer goes on holiday several times a year, there is not money in my budget to train a person for 1-2 weeks each time she wants to go away. And in addition to that I just hate training and I do not think I could do it several times a year. So I have asked the agency to recruit a secondary carer who will be a permanent back-up solution (i.e. will cover all holidays and will be able to be moved to me if there is an emergency). Unfortunately, I have been asking for 1.5 years. They are supposed to be actually settling on a person in the next two months so I am really hoping to finally put this to rest. That will be independence phase 2.0. It is far from ideal but it is where I am at right now.\n\nHowever, I am calling this my \"transitional\" stage. My future plan is to ditch the agency, which really creates more problems than it solves, and independently hire 2 live-in carers and have them rotate every 2 weeks. A friend of mine with SMAII has 3 live-in carers and rotates them every 2 weeks. That is even better because it is an even stronger safety net but I do not think I can stretch my funding that far. I think I am getting there but I know that would be too much responsibility for me right now, it is too big of a step and I am not ready. But I am planning to transition to that in the next 3-5 years and that will be independence phase 3.0!\n\nThe other complication is that I am in science and that requires a lot of moving around. I have already moved twice and I have been lucky to be able to hold on to student housing but getting local authorities to pick up funding for care has been exceptionally difficult. I am not sure how realistic it is for me to do it long-term. In my most recent move, the local authority spent 4 months pretending I had not provided medical evidence to suggest I needed care (??!?!?) and wanted to institutionalize me as it would be cheaper. Not exagerating, the whole thing nearly killed me. Never been so scared in my life. I do not know if I can keep doing it. And on top of that, I am going to have to find accessible accommodation that is affordable to rent. Because my parents no longer live here, there is nowhere to really go if I do not figure it out and I obviously cannot leave the country for too long. So yeah, not going to lie, it does keep me up at night. But that is life and we have to play the hand we are dealt I suppose.\n\nIn terms of hiring carers, it has taken a while but I have developed a precise list of what I want. I do not always get it but at least I have a better idea of what works. So I now ask:\n\n- That they have experience caring for a physically disabled person (I got tired of being sent people who treated me like I had dementia and had no moving/handling/hoisting skills).\n- That they have an interest in social care or a desire to stay in the job for at least 1 year (stability).\n- No-one under 21 (maturity/life experience).\n- I specify I want people who want to remain permanently in the UK for the vast majority of the time (they kept sending me people who saw the job as a way to make quick money so that they could go travelling every other week, did not fit in with my needs).\n- Willing to be vaccinated against the flu.\n- Excellent hygiene skills (had a carer who needed guidance on how to wash her hands and not to blow her nose/cough all over my food).\n- Must understand the huge responsibility of the role (i.e. we are not roommates, they are responsible for my safety, that kind of thing).\n\nI think that covers everything but always happy to answer questions. Though I am sure you are probably much further ahead in the independence phases! Would be keen to hear about your setup, I am sure it will also be more concise than my ridiculously long ramble!! That was a really, really helpful and well written post. Thank you!  Yay, always keen to be helpful! Thanks for the post StormCloud! So much of what you said rang true for me, especially the horror of training the carers... such a bloody nightmare... i can live with carers who are inexperienced but eager to learn, but it really gets my back up when they clearly do not give a shit. I used to put up with it but not any more, no way sister! The bit where they wanted to institutionalise you kills me. Its being treated like something sub-human and is the *one* thing that triggers my northern fury. Cannot say how much i empathise with your struggle there. I too remember the dawning realisation that my life will not be 'normal' and it really threw me as well. Still get wobbly in my head every time i am reminded of this fact but as you say, have to play the cards you are dealt.\n\nYou got one thing wrong tho... I never got to independence phase 1.0 and am still living with the ancient ones :( Your strength and courage in doing this  without the safety-net of your parents amazes me. I guess, looking back, i was both too passive and too scared and then kind of got stuck in rut. Kudos to you for taking the fight to the world.\n\nLiving with the folks works overall though, we have divided the house so I live in one section and they have their bit so its almost like living next door to each other. Also, because of their help it meant i could concentrate totally on uni/work, so have managed to carve out a pretty good career without disability having too much impact . Will love then forever just for that alone. On the other side i like to think i keep them a bit younger and am a free source of IT support.\n\nBecause of this, i can just about fund my carers through my income and thus have a bit of flexibility. I was lucky enough to find a great person who is uber professional and I hire her directly so can cut out the agency. She works for me Mon-Fri and I use an agency at the weekend. I want to get to my phase 2.0 by employing someone else and, like you, have a rolling set of carers. The carers help me with all personal care so luckily for my folks they do not have to see me but-ass nekid.\n\nThe condition is getting to the point where working is too damn difficult, so am in the process of going for ill health retirement which will keep me borderline secure, money wise. The relief when i found out this was possible was bloody indescribable. \n\nSee, i can ramble as well! Thanks for your reply, your set-up sounds good. I like the idea of having someone in the week and someone at the weekends and had not thought about that as a potential option. I may message you sometime to ask about how you manage to find carers without an agency and how you screen them if that is OK. I would actually be quite keen to live essentially next door to my ancient ones (though I am sure we would drive each other up the wall)! It is also really great to hear about how you have done well career-wise, a good degree of financial independence can really buy flexibility for us and it gives me a bit of hope to hear that. It must be hard getting to that point of having to stop but you should be super proud that you have done well for yourself because I am sure you have had to work very hard for it.\n\nThanks also for your really kind words and empathy. It can be a little isolating to deal with the types of things we have to deal with and I do not feel particularly strong. Well, I sort of oscillate between feeling like I am a tiny field mouse in a room full of raging bulls and feeling like a fire-breathing dragon but there is not an emotion to accurately describe that. But, it felt really good knowing that someone who gets it does not think I am being super whiny! Such a relief to talk to people who understand and who also happen to have cute puppers! Thanks StormCloud, it is not ideal, but the setup works for us  \n\nIt was such a relief to know retirement was an option. Will be heartbroken to leave my work chums and to not be the person who helps others but i have plans to start digital picture restoration  and that should keep me busy!\n\nI too oscillate between the extremes and its quite emotionally tiring is not it? I always avoided disability groups as i was normal damn it, *normal*. I now find it quite comforting to know that what i am going through is something somebody else is going through and is probably reacting in the same kind of way!\n\nPM me anytime and ( is the pup... as a pup!", "Automatic bed making device Hey everyone, I am working with a group of engineering students to developed a device to assist people in making their beds. Please fill out this survey to help inform our design! Thank you! \n\n Cannot wipe my own arse, bed making not a major priority... Sorry if the proposition of a bed maker was offensive given that it is not nearly as big and issue as the others you face. I too have SMA so I understand where the frustration comes from. The thought was that by giving people who have trouble making their beds the ability to do so, the device would lend some form of independence and fulfillment to the user even if it is not the most crucial of problems they encounter. After all, for me anyways, the tasks that should be simple but are not due to SMA are the ones that frustrate me the most. Hope this clarifies things and I understand if you still disagree. -JD  Ah no, I was only joking really. Had a bad day yesterday so my sense of humour was a bit...darker and spicier than necessary. You are totally right about simple tasks often being the most frustrating. And, also, for some people with milder SMA this could be a big daily issue so may be extremely useful to them. Good luck with it! :)", "About SMA type 2 I am 22 years old with SMA type 2 . I did not have spinal fusion operation till now so I have been noticing that my back is bending gradually but still I can sit unaided comfortably. I just want to ask if there is some danger if I do not have any spinal surgery to prevent further bending.\nIs my life in danger and if yes, then will I be able to maintain same mobility which I have currently even after the surgery? Thanks in advance for the reply. Ultimately, this is a question best posed to your doctor as none of us will know how much your spine is curving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that being said, I was told that it is *possible* for spinal curvature to collapse a lung if it is severe enough. Please do not panic, though, because: 1) I was told this quite a long time ago and I could just be misremembering; and 2) if it *is* true, the curvature would have to be *pretty* severe before that was a real risk, and it sounds like you are not there yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not really able to answer your mobility question. I had my fusion about 20 years ago, when I was 4 or 5. I really do not remember how much (if any) mobility I lost as a result of the surgery, but I have a gut feeling that it was not much. At any rate, medical science has come a *very* long way in 20 years, so I would think the prospects of a smooth and seamless surgery are much better today than they were for me in 2000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps! Thanks a lot. I am type III and had my spinal fusion at 13... And that was a long time ago. I do not remember how bad my curvature was, but I do remember my ortho being really worried, as it only departed to treat long-term with much more risks. I suppose everyone is different, but if it is something that your doctor sees as an absolute must, you may as well get it out of the way? I know that braces are also suggested, or God knows if there are therapies or alternatives out there. You are correct about the lung thing. Mine was that bad before I had the fusion.", "Kit's Risdiplam (Evrysdi) Updates Hey you all!\nFirst up I will introduce myself. I am 26 years old. I have type 2. I love in Texas. I have Medicare with Humana covering my part D benefits and Medicaid for PCA hours. \n\nI started Spinraza in 2018 after doing lots of research. The only problem I had was certain hospitals would not accept Buy and Bill (the hospital buys the medicine and M&amp;M reimburse them) which both Medicaid and Medicare were requiring. We found a way around that by ordering from Accredo. I started the insurance process in November and was on it by February.\n\nI would get nerve pain that lasted a few days because I had to go through the neural foramen (the area where the nerves enter the spinal column) because my spine is fused from my Herrington rods. I had a spinal headache once or twice but nothing terrible. The hardest part was driving three hours because no body was dosing patients in the city I live in. This was especially difficult when the pandemic hit and they needed me to go get a Covid test done 2-3 days prior to my injection. In the car for 6 hours twice in one week? No. We had to rent a hotel room and that is not a good thing with the pandemic.\n\nRegardless, I did not stop Spinraza because of any of that. My issue came with withdrawals. It started after my 6th or 7th injection. I got really tired, weak, these horrible twitches (everywhere), and I just felt crappy. It started happening sooner and sooner. First it was 2 weeks before my injection, then \u00e0 month, then \u00e0 month and \u00e0 half, and at this point it started 2 months before my next injection was due. Halfway through I felt like crap. Scotch was saying his FAM (Biogen rep) said there was a \"sweet spot\" 2 years in where it works its best but that is BS. So I started to look into my \"what now\" plan. I reported it and they finally said they were doing studies in higher doses but that could take years.\n\nLast summer I attended the CureSMA conference and met the head of research for the Jewelfish trial at Stanford. She was super nice and told me I may be able to join but there was only one spot left and I could still receive Spinraza so if someone who could not receive treatment would be top of the list. I did not make it. When it was filled for FDA approval last year and the decision date was planned for May 24th I waited patiently. I made an appointment for my Neuro and even though the date was pushed back I some to get about it. She did not know much but was okay with me switching. I got my last Spinraza on July 9th.\n\nFast forward 24 days and we get an approval. Yessss. I called both Genentech and my Neuro and started the process. I called obsessedly over the next month and a half. I filled out the forms online, emailed my doctor her past to sign, went and told Genentech they could contact me. I was assigned a PAL (like Biogen's FAMs) and she helped me. My doctor took a lot of prodding to turn in the Start form but she finally did it. Insurance requested a formulary exception which is just a prior auth. This is covered differently than Spinraza was because my standard Medicare covered it instead of my part D plan (Humana). They turned the prior auth in and the next Tuesday I called Humana to check in. They said was denied (apparently the tried saying I did not have 5q SMA (which I 100% do). It was later on the day I called my PAL who told me I would start the \"starter kit\" when the denial came through in writing. My doctor did not answer. The next morning I woke up to a phone call saying I was approved. I still do not get it, but it does not matter at this point. So the week ends and no word from Accredo. Finally Monday afternoon I call them to figure out what is happening. They say \"oh, sure we can schedule your delivery\" and it got delivered on Monday.\n\nNow, I will start with updates.\n\n9/25 I was just starting really bad (made it impossible to sleep) twitches, fatigue, brain fog.\n9/27 I have taken 2 doses (with meals, very important) No improvement yet. Minnie side effects. A little stomach pain and a low grade fever but that is it. Does not taste great but not terrible either.\n\nHappy to answer any questions you all have. Just keep us updated. I think I am starting to experience the withdrawl thing with Spinraza that you had, and I have high hopes for this drug. Been waiting to see how others are handling it both in improvements and in tolerance. Thanks for the excellent write up! This was really informative, thank you As a fellow type 2 around your age, I am eager to hear more. God bless and best of luck, brother. Hey, please keep us posted.\nRight now I am still in the hospital with my nearly three years old type 2 daughter. Last Wednesday she received Zolgensma.\n\nIt might not be necessary, but if it fails and does not work as intended, I would like to know if Risdiplam would be better than Spinraza, which honestly worked quite well to date. (She is able to walk slowly!) I know there are children doing both, Risdiplam and Zolgensma. For children the chance of it working without side effects is much greater. It certainly is more convient than Spinraza.\n\nIt sounds like treatment is really helping if she is walking. Wishing you all the best of luck! \u2764\ufe0f Sorry to hear your not seeing significant improvement. Maybe it will get better with time?\n\nWish there were more people sharing their experience on here so we could compare. I should get my first shipment sometime in the next two weeks but now i wonder if its worth giving up spinraza for? Argh i wish we could have both at the same. Some doctors are doing both. I also do not want to assume that just because I have not had instant results that I will not get them eventually. I really think it will take longer to see the difference. I have had friends who are dealing with worse issues and others that have seen progress. I wish you luck when you start! Thanks, despite spinraza my body has declined more in the past 3 years, but when i skipped my dose in may things got really bad, but went back in june and got a tiny boost that helped, i have high hopes for this drug but have been anxious about switching. worried about my body going downhill again... Also I did not know doctors had the ability to do both. I completely understand how you feel. I definitely declined with Spinraza. I do not expect this one to freeze me in time but more options are in the works. There is a study for microdoses of Celebrex that is happening that sounds promising and another trial on a med they were originally looking to treat Duchenne patients. Got more info on those? I do not. I have only heard others talking about them briefly, sorry. Clinicaltrials.gov might have more info, though. Just as a heads up I added your submission to the sidebar. I apologize it took so long but I was kind of expecting that there would be more people willing to share their experiences but what are you going to do... Anyway, thanks for being the first one! Thank you very much for sharing all of this information! Super helpful and informative! The withdrawal with Spinraza is a real side effect, I have experienced it also.", "So, in the UK, if you have contractures or have not walked for 12 months it is no Spinraza for you. \u0ca0_\u0ca0  To say I am miffed would be an understatement of the highest order. I am literally so mad for you all. Wtf kind of \"evidence\" do they need? I have type 3, I do not ambulate any longer, it is been many years. But Spinraza is a life changing drug for me. This is really unconscionable. It really is is not it? To be offered some hope and then for it taken away from you... My brain is having trouble parsing that. I think my emotional sanity preferred it when there was no hope of improvement. This is a pile of wank. Contractures are literally the last thing any of us care about and if having them gets in the way of \"measuring motor milestones\" then who gives a fuck? I am too tired to comment on how unethical it is to be using a patient group for the primary purpose of collecting data - that should be an additional benefit, not an end-goal. A massive pile of wanky bollocks. Good point that, contractures just effect their ability to measure data. Genuinely, fuck them and fuck NICE \\. This is bullshit. I would definitely call the makers of Spinraza. I know in the USA some cannot get it because they do not show signs of \u201cimprovement\u201d. I got accepted only because I still walk and have good upper body motor functions. Bollocks is not it? It is effectively a postcode lottery. Definitely going to get in touch with them for whatever good it will do. WTF is all I can say :(. Pile of wank, and wanky bullocks. \n\nThis is bad news and I am sorry to hear it but in the silver lining department I am learning new words....\n\nBut NICE or anyone else who is using subterfuge to keep Spinraza away from those who could benefit from it is really despicable. I take it as a point of honour that we creative brits can teach our cousins over the pond our weird sweary words. My lesson today is 'gobshite' and 'bellend'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is just so mercenary is not it? We do not fit Biogen research criteria so NICE throw us under the bus. So cruel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, how is your son doing buck? Has he noticed any improvements? Thanks for asking. We met with his neurologist this week for his 6 month check up. \nHe has grown 2.5 inches in the last 6 months (my son, not his neurologist). Even with the growth spurt he has maintained status quo with his strength, and even improved slightly in his arms and hips. \n\nSpinraza works much better than NICE apparently. \n\nCan you explain to me like I am 5, what the NICE reasoning is?  Are they just saying the US testing and data collection does not meet the UK standards? They are not be saying it does not work or is not safe, are they? Ha, that would have been weird! That is great news dude, must be an unimaginable relief as parents. Say 'owdo  from me :)\nSo, as far as I can tell, NICE made a deal where Biogen could use the data gathered for their own use and would supply the drug at a reduced cost. Maybe as they have already found it is not as effective in adults they are not interested in that data. Bummer. May be wrong, but I suspect not. He says 'owdo back!\n\nMy hope is that they will be overwhelmed with positive data at some point. Fingers crossed buck... fingers and toes. Government healthcare at its finest.", "Just found out im a carrier of SMA Just got the results of a blood test today and flings out that I \"only have 1 copy of Exon 7 of the SMN1 gene\". I really have no idea what that means. I am 38 years old. I play basketball, football, ice hockey and ultimate frisbee. I ride a bike about 300-400 kilometres a week. I feel healthy. The only thing is, about 5 years ago I fell from about 6 metres and hurt myself pretty bad. Ever since then my back has felt very weak. I always just figured it was because of the fall, but now I am wondering if this is the start of something else. My back is always weak feeling and it is usually quite tingly like someone is poking me with needless. It is this a symptom of something else or am I just being paranoid. Also, should I be worried about anything else? I am pretty sure if you have a working copy of SMN1 you do not have SMA. The reason SMA happens is our SMN1 gene is invalid and therefore our SMN2 genes act as backups which dont provide the correct amount or something like that. I am not really the person to talk to on the science of it. /u/TinyLittleStormCloud is probably more of an expert in that area. What is good is even if you have SMA you are in the age range of symptoms appearing that would consider you SMA type 4 which has almost no effect on your adult life.  Based on the results of your test, I think it is impossible that you have SMA. The symptoms you are experiencing are likely due to nerve damage arising from trauma instead, because of the injury you suffered. I think it just means if you are going to have kids make sure you partner has a test to see if she is a carrier. It takes both parents to be carriers to produce a child with SMA. i have two kids 3 years and 6 months. I guess i need to get them tested :( Or just the mother/s fellow Dave... If she is not a carrier then you have nothing to worry about. TBH I think you would have noticed by now I think, especially with the 3 year old. We tend to develop motor skills later than the average child ... So my parents only got concerned when I was not walking by 18 months. /u/wh33lybrdy is totally right. \n\nOP based on what you have said it sounds like you do not have SMA but you are a **carrier**. SMN1 is a gene (section of DNA) which is found on chromosome 5. But each person has two sets of chromosomes (one from the mum and one from the dad) and therefore everyone has two copies of SMN1, yay. SMA is a recessive disorder, which means that *both* copies of SMN1 have to be shitty in order for the person to have SMA. \n\nIn your case OP, only one of your SMN1 genes is a bit shitty. Genes are made up of regions called \"exons\". The exons are important because those are the bits that contain the genetic information that will make the SMN1 protein. In your case, it sounds like your 7th exon region (in just one of your SMN1 genes) is missing. We call that a \"deletion\". But it is OK because your other SMN1 gene has all the exons and so your cells can happily produce the SMN1 protein they need.\n\nThe only thing you need to think about is inheritance. If you were to have a child with somebody else who is a carrier like yourself then each time you had a child you would have:\n\n- 25% chance of having a child with SMA\n\n- 50% chance of having a child that is a carrier like you\n\n- 25% chance of having a child that is not a carrier and does not have SMA.\n\nIf you were to have children with somebody who is not a carrier (and who also does not have SMA), then you would not be at risk of having a child with SMA but it would still be 50-50 regarding whether your child would be a carrier.\n\nSo this would be a conversation to have with a future partner regarding getting them tested too. It also means that you will likely need to inform your children that they may be carriers so that they can take the same actions (you can also find this out during pregnancy if you wish). Beyond that, you may want to have a conversation with any of your siblings. Chances are that if you are a carrier they might be too, and they may want to have that information for the same reasons you do. Sorry I am a bit late on this! I have a passion for the medical field in general and I was wondering if I might be correct here?\n\nI know that, yes, the odds would be infinitely small, but the SMN1 gene mishap had to originate somewhere. I believe that I read a \"fun fact\" kind of thing, and it said something along the lines of one parent being a carrier and then on the infinitely small off chance that the fetus developed this mutation as well, that the fetus could essentially take the place of the other parent, effectively being the second carrier, and being subjected to the same odds as if both parents were carriers? Is that a possibility? Absolutely nowhere near likely, but possible?  Hello! Ok so to understand this, we first need to understand embryonic development. So, let us start with some fundamentals (most of which you probably already know, I am just laying out the timeline):\n\n1. Man produces sperm with 23 chromosomes, woman produces egg with 23 chromosomes.\n\n2. Sperm and egg fuse to create a single cell (formally known as the zygote) with 46 chromosomes.\n\n3. Approximately 1-2 days after fertilization, the single cell divides into 2 cells, each of which will have 46 chromosomes. A little later into 4 cells, then 8 cells etc. \n\n4. Some time later, this bunch of cells will implant into the woman's uterus and more specialized development begins.\n\nWhat you are talking about is what is known as a *spontaneous mutation* or *de novo mutation*. The mutation is passed down by one parent and the other mutation arises spontaneously in the foetus. For this to occur and cause SMA in the way that you are talking about, the spontaneous mutation would have to occur at step 2 (when the egg and sperm fuse to form a single cell known as a zygote - not yet a foetus). That way, when the zygote divides, **all** the new cells that are formed will also get the mutation. This is theoretically possible but extremely, extremely (really extremely) improbable because you not only have to get a mutation in the right gene, you have to get it in this extremely narrow window of time so that all the cells in the final organism have the mutations.\n\nIf the mutation were to occur later than step 2, it would occur in only one of the many divided cells. This means that the final human would have some totally healthy cells (the ones that did not get the mutation) and some SMA/diseased cells (the ones that were created from the initial mutated cell). This is called a mosaic and as far as I know, there is no evidence to suggest that any people with SMA are mosaics or that being a mosaic would result in the same sort of diseased state that people with SMA present with.\n\nSo if we are talking strictly about mutations in the foetus (after the zygote stage), the answer would be no. If we are talking about mutations that happen at the time of fertilization but before the first divisions of the zygote then the answer is yes but extremely unlikely.\n\nThere is however, another scenario which sort of fits what you are asking and is actually more common than people think. And that is for a spontaneous mutation to occur in just the sperm or the egg, before the two fuse. What I mean is, that one parent would be a normal carrier (i.e. all their cells have 1 shitty SMN1 gene). The other parent is not a carrier but has a sperm or an egg with a spontaneous mutation in the SMN1 gene (i.e. all their cells are normal except for the egg/sperm which has an SMN1 mutation).\n\nNow, for women, all eggs have already been made and are present at her time of birth and she will make no more in her lifetime. She starts off with a couple million eggs and that slowly decreases over time. Men, however, make sperm all the damn time and can release tens of millions of sperm each time they ejaculate. What lovely imagery. Anyway, this means there is a lot more potential for a mutation to arise randomly in a man's sperm than in a woman's egg (although of course the latter is totally possible). So, there are actually people with SMA who have this particular scenario (about 1-2%, so not super rare). One of their parents was a carrier and one of their parents happened to have a sperm or egg with a shitty mutation. When this happens, the most likely scenario is that the woman was the carrier and the man was not a carried but had a sperm with an SMN1 mutation. This scenario is far, far more likely than a mutation when the sperm and egg fuse.\n\nDoes that make sense? I am so sorry. I read this multiple times to different people (I like to teach what I can too!) and I realized while I was watching a YouTube video about myostatin (asapScience. Great YouTube channel) that I completely forgot to reply!\n\nYes! This makes perfect sense and you covered so much more than I thought I would have needed to understand everything, and then some! I really appreciate you taking the time :)\n\nIf you do not mind me asking, what is your profession? Or passion...Or both haha. You really know your stuff :)  Glad it was helpful! \n\nI am an epidemiologist in my current profession but my background is in molecular biology/biochem so it is nice to go back to my roots occasionally! Hey, hoping you might be able to answer a question regarding SMN1 carriers for me. I tested as having 2 copies of SMN1, and our sperm donor tested as having 3 copies of SMN1. Would that mean we are both considered carriers and should find a different donor? Trying to alleviate the concern while I wait to see our Reproductive Endocrinologist next week. Thanks for any insight! Hey, I will do my best though I will be making some assumptions here because I would need to know a little more information to give you a complete answer. \n\nScenario 1 - I am assuming that you have a mutation in 1 of your SMN1 copies (hence why you are a carrier) and that your donor has been tested and does *not* have a mutation in any of his 3 SMN1 copies. In this case, the chance of you having a child with SMA is very very very low. The only way there would be a chance of this happening is if your donor's sperm gets a random mutation in the SMN1 gene - this is very unlikely. I cannot put a figure on it but it would be very unlikely and changing sperm donor would not remove that risk.\n\nScenario 2 - You have 1 mutation in 1 of your SMN1 copies (hence you are a carrier) and your sperm donor has a mutation in 1 of his 3 SMN1 copies. I believe that if he had a mutation in 1 of his SMN1 copies they would have told you this. The chance of a child with SMA would be just under 17% in this scenario, I think. I honestly think this is unlikely to be the case because it would be a strange thing to do to tell you the SMN1 copy number of the sperm donor but not tell you whether any of them are mutated. If he is not labelled as a carrier then this scenario is not relevant for you.\n\nHope you get peace of mind soon! Thank you so much for the super thoughtful reply. I reached out to the genetic counselor available through Counsyl who did the testing and she said due to the limitations of the testing, we do not know if there are any mutations present. So in a way the donor having 3 copies is kind of extra insurance for a good outcome, so we are going forward. ", "23, SMA type 3, wheelchair bound ", "A Question about Tablets Hey everyone! My girlfriend\u2019s son has SMA type 1 and just had his 4th birthday recently. I picked up a children\u2019s tablet for him and pre-loaded it with his favorite shows as well as music and drawing apps. I was wondering if anyone had tablets for their children and if they had any other suggestions on what I should download. SpongeBob SquarePants I am 20 and I still f with SpongeBob I would suggest a tablet stand that mounts to his chair/bed. As for shows, Avatar: The Last Airbender is great (you *might* want to wait until he is a bit older. I was 6 when I started watching it. It is more story oriented and contains a bit of mature themes and violence; nothing too bad tho. It is a Nick show after all.) Kids also love Paw Patrol for some reason idk why. Rocket Power and Hey Arnold were two of my favorite Nickelodeon shows to watch when I was a kid. This is a good project idea I did not even think of! Most of the time we are making table space for his old, clunky DVD player but this would eliminate the need. Thank you! Also I just wanted to add in my 2 cents, tablets and TV are kind of mind numbing especially nowadays. Make sure the little kid has some toys or games he could play with to keep his mind and his body active (the body might be hard tho with the sma but the brain is really important). This is the age when the mind is truly developing and its not going to develop all that much on mindless cartoons. I am sure you already knew that tho lol Oh yeah do not worry he got every toy in the isle that he could play with! The tablet was to replace his portable DVD player that we take for long trips to the doctors. The thing was a bit beaten up. My son loves Daniel Tiger and Tumble Leaf.", "Zolgensma Today my son Oliver(2mo) received his Zolgensma infusion. He was diagnosed via newborn screening and we found out at two weeks of age. He slept thru the entire thing. He has sma type 1, but is showing zero symptoms of the disease. We are so proud of him. He is my literal hero. I am so excited for his future.", "Cost of spinraza procedure for my son? So it looks like the Biogen program will cover the drug itself, but not the procedure.  And neither will his insurance.  Does anyone know what the procedure costs if I have to pay out of pocket? The cost of the procedure is different based on regional pricing differences. The same way a root canal in Alabama is cheaper than one in Manhattan, and a root canal in Brazil is usually  cheaper than anywhere in the US. I take my son to a hoptial in the northeastern US and I think they charge our insurance $2800 for the procedure, but your hospital could be very different. \n\nIn the US there are also, often, different prices for a procedure. One price for an insurance company, one for the government, and still another one for a private person paying on their own. \n\nWhere are you located? I know in our area the insurnace, if they cover Spinraza, has to cover the procedure as well. To deny payment for the procedure is, functionally, the same as denying coverage for the drug, as many people will not be able to pay for the procedure on their own. It would be good to know if insurance companies are using the cost of the procedure and not covering it as an end around way to deny coverage for Spinraza.\n \nYou might have to put in 2 requests for payment to your insurer, one for the medicine and one for the procedure. Your hospital or Biogen  should be willing to help you with this. It is also possible that since this is a new thing your hospitals finance department and/or your insurance company have not figured out how to do the paperwork yet.  You may have to help them.\n\nKeep banging. Do not take no for an answer.  If you are in the U.S., it will depend on your insurance plan and the facility.  \n\nI have really good insurance through my work.  My injections are done in Radiology using a Fluoroscope.  After all is said and done, and including the required lab tests, my bill is about $6000 per injection.  My insurance covers all of it luckily (after I pay my copay).\n\nYou might be able to work out a deal with the facility if you are \"self pay\".\n\nBiogen also has a \"$0 out of pocket\" program depending on if you qualify. Just talk to your Biogen Family Access Manager.  They will help you figure it out. The Biogen program will cover the drug itself for us, but not the procedure.  Insurance says they do not cover the procedure either.  If i have to pay 6K out of pocket per injection then we are all fucked Biogen does have a zero copay plan for procedure.  I am on it.  Maybe its different because you need the entire procedure paid for and not just the copays.  Anyways, talk to your neurologist and the hospital to see if they will give you a deal if you \"self pay\".  Talk to your FAM to see what options they may have.\n\nAt the very least, maybe you can travel to another facility in a nearby state that might do the procedure for free or at a deep discount.\n\nAlso, is your child on Medicaid or private insurance?\n\nThe last resort would be a GoFundMe. Some states (maybe all of them) have a state agency that oversees insurnace companies. \n\nContact them. You should be able to appeal your insurance company's decision not to cover the delivery procedure. States also have a similar set up for appealing denial of coverage of a procedure by Meidicaid, if that is where you get your health care coverage from.\n\nFind out which agency in your state can force you health insurer to pay for the procedure. \n\nIf you want to share your location there may be someone here who can give you the info you need.  hes on medicaid.  Biogen says they dont cover the procedure for medicaid patients. My son is covered by medicaid in MD.  any info would be appreciated  You have come to the right place my friend. I had to do the same thing you are about to do in a different state. I am not that far away from you though and my state is very similar to MD.\n\nYou can appeal a Medicaid denial and you should win. You can go it alone or contact the Maryland Legal Aid Bureau and they may be able to help you. \n\nI believe your appeal with be filed with the Maryland Deparment of Health and Mental Hygiene (what a ridiculous name).\n\nJust go to Google and type in \"How to appeal a medicaid denial in Maryland\" and you will get more than  enough info to get you rolling.\n\nFirst thing I would do is call  your son's health coverage provider  (Maryland Health Connection?). You might have to do an internal appeal before going out to the MD  DHMH. The problem is this is a new thing and big organizations do not respond well or quickly to new things. But I can tell you something like 30 or so state Medicaid programs are already covering Spinraza and the procedure. \n\nYour son is going to get this and his healthcare provider is going to pay for it. You and/or his mother may have to do some raging against the machine but it will happen. \n\nYou might want to contact CureSMA. They probably have someone in you area who could give you more MD specific info.  Also Google and the mess that is Facebook can be your friends here.  You ate not alone and there are people in MD who have already gone through what you are about to go through. Talking with them will help. \n\nI know this sucks. Based on my experience it took me about a year to really absorb my son's diagnosis.  I would suggest you try focusing on the here and now.  What can you do for him today, which is get him Spinraza and hug him a lot. It was a little easier for me in that my son was diagnosed about a year and a half before Spinraza came out, so I had some time with nothing to do except let his situation sink in.\nYou have to hit the ground running.  You just found out he has SMA and now have to fight a bunch of pencil pushers. But you can do it.     I do not know if you have done it yet, but get coordinated with your local MDA office.

Anyways, the procedure went really well. I woke up this morning and went about my normal routine. Stopped eating and drinking about 11:30. Arrived at the hospital to check in at 2. They took some standard vitals and then laid me down and put numbing cream on my back. My neurologist then asked me if I wanted to take some Valium. I am really thankful for this as I was pretty nervous. \n\nAfter they let the Valium kick in for about 15 minutes they injected me with some lidocaine. Then comes the part everyone is waiting for. My scoliosis is pretty advanced so the original spot where my doctor thought he could get it was too difficult but he tried a lower spot and got it relatively easy. He then removed some spinal fluid, injected the dose of Spinraza and took the needle out and slapped on your usual bandaid. He also used a sharpie to mark where he went in for next time. \n\nIn terms of pain it really was not too bad. The lidocaine burns a bit when injected and the spinal tap feels a little weird as they have to wiggle around a bit to get where they want but other than that it was not too big of deal. I would advise anyone who is nervous to ask for Valium or something to calm your nerves before hand. It definitely helped for me since I get nervous just doing blood tests haha.

I was wondering if there are any career paths that are suitable for people like us to pursue in the future.

Your best opportunity will be to remain in school. The reason being is your best bets will be a city, state or federal computer based job. Your insurance will mostly be gone at 25. I do believe Avexis will be available in your lifetime. I see. Will online education courses help? Also, I live in a pretty small town in Malaysia so I am not sure there will be any good job opportunities here. I have contemplated going to a bigger city or a local college but my parents are worried that I will not be taken care of properly there. Difficult question, but here are my two cents:\n\nAs u/clairepowell3737 suggested, computer-based jobs are definitely your best bet. You can work from home both for a company or independently and earn quite well. I personally enrolled back in school to obtain my master's in cyber security because I was having no luck with a bachelor's in business administration. Well, to be fair, I did have some job opportunities, but they definitely did not pay well enough to make it worthwhile, even when working from home. I say worthwhile once I consider taxes (independent contractor; paid much more in taxes), how much in government assistance I lost (SSI), and how many hours I was putting in per week. Basically, some weeks I was working more than 60 hours just to really make the work worthwhile, which was obviously placing a strain on my health both physically and emotionally (customer service is ridiculously stressful).\n\nAfter having no career advancement in sight, I decided to go back for a degree that 1. is IT related,  2. has a positive career outlook, and 3. pays more than the average job. This is crucial for me, because again, once you lose government assistance and benefits, things get substantially tougher, as you have to pay for a care provider, higher rent, health insurance, transportation, etc.\n\nI am about 4 months away from graduation, and still trying to figure out how I will pay for my certification exams ($375 worth of vouchers), which are essential for my career, but given that all goes well then, I am hopeful I will find a good job somewhere in my city. If that happens, I will let you know how it goes!\n\nIn the meantime, stay in school and reach out to Biogen for Spinraza. It will at the very least halt further progression of SMA.

Yes, that is what the data seems to show (based on a quick skim, I have not had a chance to really look at the data properly). \n\nThey mention though that they were a little surprised that their primary endpoint (change in Motor Function Measure domains 1 and 2, whatever that is) was not met given the efficacy seen in other analyses. They say that one explanation might be that the study was underpowered to detect a statistically significant change. I had a quick look at their confidence intervals and for the primary end-point it was -0.25 to 4.25. When a confidence interval is super wide it suggests that there is a lack of power. Now, this is not amongst the widest confidence intervals I have seen so I am not jumping up and down hoping this is simply a power problem *but* I would say that their lower confidence interval estimate (-0.25) is not so low that I would discard it as a possibility either. \n\nAnother point of interest is that there seemed to be a dose-response relationship to olesoxime exposure (i.e. those with more exposure to the drug did better than those with less exposure to the drug) indicating that they probably need to look into dosage changes. \n\nAnd finally, they mention the fact that the clinical measurement scales in use do not necessarily reflect real-life benefit. I think they mostly intend this in the sense that patients view maintenance of their condition as a clinically important outcome that is not captured by their measurements. But, they also mention the need for better measurement scales that capture daily activities. This is a problem in trials in general (traditionally it relates to problems measuring quality of life but it is also a problem in analyses relating to \"performing tasks\" as is the case here). So, whilst I think that they are being cautious when making this particular point, to me it reads that they recognize and suspect that their measurements may not be capturing \"real-life\" improvements. \n\nIn summary, they are right to err on the side of caution in saying that all we can say from this is that it possibly helps people maintain what they have.

It is the tackiest, most ridiculous show I have seen since I was about 14 but now I am invested.\n\nAnyway do not thank me, I am absolutely terrible at explaining things concisely and clearly, sorry it did not make much sense. I will try again (sorry, it is going to be long and rather boring - have tried to break it down into more digestible sections):\n\n**Estimates, true results and baselines**\n\nSo, let us imagine that in the entire world/universe there are 100,000 people with SMA.\n\nWe know that the study here looked at approximately 150 individuals with SMA. That means there are 99,850 SMA people that we have no data for in this study.\n\nSome people out of the 150 were given a drug and some were not. Scientists then calculated some Motor Function Measure for those who did get a drug and those who did not. \n\nIt is important to note here that for this Motor Function Measure there is a baseline of 0 - meaning no change upwards or downwards. So from here onwards, a positive number indicates a change upwards and a negative number indicates a change downwards.\n\nThose who got the drug had a score of +0.18. Let us call this result an **estimate**.\n\nAmongst those who did not take the drug, the result was -1.82, also an **estimate**.\n\nNow, the overall difference between the scores of the treated and untreated groups is 2 points (again, an **estimate**). Meaning that those on the drug did 2 points better than those not on it, overall.\n\nThese are estimates because we do not know what the **true results** would be if we included all 100,000 people with SMA in the trial. They might be the same or similar (likely) or they might not be (less likely, but possible).\n\n**This is where confidence intervals come in**\n\nSo, our **estimated result** of the difference between treated and treated groups was 2 points.\n\nThe authors calculated a **96% confidence interval** to go around this estimate of 2 points. The 96% confidence interval they calculated was \u22120\u00b725 to +4\u00b725 points. \n\nThe point of a confidence interval is to express statistical uncertainty. \n\nWhat this means is that the authors are **96% confident that the TRUE result is somewhere between -0.25 and +4.25 treatment points**. It could be anywhere between those numbers. So for example it could be that the difference between the treated and untreated groups was -0.1 points (treatment bad) or 0 points (no difference between treated and untreated groups) or 4 points (treatment good). Based on this, we cannot say that there is evidence that the treatment is effective because the confidence interval crosses the baseline (I mention this again a little further down).\n\nNow if our confidence interval was +1.5 to +3.5 we would say the treatment is effective because the confidence interval is always above the baseline of 0. Whether it is effective by 1.5 points or 1.7 points or 3.1 points or 3.5 points would not matter, the point would be that we are pretty sure it is effective.\n\nOK so that covers what the meaning of a confidence interval is and how to interpret them. Let us pause here to reconnect with the outside world before the onset of a math-induced existential crisis.\n\n**Power/Precision**\n\nSo now it would be good to understand what we mean by power and what the authors mean when they say they suspect they may have been underpowered.\n\nA confidence interval, mathematically, is inversely linked to the size of the population being studied. So in this study they had 150 people. If they had a lot more people in the study, the confidence interval would be less wide and therefore more precise. So if the study had 10,000 people in it the confidence interval might be something like -0.1 to +3.1 instead of our current -0.25 to +4.25. The more people we had, the tighter that confidence interval would get and the more confident we would be about our **estimated result**.  A wide confidence interval therefore indicates a lack of precision (or statistical power, because that sounds sexier to scientists). \n\nThe authors are saying that there is *a possibility* that the reason they saw no effect was due to a power problem and not due to the drug not working. \n\nRemember though, it does not matter how tight a confidence interval is if it crosses the baseline. If it crosses the baseline we cannot say the treatment is effective. But, if the authors are right and there really is a power problem then it is possible that a study with a larger number of individuals could provide additional power to the study and produce a more precise estimated result and a more precise confidence interval that stays above the baseline.\n\n**So does the drug really not work or are we unable to see the effect because of a power problem? How likely is the latter?**\n\nIt is the responsibility of any scientist to state whether there are any limitations to their study design that might mean that the true effect of the drug is not observed. The authors offer the possibility that the study is underpowered.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the confidence interval is indeed a bit wide but not anywhere near the widest I have seen so I am not really sure I agree with them that this is a power problem. My gut (so scientific) tells me that it is likely the case that the drug simply does not improve the condition.\n\nHowever, because the lower end of the confidence interval is quite close to the baseline of 0 (-0.25) and the top end of the confidence interval is quite a bit higher than 0 (+4.25), I would allow for the possibility that greater power might allow the confidence interval to be pushed above 0. This would mean that treatment can improve the condition but we are not seeing it because of limitations in the design of the study rather than a failure of the drug itself. If the lower end of the confidence interval was something like -0.70 (i.e if it was much further away than the baseline) then I would not entertain the thought at all.\n\nI think that if they had a serious power problem they a) would not have been allowed to publish and b) would have made this point more strongly in the paper. I would not completely discard the possibility though.\n\nBear in mind this is not my field so I am not really qualified to interpret anything other than the numbers, I do not know much about how motor outcomes might be measured for example.\n\nOh wow, scrolling up, that is a lot. Oh dear, sorry!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Oooh, its a scroller. I love them, it is like going on a journey!\n\nThat is *really* good stuff Storm!

Hello evrybody, my name is David and I am 22. I had done a genetic testing for Marfan Syndrome and Ehler Danlos since I am very tall and lanky but came out positive for SMA with an unknown significance variation in TRPV4  Chr12:g.109788637G&gt;T c.1971C&gt;A; p.Tyr657\\*. Until now I never had any problems walking or running or standing. I do have some back pain because of kyphosis and hyperlordosis but I do not know what to expect in the future, what professionals should I be contacting now, what should I be doing right now with this diagnosis. \n\nThank you for reading. I would make an appointment with a neurologist.  I am not familiar with the variations, it could be you are simply a carrier.  In witch case, you are fine.  You just would need to be cognizant of it if you plan to have children.  If your partner is also a carrier, the children could experience the sma symptoms. Did the test say your SMN1 and 2 count? No. It says the variation is in TRPV4 so idk It sounds like you do not have SMA then. At least not the \"classic\" 5q SMA that this sub is really about. If you read online about SMA treatments (Spinraza, Zolgensma, Evrysdi) they are all exclusively meant to treat 5q SMA caused by mutations or deletions in the *SMN1* gene.\n\nThe *TRPV4* variants that have been linked to types of SMA (congenital spinal muscular atrophy and scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy) are located in a different part of the protein than your variant and are described as gain-of-function mutations that cause the protein to be over-active. Your variant is a stop-mutation, presumably causing loss of function of the protein but not gain-of-function.\n\nMost of the disorders associated with loss of function of *TRPV4* are skeletal disorders with several having kyphosis as a clinical hallmark. Since you describe this symptom I think it is much more likely you have a different type of these disorders than a type of SMA. Since the variant is novel, it is possible you do not exactly match any known type of disorder but show a unique spectrum of symptoms. For instance, many of the known disorders are associated with short stature and since you were suspected for Marfan Syndrome I do not suppose this is true in your case?\n\nAs others have suggested, I would definitely see a neurologist to get a clinical assessment of any SMA-like symptoms, but I would suspect that your particular condition has more in common with the other skeletal disorders associated with mutations in the *TRPV4* gene. Thanks for the reply. Yeah my diagnosis is scapuloperobeal spinal muscular atrophy but could not find a subreddit for that haha. Yes, it is weird how most scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrohpy patients tend to be very short and I am very tall.

I am definitely all for experiencing everything life has to offer, save for things that are dangerous or potentially addictive. How does marijuana affect type 2's? Is breathing okay? Appreciate the advice. Have you ever smoked or vaped Cannabis yet?   If you have not I suggest you do not try edibles first and try smoking or even better vaping instead.  If you have smoked before and thinking about edibles you should def know how many mg you are taking too.   \n\nA lot of people make mistakes by eating a bunch of edibles and not feeling anything so then eat some more after before it initially kicks in, and then they have taken way too much and have a horrible time and people freak out.   I dunno edibles effect people very differently than just vaping.  \n\nEating on empty stomach increases the effects as well.\n\nBe safe and educated! I definitely second what this redditor said! I use marijuana (I am a weak type 3). Edibles are different. I personally would make sure you like the high of marijuana before trying edibles, like by vaping a bit. If/when you do try edibles, start off at a very small dosage and WAIT. Do not think \"oh I feel nothing let me have a little more\", you will regret it haha. The high takes longer to hit, and in my experience it does hit harder. That is not to say it is not wonderful, just that it is different. I am a little late to the party but I will chime in, too. Totally agree with the other responses. I do not know if it is my metabolism or what but edibles take 3 hours to kick in for me. \n\nAlso, it is difficult to get a consistent dose. Take a brownie as an example. There is no way to ensure that the MMJ is mixed completely throughout.\n\nAs for safety, I have never had issues breathing but I have had trouble eating/swallowing while high on edibles. I am a fairly moderate type 2. I would maybe stay away from the Cheetos your first time. Type 2 - 42yrs -  I have only been using for 6 months and now I am pissed I did not start sooner.  I have a prescription, so there is issues using if you have SMA.  If you already have concerns about your breathing, definitely avoid smoking or vaping.  Start slow.  I personally use an oral spray to better control dosage.  I have only ever tried indicas.  If I have had too much I get dizzy and paranoid.  The paranoia sometimes turns into a bit of a panic attack, usually centered around my breathing.  I use a 1:1 THC to CBD, it helps with the paranoia.  Going back onto my ventilator and having someone to help me through it let us me relax and sleep it off.  When the dosing is right I have no issues with my breathing.  I get so relaxed, it is one of those rare moments where I do not think about my breathing at all.  It is an amazing painkiller.  Get yourself a good playlist and enjoy. Type 2, 24 years old here. Sorry I am late! But glad to know you follow the same golden rule. Just got to be smart about the stupid stuff we do. Always test the edible by having a bit and waiting a decent while. You can always add more, but never less, yknow? You will likely become paranoid about your breathing but my lung specialist said that it is fine. I would just say that if you start to feel pretty tired, do not feel too bad about throwing on your bipap and getting some sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have certainly blacked out maybe twice ever. Once was an edible and another was a dab. Too big of one, that is. If you use a bipap and you trust everyone around you, you can do it safely. Just exercise caution :) Appreciate all of the advice! I do not feel too great about possibly messing with my lungs by inhaling it, so I might just go slow and take a bite or two when the time comes, then wait for awhile and see how I feel.

", "Research Paper on SMA Hello everyone!\n\nSo I am currently a freshman in college, and while I am able-bodied, I have a brother with Down's syndrome and I have been involved in his special education classes since middle school. I am currently writing a research paper for my English 161 course on Narrative Medicine on how awareness and education of SMA has increased due to social media and YouTube, specifically studying Shane Burcaw's work. I wanted to ask if any of you, no matter your association with SMA, have any thoughts, ideas, or tips on what I should include to better understand your perspective. It can be positive or negative towards the subject, and any thoughts are welcome. \n\nThanks for reading, and have a great day! 37 year old guy with SMA type 3 here. That is an interesting topic you choose to cover. And if I can add my grain of sand it would be that before internet was a common thing, let alone social media platforms and YouTube, it was very easy to feel \"unique\" and not in a good way, due to the extremely rare nature of the disease. You also had no way to compare yourself to other peers which is something every human does in a society context. I remember growing up and for years I only knew of just 1 more person with the same condition, and now I am in several WhatsApp groups with dozens of them, I see their Instagrams daily, etc. Now I know I am not \"alone\" in feeling the same things, in going through the same tribulations, etc.\n\nExcuse my english. I also think a treatment becoming available and SMA being listed as the disease most likely to be cured is another big factor. With so many genetic illnesses once you are diagnosed there is not a lot of treatment options available. Now with SMA we know the earlier the diagnosis the earlier the treatments can begin and the more muscle function will be preserved. So now for my part. I am a young mom to two recently diagnosed SMA3 patients. When my sons were born \u201c02\u201d and \u201c05\u201d no screenings were performed because there was no treatment. Now that there is a treatment available a large number of states still are not screening. Including my home state of Alabama. SMA is more common than I realized with it effecting around 1 in 6000 births. So after the shock wore off when my sons were diagnosed earlier this year it became my mission to spread awareness in hopes of earlier screenings and treatments to prevent other families from going through this same ordeal. \n\n   Here is the part for me that is difficult to swallow. In spreading awareness and encouraging screenings more children will have access to the one dose treatment avexis. In lobbying for this the number of patients that require Spinraza will dwindle rapidly. Which also means patient numbers and the demand for curing older patients of SMA will no longer be a priority. So essentially in lobbying for infant screenings I am assisting in creating the crack my children will fall through. I could be completely incorrect in that that thought process. So to summarize my actual answer I feel it is basically we can do something to treat this disease now so we are drawing attention to spread awareness and earlier detection. \n\nIt is the number one genetic killer in children and I never heard of it until March of this year. That is really poignant, thank you! Everyone deserves to find their people. Yw! =) Thank you for sharing your story, I really appreciate it. In all of the research I have done, it is been surprisingly difficult to find anything about Spinraza or other current medicines (probably because my library's database is so filled with outdated or unrelated studies). \n\nThank you for all you are doing in regards spreading awareness, and all of your thoughts are valid on that subject. By putting more emphasis onto early-onset detection, hospitals are going to direct funding into those areas of study, and hospitals that specialize in Spinraza will be more sparse. I certainly hope that they will be cognitive enough to keep in mind treatments for older patients with SMA, but sometimes it is a bit far-fetched to hope for something like that. \n\nThank you again for sharing! I learned something new today. :) Hospitals are already few and far between. We travel 5 hours for treatments and they are spinal injections so we require at least 24 hours in a near by hotel after before travel. There is also some form of daily pill treatment that is in the works too Something difficult for me that has actually led to some depression is this: I was diagnosed before I was 2 years old. Until I was about 30, I thought I was doing so well despite how downhill I would gone. I have lived through falling and fracturing my femur (osteoporosis from not being able to walk), hospitalization from a bad case of pneumonia, having my pelvis and 15 vertebrae fused along with rods put in my back, etc. Suddenly, I was DNA tested instead of told my diagnosis from molecular testing and given a type based on what I was showing. So I went from always believing I was doing well as a type 2 to finding out overnight I was a type 3 and have at least 4 copies of SMN2. Which means I feel like what the heck is wrong with me that I can barely move my arms/hands anymore even? Did I not fight enough? Am I just lazy? I battled so hard. And the constant barrage of social media and news posts can send me into a panic, like I never knew enough or treated it right and now I am a lost cause (I have had 6 doses of Spinraza under fluoroscopy so far and have LOST strength). I guess, just like so many parts of social media, now I compare and wind up feeling bad. Like I have done something incorrectly to cause my disease to have progressed further than it should have. Before, I did not really know anything but what I saw in Quest articles. SMA2 here. I think one thing that I have thought a lot about is whether social media is truly raising awareness or whether it is skewing the conversation in a way that might be negative in the long-term. \n\nIt is amazing that kids growing up today will be able to easily connect to lots of other people with the same experience as them. I did not have that growing up and finding this community, for example, has been really healing in a lot of ways. It is also great to see people like Shane out there, living a life as close to normal as possible and sharing that. When I was a kid I was desperate to find examples of people with SMA living normal lives, doing normal things, but there just were not any and that created a lot of anxiety. So in that sense I think social media is great and I am really glad that Shane has brought so much visibility to life with SMA as a young adult.\n\nHowever, there is one thing I have felt concerned about. Beyond everyday life, I have not seen social media really help raise awareness about societal challenges. Raising awareness is often limited to talking about diagnosis, treatments, the progression of illness in kids and relationships, travel and accessible fashion for young adults. Those are important aspects of our life but they are not the only aspects and I do think the focus on treatment and, to some extent, the frequent focus on children, is damaging in the long-term. I think there is huge oversight of other challenges that we face - finances, getting the personal care assistants we need to live independently, housing, inequalities and barriers to medical care, discrimination in higher education and the workplace, international disparities in provision of welfare and quality of life. I worry sometimes that social media is presenting a very skewed picture and giving parents who are raising children with SMA an unbalanced view of the challenges ahead. Treatment is one aspect of the SMA puzzle, and it is hugely important, but kids will grow up and many of them will continue to need extensive support in adulthood to face the challenges above.  Similarly, for young adults, the focus on things like relationships and travel can make people feel like they are somehow inadequate if those things have not happened for them. In reality though, those things do depend on us having a certain degree of independence and financial security and so it is important to raise awareness of those things as well. Thank you for sharing your story, and I am so sorry that it is been so hard for you. I really appreciate you sharing the negative sides of social media. That is something I never really thought of. \n\nI personally want you to know that everything you feel is valid, and that I am positive that you are doing phenomenally. This might be the typical motivational rhetoric, but from what you have shared of yourself, you are doing amazing. The fact that you are still going and working hard is unbelievable in itself, and I am so thankful that you shared your story with me. I hope nothing but the best for you in the future. Thank you again. That is very poignant. I never considered the missing aspects that do not gain attention, so they are not talked about. Especially the negative aspects of social media on \"FOMO\", but on a larger scale. Thank you for sharing this perspective with me, it is extremely illuminating. :) SMA type 3 here and I have spent the last few years writing a bit about what it is like living with SMA, you can read about it on my site, ( in the blog section, you can click on the Disabled Chronicles tag for the things I have written.

Type 3 patients in the study only got the real drug, no placebo. So smaller #'s and a smaller study with no control group.  Someone in this sub-reddit said a while back \"We are the data\" and that is definitely the case.\n\nEven within BCH, where part of the clinical trials were done (Biogen is across the river in Cambridge) there seems to be a split as to what Spinraza will do.   One of the neurologists said flat out that it is not a \"cure\" because he sees it slowing the progression of the disease, not reversing it is effects.  However I heard a much more optimistic view from one of the physical therapists who worked directly with patients involved in the clinical study. She saw improvements in things like walking ability and core strength in patients with type 3.  That, if accurate, would imply a reversal of the disease's effects, which would be much better than just a slowing of negative effects. I say \"if accurate\" because I was told by a neurologist that there can sometimes be a \"bias\" in the analysis when there sample size is so small.  People want the drug to work so they look for positive signs and maybe see some when they are not there.  \n\nWhen it comes to type 3 all they can really say is that Spinraza is not going to hurt (very few negative side effects reported) and they think it will help.  There is much more positive research for type 1 &amp; 2, but most of it involves younger patients. Kids who would not have been expected to sit up are sitting up.  Kids who never would have been expected to walk are taking a few steps.  At least that is what I got today. I was at a Children's Hospital, so they might not be 100% up on studies involving older patterns. \n\nI know most people here are not little kids.  I asked about older people and....you are the data.  The vibe I got was that Spinraza may help slow the progression, a good thing, but not so much optimism about improvements in adults. But again, I was at a Children's Hospital.\n\nSomeone here asked about people who have had calcification around the spine due to spinal fusion.  I was told that the first thing they do is x-ray the spine and see if they can find any spot to stick a needle. They do not need a lot of room and have had.some success with that route. I asked what happens if they cant find a spot for a needle. The answer was \"We are working on it.\" \n\nRegarding payment I was told Biogen knows that Roche is working on a pill  and that if that is successful no one will be using Spinraza, as long as it involves a needle to the spine.  So they are raising the price way up to make as.much money as they can while they have an exclusive window to the market. It took a lot of money to get the product to market and they would like to recoup their investment. Most people do the have $750K to drop on medicine and the impression I got from BCH is that cost will not keep patients from getting Spinraza. Between Biogen, the insurance companies, and the hospitals it looks like they will work something out. \n\nOne piece of good news is that now that Biogen has a) found a treatment, if not a cure for SMA, and b) is going to make some money off it, or at least get back some of the money they invested in research and development, that is going to push other companies into SMA research. Prior to any successful drugs being developed pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to dump money into a disease that may have no cure (or treatment). \n\nMy son's doctor today said he is putting him in the system to start getting Spinraza. His guess was  he may start getting injections in 2 months.  It is all new so it may take a little longer.  We will see. \n\nThat is it I think. If I get any new info I will post it here. \n\n Some good info there, thanks for the feedback dude. I guess it is really to early to tell, but slowing it down is certainly better than the options we had before this  :) Yes something is better than nothing. \n\nI forgot something too.  The patients in the clinical trials got loadding doses, every few weeks.  Then they got a shot every 6 months.  \n\nThe commercial  prescriptions being issued will also start with a loading dose, shots every few weeks, but then the maintenence program will be a shot every 4 months, as opposed to 6. And unless I got it wrong the actual dosage in the shots will stay the same. \n\nSo it seems like they are upping the dosage from what was given to the patients in the clinical trials.  \n its like fine wine then... the more the merrier :) I suppose now that it is proven to be safe they can start experimenting a bit...\n\nIs your son excited or are you keeping expectations low? Honestly he does not know.  I kicked him out of the room when we talked about it.  He is only 11.  Smart kid and mature but he is dealing with enough stress right now. I do not want him to spend the next few weeks/months thinking about getting a needle in his spine. Plus I am not sure how to manage his expectations since it is unknown exactly how much this will help.  \n\nSo for now it is a secret.  Thanks for all this information!!!!! My BF had SMA and his first appointment is in March and we are dying for real world experienced and stories about spinraza. Thank you! You are a good dad dude. i had my spinal fusion at 11 and looking back, i did not know what the hell was going on... \n\nSaw a Youtube vid of parents telling their 9ish yr old daughter about the treatment and she got  excited. I thought at the time that telling her could cause some really bad consequences. Thank you. Kids do not come with instructions, and if they did I probably would have lost them....I am just trying not to screw things up to bad.  He is an awesome kid.   You are welcome. I hope everyone shares any info they get.  There is so little of it out there.   Thanks for your super description of everything, crossing my fingers for your son!\n There is no manual, I checked lol. I did not know shit about my back surgery until a few weeks before. When spinraza got announced I had pretty bad lower back pain from just thinking about it. So you made the right call. That said we SMAers are sneaky fucks and tend to know more than you think we do, so he might already know.\n\nHe is only 11 but start involving him and push independence. He is not going to have a manual either when he is older.  Hahaha I like your description of you and your fellow SMAers. Yes he is a sharp cookie and probably knows more than I am aware of.  \nIt is all a big bag of suck. I am sorry to hear about your back and how that went.  Sucks. I asked about the procedure on people with calcificated spines, so thank you very much, and best of luck with your kid! Would you happen to know how I can find out if my insurance will cover the cost?  You are welcome and thank you. Now is a time for everyone to stick together and share every piece of information we can get our hands on.  Bang the phones and send emails. Lots of calls and emails. I would start with Biogen.  Where are you located?  One of the things I heard in Boston is that they are getting lots of international calls.\n\nMy impression is that payment is being worked out on a case by case basis.  Biogen is going to start with a #, then they see how much $ they can get out of the patient, the hospital, the government, the insurance company, then they give the patient the drug and take a tax deduction for any outstanding balance.  I am not 100% on that but that is my feeling based on what I have been hearing. \n\nInformation sharing is HUGE right now so if you get any info please shout it out.  I have the number for Biogen patient services. This # is specifically for Spinraza questions.  I do not think they will be able to directly answer your question (although you could always ask them if they have any experience with your particular insurance) but they may be able to point you in the right direction.\n\nI am not sure if I am allowed to post the # here but you can find it on the Google machine or the interweb or send me a message and I will reply with the number no problem.   I am so sorry dude I completely forgot about this post. If you do not mind, I would love the number. And if you have any other information that would be amazing. I will call anywhere.

So I am looking for other options.  My son is 11 years old and has type 3.  I am looking for an insurance company willing to cover him.  \n\nAny info would be greatly appreciated.   I wonder if the people who made that decision had 16 year old kids with SMA themselves, would they still have drawn the line at 15....or  if their kids were 26, or 36?\n\nSomeone should ask them.  I received a call (voicemail unfortunately) from my doctor telling me that she was not able to get the treatment approved for me :(. I do not know much of the details because that is all she really said, but it is very disheartening. I guess I can start looking around for different insurances, but I am not sure if that is an option for me in California being unemployed (I currently receive Medi-Cal). Oh well, I will keep you guys updated. Forget about the Doctor.  Stupid, ignorant skank to leave that on a voicemail.  But that is typical. Very focused on results and outcomes, which is good for patients, but certain things that would be obvious to others seem to escape a lot of Docs.  \n\nI believe you have the right of appeal within Medicaid.  Then, I think, you can do an external appeal.  Then, perhaps, Biogen may consider you \"functionally uninsured\" and give you the drug for free on a short term basis.

I add in the \"legally\", or similar lingo, just so they do not accuse me of outright threatening them ;)\n\nTry going to the media too. Hit up your Senators and member of Congress.

Hello, i think title says it all.\n\nI learned about SMA about week ago. Luckily, i am not directly affected myself or my family, but i became aware about a fundraising for the 2.1 mil therapy by a boy and it took me hard....\n\nI still hope they manage to get the money, but i am wondering what happens if they will not....\n\nThanks for any answers. Type 1s do not live for more than a few years usually. They will usually die of respiratory issues as their lungs give out. Just to be sure, that is with Spinraza?  \nDamn :( was hoping for a more optimistic answer...\n\nWeird time we live in, few years age before Spinraza, 3 years was a miracle. Today, Zolgensma is just over there, out of reach... Puts life into perspective, doesnt it.  \n\n\nSorry for rant, had to let it out :( That is without any drugs. Ok thanks. I knew that, i am interested about the data WITH Spinraza. Looking for some optimism.... my sister showed SMA at 7 months old and she lived until she was 16 years old. I was diagnosed with SMA in the 13-14 month and now I am 31 years old. I do not think there is any long-term data about life expectancy of someone with type one who was treated with Spinraza.  The treatment is very new.  \n\nYou ask about quality of life.  That is a difficult question.  \n\nHow much do you value my life?  Does that change depending on whether or not I can walk, or feed myself independently?  \n\nQuality of life is very, if not entirely, subjective.  But being alive is generally accepted as way better than being dead.  Spinraza seems to keep kids with type 1 alive. \n\nPeople often devalue the lives of people living with a disability, seeing only functional deficits and not the parts of life that make it worthwhile.  \n\nIt is not a pity to use a wheelchair, a wheelchair is having the freedom to move.  Not walking is not a problem.  Not having elevators, ramps, or accessible bathrooms is a problem.  \n\nMy wife, who has SMA type 2, has done many ordinary things.  We married, raised two brilliant daughters, and are grandparents.  She has a B.A, B.Ed, and  an M.A.  she worked in government, and retired after a 25 year career where she made significant contributions.  In retirement she is active volunteering,  advocating to improve the lives of people who have disabilities. \n\nShe has not done some ordinary things as well.  She never walked, uses a wheelchair to get around, and needs assistance with most activities of daily living.  \n\nHer quality of life is pretty damn high, although parts of our kids\u2019 teen years were very unpleasant. \n\nHere are some suggestions for getting information from people with disabilities about their lives and the value they put on them: \n\nIf you are on Facebook, look for \u201cProject Value\u201d and watch some of the videos posted by people there.  (That is project, as in send out or convey value).  At least three of those videos come from people with SMA.  \n\nRead \u201cLaughing at My Nightmare\u201d by Shane Burcaw, or google him and watch his videos.  Search YouTube for Squirmy and Grubs.  He is pretty open with sharing his life.  He also has SMA.  \n\nWatch this video from the late and funny Stella Young.  Not exactly on topic, but funny and informative.   It is hard to say. Spinraza is too new to know anything. A lot also depends on how early it is started.

I have a permobil f3 and it is fucking ridiculous how slow it goes when I am up high. It is so slow that if I am on carpet and try to just turn, I cannot and so I have to shrink and then try again. I have asked a permobil handyman to try it, and when he called the hq to try to get a code to adjust the speed, he was yelled at and told that it is against their rules or whatever due to safety issues. I completely understand that, but I have been in a chair for almost 17 years now and I know my limits and how to drive safely. I just would like to be able to have a conversation with someone face-to-face while not always having to go up and down all the time when I need to move. I do not have an answer but I am commenting because SAME. I hope someone knows. Preach. Got the same annoying \"safety\" feature on my Spectra XTR. Not being able to turn on the carpet may be more a matter of torque than speed\u2014it is the power that is lacking. Maybe the tech guy can adjust that instead of \u201cspeed\u201d? It is not exactly what you want, but at least a step in the right direction... I took an ambulance ride to the ER because of this actually. I was basically ejected out of my chair because the footrests got caught on a part of the sidewalk that was uneven. Was not hurt too bad, just a head bump and some pain for a few days. Quite the experience. 2/10 would not recommend. Yeah I thought about that, but the real problem is just being able to drive at a reasonable speed while elevated. It is so annoying to have to always go up and down when I need to reach something and then drive somewhere or if I just want to be able to talk to someone while walking. I am in college right now so I was thinking of maybe getting one of the engineering kids to do something for me. Oh yikes! I have tipped my chair before and yeah, it are not fun. May I ask how your footrests got caught? Was your chair elevated? I am just trying to imagine how that would happen because if you were up high your footrests would probably be above the sidewalk, no? The chair I have currently is a POS. One of it is many problems is that the footrests are comically low, to the point where if I am as low as the chair goes, they will drag on the floor. In order for me to actually go at a decent pace without the drag, I have to raise the chair to *just* before it goes to that low-speed safety mode. But it seems like every day the amount of height I get varies. I just happened to be unlucky and did not get as much as I needed that day.\n\nI am getting a new chair in two weeks. I want to donate this one but honestly it is such a safety hazard that I would feel guilty donating it without he problems getting fixed. Same. Each Permobile gets \"safer\", aka slower and more of pain in the ass to drive, than the last. Keep us posted if you figure something out.  My Permobile guy did not even try. I cannot speak on your specific wheelchair, but I have the same issue on my Amysystems power chair and absolutely hate that as well. The only thing I have been able to do is to possibly waive my safety rights and warranty through the place that I received it and Amy to get the programming to override it. I myself have not done it yet, but that is what I was told I can do to get over the safety issue. If you figured anything new out, lemme know too!", "Work clothes for SMA women!

I am going to ask about how long before Spinraza is readily available and the insurance/payment process. What else is in the pipeline and is it worth waiting for some other drug?

But that is just my very uneducated opinion. \n\nMy bigger complaint here is why is not the UK paying for Spinraza.  We know it is safe, we know it works, and there is no other option at this point.  Yeah, I mean, I would imagine Biogen are looking at this with some concern \u2014 4mil is massively more cost effective than say 80mil. The Spinraza thing is really grim.

From most videos I see, people are actually in a seating position more or less. With my sling, I am actually more in a resting position... Not much different from laying on my back. This makes it really hard to sit on my chair or my bath chair. Basically impossible. It also causes pain on my knees, since I cannot really bring in/bend my feet close to my butt.\n\nDo any of you share similar pain? My legs basically have to be at a 90\u00b0 position (as if on my chair), and this was basically the same case before the accident... Bringing my feet in caused severe pain. So I am thinking that either the sling is the wrong type or too big? Because I had my spinal fusion when I was 13 years old, I am guessing my torso is relatively small compared to an average male, though I do weigh about 160 pounds and I do have quite the stomach/gut ;x.\n\nSo yeah, any tips/suggestions? I am desperate to get back on my chairs! I also have my first Spinraza dosage on the 27th, and I am really hoping I can make it on my own using my chair instead of relying on ambulance transport. Fuck dude, that sounds like a crappy crappy time. Hope you are doing all right now.\n\nI use a different hoist to the hoyer as I find the hoyer to be really painful and inconvenient so I do not have much advice. However, it sounds like the sling is not right? Or potentially, you know the bit that the sling clips onto that is kind of like a long mast? I do not know if hoyer does this but some hoists have a selection of masts and it could be that the mast on yours is not the right type to have you in a seated position?\n\nI am sure someone on here will have some good advice but it might also be worth contacting the hoyer company reps and see if they can come out and assess what is going wrong - they might even be able to bring out some additional slings to try. Or alternatively an occupational therapist as a last resort?\n\nPS - Great to hear about your spinraza dosage! Good luck and stay well! It sounds like the sling is too big for you.  I have had the same results using a hospital's Hoyer. Definitely bring it up with whoever normally helps you with equipment. They can try some better fitting slings, and make sure the caregiver is hooking it up correctly.  It might be helpful to post a picture of the lift and sling too. Someone might have the same model and can give you some tips.  They are supposed to be bringing me a new lift sometime early next week, so I will bring up the sling deal. I have been in bed for five weeks now :( feelsbadman.tiff\n\nWhatever. Still pretty happy about my Spinraza finally coming through. I hope you and everyone else here gets an approval sometime soon. (  \n\n\n---\n^(*Feedback welcome at /r/image_linker_bot* | )( with \"ignore me\" via reply or PM)\n That is what I reckon too. If you do not mind me asking, does it hurt you when you bring your feet in? Stretching them out does not seem to affect me much, as there is a limit as to how far they actually stretch, but bringing them in is pretty painful... Feels like my knee is going to pop or something. Nooooooo, 5 weeks is insane. Ugh, I hope you have at least got some good shows to watch and maybe some visitors? On the bright side, you are probably totally avoiding all that nasty flu outside. Got To take the wins where we can eh? Hang in there dude. I actually have the opposite problem. It is hard to stretch my legs out.  It is partially because of tightness in my knees, but mainly because both of my hips are partially dislocated. The left leg is especially bad. \n\nDid you have that pain before your fall? Have you been able to sit in a chair normally at all since then?  My legs were pretty much the same before the accident. I have been wheelchair bound for approximately 20 years now, so most of the tendons in my lower extremities got pretty tight. Stretching my feet out just does not really happen... They go from 90\u00b0 to 120\u00b0? Trying to stretch them any further does not really hurt; they just basically do not. Bringing them is quite painful though, and that is how my accident happened more or less. It was not like I was dropped hard... More like a slow descend where I ultimately put my weight on my knees with my feet bending in towards my butt. That actually caused both of my femurs to snap! Pretty damn painful to say the least. Did you try crossing the sling in front of you (an X in between the legs)? This prevents you maybe from sliding too much forward. Also, have them pull the sling very far through (have them pull down against the seat cushion so it wont apply pressure on the legs. Idk if I was clear, let me know if not. Hope you feel better soon! You need huge doses of vitamin D but you prob know right.  I am pretty sure I did. I think the problem is that the sling is a size large, and I am really not that big. I had my spinal fusion done at 13, so my torso is not all that stretched out. Thanks for the suggestion! And yes, I do take vitamin D.  For what it is worth I am putting you in for the toughest person on the planet award, for going through that and talking about it like it is no big deal. My whole body hurts just reading what happened. You are tough as fuck.  Lol, thx &lt;3. I stopped taking pain medication after the second day following the surgery. The doctor was quite surprised at my pain tolerance. I got lucky! I had to take pain meds just reading that. Good for you! Yeah if it is a large that sounds like it is probably most of the problem (unless you were a really tall 13 year old). At my neuro centre they have a Hoyer and a large sling, they tried to lift me with it and ended up causing muscle damage in the lower back and hip area. I can definitely see how the large could cause you a lot of pain and not have you in the right position. \n\nMy understanding of slings (which is limited because I have literally used the same size since I had my spinal fusion) is that you want the length to be from like at most maybe 2 fingers above your head all the way down to your booty. I like to be able to tuck mine under the booty by a couple of fingers for added support, not sure if everyone does that. Then you want the width of the sling to basically be snug around your torso. You want to have like a tight little cocoon around your back and sides. I imagine the length of the leg bits is important too (cannot remember what those are like on the hoyer sling) but if you get the other two bits right then the leg bits will probably be the right length. Luckily, they told me that the company delivering will let me try a few sizes to see what works best. I just really need something that actually sits up while I am being transferred rather than laying flat, which is the case right now. Using the large sling just does not work and I am really hoping it is because it is too big. We will see! Thanks for the input. For my fiance it works, even for hospital slings. Crossing makes the slings a few sizes smaller and way safer (he got spinal fusion at age 12). But having a smaller sling works too :) good luck! Thanks!  I just read your story, so, probably I am late and you already resolved your sling issue. In case you are not, take a look at this \n\n I use this type of sling for 12 years, it works perfectly for me. Whoa thanks! NP. The most convenient part of it is that it is easy to put on and off, unlike slings that are supposed to be under almost all of your body and around \u2013 hate those. Hey there. I am sorry for getting back to you so late. I have been using my traditional sling which has worked well so far, except when I use it to get to my bath chair since it does not have access for using it quite well. \n\nIf you do not mind me asking, are you heavy? How much strength do you have? I am fairly heavy at about 180 pounds, though my body is not all that big at about 5'8\". I am afraid I might slip through the bottom, lol. Although it does seem to have a sort of chest brace/support? I do not have any upper body strength so I am not really able to hold or support myself in any way.\n\nI also noticed that your active in the work from home community.

Thanks in advance, and I apologize for asking so many questions. Hey man. I, too, apologize  for the delay :)\n I am not that heavy - probably, about 140-150. I do not think you can slip out of it - you (your caregiver) fasten it  tightly on your chest (it has Velcro about 5 inches wide), and those lower parts go under your hips. If you Google for pictures, you can get better impression from it than from my awkward explanation)) I also do not have any upper body strength, at all, and I have horrible scoliosis, but this sling holds me tight. You can try and find representatives in your area and ask them for demo, I think.\nOn your other questions: let me PM you, probably, not right now \u2013 I just do not feel comfortable unloading all personal info right here. OK?", "Survey to Improve Input Technology for People with Mobility Impairments (University of Washington - Computer Science) ", "My boyfriend has never been able to walk on a beach or see a sunset on one, but he once told me in passing that it is something he really longs to do. Do any of you guys have any ideas for how I could make it easier for him to enjoy a beach? He has type 3 so he can walk around on level, even ground pretty easily but the rough terrain of a beach and the lack of rigidity in the sand is what makes it really hard for him. He does not have crutches or a wheel chair or anything. He is worried about falling down and then not being able to get back up. How can I reduce this risk and help him have a good time if he ever chooses to actually go to a beach? \n\nThank you all. Search beach wheelchair and whatever beach you are going to there should some options to rent or borrow one. A walking 3 will probably would not like that.  I know I would not have.  I walked until 30ish.\n\nUneven or untrusting terrain is really hard for a type 3 that can still walk.   I would compromise on the beach thing and find a pier near a beach to walk out onto. That is a great suggestion, and I thank you, but he would not want to use a wheelchair. A major part of it is that he wants the freedom to enjoy the beach without having to think about his SMA and I feel like a wheelchair would be quite a large reminder I would find a beach with a path on it. In Denmark we have some beaches with a small concrete path, so you can follow that almost to the water, and when you come close enough the sand will be easier to walk in. If you cannot find that, then find to guys, one on each side to support him, and to pick him up if he falls :). If he wants to experience it, he have to take the risk of falling. I have never seen a beach with a path on it, but I will absolutely start looking! Thank you very very much :-) And about picking him up- I could do it all by myself and I have offered to in the past, but he really does not like being helped up, His first choice is always to crawl somewhere he can grab onto something to pull himself up. The thing about a beach is that it is a pretty open space and there is nothing tall and sturdy to grab onto near the water. \n\nHe also does not want to stand out by having something that screams 'disability' because he really does not like attention. (So no wheelchairs or crutches or anything) but I think finding a big stick/driftwood and walking around with it is not too much of an eye-catcher on a beach. Do you think that could help him balance better? Like if he used it as an inconspicuous cane? I have always hated been picked up, but in the end I did not have a choice. You get used to it, but it is a hard battle with your mind. \n\nThat depends on his strength. I am not sure it would have helped me on a beach, I would be afraid the stick would slide in then sand. I have always liked the support of walls or humans better than things who could move.  \n\nMaybe you can find a beach where the sand is mostly hard? Some places cars can drive in the sand, it should be easier to walk on. \n\nI hope you find a place! I am so happy I got to experience sand between my toes. Okay, flat beach it is then! Again, thank you. I really hope I can find one near where we live. I am also happy you got to experience sand between your toes :-) Hopefully this does not make me out to be a total shitbag, but this sounds like the symptoms of a bigger problem.  I do not know how long you have been together or what you know of the disease but it is not something that generally gets better...besides the injections going on but that is a different discussion.  I hope he does not think less of himself if he has to use a wheelchair, I mean when you are young this can be a phase.  People try to not think about the reaches of the disease, I understand, but eventually you have to work with the disease to get what you want.  Goals are still goals.  Maybe you just have to take a sand-wheelchair half way to just stand near the waves.  I would try to find out if it is embarrassing for himself or if he thinks other people are thinking less of him...because either way he could be losing out on wonderful opportunities because of small hangups.\n\nEither way, it is great to know he has someone like yourself going the distance by trying to fulfill this dream, but know there is a limit to what you can do.  Assurance that a wheelchair or some other assistance device is not going to make you for the hills might go a long way. We have been together 2 years and I did quite a bit of research on SMA because I was pretty curious about it and I ended up writing 2 papers about it in 2 different courses, but obviously I am still no expert and there is a lot more for me to learn. He is currently getting the injections and we are both hoping someone invents something better.\n\nI think the wheelchair aversion might have a little bit to do with being embarrassed about it, but it think it mostly has to do with him not wanting to fully accept what his life might be one day. Right now we are both young and he can still move around relatively easily and I think he wants to enjoy that for as long as possible before he \"gives in\" to a wheelchair. To him, that would be like giving up and just fully accepting it which I do not think he is ready to do quite yet. We both know it is coming, but we are trying to draw this phase out as long as possible. Is that healthy? I do not know. But it is working right now so I think we will just keep going with it.\n\nYou do not sound like a total shitbag, I get what you are saying. He is just not ready for a wheelchair yet, so I am trying to find other ways to help him enjoy things he otherwise would not be able to.\n\nThank you. That sounds like the most promising option so far I know it is a bit different b/c the rolls are switched, but I am type 3 who can still walk and I tend to lock arms at the elbow with my BF when we are walking for some stability. I do not really lean on him, but just having someone stabile is a big confidence booster for me. \n\nWalking barefoot when I can also adds more stability for me. I can feel changes in the ground that I cannot in shoes. I would walk around barefoot everywhere if I could lol. \n\nI totally get how he feels about using a wheelchair or cane. My plan right now is all or nothing. People staring is just annoying and it is really hard to judge when it is time to give in or keep going as normal. I do not like the idea of a wheelchair or cane personally because once you start using that you lose what little you have and it is nearly impossible to get back. I know one day that will not be an option, but right now while I can say no it is nice to have that choice even if somedays I struggle more than others. I think that is exactly how he feels about using aids as well. I am a pretty sturdy human being, so him using me for support would not be a huge problem. I have had to help him catch his balance a couple times, but other times I was not quick enough. If we went to the beach together, I would be on full alert trying to keep him upright at all times. I am just nervous that if he falls, he will not let me pick him back up. But I am sure we could have a fun time sitting in the sand there for a while. When I do fall I cannot just go from the ground to my feet. I normally get up on my knees, get myself up into a chair, then I can get up from there. Falls just happen and there is nothing you or someone else could do to stop them. Maybe bring chairs or something at seat height just in case? \n\nI am usually self conscience when I am around normal people when something like that happens or when I do something weird that is not weird for me because that is just how I have learned/ compensated with certain things. I am not that way with my BF though because he has never cared or thought what I do is weird. He also knows if I need help then I will ask otherwise he knows I am ok. \n\nI understand that it sounds like you are trying to set this up as a surprise and honestly I am not a fan of surprises because I like to plan and make sure I am able to do something before I try it. Maybe talking with him and seeing what he thinks would help. That may be better than a surprise in his case. So that way you could tell him he could lean on you or maybe use your shoulders for support for the walking part. He gets up the same exact same way. I was totally planning on talking with him about this first, but I wanted to have some ideas and suggestions from more knowledgeable people before going into this because I do not want the pressure to be completely on him for the decision making. (Thank you and everyone else for the ideas and suggestions!) I will run everything by him and see what he thinks. Hopefully one of these days he will be able to know what it is like of have sand find it is way into every nook and cranny of your body lol! My brother and his wife ( both wheelchair users) shared photos and stories about how in Hawaii (Oahu specifically) there are long rubber mats on the beach leading from the walkways up to the surf. They are sturdy enough to support wheelchairs (his a heavy duty power and hers a light manual) so I have to imagine that it would make it easier for your BF as well. I just do not know if there are any beaches where the rubber mats run parallel to the surf. I understand everything you are saying. I used a wheelchair or scooter for long distances (park, mall, school, etc) because of fatigue and because of losing my balance easily and not being able to get up again while I walked inside of my house and classes and stuff. But progression happens. Which means I fell working at a grocery store in high school and luckily was able to call co-workers over to pick me up, I was too fatigued for prom and had to sit by the time I was done getting ready, no standing for pictures, not a single dance because I would spent all my energy that day, etc. And by senior year, my brother had to give me piggyback rides across the hall from my bedroom to the bathroom so I could pee. That is when I \u201cgave in\u201d and got a power chair. I thought I would still fight and do my own transferring to bed, shower, toilet, whatever, but at age 20, one miscalculation transferring to my chair and I fell and fractured my femur. Because of course when you do not bear weight through your bones, you get osteoporosis.\n\nSo it is JMO, but I would be doing some serious talking/planning about the future while having fun. If I would used a standing frame, could I have prevented the poor bone density? If he uses a wheelchair *sometimes* now, will he have more energy for the best things? \n\nLastly, I visited the ocean when I was still walking and found it mother elfin\u2019 terrifying because even just at the shore, the waves were overpowering, knocking me over and keeping me down since I was too weak to even sit up against them. Additionally, you are right; the uneven sand makes it impossible to keep your balance on. I had WAY more fun later, when I was in a beach wheelchair, and then transferring to a pool chair kind of thing to lay in next to my husband. Plus, he pulled me along snorkeling and it was awesome. Good luck!", "Life Expectancy for SMA type 2 So, I wanted to know about the life expectancy in patients having SMA type 2 disease. Is it 30-40 years, 50 years or normal? The most recent paper I found on this was a ( that estimated a probability of 88% making it to age 40 based on data from 26 patients. There is a much more bleak ( (77% survival rate at age 20). The more recent paper puts this down to better management which makes sense to me.\n\nI would say there is two main factors:\n\n* Severity of symptoms - SMA Type 2 can vary significantly from person to person. The criteria for Type 2 is that the person can sit unaided but never stands or walks unaided. There is a lot of variation within that criteria in terms of initial weakness and rate of decline\n\n* Level of medical intervention - physical therapy, surgeries such as spinal fusion to prevent complications like scoliosis, and respiratory support when needed (CPAP machines, cough assist machines). Prevention and rapid treatment of common illnesses like flu can play a major factor. Modern medical intervention can also include drugs like Spinraza, Zolgensma or Evrysdi that can limit disease progression.\n\nEven without modern drugs, life spans can be long if SMA is properly managed and with a fair bit of luck. As an example, Steve Mikita is one of the oldest people with Type 2 who is in his 60's \n\nSteve is currently a rare case, as far as I know, with most people with Type 2 sadly dying younger, but with recent advances and better management I suspect we will see a lot more people living full lives in the coming years.\n\n**Tl;dr** - probably less than normal but difficult to quantify. Getting longer as treatment improves, expect it to go up more since we now have drugs that can limit disease progression. Thanks There are not no expiration date, it depends wildly on the individual.\n\nIt is very much possible to live to your 50s/60s", "Soon to start Spinraza, what to expect... Hello all, Am going for preliminary test to see if I am okay for Spinraza treatment. I have no reason to believe I will not be,  so was just looking for some feedback on how people who have been on Spinraza for awhile are finding it?  Any improvements or nothing to speak of? \n\nI have suitably low expectations, but it will be kind of good to some vague ideas of what I can look forward to.\n\nOh, also, how did the procedure go if you already have spinal rods? I have been on it for a couple years now. I had some minor but noticeable improvements getting the loading doses, but nothing since then. I think it is a good idea to keep your expectations low. My thought process was I just want to maintain what I have, any improvement is a bonus.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the process itself, I do not have a spinal rod, but the procedure was slightly painful and uncomfortable. It is a little gross to feel your spinal fluid dripping out of your back. But, I am sure you will be okay. Afterwards, your back is sore for about a day. Migraines headaches are common afterwards, but I have never experienced this.\r  \n\r  \nGood luck! If you want to ask me anything further, go right ahead. Post I wrote last year:\n\nEvery back, hospital, and radiologist is different but this is how Duke does me. First I get on the table and lay on my left side. The tech puts a marker on my back then puts me in the scanner and takes some scans. Radiologist and tech come in, clean my back and draws on my skin with a pen. Once ready he will first inject a few shots of licocaine, this honestly hurts the most and burns. He then slides me into the scanner, leans in, and inserts an introduction needle, I should not feel anything, licocaine is a hell of a drug, ask for more if it hurts. Then comes the spinal needle inserted inside the first needle, I use a 24g Gertie needle since its thin and has a pencil tip instead of cutting edge. The entire time he is watching the needle on the screen and shining a laser from the scanner through the needle to get the angle perfect. He will push it deeper and pause every little bit. I still do not feel anything. As he gets in the spine I start to feel a dull ache. My back is a rock so they go in through the side of my spine through a nerve canal, so they sometimes bump into a nerve sending a jolt down my leg. Eventually I feel some pressure and pop, he is in. Everyone has different spinal pressure, but for me it is low, so the fluid has to be pulled out. With fluid confirmed he will signal neurology to open the box and load the Spinraza into a syringe, meanwhile I am just laying there with a needle in me. The Neurologist enters, connects to a tube connected to the needle and pushes the drug. After the Radiologist connects his syringe with my fluid to flush the needle. Since I have got low pressure I have them put back every drop of my fluid, otherwise I get a headache. He then in half a second pulls out the needle, done. It is always amazing how fast its over. I then get in my chair, go to recovery for an hour, then go home. I only lay down if I get a headache. I have spinal rods as well. At first they tried putting a port that went to my spine but that did not work. So they ended up doing a procedure where they drilled a small hole in the metal so they could access it. &gt;I just want to maintain what I have, any improvement is a bonus\n\nAye, that was my thinking as well. What were the improvements if you do not mind me asking? That is great, thanks for the detailed headsup. My breathing improved. I did not really notice it myself, but everybody said that my speech was stronger and I had to stop for air less frequently. Every now and then I would get some sleep apnea, I have not experienced that for over a year.\r  \n\r  \nI eat more, that is pretty common.\r  \n\r  \nI gained more endurance. Playing video games with my friends, my hands would not get tired like they used to.\r  \n\r  \nMy back got stronger. I used to sit in my wheelchair and 45\u00b0 angle, but is now down to 30\u00b0 where I am comfortable. You know what, that all sounds great. If I get that, I will be happy (\u30c4) Cheers for the details. Best of luck, brother.", "Wanting to help my friend with SMA Type 2 Hello, I have recently got to know an online friend with SMA Type 2. Honestly, I have not known the name of this condition until lately. I have done some research on it, but there are not a lot of articles to answer my questions, so I thought I would take it here.\n\nI really would like to help her in any way I can, be it financially or just to let her enjoy her life a little more, to be able to experience a more \"normal\" life. I am personally a music teacher, and I thought of basking to help her raise funds for her treatment. And I thought that if I could teach her some basic piano or ukulele, I can help her have some enjoyment, even if she does not join me in basking (I know how difficult it is for her to get out of her house).\n\nSome articles tell me that some SMA Type 2 people have problems using the computer keyboard. She herself has told me that she tried picking up the piano again but there are some complications which is difficult for her to explain. So I was wondering if anyone with the condition play a musical instrument, and maybe if a ukulele would be a better option than a keyboard, or any other instruments.\n\nOn top of that, what advice would you give someone who wants to help in any way? Should I be mindful of anything in particular? I am planning to meet her in person soon. Any information and advice would be useful, thanks!! First off hello and welcome! My advice would be to just be her friend. You do not have to do anything special. Look at her as a just a person you are trying to form a friendship with, not someone you need to help, unless she specifically asks you for help, and its within you ability to do so. Treat her as you would treat any other friend. Hmm alright, thanks! Besides treating her like a friend, I think it is also okay to ask if she needs help with certain things and not making a huge deal or ordeal to help if that makes sense?!\n\nFor example, I had this friend who invited me out for lunch once and she made sure to be the lead: she asked for an accessible table so we could sit comfortably. When we got to the table, we were in conversation and she asked if I needed help adjusting my arms and offered to help me if I did, just real low key. While we spoke she casually pushed the silverware closer to me along with my water because she knew it was too far away for me to reach, etc...\n\nI remember this lunch in particular because she knew my limitations and felt comfortable enough to ask if I needed her help and was super willing to either lend a hand or sit back and let me do it on my own, while we were in conversation. It was awesome. \n\nGet to know her and what feels comfortable for her. Be a friend that is aware and pays attention to details. But most importantly, respect her wishes and her autonomy. \n\nLet us know how it goes. Hmm alright, I will take note! Thanks!! I once learned how to play simple guitar songs but because i do not have the finger strength to hold down the strings, i used a rubber and could then play some songs. Think a ukulele might be the same thing, strings are too tight to actually play any notes Aw, but I am glad to hear that you tried it out! Thank you for letting me know! Hey there. You are very nice for wanting to help people. My advice would be to help her if she asks you for help like you would anyone. The thing is, this is our state of 'normal'. For example, I like gaming but cannot do it very well, so enjoy watching my nephews play instead \u2014 I am comfortable with that and do not feel any need for it to be otherwise. That make sense?\n\nThat said, I would imagine, if she is like me, she will not have anywhere near the dexterity needed for a stringed instrument. If some was going to teach me an instrument I have always had a hankering to try the harmonica. (\u30c4) I see, I guess looking at all the comments I should just be a friend and treat her like I do to everyone else. Thank you!! It is great that you care enough to ask bud :) I will say from my own experience that I stopped using the keyboard to write, because after 2-3 phrases it becomes very difficult. I write with a virtual keyboard with the mouse.\n\nand believe me, just having a friend already means a lot.", "My 2yr old son was diagnosed Type II last summer. I have a question for parents of SMA kids. Does it ever get any easier?  My heart is broken more than I ever thought it could be.  Our 1st born son was the happiest thing that ever happened to me.  Then we found out, and then he became the saddest.\n\nHe will never ride bikes with the other kids, play tag, dodgeball, baseball, play in a band, climb trees, play on the playground at recess, build pillow forts, jump on the bed, sneak out his bedroom window, splash around in the ocean waves, or have a normal sex life. \n\nI have been in a state of despair for months.  I block out my thoughts the best i can to keep functioning and going to work.  I want to know if accepting this will ever get any easier.\n\nI have been through tragedies in life before. Bad ones.  But my happiness has always healed itself over time.  This one just feels like constant mourning forever. \n I have lived a fairly normal and happy life. I honestly have no complaints. It definitely helps to have amazing parents though. Your child will live a long and happy life as long as you are there to support and care for him.\n\nGrowing up, I had a ton of friends and I do not really feel like I missed out on a whole lot. I guess I could not play sports... lolsports. I was able to ride a bike (I have type III), but it got old really fast, lol. Even when I lost the ability to walk at 10, I was just like \"meh.\" \n\nBeing disabled is not the end of the world. I also would not be too bummed out with all the recent advancements. Spinraza's just the start, and it basically halts any further progression of the condition and it even appears to allow development in many areas. So yeah, SMA's whatever. I would not trip about it. We have spoken before. I have no idea if it gets easier as a parent, emotionally, you would have to ask another parent. What I will say is that over time you will become more resilient.\n\nBut your child can can live a mostly normal life, there is much much worse shit than SMA out there. No, it is not always easy and sometimes things do not go as planned or as desired but it is your job to prepare your kid and support him to do whatever he can while he is able to, that is what having kids is all about. My parents never focused on what I could not do, they focused on what I could do and did everything to support those things. I never once heard a single negative thing about my abilities from them. I excelled at school, I went horse-riding and swimming for as long as I was able to, I had great friends, I played tag (yes, it is possible), I had sleepovers, I got into trouble, I rebelled as a teenager, I made dumb decisions like getting stupid piercings in stupid places, I went to concerts, I took part in school plays, I fell in love with dumb boys who broke my heart, I went to the top uni in my country and graduated in the top of my cohort, I found a guy who stands by me despite the fact that he could easily have someone without all my emotional and physical issues, I wake up every day now and do work that helps people (which is what I always knew I wanted to do, since I was a kid).\n\nSeriously - if anything I would say my life has been extraordinarily good. Of course there is another side to all this - the medical appointments, the spinal surgery, the constant fear and uncertainty about tomorrow, the difficulty of the winter flu season, the loss of abilities over time and the grief that comes with that, the stress of learning how to live independently, the fear that my parents will one day not be here to help me and not feeling ready for that despite being a grown-ass adult, the fear of being alone in all this. \n\nNone of this is easy dude, but you are lucky because when I was born almost 30 years ago there was no hope. You have hope, there is a drug that literally can halt progression and there are even more things in the pipeline. No, it is not all rainbows and unicorns but it sure as hell is not the end of the world and life either.\n I can feel your pain and its heartbreaking. Makes me wonder what my dad went through when he found out the same thing. I do know that he essentially ignored it for the first 10 years and pushed me harder than he would have done normally. Between us, I also fear it made him quite bitter for a long time and this has made *me* feel guilty... So for your sons sake  you need to find a way out of this, by counselling or any other means at your disposal.\n\nIs it helps, you are wrong in what you say about what he will not be able to do. I was diagnosed at with Type II/III. I had sleepovers, played with friends, went on swings and swam like a dolphin! Later on I snogged girls, smoked weed, went to concerts and was out almost every night drinking with my mates. He will do those things but *it will just be different to how you did them*. Life is harder with this condition, but it is still a life he will fill with stuff!\n\nPlease, talk to u/24pointbuck. He has been in your situation. Be thankful that your kid was born NOW and not 30+ years ago like many of us lol. And hey! I has the secs pretty well! ;) all of the modern medicine breakthroughs are the only hope i have.  he just finished spinraza loading doses but it hasnt done much yet.  \n\nhow do you have the secs well?  like seriously i want to know how that even works.   you can pm me if u want. Of course I can pm you! My 12 year old son has SMA. The first year or so after I found out my head was spinning. That is normal I think.  Like a  wedding, death of a loved one, or any other major life event. It takes a while to sink in. \n\nEnjoy your time with him.  He is still going to smile and make you smile. He will grow up and make poop jokes and you will both laugh. Do not focus on the thing he cannot or will not do. With the advances in medical science you do not know what he will be able to do in 20 years (when, really, he will still be a kid). \n\nThink of all the things he CAN do.  For example, instead of getting his head bashed in playing football he is can learn a second language, or coding, or some other skill he is going to use to make tons of money and buy you a beach house. Or something like that. He can be a rockstar, just maybe not the way you thought he would be.  As was already pointed out, kids with SMA are wicked SMArt.\n\nI have used this example before but it is a good one. Google \"Paul Allen\". Not the most athletic guy in the world and had major health problems, so he just co-founded a little company called Microsoft,  made a few billion dollars, then bought an NBA and NFL team. Rockstar. So your little guy might not be the quartback on your local football team, but he could own the whole darn team, including the cheerleaders ;) \n\nYou can dig a big pit and throw yourself in and be miserable if you want, but I would not suggest it. Have some fun. Be patient, be there for him, and he will do some great things and you will both have great lives. \n\nDo your best.  You do not have to be an all star, just be there. ", "Spinraza with type 3 I am currently in the process of getting approved for spinraza, but I am not totally sold on it yet. I am nervous about the injections and the amount of time off work it would cause. I am 26 and can still walk. I have good and bad days with walking. I also have arthritis in my hip now, which is the joys of getting old. I am kind of wary of most doctors because they do not know what they are talking about with sma and these doctors seem pushy for me to be in their study because I can stil walk. It would be at OSU if I got it done. I have been deneid by my insurance twice already because I am over their 15 year old age limit. Any thoughts or experiences on spinraza that would help me make a decision? I have no idea what the impact will be with type 3. \nBut the three year old I know with type 1 is now walking on an off. Prior to this she could hardly sit. \n\nIf this drug stops your decline and keeps you walking I think it is worth the time off work. The different types of SMA are largely determined by the number of SMN2 copies (ie type 1s may have only 1 copy while type 3s may have 3 or 4 copies). Spinraza works by activating the SMN2 gene so the more copies you have the more effective it should be. That all being said it is so potent in type 1 patients that it likely restores SMA protein to normal levels even with one SMN2 copy. I have three copies. Right so it probably would work well. Also why would it cause time off work for you? Many places are doing the injections with just local anesthesia so ends up being a very simple procedure. Perhaps you should ask about that. I work in a production lab that is pretty fast pace to begin with and nearly impossible when I am not feeling well. I am guessing you have never had spinraza by the way your talking. I king of wanted the opinion of someone who was already taking spinraza. Otherwise u have no idea what it is like to work with sma. I know I have it easy having type 3 and I am still in tears most days from the pain. My 10 year old with type 3 has been getting it for 2 years. She has an unusually hard time with it. She gets it on a Tuesday and stays home through Friday. I have not heard of anyone else that feels bad so often or for so long. She had lost the ability to walk right before starting spinraza and she has not gained that back but we have seen benefits in other areas. Her endurance seems improved and her arm strength has definitely improved. She could not open markers, lunch containers and was struggling to lift a full cup. She can now do those things and more! It was/is a hard decision for us keeping her on it because of her personal struggles after every injection but it really has increased her Independence to make the hard days worth it. I can understand how missing that much work would be a serious concern for you but like I said it is not common to be down for so long after and the only way you will know is if you try it. And maybe increased endurance will balance out the time you miss work for the injection. It is a tough decision and I hope you can choose whatever works best for you. My kid is 13 years old, has SMA type 3, and Spinraza is working great for him. \nAs a general rule he goes right back to normal actiives the day after the shot. He has had spinal headaches twice out of maybe 10 shots. The headaches are bad news but go away within a couple days. Totally worth it for the benefit he gets from the shot. \nAfter seeing his results I cannot recomend it enough, but he is 13 not 26. If headaches are her issue talk with whoever gives her the shot about taking more or less fluid out before putting the Spinraza in. I think that helps some people. The procedure takes about 45 mins 1 hr max and you need to lay down the rest of the day and stay very well hydrated. You should not be out of commission for more than a day. The doctor can mess up and hit a nerve that can cause pain for weeks but that is very rare and even rarer if you do not have a spinal fusion. I am taking spinraza and I think it is well worth the risk (however small they may be). If it were not for spinraza I would continue to decline in strength and might not even be able to write this response. Thanks, I guess I know it is the right thing to do, but just struggling with it mentally It is alright to be scared. I am still scared every time and I have had it 8 times now. My sister is even more scared than I am. But we believe it is worth it so we continue to get it. You might be offered Valium to help with the nerves. I recommend talking to a doctor you trust to help you get prepared mentally. I agree that it is hard mentally especially if you have a job/school. Ultimately it is your decision so do whatever you decide is best. Yeah, it would be nice if I was even a few years younger thinking about doing this. I guess I am just struggling with this more mentally. I get what you are saying about being scared, but believing it is worth it. I just wish I could get it done and over with. I have been struggling with insurance for most of the year now, so dragging it out is giving me a lot of time to have doubt and make it worse thinking about it. I am 30 years old with type 3 and am getting Spinraza. I no longer walk, but am mostly independent except for transfers. I work and go to school full time and I take the day of a Spinraza injection off from work, but still go to class in the evening. It takes normally 30 minutes max, and I lay down for an hour after, and then I am good to go. I had a headache the first two injections, and then none since. It is worth it. I have seen no more decline, and I have seen improvement in my arms, neck, and leg strength. Thanks, that is really reassuring. I am starting to feel better about my choice with all the feedback. There is not a book on how to live with sma and I have tried so many things that have not helped already. I am really sorry she is having a rough time. Coming from experience all I can say is never tell her she cannot do something. Sma already sucks and not having a family that supports you through whatever you want to do is worse. I was always told I would not be able to do the things that I have accomplished. It is hard to have family doubt your abilities. It is totally a tough decision and every decision is very personal and individual for everyone with SMA. I personally recommend it to everyone. I also know a handful of people who have started Spinraza and then stopped for whatever reason they had. So it is super variable. Fingers crossed a much easier treatment is in our near future. So true about the easier treatment! I hope I am not prying, but what are u going to school for? Not at all! I work as a social worker, but I am going to school for a master's in social work so I can get my licensure. That is really cool. I have a chemistry degree, but I am not sure I have it in me to get a masters. I have forgotten way too much by now. Hope you are close to getting your masters! Hey so I have SMA type 3, age 28. I still walk, and take the subway to my job as a corporate attorney in NYC everyday. \n\nNow I do not say that to sound fancy, I say it to let you know that I work long hours with little sleep, and am still able to navigate the large crowds of people who stop/start/ change direction at a moments notice. \n\nI can say with confidence that I do not think I would be managing that without the Spinraza. \n\nThe biggest benefit I see is less fatigue. I am also seeing improved strength in my upper body and am also having fewer falls than I used to.  Has it completely reversed my SMA? No.  But it is made life a hell of a lot better and helped me maintain my independence and ability to work. \n\nThe other thing to think about is that the Spinraza making things better is really the cherry on top - the big thing is it preventing things from getting worse.  I have been on it for just over 18 months and have had no deterioration - and am improving on some of the scores.  As I am still walking like you, this has been one of the biggest things for me - keeping walking and avoiding needing a walker or chair for as long as I can. \n\nAs far as recovery time goes; I have noticed it can vary. I have had some doses where the recovery time was no more than a day, and others where it took a week or so to go back to normal (no soreness). I recommend drinking lots of water the week leading up to it as staying hydrated really makes a difference. \nFor sure talk to your doctor about the different ways the dosing can be completed; I have done it both fully awake and sedated under light anesthesia, and I personally prefer the anesthesia way due to a faster recovery time. \n\nRegarding participating in studies, please do not think you have to do that if you do not want.  I have participated in research testing at some of my doses, and at others have said no when I did not have the time.  I really do not think it would be ethical for a doctor to deny you the treatment because you did not want to be a guinea pig.\n\nIn terms of the cost of the drug with the procedure, I have found that Biogen and their case managers have been really helpful with advocating to the insurance companies and providing co-pay assistance. \n\nI hope that helps, that is my honest experience with it all. Take care! I am 29 years old and have type 3. I stopped walking about three years ago around the same age you are now. I WISH spinraza was available back when I was still able to walk. I would probably still be able to walk now if it were. I have had eight injections so far. I have had headaches twice and for me they last about a week. But once those headaches went away I felt amazing. Physically every part of my body felt stronger. My forearms, biceps and shoulder got bigger and stronger. My back and abs felt stronger so my posture was better (less slouching). And every part of my legs felt better as well, to the point where I felt in a few more months and after a couple more injections I could start walking again. But my progress stopped. Basically I had two injections and I felt like they did nothing. Which caused me to lose all the progress I made physically from earlier injections. I have had my SPECULATIONS on why those two injections did nothing for me just no way to prove it. I have had another shot since then and it seems like spinraza is working again but not like it did at the beginning.\n\nI met with a family access manager and a director last week. One thing they mentioned was that some with type 3 and 4 and in better physical states will not try to get spinraza until something drastic happens to them. She told me the story of one guy that went on a trip for work and had something drastic to him. He immediately wanted to get on spinraza after that. We are here to give insight and info and the decision is YOURS to make but take that into consideration when you are making your decision. Do not wait until your health declines, possibly the ability to walk, to decide. Good luck with everything! Hope this was helpful\n\nI have more I can go on about. If you have more questions feel free to ask.\n\nHere the link to an earlier thread were I and others go into some detail about their experience.   Yeah, I totally get what your saying about not getting it till something drastic has happened. My hips have definitely been on a decline the last year where I was more stable before that. The arthritis in my hips has been brewing for about 12 years now, but nobody ever wanted to even bother with an MRI to see why I was actually having hip pain. I am at the point I am in tears from the pain and cannot handle it like I did before. \n\nI feel better, but still scared about pursuing this. I am just getting frustrated with the process and getting stuck in my head now. My insurance has denied it and I am afraid going through biogen will cost too much that I cannot pay. Another thing is I work third shift, so it is hard to get sleep and deal will this process and the amount of time it takes to get done. I have been dealing with this since March of this year and I am nowhere near a date or cost estimate. It is a lot of stress I was not expecting. About how long did it take u to get funding/ approval? I have been working on it since March of this year and I have no end in site so far. It is starting to get frustrating. I was hoping to start before winter because I hurt myself a few times last winter. I am starting to lose hope in that and I am not sure I can take another winter. Do you mind if I ask what insurance company you have? Feel free to private message. Are you working through a pediatric hospital? I started with my first appointment in about November and it took until March to get approved/dosed. \n\nI am happy to help in anyway possible. \nI started dosing with Blue Cross Blue Shield, now I have Cigna due to a job change. I have Aetna and they are adamant about not covering anyone over 15 years old. I have been denied three times now. I have the option of having blue cross blue shield through my job too, but up until now I have never had issues with Aetna.   They have a 90/10 plan with no referrals needed that has been pretty handy with someone with semi regular issues. \n\nI asked if switching to blue cross blue shield would be better and was told I do not meet all of their requirements either because I have too many copies of sm2. Whether that is true or not I do not know. Biogen has a program which if you get denied three times they will provide Spinraza for free. I know this because my brother got denied three times and got it for free. Idk if the lumbar puncture is covered as well. Ask your neurologist about that. Your family access manager should be able to tell you more. What kind of testing do you have to ask a doctor about this??? This might be a good thing for me to know. I think just testing for SMN2 gene copy number. The clinician should be removing 5ml of CSF and replacing with 5ml of Spinraza. It is been almost 2 years so I do not remember the exact numbers, but I think they tweaked them for my kid after he got a bad headache. Like they took out 4.75 or 5.25 instead of 5. Something along those lines. He has not had a problem since. Hey idk if you are still following this but are you in the \"living with MD\" group on FB? It is a huge group of people with MD and it is totally ran by us. It is extremely helpful. I would actually say it was pretty life changing when I found that community. PM me if you need help finding it.\n\nI have Sma2. I am a pretty strong sma 2. Spinraza has been life changing for me. I would do it. Late to the post but thought I would share.  I have SMA type 2 with 3 SMN copies and I also get Spinraza at OSU.  Ive been on it for 6 months and have seen increased energy but no measurable increase in muscle strength.  I have had no problems with the injections. No pain afterwards or anything.  I would definitely do it again.  Im sorry to hear about your insurance.  I have Medicaid and I have been able to keep it despite working full time because I pay into the program through medicaid buy in.  Not sure if it is an option for you but if Aetna keeps screwing you around it may be worth considering.\n\nGood luck I finally got approved for the free drug program after a year, but now OSU is screwing with me. I love my other doctors through OSU especially my primary care doctor, but because I do not want to participate in their study on SMA I am being ignored and treated like a bad guy. They did not even tell me about the study till I got approved otherwise I would have switched to a different facility a year ago. They have been telling me for three weeks now that they would schedule me for the initial assessment and still nothing but the typical run around. \n\nI feel so defeated at this point. I do not see how I am the bad guy for not having time to do the study and not wanting to live my life as a lab rat. I am sorry to hear they are doing that.  Fwiw it took them several weeks to schedule me too.  I am not sure what to do too change it I guess just keep pushing.  You have been talking to Brent right?\n\nAlso the study, if it is the one I am in, is an appt every 4 months with neuro, pt, etc to evaluate if you have made improvements.  Its an all day affair and it gets tedious but manageable.  Idk how much they told you about it.  They definitely should not withhold care just because you do not want to do that.  Im sure you are not the first person to turn down the study. Yeah, Brent rubs me the wrong way. I do not know if I am just frustrated with the situation, but him talking to me like a five year old drives me nuts. Right now I am trying to get ahold of Marco for scheduling and he does not respond at all. \n\nThey told me about the all day thing sort of. I said I did not have time for that and I am dealing with some issues with my hip along with a broken foot. I was crying after ortho was messing with it last week. I also said I prefer to see my doctors and do not like people touching my legs. It takes me a long time to like and trust doctors. Marco I do not like at all.  I have to call him multiple times to get a response. Im surprised Brent talks to you that way though.  He was like the one person that never talked to me that way.  We shared drunk stories, talked abt relationships etc.  I had a lot of doctors growing up that talked down to me and treated me like a science experiment.  But Brent and Dr Elsheik were always pretty cool to me.  Sucks to hear its not like that for everyone.\n\nI really hope they can respect you not wanting to do the study because you definitely have the right to refuse it and you have legitimate reasons for not wanting to do it. He might be a nice guy, but like I said I am getting really frustrated with this after a year plus. I have never even talked to dr. Elsheik. I wish they would have disclosed that their program was apart of a research study from the very beginning. I have been trying for three weeks now to get someone to answer if getting treatment at OSU is dependent on doing the study.\n\nI know studies are necessary in science, but I am just trying to live my life as normal as possible without being a science experiment. I normally really like OSU. I guess not. I just got bumped from seeing them because I do not want to do the study. I am trying really hard to be nice and not say what I want to say to them right now.", "Mix of Muscle Vibration and Intensive Rehab Seen to Increase Muscle Strength in SMA Type 2 and 3 in German Study  I was pushed pretty hard as a kid with exercises... endless boring exercises (or so it seemed to child me). I have often wondered if it made any difference.\n\nLater on, I was always told exercise did not really do much, the best we could do was just to keep supple. Looks like maybe the exercise was not a waste after all.\n\nI wonder if the vibrations would help as an adult? It would also be interesting to see the results with patients using Spinraza It would indeed. Would it be even more beneficial I wonder?", "Baby Teera born in August 2020 is suffering SMA ", "Serious question to people taking or that have taken Spinraza. Long-term questions and stuff... Hello everyone,\nSo real quick I had a couple questions for anybody like myself who has taken spinraza or is still taking spinraza. There are mumblings that a possible oral version of a spinraza-like drug is coming down the pipe...so my first question: is anybody considering continuing the spinraza injections if an alternative is available? My next question is kind of a combination of my experience as well as a hypothetical question to others, so because of covid-19 I basically quit taking my injections because it is just another chance - probably a small one but a chance - to be exposed. I know I probably should continue to take them, it is just I do not want to risk it after hearing about the case resurgence and a possible alternate drug. So, is anybody else having similar feelings or have stopped altogether because of possible exposure? And does that response relate to the first question at all? \n\nPersonally I just do not know why anybody would continue taking these complicated injections when there is going to potentially be an alternative treatment that would work in a similar fashion. I was thinking maybe if you are younger it would be more important to continue using spinraza, but that is really the only idea I could come up with. Has anyone else's representative said anything regarding that? I am also wondering if maybe Biogen has a trick up their sleeve or maybe they know that the potency of their drug is more so than the oral competition because again honestly I cannot imagine with the general complications of drug delivery to some people's physical issues, bullshit cost, and everything in between of why you would remain on it. Brand loyalty? Fuck right off.\n\nSo anyway, if anybody has some thoughts or feedback, or wants to call me an idiot for stopping my treatment please do so. I would like to hear how other people are handling the situation and what they plan on doing should an alternative treatment come about. Otherwise take care and stay safe! \n\nThanks! If Spinraza is markedly more effective, insurance continues to pay for it, and if I am given the choice; I will continue the injections. One miserable, traumatic day every 4 months is not so bad. \n\nIf there is not much difference between Spinraza and Risdiplam, insurance pays for it, and I am given a choice; then, yeah, I will go for the oral treatment. I recently had this very discussion with  my neurologist. He said the data on Risdiplam effectiveness in adults is *expected* to come out in August along with a possible FDA approval. He said for the data they already have it seems to help better with swallow and breathing function than Spinraza. If it is of the same quality and my insurance pays for it then I will probably switch. \n\nAs far as continuing injections during Covid, my injection site has said it is up to the individual but I still went to mine in May during the height of all the cases and I was ok. The hospitals are pretty good on making everyone wear a mask and they have protocols in place to keep things like Covid contained. We continued injections. My sons very mobile type 3s so we all know time lost is muscle loss. We were to fearful at major losses for them from muscle function so we continued on but I think it is a personal choice.\n  \nAs far as the oral drug goes we are anxious to see the studies. Thanks for the response. You said you discussed it with your neurologist which I did as well. The thing that gets me is after delaying my injection I have not heard anything from my Biogen representative which to me says there is a scrambling for new patients before it is laughed out of the picture by an oral version. So far all the answers here are what I expected, if the oral version works why go through the injection. Covid is the catalyst for my switch and I do not think I am alone. How do you think you will measure effectiveness? Just their feedback from the studies or wait to hear the feedback from Reddit or Facebook psychopaths? \n\nI had the similar 4 month rationalization before the plague but now I do not even want the risk. I think it will not look like overreacting if I am around when the covid numbers dip but that is just me. Totally appreciate your feedback, thanks! I appreciate your feedback, thanks! If he is young I can see the need to keep it going. Has it been going well? I am older so I came to the drug late so I do not think I am missing much by cutting it early. Hope the oral version works for you all. I have two. They were diagnosed in March of 2019 when they were 13 and almost 17. Are you 2 or 3? I am still getting the injections. It is important to keep up the levels of SMN in your nerves. When you stop, the levels go down and your nerves can start dying again. The oral drug is through a separate company, Roche. It is called Risdiplam and it has not been approved yet by the FDA. Approval is taking longer than expected due to COVID and after approval, it is another fight with insurance companies to get coverage. I would say continue getting injections. It is not worth the potential progression of SMA. We have a long way to go before we switch to Risdiplam My little brother (almost 7) is in a trial with Risdiplam and he is doing very well without Spinraza injections. I will wait for some data and talk with my neuro. I stay far, far away from FB. It is a dark place. \n\nI had a shot scheduled a couple weeks after the stay-at-home order. Decided to postpone it for as long as I could, just to see which way this thing was headed. Talked to a couple doctors and they said it was pretty safe, and thought I should get the shot. Ended up getting it late May. It was actually the easiest appointment so far. Everyone had to wear masks, the waiting room was empty, and we were in and out. Definitely shaved a couple hours off the visit.\n\nThings are different than in May though, numbers are way up where I live. I am not sure what my docs will say in September. I have a good relationship with them so I will follow their advice. \n\nI do not think you are overreacting. There are a lot of factors that affect your decision, and your situation is different than mine. If you trust your doctors I would recommend following their advice, but you know your situation best. Your words give me hope, in the last year my swallowing's been compromised and I am on spinraza. Been avoiding solid food since november It is tough to know what to do, and that is why I thought I would ask the question on top of the oral drug question. If you are comfortable with it, can I ask where you are located? Hopefully it is not Texas or one of the other states that is currently exploding! Well that is definitely good to know. Has there been any noticeable difference from before and now after? I am a bit older, well quite a bit older, so I imagine the effects on somebody in their 30s is going to be quite different but without Facebook I really do not hear anything. Not that Facebook information has been that useful anyway, but I joined to get more information while getting my spinraza injections and I will just say it was full of the most bogus and fear-mongering information about the injections that I did not expect but after the fact completely regret signing up for it. I think I am Type 2. Sometimes there is a lot of confusion between two and three but I have never been able to walk and was diagnosed at like three months. I am pretty sure I am Type 2, but after reading some of the Facebook groups a while back honestly I do not know anymore. \n\nSince your son's are younger how was the battle to actually get the injection? I was over 15 which because of my health insurance through work there was a cut off at that age in the fine print where I could not even be considered for it. Without the free drug program I would not have had a chance. He is been pretty stable since his spinraza injections and has not had any side effects really. He had to quit spinraza because of the trial and has been as stable as when he was on it. I think the main difference is the stop of the progression. Wow, so he has had exposure to both? That is pretty remarkable. I definitely understand the the effort to try to stave off the progression. I would sacrifice small adorable animals just for a few more days of the capabilities I had in high school versus what I have now. Hopefully it works out well for him...and everybody if the trial is successful. Thanks for your feedback. Yes! He had to stop with spinraza for the study which was pretty scary as it was stabilizing him. Message me anytime you want to learn more! I am in Greenville, South Carolina. Our cases have shot up since re-opening. It is not Texas numbers, but that just because we are not as big. Same mentality when it comes to social distancing and mask wearing though. I have Spinraza in a few weeks, and I am hoping it will be the last. For me, due to my spinal fusion, I go through at least 7+ CT scans every treatment. I believe my next injection will be my 10th; it is a lot of radiation over time that worries me. \n\nI definitely need to ask my new all just about receiving Risdiplam--not so much because of its efficacy--but because of radiation concerns that I would rather avoid if at all possible. I think that is a good concerned that a lot of people are forgetting about. My first few were done by x-ray but they switch to the CT version because it was a little quicker. But I can understand with a fusion, which I do not have, that there could be a serious exposure if you were to continue with your injections over time. One time it was explained to me that we are already kind of in a limited lifespan predicament and that this would not really affect us in the long term but with modern medicine I do not really think that is a great outlook. Additionally if anybody ever wanted to start a family without having mutant children it might be a concern to cut down on the radiation. Good luck on your 10th injection! And of course thanks for your feedback. iiiiiiAbsolutely! I am glad it helped.\n\nI would not say all my shots went perfectly smooth. There was one where I was laying on the table for about a half-hour and they were basically forking for a potato in the stew that is my spine. I did not care for that trip.\n\nIt took me a similar amount of time to get Spinraza is well. I found out about it on the exact same day that you did but my insurance would not provide some letter, and because of that Biogen did not know what to do with me so I basically sat in this pharmacological purgatory where I did not fall into the covered buy insurance area, but I also did not fall into the free drug area. My wife ended up emailing everybody she could find at Biogen, including the vice president, head of PR, and basically anybody else she can figure out format for the email of through Linkedin. I literally had the drug the next week because they were so embarrassed of my wife's email asking what was taking so long.\n\nIn terms of your progress with the oral version, I would absolutely be interested in the progress. And I think a lot of others would be as well. I just commented on another response and said it would be interesting if we can get a collection of people going through this to follow up with milestones or noticeable things that happened while taking the drug. That does not have to reference Spinraza whatsoever, but have a collection of people and their information going through the oral version for people that would be interested. I think there is a lot of us. We would have to declare that we are not supporting anybody or and that we are absolutely not representing the drug company with our information, but try to explain that this is what we are noticing going through the stages of taking the drug. I think this would be so much more valuable than just seeing the handouts from companies and where people are on the RM-32 or whatever the hell that arm capability rating system is. So much of that does not apply to us because we do things so differently, so hearing the fine details means a lot more than a graph. And on top of that being able to ask questions would be so much better. Not to mention if you are one of the older people with SMA Type 2, a lot of us could learn from where you are and where you are going. My friend with type 2 is about five or so years older than me, and I have always gone to him for information because everything that happens to him eventually happened to me. It is almost like a mentor situation. So I think it would be valuable, but it is up to you to follow up on that. As well as the mods, if we can get them involved somehow. What do you think? Sorry for the delay in responding to this! I have been a bit under the weather. I think getting a group of us together to discuss changes from the new drug would be quite helpful for everyone. Have you had any luck getting on the drug yet?\n\nUnless someone else does it before me, I will make a post once I actually get approved for the new drug. Something like \"Community experiences with Evrysdi\". We can make an effort to keep each other informed. I know I am curious to find out whether it will be more or less effective than Spinraza.\n\nAs of right now, I am waiting on an appeal since I was rejected by my insurance. I have approximately 3 months till the next dose of Spinraza. I am hoping I can get on the oral treatment before then.\n\nStay healthy friend and I will be in touch! Hey dude, thanks for getting back to me. No worry about the delay it happens to everybody hand is totally understandable. There is no rush. Just the possibility of getting all this information together is awesome.\n\n&gt; Have you had any luck getting on the drug yet?\n\nUnfortunately no. My insurance straight-up denied it right away without going in for any pulmonary tests or the other bass level test. I have an appointment coming this next week to do those so hopefully that will look good in the eyes of my insurance company but honestly even though I have private insurance through my job they just seem to deny everything regardless of how important they could be to my situation. \n\n&gt; Unless someone else does it before me, I will make a post once I actually get approved for the new drug. Something like \"Community experiences with Evrysdi\".\n\nAgain, there is no rush. And it could be good to get your take on how things are going before, not just when you get approved but kind of where you are at before that. Honestly, I am encouraging just about anybody who is either switching or just on one of the medications to do a little write-up just so that people who are new to the sub can get some straightforward information from people going through the actual procedures. And like I said maybe we can get a collection of them together and pin them on the side bar so that they are easily accessible. So if you are willing to go through the motions to write something up its great either way. Just take your time oh, you do not have to do it all at once and it would probably be better if there were takes from different times through your progress.\n\nThanks for following up. I am hoping that we can have more of a impact on social media in the spinal muscular atrophy crowd than Facebook. I think it is kind of a pipe dream but if we can have better information from sources like yourself that have put the effort in to put information forward oh, who knows it might be possible. Thanks for following up! Take care of yourself!", "What does/did everyone do for work? Curious about the best career paths for someone with SMA. It is a ways off for my little guy with SMA type 3, but it usually takes a long time to get good at something so I would like to start (slowly) directing him towards areas of study now that could have practical applications for him when he enters the workforce later. \nThanks!\n I have thought about this a lot in the last few years (in terms of thinking about what I would have done differently if I knew the things I know now).\n\nI know now that there are a few things one needs to take into account. These are all so obvious to me now but they were not obvious in my teens or early adulthood so I made lots of mistakes. Probably obvious to you too as an adult but will list them anyway:\n\n- The need for flexible working hours so that you can deal with medical issues that become more frequent as you get older (and it is not just the medical issues, once you become an adult there is generally a lot of other stuff you have to sort out that might require occasional time off).\n\n- The need to work from home always or sometimes. If not possible to work from home then the work should be somewhere where we can just be left to it (i.e. not something that requires lots of moving around between buildings or across the city during the day, not something that requires travel etc).\n\n- The need for a job where the mind is more important than the body. That sounds like it is really obvious but I was surprised by how many jobs that seem \"mind-oriented\" actually had a lot of hidden physical demands.\n\n- A job that requires only the use of hands, nothing more strenuous than that.\n\n- Preferably a job that pays OK because let us be honest, being disabled is bloody expensive.\n\nNow for career options.\n\nFor the person that likes people and is good at feelings: I have kind of thought for a while that a really good job for someone with SMA is to be a therapist/counsellor of some sort. If you go into private practice you can work from a room in your home (you can make it your office), the pay is good and you will be fine doing it for a very long time because you just need to listen and talk (and take notes I guess, but you can do that in your own time at your own pace). I do not think it is possible to go into private practice straight away (or maybe it is) so there would be a few years of training in which you might not be working out of your home but at a young age that might be manageable. Also, if you are working privately you do not need to worry about discrimination when trying to get hired by a company or whatever - you are in control. You might have a few clients who do not want a disabled therapist but I doubt that is a major issue. Honestly, if I could go back, this is what I would do.\n\nFor the science person: Computer science. It pays well and in the right fields you can likely work remotely, from home - likely able to set your own hours. It will require a lot of education to get to a good level but it is one of those fields for which there is always work. Maths and physics are important aspects so if that is something that your kid hates then it is still possible to try to look for a career that is heavily computer-based but not so reliant on those kinds of subjects. Something like data management could work, for example.\n\nFor the computer person who is more creative: Editing or design. An acquaintance of mine is a video editor at a news corp, he seems to be doing just fine so something like that could work. Probably a bit harder to get a good job from home but maybe not impossible - especially if you do well in your early years.\n\nThose are my thoughts for now anyway! As someone with a computer science degree, a fully remote job straight out of college is not that common. Typically companies want you to have at least 5 years of experience before they trust you to be remote. Entry level jobs are mostly to train you in real work scenarios you cannot get in college. One option is do to web design which allows for a self built portfolio and an easier entry into remote jobs though.  Computer person who is more creative here. I am a Freelance graphic designer, the field is very competitive and tough to get started in because everyone seems to think \"why hire a designer when I can do it myself\". Until you establish a secure foothold it requires a lot of time and effort. Yeah I have heard it is can be quite competitive. Awesome skill though dude, wish I could do graphic design stuff! I think it will depend greatly on what your little guy shows interest in.  I can say, IT has been good for me(SMA Type 3 in his 30s).  Specifically Network Engineering.  My experience, large corporations will have the most liberal work policies and good benefits.  Tbh, I do not know anybody who started working remotely straight out of college. It definitely can be tricky to get there. Did you work in companies or go a different route? Any CompSci friends I have are not disabled so would be interesting to hear your perspective on how you found the experience. All very good advice thank you! The therapist/counselor idea is a good one and not something I would have thought of. And I promise you I made more mistakes in my teens and early adulthood than you did. Probably by a factor of ten lol\n He is interested and computers and coding.  It is just not something I know anything about. But fortunately for him his school has resources and we live in a good sized city where we can find people who can teach him.  I am a 22 year old type 2, started studying Artificial Intelligence this year, and currently work part time at a distributor/webshop doing customer service and social media. The great thing is I can do a big part of it from home and only have to come to the office for meetings, or when it fits into my uni schedule. The most important thing that I have come to appreciate so much about my current job is the fact that my employer is simply understanding and willing. I am able to schedule my work days around my studies, can easily get off for medical appointments and such, and when I am having a particular bad day it is not too uncommon to feel a hand on my shoulder somewhere along the day and get a \"come on, go home, you can finish this next time/at home/\". \nI have a great fascination for all things science but settled on an Artificial Intelligence studies because it is an exponentially growing field, offers great possibilities for working from home and earning well (as TinyLittleStormCloud pointed out, having a disability is expensive as hell), and simply the fact that it is a field in science where there is not much physical aspects to the work and it is very mind oriented.  Late as always but like /u/redhottaco I am a graphic designer . I got a job in this field just about the same time that it became a mainly computer based thing. I was always pretty artistic so I remember thinking this will be my best bet at having a career. On the downside it can have odd working hours and it is a crowded market.\n\nFor us SMAers, computers are the key in most career paths I think... For example, the software used for print design - Photoshop, InDesign etc can be used with a mouse and one finger on a keyboard.\n Film school student at the moment. Hope to edit movies, a realstiic goal is probably working on a news station or tv editing small segments SMA type 3 here. Probably going to law school next year (germany). Government is the best employer you can get, otherwise you should have very good grades to convince a company to hire you. Agreed on the government being a good employer, in the sense that some of the pressures you see with a private sector employer are not there. They are not going out of business or pushing their employees to make the company more profitable. Downside, at least in the US (where we live), is there are very few government jobs where you can work from home. \n\nLawyer is another one, like therapist/counselor, that you can do from home and be self employed.  \n\nThanks to all who responded! I also have type 3. I am 18 and I am studying engineering. Short answer: whatever career he wants to do he can. I have found a way to accomplish every task I have set my sights on completing and so will he so long as he is determined and has the support of his parents. No need to direct him in any set direction, let him discover what he is passionate about when the time comes and simply support him.

My grandfather had polio as a child.  The effects of polio are not too dissimilar from the effects of SMA.

I heard in my country in month or few months evrysdi would be listed , and i am male 31 SMA type 3, I am worried about these informations... not only cause i have a girlfriend, but i have a fear it will change me as a person,and testicular atrophy has negative effect on muscle mass and reduce the size of sexual organ in males.  \n\n\n  \n \"Impairment of fertility Treatment with risdiplam was associated with male germ cell arrest in rats and monkeys without safety margins based on systemic exposures at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). These effects led to degenerated spermatocytes, degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous epithelium, and oligo/aspermia in the epididymis. Sperm cell effects of risdiplam are likely related to an interference of risdiplam with the cell cycle of dividing cells, which is stage specific and expected to be reversible. No effects were seen on female reproductive organs in rats and monkeys after treatment with risdiplam. No fertility and early embryonic development studies were conducted with concomitant administration of risdiplam, as sperm cell arrest and embryotoxic potential under treatment was already identified with treatment of rats and monkeys in other toxicity studies. No impairment on male fertility or female fertility was observed in two studies in which rats were mated, either following completion of a 13-week treatment period starting at weaning, or 8 weeks after completion of a 4-week treatment period starting at 4 days of age \"  \n\n\n \"Fertility Male patients Male fertility may be compromised while on treatment, based on nonclinical findings. In rat and monkey reproductive organs, sperm degeneration and reduced sperm numbers were observed (see section 5.3). Based on observations from animal studies, the effects on sperm cells are expected to be reversible upon discontinuation of risdiplam. Male patients may consider sperm preservation prior to treatment initiation or after a treatment-free period of at least 4 months. Male patients who wish to father a child should stop treatment for a minimum of 4 months. Treatment may be re-started after conception \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\" Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of risdiplam to rats for 4 (0, 1, 3, or 9 mg/kg/day) or 26 (0, 1, 3, or 7.5 mg/kg/day) weeks resulted in histopathological effects in the testis (degenerated spermatocytes, degeneration/atrophy of the seminiferous tubules) and epididymis (degeneration/necrosis of ductular epithelium) at the mid and/or high doses. At the high dose in the 26-week study, the testicular lesions persisted to the end of the recovery period, which corresponds, in rat, to approximately one spermatogenic cycle. The no-effect dose for adverse reproductive system effects in adult male rats (1 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma drug exposures (AUC) similar to that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 5 mg/day. Adverse effects of risdiplam on the testis could not be fully evaluated in the monkey because the majority of monkeys tested were sexually immature. However, oral administration of risdiplam (0, 2, 4, or 6 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks resulted in histopathological changes in the testis (increases in multinucleate cells, germ cell degeneration) at the highest dose. At the no-effect dose for testicular toxicity in monkeys, plasma exposures were approximately 3 times that in humans at the MRHD. Oral administration of risdiplam to postweaning juvenile rats resulted in male reproductive toxicity (degeneration/necrosis of the testis seminiferous epithelium with associated oligo/aspermia in the epididymis and abnormal sperm parameters). The no-effect dose for adverse reproductive effects in postweaning male juvenile rats was associated with plasma exposures approximately 4 times that in humans at the MRHD \\. \"  \n\n\n\" Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of risdiplam (0, 0.75, 1.5, 2.5 mg/kg/day) to young rats from postnatal day (PND) 4 through PND 31 resulted in decreased growth (body weight, tibia length) and delayed sexual maturation in males at the mid and high dose. The skeletal and body weight deficits persisted after cessation of dosing. Ophthalmic changes consisting of vacuoles in the anterior vitreous were seen at the high dose. Decreases in absolute B lymphocyte counts were observed at all doses after cessation of dosing. Decreases in testis and epididymis weights, which correlated with degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium in the testis, occurred at the mid and high doses; the histopathology findings were reversible, but organ weight persisted after cessation of dosing. Impaired female reproductive performance (decreased mating index, fertility index, and conception rate) was observed at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse developmental effects on preweaning rats was not identified. The lowest dose tested (0.75 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) lower than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 5 mg/day \"", "For those in the UK.

Only within the last few years have I really begun to explore relationships. Despite having many friends in high school and college, I never really felt that romance was something I could realistically hope for. \n\nI would like to know about the experience of other people with similar conditions to mine. There is quite a bit of talk online from paraplegics and quads but I feel like their advice is very applicable. Reddit is also a useful filter; though there are a few old forums that discuss these sorts of things, I do not relate to the users very well.\n\nSo, what is your love life like? Have you ever been with anyone who was attracted to disability itself? How did you and your partners meet? What turned out to be more difficult than you thought it would be? Less?\n\nTL;DR crippled? get laid, have partners? elaborate.", "Results Spinraza Sma 2 adult?  Yes Which benefits? Gainz I am about to start. Please tell me what you experienced Gainz like he said.\n\nSeriously tho, I have not had any decrease in muscle strength since I started taking it (I am type 2 with severe muscle degradation and spinal fusion) and actually noticed an increase in upper body strength and arm strength, upper body strength is way up actually, arm strength is a barely noticeable increase, breathing has improved. I do not get tired as easily either. I unfortunately have seen zero improvement after 18 months of taking it, but I keep telling people do not let that stop you, I am in a vast minority of people, 99% of people have noticeable improvements, and if you have survived into adulthood, you have certainly experienced far more harsh medical procedures than a Spinal Tap. Its worth going for.", "Student writing thesis about SMA. What are the care needs of SMA-patients and their environment. Hello, I am Rosanne, a Dutch health science student, and I am currently writing a literature thesis about the needs of SMA patients and their environment with regards to care. I would like to investigate whether the current guidelines are in coherence with the care needs presented by patients.\n\nTechnically I am only allowed to use scientific peer reviewed articles, and reports from the government or patient organisations. Currently I am in the exploratory phase, like writing my introduction/methods etcetera. However, I am interested in hearing first hand experiences from people with SMA, because I think it will help me understand better what having SMA entails. It is also kind of a check to see if what I am going to find in the literature is similar to what you guys are saying. Therefore I have a few questions!\n\n1.What care needs do you have with regards to SMA? And do you have other needs that  are not focussed on care you or the patient receives (such as a need for information or psychological support)?\n\n2. Are all needs you have catered for?\n\n3. What are you currently missing in the care or support you receive?\n\n4. Do the care needs you had change over time? So how did the needs change during pregnancy, after birth, childhood, adulthood etcetera.\n\nI totally understand that having SMA yourself or caring for a person with SMA can be very intense and difficult. Please do not feel obliged to answer all questions, and if you are curious about what I am doing you can always ask questions about that as well. Also, if you want to share experiences or stories, please do!\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nEDIT: lay out. Numbering is wrong, but do not know how to fix this SMA type 2 here, feel free to send a me PM if you have any more questions.\n\n1: 24/7 care. I can use my hands and fingers myself. Everything else i need help to. I can eat myself, brush my teeth, use a computer. I need help to cut out my food, open water bottles, toilet visits. Yeah, i can go into depth with this if you would like, but its going to be a long list.\n\n1: Yes, i live in Denmark and my assistent is payed by the goverment \n\n2: Nothing.\n\n3: When i was a kid i had 6-8 hours of help, in which my mother helped out the other hours. As i have grown older i have gotten more and more help. I am 19 now and had 24/7 care for 4-5 years now Hi Rosanne. My name is Brian and I have SMA type 2. As a fellow graduate student I am more than willing to help you with answering your questions!\n\n1.\tAs far as care needs go with regards to SMA I need full assistance in dressing, toileting, showering, transferring from chair to wherever or visa versa, and other small nuances such as needing help in reaching things that are too far away. Basically, with the limited range of strength afforded to me by my disability, I do need just about 24/7 assistance from others (primarily my mom). Due to the nature of SMA I do have a full team of doctors. The two primary doctors from a physical &amp; rehabilitation clinic, one looking after my general health as someone with a neuromuscular disorder and the other doctor assessing my pulmonary function. All of which are physically based. But I think more could be done for patients with SMA in terms of psychological support or well-being. \n\n2.\tI am not really missing anything else as far as care or support goes.\n\n3.\tDue to the progressive nature of SMA, I have gotten weaker as I got older. I could never walk so I was always dependent on my wheelchair. My primary caretaker has always and is still my mom as I live with my parents. Not a lot of care need have changed because I have a relatively stable type 2 SMA where my breathing and pulmonary functions have been stable so far so nothing invasive like a tracheostomy has been placed. But, I would say that certain additional care needs have been dependent on social/life \u201cmilestone trajectories,\u201d such as when attending school from grade level to university. Throughout elementary to high school, for example, I had an aid or someone to help me use the restroom at school or get things out of my backpack and so on. Also, in the United States all disabled individuals in grade school are also required to have an individualized education program (IEP)..I am sure in the Netherlands, or which other country you are from that speaks Dutch, there is something similar to where accommodations can be made for a student with disability in school. \n\nI could go a lot more in depth so if you need any more specific questions answered just let me know. I could also suggest peer-reviewed articles that would help you understand more about the nature of SMA as a neuromuscular disorder (which is as you probably know the # 1 genetic cause for infant mortality and #2 most common childhood neuromuscular disorder next to duchennes muscular dystrophy). \n You might want to check out the Cure SMA wensite and reach out to them for info. They might be able  to put you in touch with people who can help you. \n\nThere is also SMA News Today. They have some interesting articles, some of which are written by people with SMA, who would probably be willing to answer your questions.\n\nHere is an example: \n\n\n\nGood luck! Hey, IDK if you still need infos about sma care, Ill reply as the fiance of a guy with sma type II\n\nAre all needs you have catered for? yep, there\u00b4s a selfwaver and also medicaid that pays for all things - helpers and equipment\n\nWhat are you currently missing in the care or support you receive? not really, I wished they could give a new wheelchair that reclines more but we\u00b4ll have to wait 3 years or so, and they are really expensive, like IDK. 20k????\n\nDo the care needs you had change over time? So how did the needs change during pregnancy, after birth, childhood, adulthood etcetera. after a pleural effusion he\u00b4s now supposed to use the bi-pap at night so there\u00b4s someone coming at night too, before he only had 2 hours per day with a helper. He lives alone and independently most of the time, only need help dressing, showering and with the bi-pap. \n\nBut when we will live together we will dismiss all people, they are often unreliable and careless....like yesterday the guy complained about the laundry, why he had to do it and not another helper and in the end he did not do....you know, people are probably low paid, so they have low motivation to do a good job. As the wife (35+years) of a guy with SMA Type 2, I suggest you and your fiance not entirely dismiss all paid helpers. Yes, some of them are useless and you will probably do a better job than even the best of them. But it is a lot of not-the-best-kind of intimacy and can wear down your relationship. And what about when something happens to you? It is good to have a few names to call of people who already know the routine, even if they are not the best. Right now I am the sole attendant because our guy quit with no notice, but my husband is sorting through Craigslist responders now, trying to find a new guy so I can go back to the part-time job that keeps me sane, even though it barely pays enough to cover the cost of the attendant hours.  I dont know if you have this in your state but my fiance can self hire and it is covered... we were thinking of hiring someone in the future if everything is too much...but I can already foresee I will have trouble even if they did a good job because I like things a certain way lol  We do not qualify for assistance because we have some assets. He used to get survivor benefits because his mom died while he was a minor. But when we got married that ended. (We did not know this, and even though we were open about our marriage and filed joint tax returns, the checks kept coming. A friend told us five years in. It took another two years to straighten out the paperwork, leaving us in debt to Social Security for $65,000. Fortunately we are paying it back at the rate of $50/ month. So it will take forever but will not break us. \n\nAnyway, my job pays the same rate we pay our attendant. So it is a wash financially, but I need to get out of the house and spend some time doing, and being paid for, something completely different. Then my husband and I can get together and have new things to talk about. Even when I complain about my customers and he complains about his clients (he works from home thanks to Naturally Speaking and a sip-and-puff mouse stick) and we both complain about the attendant!  Hey everyone, sorry for not responding but I read your responses and it provided me with a nice insight in what it can be like to have SMA. I am finishing off my project at the moment, and my conclusion is that there is too little attention for psychosocial needs (support from health care professionals, support from the environment, sufficient information to make informed decisions etc.). My recommendation is to study these needs specifically, because they barely arise in the current guidelines and more awareness for these needs should be created. My supervisors are currently performing interviews with patients to get an impression as to what they need to increase quality of life and wellbeing. Hopefully things will improve as care can always be better! \n\nThanks for your messages, and I think I will stick around this sub for a bit!
