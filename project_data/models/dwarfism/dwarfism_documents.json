["Source for custom knee braces needed Hello all.  I hope someone here might be able to help me.\n\nI was born without a thyroid and i did not grow to be very tall.  I am about 4'11.  Nonetheless, I joined the army and fought in Afghanistan and was wounded.\n\nPartially due to the injury, and partially to just getting old, I have a partial acl tear in my leg.  Its very painful at times and has slowed me down quite a bit.  What the doctors want to do is to give me a leg brace, but they do not have any for someone who has thick but short legs.  \n\n\nDoes anyone know of a manufacturer of custom leg braces?  There are many places who claim to do custom work, but in fact they only make adjustable braces.    \n\n\nThanks! You might try looking custom up companies that make leg braces for spinal cord injuries. I know you are not paralyzed, but to make them, they take a cast of your legs so that the braces totally fit to you. \n\nI am not sure where you are located, but try starting there by looking up \u201ccustom leg braces for spinal cord injury\u201d . If they are not able to help, which I think they will, then they will probably know where to look. ps, I had some made because I do have an SCI so I am slightly familiar with the process, though it was a long time ago. If you were in the army and got hurt in combat you need to be going and talking to someone at the VA! This is a great lead!  Thank you very much for taking the time to answer my question! No problem, I hope it helps! Good luck! No offense, but how the hell did they let you into the army? Are not they pretty strict about medical conditions and whatnot? They just wrote 5'0\" down instead of 4'11\" Good ol US military, haha", "This is why I hate posting pictures of myself.. I did not even add any tags and it was a brand new account.. Do people just hate us..?  Apparently it is a thing on Imgur.. I feel stupid \u201cit is a thing on Imgur\u201d sounds like a bullshit way of dressing up being a fuckin asshole. Do not feel stupid, feel mad that society deems it acceptable to view and treat us like a joke. I know. I probably should not have posted it there in the first place. Though for once I felt confident enough to post a photo of myself to share on here later.. I am pretty mad though.. well embarrassed too.. I feel ya, man. Myself, I am just so uncomfortable and insecure of my body that I would not consider posting to some place that is not just viewed by friends and fam\u2014 that took balls on your part, dude. \n\nThere is a bunch of losers and idiots in this world, friend; fuck them all. You cannot win over every person, but you do not have to either. Keep being the king of your world, brother. I am sorry you have to go through this. My oldest son has an extremely rare form of dwarfism. I dread the day he has to be around idiots, there are so many of them in the world. Please hold your head up high. We are rooting for you! Thank you, it did. I normally use social media for family and friends too. I guess I joined Reddit because I am somewhat anonymous. So I guess I thought it would be easy posting a photo but damn it, words can hurt \ud83d\ude05..\nYeah, I will keep that in mind thank you.\nYou too! It is ok, I feel like I should be used to it but I never really am.\nHopefully he grows up in a more understanding time do he does not have to deal with idiots too. It really messes with your mental health.\nThank you!\nI wish the best for your son Thank you. No problem! If you need any help or advice you can ask me anytime. I am not an expert but I have the experience \ud83d\ude05 I \u2018ll message you if that is okay! Sure! You are going to find a lot of this on the internet. Its easy to make fun of someone when they can hide behind a computer screen not knowing who they are or there name. They are just plan cowards. Yeah.. People just hate themselves. If I could magically grant empathy and intelligence to everyone, I would do it in a second. I am sorry people are assholes. Only ignorant people, I am sure you are awesome Honestly that would make the world so much better. \nThank you \ud83d\ude05 I think actors like Peter Dinklage or the reality show that is like real housewives but for little people (I forget the name) are SO important. General entertainment with little people. Not exploiting their appearance for laughs or just to play the stereotypical role. I think that is a powerful way to get people to grow the hell up and realize little people are PEOPLE.\n\nI think people are too stupid to understand empathy or tolerance so you have to shove it down their throats with entertainment. Like the \u2018will and grace effect\u2019 with gay culture into main stream culture. People are so dumb until you put the thing that is good for them into their favorite things, like peas hidden in the mashed potatoes lol. Yeah Peter Dinklage is my idol \ud83d\ude05. Yeah we need more shows with great representation because I am tired of having dwarf characters treated like jokes. 100%. I am so passionate about this (not only because I care about people in general), but my niece just turned 12 and is such an awesome kid who has gone through so much in life (health wise) in addition to achondroplasia. It will always SO quick to put anyone in their place when they laugh at someone for how they look or are just because they look different than themselves. \n\nSending you lots and lots of positive vibes and letting you know I am doing my part to spread awareness too! If you ever need someone to vent to or just chat. Feel free! I am also about to be an attorney in one year so maybe I can help you get back at dumb jerks in the future! Lol She sounds like a strong person. I wish her the best! \nThank you for being passionate about this, we do not really have any allies \ud83d\ude05. It helps knowing there is people out there who actually see us as people.Spreading awareness is really helpful too, since a lot of people are afraid of asking us and they remain uneducated.\nThank you again! I wish you luck in your career! Hassling anybody for how they look or their stature is wrong unless they go there first and are therefore asking for it. Agree I randomly stumbled upon this. Was going to say the same thing.  If the image was a selfie, imgur will roast you regardless (unless of course it is posted on Christmas). I think June 29th may do as well but not 100% on that. Yeah I wish I knew sooner Lmao Hey bro im a  non dwarf lurking through this subreddit and wanted to know the perspective of dwarves. It is disgusting how they are treated and they deserve to be respected. Those guys lack sympathy and are ignorant to say such a thing. The golden rule may be cringe \u201ctreat others the way you want to be treated\u201d, but it is fucking true. If I ever become rich one day I will want to donate to some research. Well I am not the most optimistic person out there. I know a lot people who are happy the way they are and I try my best to do the same but I cannot help but imagine how much better life would be without my condition. Not being able to reach stuff, joint problems and just not being able to fit in easily makes life a bit harder than I feel it should and then you have people that make fun of you for it I have also been picked up by strangers and people take photos or record me when I am in public places. That said I do not completely hate myself and I try my best to do my best with my dwarfism. There is been moments when I even loved myself or just loved the fact that I am \u201crare\u201d. I still wish I was a normal person but I cannot change that. Some people are mentally stuck in middle school. I am sorry that you have to deal with assholes like that person. Yeah.. I do not think I will ever be truly used to it.

Why kind of? Well, you see, When I hide from people, i am small, so I can hide in like a trash can (There were no germs because it was new). I had bullying experiences. I am 3.5. And one kid got really under my skin. It happened in the 5th grade in Junior High. A boy named Damien. (He was Caucasian,) And I was getting my books from my locker, preparing for a Calculus Class. Then Damien went up straight up to me and said \u201cHey kid, why you so short, Midget!\u201d He started parroting the word Midget. Then he Chuckled. I felt really bad, and there was when my depression started. I had lots of friends and classmates, who did not really care about my size. Then, one day in 6th grade, (Second Year Of Junior High) Damien and his friend\u2019s walked up to me and they said straight to my face \u201cHey midget!\u201d I decided enough was enough. So I yelled at them like no tommorow and said \u201cHey, what if you were as small as me? Huh? Yeah, I do not care what you say. I am handsome the way I am.\u201d\n\nI am 19 now, and I say that I became in college, in Quotation Mark\u2019s \u201cA Popular Kid.\u201d Not going to outright delete this yet, but proceed with caution people.\n\n\n\nClaims he is 13 here, and if you check the post history he has a habit of making things up.", "Baby is being checked for dwarfism I hope this is Ok to post. I am pregnant and today at my ultrasound they noticed my babies limbs are short. I am 33 weeks.\n\nShe has no other signs that would point to dwarfism but they are not saying she does not. \n\nI have to wait to tomorrow to get a doctor at the hospital check it out. \n\nI have preeclampsia so that could be it too but we do not know for certain.\n\nOf course I will love my child if she does have dwarfism and I know she can live her best life regardless. but I guess I just want answers.\n\nCan anyone tell me what signs were in your ultrasounds ? \n\nThank you", "How do you feel about APs that are attracted to LPs specifically? (Not in a fetish way) ", "Character consultant? Writing LP characters in a world before modern tech. In one area of my fictional world, about 10% of people have some form of dwarfism. One of the main characters has a grandmother with achondroplasia.  From what I understand, she would likely have mobility issues in her old age, having lived a very active life. She has two husbands. I am I am wondering if it would be inappropriate for one of them to carry her, or carry a platform that she rests on. She is pretty powerful and wealthy so it would make sense for her to be carted around. But for lesser characters with dwarfism, is carrying them around insulting? Does the presence of a platform or cart help? I want to do right by the community. I am having issues imagining any kind of autonomous type wheelchair that is not very very modern. The tech there is definitely pre electricity and in that region they use mostly wooden structures. If this is not a good place for this question I would love some help! I have been working on this for a v long time Hi.  Mobility issues can come to us very young indeed, or remain nonexistent for decades on end.  We are much like anybody else, we just do not hit our heads on things quite as much.  \n\n\nCarrying someone around because of power/money/importance will be a perquisite of that importance. It will be done by someone below that person in rank.\n\nI do not think you would have ever found Prince Philip carrying Queen Elizabeth around on a platform or cart.  He had to walk behind her, and that was about all he could stand!  (Queen Victoria WAS one of us, and as she aged and put on weight, she DID end up letting herself be carried about in various ways.)   Her husband would not have humored her, but after she was widowed, she had other servants who did, John Brown her Scots friend, whom the family despised, and a man from India whose name I am drawing a blank on at the moment.  Both of those men took the place of her late husband Prince Albert, if not in the royal bed, then everywhere else.    \n\n\nIf a woman is the powerful leader and she has two consorts, she will have to be careful not to set them against each other!    \n\n\nThere are wooden wheelchairs even these days.  There are amazing devices that hardly look like wheelchairs at all--they will go up and down stairs, help transfer to bed and bath, let the disabled person walk upright, and so on.  But you are writing a fantasy.  Maybe the gravity and wind are very low and your grandmother's husbands could carry her using one finger each, on a luxurious but ever so light vehicle, between them.    Maybe someone invents a harness and wings that could let a little person fly--in dense atmosphere and very very low gravity.    \n\n\nIf the gravity is low enough, the air dense enough, and the planet generous enough to make airships and other steampunk concepts work well in your world, that would be fun to read.  I LOVE airships.  Like in the movie StarDust, have you seen it?  A star falls, and a boy in love vows to bring it back and give it to his own true love so she will marry him.  A WONDERFUL movie.  Evil princes, scary pirate captains, witches who want to live forever, a darling young man, his mother and father, and this girl who is a star.    \n\n\nThere is an airship in that movie and it makes me very happy.  \n\n\nPerhaps you would enjoy creating little persons whose size is not due to disorders at all.  Even before my spine went all to hell, I was not a tall person.  4'11\" at best.   I never envied the tall.  I have a lot of pain in my life, and disability, but very tall people are so afflicted too, I think.  And I have known other little people who are the types to just push through adversity of all types.  I am not that tough, but they are out there.  \n\n\nWhat if being little is a choice you make as you are growing up?  Boys who yearn to be warriors might usually choose to be big and strong, but what if they learn that there are always problems that are easier to solve from the down low?   Girls might choose to be dainty or they might want to be taller than the men they are related to. If you can organize your society around all the different motives people can have for wanting what they want, you will be well on your way to believable characters.  \n\n\nWhat if the choice is made by someone else?  Mother names the child.  Father chooses its final size.  I do not know!  But reach out and make many strongly visual images of your world and your story, so that in your head, you know what things look like.

My son has just been diagnosed with Russel Silver syndrome/dwarfism, age 7, and for the longest time we have been trying to find out what is causing his various health problems and lack of growth until a decent endo team run some more focused DNA tests and this is the diagnosis he was given. \n\nI have never heard of RSS and was told it is really rare.\n\nI am happy to finally have some answers but I do have questions because I worry about the amount of bullying he is going through due to his size. And I guess I am here for your guidance on a few things, and would appreciate any words of advice and any experiences you would be happy to share:\n\n1. How do I support him as a parent and build his confidence so that he can grow up without feeling bad about himself? He already does, and I am doing my best, but reassurance coming from a mum just does not seem to hit a spot, as his school peers refuse to play with him cos 'he is a baby' and because he cannot participate in sports with same ability as his classmates so they get mad with him and push him out of any group activity\n\n2. Have you got any words of advice on what worked or did not work for you when explaining dwarfism to your peers in school, so that I can introduce some ideas to him? \n\n3. How do we best deal with bullies? He used to tell me things and I was raising this with school all the time but now he stopped telling anyone. Though the physical part has stopped, mental is still present and he just keeps it to himself until he cannot anymore and he breaks down to me. It hurts so much to watch him struggle.\n\n4. He has osteoporosis and clinodactyly. What sports would you recommend that I can sign him up for? I am scared of more fractures to be fair. He is usually does cycling and doing swimming lessons (when COVID allows), but football and any ball sport seem to be unmanageable for him due to his motor abilities and this then feeds into his lack of self confidence\n\n5. Does anyone know of any kids and family support/play groups he can join in London, UK so that he can meet with other children with same/similar condition? \n\nI am so sorry if it is a silly post, but I feel stuck and just trying to gather as much info and advice to make sure my boy grows up happy with himself and knowing that he is perfect just the way he is. I am trying to arrange getting him into children's counseling, but those services are so stripped of funding that we are looking at very long waiting times. I feel I need to be addressing as much of this as possible myself in the meantime \n\nThank you all in advance Hi! Unfortunately I cannot help much with the bullying dilemma. But if you notice he seems to be holding it in I would definitely recommend a therapist :) I do not know much about schools in the UK because I am from the US but if there is a counselor at the school that you and him can talk to, it might help in raising the faculties awareness is what is happening. It also gives him somewhere safe to turn to during school. \n\nFor sports maybe he would be interested in after school dance programs or golf? Those were ones I enjoyed at his age.\n\nAnd for programs in the UK, Little People UK is run by dwarf actor Warwick Davis and his family, who are close friends of my family and I! The website is \n\nFeel free to message me if you have anymore questions or if he wants to talk to someone similar to him. I am 22 year old female and have hypoachondroplasia. I hope this helps! I lived in the UK for 7.years. It is got a real bullying culture about it. My No.1 recommendation would be to move to another country. Most other European countries would be better. I too grew up in London, UK \n\nWith bullying- i dont have big memories about it at school except my mum was joking about people calling me a midget, but shes a whole different story \ud83d\ude02 ive forgotten most of my primary experience. If its really bad at his current school, it may be worth looking into moving him to a different school where the students are taught about differences &amp; his condition before he starts. Children are curious &amp; if theyre able to start a step ahead, this will help. You want to be careful with things like these because they can be patronising.\n\nIn terms of associations, there is RGA &amp; DAA in the UK.\n\nFeel free to PM me too! Thank you so much for all of the above! I might take you up on that offer :) That link is fantastic, thank you very much. I have thought quite a bit about issues he might face with employment and relationships and it left me feeling upset and worried, I will do my best to prepare him and make him as resilient/confident in himself as I can. I am so sorry for all the pain you have had to go through, and I wish you all the happiness for the future. There are so many nasty people in this world and I will never be able to understand why some choose to be cruel. Thanks! What does DAA stand for?

Thank you. I am not on Facebook/Instagram sadly. I was thinking of making an account but not adding people. Not sure I would get accepted to closed groups though with zero friends on my list though. There is another group Little People charity pointed me to. I guess I will have to reconsider I feel you 100% there. I was off of Facebook for ~2.5 years and had zero intention of going back, but the only online groups I could find ended up being links to the different Facebook groups that I am now apart of. \n\nI think nearly all of the groups I have joined basically just ask \"Are you or someone you know affected by disorder X\" and will let you in pretty quickly. \n\nI hate Facebook (outside of the support groups) and miss the golden age of internet forums, but these groups are the only reason that I have a diagnosis at all and I have found the collective knowledge-pool to be astronomically more informative than anything I have learned in a doctor's office. Worry about the adult stuff later.\n\nTry and get him a fun childhood with friends. I had that. I was happy and popular and it helped me deal with the shit I would get from strangers in the street. I worry that he is getting no support at school from peers because he is certainly not going to get it outside of school.\n\nAlso, if you can afford it, send him to the LPA kids camps they organise in the USA. This will be life changing for him.\n\nMan the UK had problems. I am sorry you have to live there. Some schools have a buddying programme, I.e. they will 'partner' a bullying victim with a senior school pupil who will hang around with them and befriend them at intervals.

It sounded better to LPs in the 70s than the extremely offensive term midget did, though, and they changed the organization name to Little People of America.  LP is a commonly used term, too.

I imagine his best bet for becoming part of the community is to participate in it.\n\nFinding friends as adults is actually really hard. Most people who move somewhere new just avoid the situation and partner up. If that is not an option for him in Minnesota then he will just have to keep trying via the club / interest route.

He is into his 40's and knows a lot of people, but he is tired of being a novelty when meeting new folks, and when trying to date. Thank you :) I think you will find that there is not really a \"community\" of LPs. In my experience, all of us being short does not amount to having much in common that brings about a sense of \"yes, finally I belong\". \n\nHe might be dissappointed to discover that learning to live in society that insists you are different, is about as good as it gets. \n\nIf your town and your social scene is really that unaccepting of his disability I think he needs to move to a more open minded place. It is extreme but I have moved a lot and more open minded areas are just way easier places to live. \n\nIf the lack of belonging is somehow being exxaserbated by his actions/beliefs or trauma than a decent shrink should help him develop positive social strategies.\n\nStill, he really just needs a girlfriend. Most people's problems around lonliness go away with a decent partner. It is hard for people who are always coupled up to understand this... Even though they clearly avoid being single themselves.\n\nYour story kind of reminds me of \"the station agent\". Maybe you will get some ideas from that movie... Or you will just be super depressed. I do not remember how it ended but it had Peter Dinklage in it having the same issues as your friend. I do not know what 'block on my dude means', unless you are trying to find your friend a girlfriend on reddit.... \n\nDo you even know if your friend is prepared to date other LPs? In my experience, the stigma Normates have dating LPs also exists amongst LPs (cause, you know, we also pick up on cultural cues). \n\nA google search will tell you if you have LPA groups in your area. In my experience they tend to be for people with kids, so as a single guy it will not be easy, even if he finds a LPA group to meet up with occasionally.", "Wolf of Wall Street: the trailer promotes dwarf tossing, as a party trick.

I suspect if you have noticeable physical differences (being a little on the short side is not what I am talking about), that you have some common experiences with LPs.  From what I have observed, the thing that draws people's attention to LPs is that there is something \"different\", but not easily categorizable.    From my experience, most LPs become very good at putting other people at ease if they want to have social success.  One thing to remember is that our common experiences as people will quickly become more important in our relationships than the differences people initially notice, but there may be a little extra work at the start of relationships.  Just for future reference, at 5'6\", you are not an LP at all.  That does not mean you cannot have conversations about what it means to be shorter than average, though.

On the one hand, it seems like the logical conclusion is the potential end to dwarfism (as we know it, I guess). I am insulted by the notion of this. Because our shared (but incredibly varied) condition is something passed on not only from dwarf to dwarf, but quite commonly (in cases of dwarfism) parents without dwarfism will have a child that has it, which is my situation. \n\nI know there is a lot of people who would jump at the chance to be guaranteed not to pass on the gene due to the difficulties it has presented their lives. \nm\nBullying, Missed opportunities/prejudice at job interviews, and just being unable to function with the same amount of ease in a world not designed for you (which in some cases is physically dangerous). \n\nMy feelings are that I do not wish to see our condition \u201ccured\u201d since I do not feel that there is anything to cure. There is nothing wrong with being a dwarf, having dwarfism, no matter how you classify it. I also realize that having the most common type(achondroplasia) is the most visible in the media and also being on the taller end of dwarfism so (before I hurt my back and becoming wheelchair bound) I get along easier than someone with a type that is generally going to be significantly shorter, and/or have much shorter limbs which would make their experience quite a bit different and potentially a lot more difficult. \n\nI am erring on the side of being against this in principle. I am very curious to know what someone with a different type of dwarfism feels about this. I think this drug sounds awesome and I would 100% give it to my offspring if I found out they were affected by achondroplasia.

Speak to them about keeping an eye on the behavior of classmates and other kids in the school. \n\nIf any bullying happens it needs to be squashed hard and fast especially when kids are young. \n\nI was lucky enough at my school to be surrounded by a great group of friends that had my back and were my allies in school. They had my back at any bullying that happened to me and after awhile kids just accept it. People are different. \n\nAlso, if you are not already, get your child signed up with LPA \n\nIts a network of Little People that host events, have support resources and can share experiences. My father and I often go to schools and speak to young children about us. Bullying of little people comes for a perceived fear of difference. When children, especially young children, learn that we are no different from the adults in their life then the bullying stops. \nNo doubt that does not stop all bullying that is based on social order (nerds, jocks, etc) but your never going to kill that. Thanks for reaching out. I really appreciate it... we signed up for LPA and hit up events and talk.  Really appreciate the perspective though and you chasing me down. The biggest thing to remember is that you cannot live your childs life for them.  Do not try to live your life THROUGH them either.  So many parents project onto their child, just as this mom's need for attention is evident.  An LP is just that, a \"little\" person.  But we are still people.  And there is no shame in therapy, or starting before it is a problem.  Now that I am in therapy, I wish I would have been in it at a younger age. Makes total sense.

I have worked with our diversity group at work for quite a while and we are working towards intersectionality in our groups. A veteran who is disabled and a woman, or a bisexual black christian, etc. The idea is many people do not fall into just one category of diversity. Sometimes those groups may not seem complimentary. I was wondering what are folks experiences here with intersection in diversity. Dwarfism trump's any other identity metric. You are a dwarf before you are anything else. It is the most noticeable, memorable thing about you. Is the most stigmatised thing about you. Presents real physical barriers as well as social ones. \n\nIn the UK I had a friend who was a wheelchair user and who was also Nigerian black. I asked her what had the biggest impact in her quality of life. Ablism or racism. She said Ableism by fair. I am paraplegic (T12 incomplete) and I have achondroplasia. As far as not being complimentary, I guess I never really thought of it that way. Its not that unusual for someone with dwarfism who may be short to the point of needing adaptive equipment to find their way in a safe, easier, and faster manner.\nWith that said, there arent too many, And none I know personally, of us using a chair for the reason I do.

Excerpt of manuscript included. thanks in advance So hi guys, thanks for taking the time to read through this. I would really appreciate some thoughts or feedback, because I would like to write a cool story, with some realistic features. So if you could help me, that would be absolutely GRAND!\n\nI am trying to write a romance novel (not really my strong suit, but I would like to try it) and I am a little annoyed with the common novel tropes of \"tall, dark, handsome, overbearing, rich, strikingly beautiful, CEO, ...\" you get the thing.\n\nI want to write a story, which is awesome to read and clashes a little with these stereotypes. So I decided for a short guy and after quite some thought and research, I decided to make him not just a little small, but give him dwarfism. On top of that, I decided to make him an archer and a trapper, to clash with the \"rich and ceo\" stereotype.\n\nNow, if this is not too much to ask, I would love a bit of help in writing this character, to be believable and likable without falling into any great, big cliches or offensive things. The name he currently has (not sure if I will keep it) is Fergus. So far, I have written it in a way, that Fergus likes to be top eyes on everything, which suits his love for being an archer and hunter. Which is why the main Character (currently called Anra) has not yet seen, but only heard him and - because of his awesome voice, (which I borrowed from Peter Dinklage in my head), together with the fact, that so far he has always been high up somewhere, Anra has created some sort of fantasy image of him, following the \"tall dark and handsome\" sterotype. \n\nSo my first draft (I am still writing), looks like this:\n\n&gt;When Anra turned round toward Fergus, she rocked back from the impact of her fantasy of him clashing with reality. His voice, which was all she had known of him so far, sounded growly and dark. Automatically, her mind had conjured up someone tall, dark and handsome. Someone with rippling muscles to be able to shoot like he did, someone with an intense stare, due to his apparent ability to see in the night. However, she was only partially right. He was dark, no doubt about it. His black hair and thick eyebrows seemed to suggest some kind of dark plot or deeper intensity. His voice fit that impression too. And there was no doubt about it, that he had a handsome face with chiseled features, even though his forehead was a little taller than strictly necessary. But he was not tall. Not exactly, anyway. His head and torso looked like those of any person she knew. But his limbs were short, thick and muscular. The word \u201cdwarf\u201d came to mind. And if she had seen him with a pickax in his hand and a raging beard, she would not have been quite as surprised as she was right now.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fergus glowered at her, watching her reaction with exactly those kind of intense eyes, that she had thought he probably had. She was not quite sure what eye color he had, but there was a small glint of silver in them. Like that of a predator in the night.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;Several moments must have passed between them, without anyone saying a word. Without Anra even breathing, as far as she knew. It was Fergus, who broke the silence, his voice even darker than usual. It was lush with scorn and she could not blame him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI guess, I am not what you have imagined. I get that often, so let us just get this over with, because I am only going to say this once: Yes, I am small, no, I am not a dwarf. I am a human, who is small. No, I am not a gnome or a tiny elf. Yes, I eat, drink and shit like a normal person, just in smaller portions. No, I have no control over the weather and I have no idea, where the pot of gold is at the end of the rainbow. And even if I had it, I would not tell you. I bleed the same, I have the same heart, I am big where it counts. Any more questions?\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He rattled the entire list of things off at lightning speed. As if he had rehearsed and refined it until it was as compact as possible. Which was probably exactly what he had done. Anra imagined, that he had to say this to probably everyone he met, since for one, his being different was glaringly obvious to anyone and radically divergent from what people usually perceived as normal. Sores and wounds and pimples and moles they saw every day. A normal sized person with short limbs and a large forehead however, not exactly. After all, he looked like someone had simply snatched the limbs of a child and stuck them to his body after snatching off the proper sized ones.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;It probably put him at a disadvantage and in need to constantly prove himself and a thousand other things, that she could not even begin to imagine. After what he had done for her, she was especially unwilling to piss him off. Since for one, he had saved her life and two, because he was such an impressive shot with that bow. Which caused a sudden idea. \u201cYeah, I think, I have one. Or two.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fergus crossed his arms in front of his chest, his face dark as a bottomless abyss. \u201cShoot\u201d, he growled.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cHow do you manage to climb so fast and how can you shoot that far?\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fergus seemed taken aback, stared for a moment, then cracked a crooked smile. \u201cI made myself some claws. I use them to grab hold of the bark like a cat. And the bow\u2026 well it was crafted to my specifications.\u201d He fiddled with his bag and produced the most intricate bow she had ever seen. It was an arrangement of wheels and pulleys, with the sinew looping backward and forward, crossing in and around itself. When he drew the sinew back, the muscles on his arms bulged and the wheels moved backwards and forwards, apparently supporting or rearranging the pulling force of the sinew. When he let go, the sinew thwapped back with the sound of an ax hitting a block of wood.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIt allows for far greater range and more power. My brother came up with the idea of wheels in the first place. He is a Fletcher and fiddles around with wheels, cogs and pulleys. He gave me the first version of a blow like this when I told him, I want to be an archer.\u201d As he talked, all the darkness had vanished and his facial expression was radiating joy. As if the sun was peeking out from behind the dark clouds.\n\nHow is this, as a first draft? \n\nIs it all right? I do not want them to instantly be head over heels in love, and I like him to be a little grumpy in the beginning, maybe a little sarcastic too. I would these two to gradually become friends and eventually fall for each other, because I dislike the \"prince charming, we have just met, lets marry\" thing. So I thought, a little bit of shock would be fitting, because his appearance is not how she expected him to be, plus, he does not look like the majority of people she has met so far. \n\nOk, Imma stop now, because else I keep writing. Sorry, I am a little fussy and insecure about my writing in general so.. yeah. Any feedback? Would be greatly appreciated.

Looking to talk to experienced parents as I am totally clueless! Hello everyone.\nI hope you do not mind me posting here, looking for parents of children with dwarfism who might feel willing to talk with me, a clueless new mother of a little girl who is still undiagnosed, but most likely has achondroplasia or another form of dwarfism.\n\nLittle bit about my girl -\nShe was found to have short long bones since wk 26 or so during my pregnancy. She was finally born a couple weeks early by a c-section due to her breech position and relatively large head. She had no complications at birth, spent one day in NICU just in case, and was released home with me as usual. The doctors told us simply that they suspect some type of \u201cbone related condition\u201d but we will see a specialist only when she is 3 months old. Since then we have led a normal life with a newborn, watching her grow by the curve (while well below others in height, she is been gaining weight and height along the curve and has been healthy).\n\nSo, we really have no information from the doctors and are waiting to see the specialist in some weeks, our girl is now 7 weeks old.\nLooking at her characteristics I think she has achondroplasia. But I will be honest, I have avoided googling a lot because the wave of medical articles and lists of co-morbidities made me worry for my little girl. With post partum anxiety, it was too much for me during these early weeks.\n\nHowever, knowing nothing also makes me worry. I am afraid I might damage my girl taking care of her as if she is a newborn without any condition. For example, we had been using a baby carrier as she loves sleeping in it. The other day I read baby carriers should never be used with babies with achondroplasia, which we did not know - we have zero instruction from our doctor at this point!\n\nHearing practical tips from other parents of achon babies would help me so much.

We were able to find an SED specific group thanks to the LPA one, and I believe there are subgroups for different age ranges (like 2021 babies, etc.) As a person with Achondroplasia, as well as being the parent of several children with Achondroplasia, welcome. I think all of the other comments are great. From your post history it looks like your currently living in Japan. I do not know any LP's from Japan but I can imagine there are a few. Actually looking through my facebook friends, I found a young adult woman that I believe is from Japan. I will PM you her name and perhaps she can hook you up with resources there. As others have said, definitely join the Parent LP pages on facebook and remember to just breath. My kiddo's long bones started measuring behind at the anatomy scan. Dude is 4 now, tiny, but a spitfire.  Pm me if you need. \nI strongly encourage you to do some research into what your kiddo has. Dwarfism *can* cause significant, life threatening health complications depending on which type your kiddo has.  There have been many losses in my group on Facebook, I am not saying this to encite fear by any means, I just would hate to see the unthinkable happen again.\n\nKiddos with achon need MRIs to check for spinal cord compression, and they need sleep studies to ensure they are not having apnea episodes. They should not be on soft backed baby seats like bouncers.  If head circumference percentiles jump abruptly they need to be watched for hydrocephalus.\n\nOther types of dwarfism bring other health related issues that have to be monitored. These kids are incredible and amazing and prefect.  Please pm me if you have any questions or if you want links to parent groups for Facebook, they are truly pivotal in finding a space in the community with a sense of belonging.

Thanks. I am a teen with dwarfism but from the US.", "Could anyone help me with an issue surrounding the use of the m-word in a discord server I mod? (will include the word but censored) I am a mod of a decently sized discord server (a little over 2000 people, although most people are inactive), and recently its come to my attention that people have been using the word \"m\\*dg\\*t\" in the server. I am not a little person, but I know that that word is considered to be a slur against people with dwarfism by many, and I brought it to the other mods attention that I do not think we should allow it to be said in the server (we have a bot that automatically removes messages with words we tell it to look for).\n\nWe are a fairly small mod team, we are trying to get more people on the team but currently, we only have 5 people on it, 2 admins, 3 mods. I and another mod think we should add the word to the bot word filer, the admins do not think it is necessary, and the 3rd mod is unsure. \n\nThe admins argue that we do not have anyone with dwarfism (that we know of at least) in our server right now and that if someone with dwarfism were to come into our server and be offended by someone using the m-word, then we would add it to the bot filter. They also argue they do not think anyone is trying to insult people with dwarfism when using that word, and that it is a more normalized word which can be often used to describe things other than humans.\n\nI argue that even if someone who is not personally affected by a slur is not present, it does not make it ok to say the slur. I gave examples of the f slur and the n-word, that even if you arent around the groups of people those words have affected, it is still not ok to say them. I also argued that If someone with dwarfism were to come into our server, I would not want them to see people using the m-word and feel upset or not welcome because we as mods did not deal with an issue until someone felt personally attacked.\n\nThe reason I am coming here is because I do not want to be doing the wrong thing. I do not want to be speaking for little people and be incorrectly trying to advocate for them. I as a person have an issue of always worrying that what I am doing is wrong, especially when I am trying to advocate for a community that I am not a part of (although I worry about this even when I am speaking for a community I am a part of too). I would really appreciate some opinions from this community to make sure I am not speaking over you.\n\nThank you to anyone who is willing to give me some insight on this issue, I will greatly appreciate any advice given! If you have got a bot that is already deleting words, I figure it is not a bad idea to throw midget in there.\n\nDo not expect it to actually happen, though--a lot of people think it is a ridiculous notion to equate the word \"midget\" to \"nigger\", or any other \"serious\" slur. It doesnt matter that you do not have anyone with dwarfism using the server that you know of. Basically, exactly what your counter argument was is how I, and the vast majority of people with dwarfism feel. \nEven if they think its a ridiculous thing to censor or consider on the level of the \u201cn\u201d word, that is NOT their call. \n\nI mod this sub and you can refer them to me (preferably not the entire sub, just me) if they need more info. Maybe explain the fact that most of us resent that our physicality is still considered acceptable to mock and that fact that they dont feel the need to respect our equal rights, puts them on the wrong side if history. \n\nIt would be interesting to ask if every user is a cis-gendered caucasian male of the same religion. I really appreciate your willingness to tackle this even with no personal connection to someone with dwarfism. So often, we are met with adversity when we speak up about this word and instead of apologising or simply fixing mistakes and doing better next time, people double down and try to claim that they do not mean it *like that*. And this has been my experience speaking up for the community, which my family is part of. \n\nWith all that said, no, it should not be used. Ever.  Allowing slurs in conversation further perpetuates the misconception that they are okay to use. It should not stop only when there is an immediate need in that specific space, it should stop because it is what is right and further marginalizing human beings is a disgusting stance to take.  \n\nThank you, from the bottom of my heart, for speaking up for what is right. Calling someone a midget as an insult, even when the target isnt short, is just normalising/validating negative social attitudes around dwarfism. \n\nEveryone know what the word \"midget\" means. They know it is a way to ridicule/dehumanise people with dwarfism. It is such an effective insult that taller people are \"tarnished\" with the slur if they are disliked. \n\nIn principle, it is exactly the same as saying faggot or nigger but it is considered less offensive because we have not got a big lobby or platform to complain about it and attitudes towards people with disabilities have not progressed as far as racial or Alt sexual identities. I am really glad you shared this honestly. I am currently in a large server, which I do not mod, and people regularly use the word midget. Quite a few people know that I am a little person and have also used it to refer to me (eg. \"that midget guy\") when I am not around. It makes me really uncomfortable, and I have been trying to build up the confidence to say something to the mods.\n\nI really appreciate you putting your neck out for us.

Now is the best time in history thusfar to be an LP.  Why would I say that?  Look at all the technological advances and advances in human culture surrounding us.  Ten years ago the only time you knew of an LP actor was Warwick Davis in Willow; Simon Birch; the Ewoks; and the Munchkins.  Sure you may have heard of the Roloff family (if you were an LP), but they were not as famous as they are today, with Little People Big World having opened the public\u2019s eye to LPs in a much wider range.  Not just that, but we have Martin Klebba and Peter Dinklage spearheading the way into acting careers like never before.  Ten years ago, if you walked up to a random person on the street and asked them about dwarfs, they were more likely to use the word \u201cmidget\u201d (which by the way, is offensive) and to think of a sideshow act than of a successful businessman or actor.  Not only are LPs making headway into the acting fields, as Steve and Katie Hatch from the TLC show The Little Chocolatiers show, LPs can be business owners too, or even doctors, as shown by Jennifer Arnold on The Little Couple.  (Do not worry, her husband Bill Klein is a successful businessman)\n\nBut not just in the media, LPs are more accessible than ever now.  Growing up I have lived in a small town, and knew only a few LPs that just so happened to be local (and uninvolved with LPA).  While yes these were role models for me (until life situations caused us to lose touch), LPA was not really something I ever thought about.  I saw myself as close to \u201cnormal\u201d as someone of short stature could be.  I hung out with friends, ignored the jokes that came along with the size, and had a pretty good life.  If I could not do it, I found a way to.  I did not really get involved with other LPs and LPA until my senior year, which brings me to the point of this: With the advent of the internet, it is now easier than ever to meet other dwarfs, locally, nationally, and internationally.  Before you had the hopes of mailing letters and waiting on responses (and hoping the addresses had not changed) and now you can receive almost an instantaneous reply.  I have friends from all over the world now that ten years ago I would never have dreamed of existing.  I can talk to others who have been through the same things I have, and get and provide support through times of hardship related to LP issues.\n\nNot only does the internet make people more accessible, it makes it easier to find out about ongoing LPA activities.  Before you relied on phone calls and mailing lists, but now as soon as something is firm it can be posted online.  So perhaps you cannot make it to your own regional, but there is one for a different region that you can make it to, before you may not have known it was so available to you but now you can plan ahead.  Not just that, but before the internet you either had to make your own pedals from scratch, or hope to find a set that you could buy used (or new, if you could afford them).  However with the internet, it opens up a national/global market for extensions and hand controls, bringing costs down and making it easier to build your own.\n\nSo why WOULD NOT now be the best time to be an LP?  There is progress being made against the word \u201cmidget\u201d, LPs are being more seen in the public eye as less of something \u201cweird\u201d, and instead they are seen as individuals, which we all are.

She is proportional, just has grown very little in the last 8 years or so. Her endocrinologist has said for many years that there is nothing that can be done to alter this fact and this has been agreed upon by another endocrinologist. \n\nI am hoping that someone here might have some advice for helping her to accept her height and not be so angry when people mistake her for her a child, particularly at restaurants. It is very rare that she is not offered a child's menu when we go out to eat. The truth is that she eats proportions typical to a child, so if they actually had smaller versions of the adult entrees, it would be a good deal. Sadly, most children's menus are relegated to mac and cheese, grilled cheese, hot dogs, etc. \n\nToday she was visibly seething with anger at this error by the hostess. When I tried to comfort her with the fact that it is difficult to tell the difference when she has a mask up, glasses on, and a baggy sweatshirt. The hostess is primarily looking at the height of the person. My daughter's features are youthful. When she does her makeup, she can look older than her actual age, but on a typical day her age is really tough to tell. The hostess apologized and tried to explain that they are supposed to offer the menus to anyone who might fit the age demographic (12 and under) which just made my daughter angrier.\n\nShe is not comforted by the fact that she will likely age well. I do not look my chronological age either and that is not arrogance... my skin is just mostly clear, with very few lines and no grays in my hair despite many of my peers developing these traits. I am grateful and have done nothing to merit bragging about it. I am sharing to say she will probably look like she could be in high school for another 10-15 years if she follows my aging patterns.\n\nI really do not know how to help her, but it is difficult to see her be so angry about a feature that I do not think is changeable. Does anyone have any advice to share? It is tough for me to say and probably for you to hear, but there is not really anything you can do for this.  A very good therapist may be able to help but honestly mine did not.  \n\nI started noticeably balding at 24 so that pretty rapidly ended being mistaken for a child, but until that point it happened a lot and was maddening.  Ultimately you either age noticeably, alter your appearance somehow, or get used to it. Agree with the post above. Unfortunately not much you can do aside from what youre probably already doing. Dont show that you feel sorry for her. Understand that you cant be in her shoes but in her footsteps.. \n\nIm early 20s &amp; still get this.. she will eventually grow thicker skin. For all of us, the earlier this happens the better. I do not agree with the other posts. There are things you can do but platitudes will not help. \n\nRather than telling her she will be fine. Talk to her about how she feels when people make this mistake. Let her talk her through all her thoughts, even if they sound irrational to you. \n\nShe will have fears she is too embarrassed to express. Will boys like her? Will she be taken seriously in high school, at work? All if these are super valid but she will probably have a hard time articulating them, perhaps even to herself. The menu at the restaurant is probably just a trigger for these deeper concerns. \n\nShe will also might experience being made fun of by either people at school or just other kids in the street.  She may be keeping this from you out of shame or to protect your feelings. \n\nMy father is 5ft 3 and always tries to relate to my experience. I am 3ft11 and disproportionate.

She loves talking to people about herself! So if the situation permits, ask questions, as a parent It has never bothered me when someone comes up to talk to her about being little. It is much preferred than being stared at. Also there are so few of them, that they are just as excited to see another LP as the general public is! My daughter is a LP, and I am average height. Here are a few things I can think of as her parent.\n\nCommon issues: toilets, obviously. Being able to reach a faucet to wash hands can be a problem, but some public restrooms have sinks that are lowered to accommodate wheelchairs and those are helpful. Light switches being too high, putting food in high cabinets/shelves, having a fridge with a bottom freezer are big helps. Depending on height, being able to step over the edge of a bath tub to get in can be an issue. Chairs without footrests can suck, nobody likes having their legs dangle. My daughter's condition comes with tendency for frequent elbow dislocation, different types have different quirks. We are in the US and accessibility is pretty good, but when we travel we have to scrutinize all of our plans &amp; have backup plans if she cannot do something (e.g., places that have steep stairs and no elevator. Or, we did a cave tour a couple years ago that was a nightmare with her.) We are pretty active and often call or email places before visiting. This year we are doing a family camp/hike and had to make special arrangements with the camp for her. We also have her in a toddler bed because it is closer to the ground, hotel beds suck A LOT.\n\nIf she drives, she will need pedal extenders, and a grabber tool to close the trunk. Right now, because she is in school, getting onto the school bus really sucks because the bottom step is simply way too high up from the ground. Someone has to lift her onto the bus, which I imagine will be embarrassing someday. \n\nBeing mindful: just assume that a LP can do something until they ask for help. If a little person is visiting your home, or you are hiring, it is fine to ask if there is something that would make them more comfortable. It is not like an LP is ever unaware of their stature, I think avoiding the topic is worse than acknowledging and moving on.\n\nJester dwarf, etc: eh, it happens. You see it on media portraying freak shows, too. There is some historical accuracy, so it is whatever. Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister is generally well regarded as a character because his dwarfism is part of his identity, but you see him doing things everyone else does (fighting, learning, making friends, sex and love, using his intellect to his advantage.) What I do not like, personally, is when someone is dwarfism is there *only* to be a spectacle, like, \"look how weird this is.\" There has to be character development to show a full person beyond their stature.\n\nYour last question: Little people are just people! Treat them like you would anyone else. It is fine to ask questions, like I said above, it is not like LPs are ever unaware of their stature. Just avoid walking up to random little people and asking what their genitalia is like, or if you can pick them up-- shit like that, and you are good.

So I got a pretty random message from an old colleague the other night apologizing for having called me a midget in the workplace 15 years ago. \n\nApparently, he recalls us being rather friendly with each other, then saying something stupid involving the word 'midget' with regards to me, and then me ignoring him ever since. \n\nAnyway, he went on about how he used to hold me in really high regard and has often felt guilty about the incident since. \n\nMy response was to say he was a product of his culture and time and it was good he is grown up but I was not going to forgive him. That it was not my job and that the young woman he hurt is not around anymore to forgive him anyway. She is older, more cynical, and has had to get on with life no matter what he thought of her.\n\nHe was upset with my answer and now I feel guilty about it.  I do not hate this guy, he is totally fine but I do not want to \"offer forgiveness\" either.\n\nThoughts? This man sounds like a selfish asshole whose growth, if any, has been minimal. What *he* did was wrong; you are not obligated to forgive him, stroke his ego, or help him feel better about himself. If his apology was sincere and worth accepting, he would have completely understood your response. Personally, I think you answered perfectly, especially after his response made you feel guilty. He should have wished you the absolute best and reiterated his apology for any contribution he made to your cynicism. \n\nI wish you the absolute best!!! Do not let this jerk get you down. Well we are you to as friendly as he claims? If so I do not think it is totally wrong to forgive him.  Though your never obligated to forgive anyone.   But like you said the person he hurt is not around anymore.  Well the same could be said for him.  The person that called you a midget might have changed to.  \n\nBut that is my two cents.  I do not find the term as offensive as some.  So take that what you will. If you do not forgive him, you do not forgive him. You should not offer forgiveness if it is not something you truly feel. And it is ok to not feel forgiveness.\n\nYou could say something like, \"I appreciate the apology,\" if you felt that way, which may make him feel a little better, but you are not *obligated* to do a damn thing to make him feel better about it at all.\n\nI think your message was perfect, though. Try to let go of the guilt you are feeling; you are not responsible for his feelings at all.\n\nIt sounds like he apologized to make himself feel better, not because he was actually thinking about the impact his words had on you. What made him call you a midget did you do or say something to him Wow, wait it go blame the victim... \n\nSince when do we need to provoke people into calling us names? Simply walking down the street solicits name calling. \n\nHe was probably making a midget joke or something trying to be cool. It was 15 years ago and midget jokes were... and still are, totally culturally acceptable. Even among the \"woke\" crowd. \n\nDo you have dwarfism? Why did you even need to ask me this?\n\nAlso, why would any rudeness on my part warrent being called a midget? Call me a bitch, sure but to insult me based on my disability is just fucked. I have disagreements with all types of people and do not resort to making fun of how they look.\n\nEdit: oh you are 4''7\" and enjoy posting pictures of your dick online... No need to wow me with a particularly insightful response. So he might have told a midget joke get a grip of yourself your offended over jokes to dump a friend for a simple think like that just goes to show how insecure you are as a person and do not worry if you do not want to reply now maybe give it 15 years I am sorry you feel you deserve the ridicule you have lived with your whole life. I get how you have \"accepted it\" and learned to \"laugh along\" as a coping strategy. \n\nHowever, I choose to be treated with more dignity and respect than you currently do and I will continue to advocate for the better treatment of people with dwarfism. No one deserves to be ridiculed never said that but a person cannot go around letting things like that affect you every type of person gets laughed at gets some sort of abuse in their lives and I am not saying it is rights but it is not healthy to harbour all of these things in your head For one thing .. no you do not have to feel guilty \u2026 that would be carrying someone else\u2019s burden to an extent \u2026\n\nBut as a man who has made his fair share of mistakes and a man who is views on himself and the world have grown and become more understanding with the wisdom of age , I get why someone may want to apologise for past indiscretions that they are not at all proud of \u2026. People change and grow \u2026.\n\nBut that does not mean you have to accept an apology or feel guilty about your response to make that person feel better \u2026. Maybe it is just a positive that someone out there has grown enough to understand that previous behaviour and thinking was unacceptable or inappropriate, and will consciously be a better person in the future. Why is not that term considered hate speech? I would like to know if that should be considered hate speech because if someone said that to my friend I would be super angry. Lot's of people say it to/about your friend all the time.\n\nHe just will not bother telling you about it because there is nothing you can do about it and people just get uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, he is a grown man. He will probably be embaressed or ashamed by it and will not want to look vulnerable.\n\nYeah it is hate speech. I have really only heard it used to diminish people's humanity and for the purposes of hurting them or intimidating them, so I do not see how it is not.\n\nBut midget jokes are still totally acceptable in the media. Even when it is literally making fun of LPs so good luck getting people to take you seriously. It is a woman not that it matters she is so sweet and you are right she probably would not tell me unless I did not make a big deal and let her know that I would not. \n\nI still do not think that it is right, and it upset me to see some people say just take it but I am on the outside so I can only speak my opinion and correct people and confront them as it comes up.\n\nI always thought it was hateful and I am glad I could hear that from you. \n\nI am glad you did not forgive that guy, maybe that will bring a change in him when he deals with others. Thanks. I think we agree on a few things\ud83d\ude09 I have been treated like shit way worse than you due to my autism. My suggestion is to forgive him. I have forgiven others in the past who have done me wrong. Lol, how are on earth are you qualified to say this? You do not have the experience of having dwarfism. You have no way of knowing how i, or others have been treated. And you clearly lack the imagination to try. \n\nSure, you have experienced sone trauma because of your autism, but do not go around dismissing other peoples experience because you think yours is worse. This is a bit late but your answer was exactally right This is an amazing response! His reaction so clearly confirms that he was not seeking to make you feel better, but for YOU to make HIM feel better. Give me a sincere apology over a plea for forgiveness any day! He was a dick to call you that. But now, you need to show that you are not like him.", "Yo you all shorties talk a lotta shit for people at schlong gargling height\n\nWord", "LP parents of LPs, any advice? So my wife and I have a daughter who is appearing... any day now.  And while I have a recessive dwarfism (EVC), my wife has a dominant dwarfism (we believe Hypo), and we won the coin flip to have a little person daughter based on the measurements we are receiving.\n\nSo, what is some advice some seasoned LP parents can give us?  Any tips you will not find anywhere else?  How can I not fuck up as a dad?  I am not a parent to a LP, but I am a older sibling to one, ans I think something my parents were deeply unprepared for, was how easy it is to lose track of a tiny TINY toddler on the move. My sister was just over a year when she started walking, and she was about a foot and a half tall, if that. Leashes are not the worst things in the world if it really comes down to it. \n\nI think the biggest things I had to adjust to, were becoming cognizant of everything that needed to be adjusted or needed alterations to be accessible. We are talking EVERYTHING from simple obvious things like reaching something on a shelf or turning on the light to less obvious things like not being able to use automatic sinks or automatics doors not opening for her, getting her a jar opener because her hands were too small to wrap around the jar and the jar lid. She had a very independent personality and we wanted her to be independent and feel she could do things on her own. So there were stools everywhere and she had a stick she could use to push things around. when we moved to a new house, my parents had the counters lowered in the bathroom and some of the light switches in the common areas and her room installed at her height. \n\nIf you are going to expect her to help with chores or cooking or anything, leave those things at her height so she can reach them. Nothing worse than getting yelled at when you cannot even access what you need to the job. \n\nFinding that balance between encouraging her to try new things on her own, and being reasonably aware of the limitations of her body. For instance, my sister has bowed legs and has to be careful with how much pressure she puts on her knees. Joining the cross country team was not really an option, but she did volleyball and golf instead (even had a special set of clubs made for her!). It is usually going to be slightly more expensive to do extra-curriculars - another example, sis wanted to play cello so the school district had to find her the smallest cello possible, and it cost my parents and arm and a leg to rent. With that said, you are probably going to fight with school admins and teachers who might think little person = not smart, which is totally not true. Sister also had to fight to get a permanent stool so her legs would not be dangling off the chair and cutting off blood circulation. \n\nOne thing my parents emphasized over and over, was that my sister CAN. She can do X thing. It might take her a little longer, it might be a little harder, but she can do it. And she did. She would monkey-climb her way to the highest shelf with the candy and cookies on it. She would find some way to get a book off the top shelf at the library. She was not afraid or ashamed to ask for help when she needed it. My mom really wanted her to have a positive attitude and I think she did a good job of it. I think where my mom could have done better, was letting her have her bad days too, and not pushing the YOU CAN DO IT so hard when she just wanted comfort. \n\nMake sure your baby wears shoes so that her feet do not widen so much because it is nearly impossible to find a extra wide women\u2019s size 5, much less find something CUTE in extra wide women\u2019s size 5. \u00be sleeve blouses will fit like a long-sleeved blouse. Find a good seamstress you can send all her clothes to get hemmed at and as she gets older, invest in some customized formalwear that is tailored to her so can feel confident and pretty in something that was literally made to fit her. \n\nThese are just some jumbled thoughts that I thought while trying to fall asleep unsuccessfully. Best wishes to you and your wife and you are going to do amazing. Are you on Facebook? There is a birth year group for your kiddo's age thatmay be helpful.

DM me for info. This is the sweetest big brother message ever.  All your points were excellent. Your family sounds lovely. Not a parent of an LP, but an LP. One thing my mom did for me was treated me like my brothers, there were no kid gloves and coddling. She always let me try, figure it out myself. Obviously if there were things I just could not do after trying, she would understand and help. But if I could climb a step stool, a counter, modify the way I was standing, or whatever had to be done and then accomplish it myself, she absolutely let me have at it. I was always, always given the chance to do it without interference.\n\nI grew up riding horses, barrel racing, skateboarding, anything I could attempt, I did. I did not have help getting up on horses, I found the ways to saddle up and get on myself. I personally heard other parents appalled by how my mom let go my own way because I was regularly recovering from major surgeries and had leg braces for many years. But mom's view was that one day I would not have her and I would still want to do these things so there should not be anything stopping me.\n\nBy doing that for me, my mom allowed me to realize that for the most part the only thing stopping me were other people's perceptions of me. Growing up it was frustrating to a point. Now I am grown and I owe my strength to my mother's approach. I know other people with less severe disabilities who call their mothers to talk to their boss at 25 years old because they have been coddled. Please do not do that. Lol. \n\nIt is like a balance. The best thing to do is be understanding and of course be there, but teach them that nothing can stop them. \n\nAnd also be prepared to have people amazed that what appears to be an 8 month old is talking full sentences because they do not know the child is actually 3 years.

What should we expect and prepare for? This news was devastating for us, mostly because we just wanted him to be average and not have to struggle so much in life. We have taken some time to vent out how we feel and now were in research mode. What can we expect moving forward. If any of you have this disorder and could explain how your life is, that would be helpful too. I guess we just have no idea what to do now. First off, it is totally normal to feel devastated right now. But do not let that hang around for too long. There are thousands of people who are extremely proud to have dwarfism. There are going to be struggles. There is going to be tears. There is going to be pain. But there are also going to be new experiences, new friends, and good times. For the records, I do not have achondroplasia, I have SEDC. As a word of caution, dwarfism is rare enough that if they diagnosed you on ultrasound there is still a chance that your baby will have a type of dwarfism that is not achondroplasia, but achondroplasia is by far the most common type of dwarfism. My point being here, just make sure you advocate early for a concrete diagnosis, whether that is through genetic testing or being seen by an expert in the field of skeletal dysplasias. My advice:\n\n1. Join the Little People of America (LPA). This is a great place for information but also support. Your child will greatly benefit from being exposed to people who are \"like him\" and the other members there will offer advice none of your doctors have. I am talking about how to arrange accommodations in school and at home, the best step stool brands, the best shoes, etc. There are usually local \"meetings\", regional conferences, and national conferences. The national conferences are very well attended and fun! They rotate the location around the country every year. The national this year is in Austin, TX. \n2. Be there for your kid. I know this sounds dumb, but you have about three years to prepare on this. That is about when your kid is going to realize themselves that they are different. It is your job as a parent to love and support them when they come home for the first time, upset, because someone said they look weird. \n3. Surround yourself with good medical providers! This is something you really have to advocate for because your child might be the first child with dwarfism your pediatrician has seen. There are several skeletal dysplasia specialty clinics around the country and they might be close or you might have to drive. In general your child will need more doctor's visits than the average child, but you particularly want to have a good orthopedic surgeon watching him, even if it is just once a year. The LPA brings in the best of the best expert docs in skeletal dysplasias to the national conference every year and they have a free clinic right at the conference (another good reason to join LPA).\n\nThe fact that you have already moved on to research mode is great! You are going to be fantastic parents. The best thing you can do right now is just continue to love your baby. Do not feel like this diagnosis is a death sentence. Your kid is probably not going to be a professional athlete (though there is a Harlem Globetrotter with achondroplasia), but your child really should't be too limited in life successes. I am a year away from being a doctor. I have friends who are teachers, lawyers, actors, accountants, etc. There is going to be bad days, but there are going to be plenty of good days.  \n\n\nI am happy to answer any other questions you may have! Feel free to PM me! Thank you so much for the kind response. At this point all I want to do is make my wife smile and relax and your post really put her at ease. There were a lot of tears for the first couple hours but were looking on the bright side now and making a lot of jokes to keep our spirits high. He will be a great kid and we already love him more then you could imagine. I may take you up on the PM once we collect ourselves and figure out what questions we even have. This was our first child so we already didnt know anything! Now we just dont know anything about something slightly different! Everything will be fine. Well said. This is great, solid advice We have a three year old little girl with achondroplasia. Give yourself time to grieve the vision of your child you had in your head and do not beat yourself up for doing so. BUT, everything is going to be great, so keep that in mind. Three years in I can tell you, we have a totally normal life with her! She is amazing and your kiddo will be to. Get involved with the LPA and get aggressive with finding a good team of doctors at a reputable skeletal dysplasia clinic (even if you need to travel). Otherwise, relax and enjoy your beautiful baby!

My friends crack jokes about it and I do it too, it does not hurt me. \n\nParents listen up: Do not punish your kids if they make a hurtful gesture towards me, or someone like me. Please, because then it makes ME feel bad. \n\nTLDR: Kid got in trouble for questioning my condition. Parents: please do not punish your kids for that. I can take it, do not worry Punishing and informing are also two different things.  That is, you can simply explain to a child that there is a lot of variety in the world and should not make snap judgments about people based on appearance whether they are taller than usually or shorter than usual.  It is not necessary to punish a child for such observations, and it is a great opportunity for them to learn.\n\nThey should be taking the child over to you and having a real conversation.  Many people seek to avoid people that are minorities or unique, whether they are shorter, taller, bald, elderly, or a different skin color.  Politeness is not avoidance.  Politeness is an exhibition of respect. I am on the opposite end. I hate being around children I do not know\u2014they are always staring. Sometimes laughing, sometimes pointing and asking their parents how I could look so \u2018wrong\u2019.\n\nSo, no, I am not going to feel bad when their parent/ guardian educates them to be mannerful and respectful of others. I agree. The only way people (kids specifically) can understand our condition is if they approach us like normal people and just ask a simple question/start a conversation. \n\nI was lucky enough to have a dad approach me with his kids and we explained to them my condition, and that even though I look different, I am still a normal person. That conversation alone made me feel so much better about both my dwarfism, and the perspective others have of people like me. It sucks they get in trouble, but need to be taught to not be rude to people who are different such as those with dwarfism. Everyone needs to be taught that everyone is different and that is not a bad thing and that people that are different than you still need to be treated with respect and that treating them differently can be very hurtful.\n\nI dont want to be treated differently than others, I want to be treated as a regular person, like they would want to be treated and I dont treat others differently no matter how different than me they are, because I know that is wrong and I know how hurtful that is. The thing that sucks seems to be you did not have a chance to intervene or have a voice. \n\nAny situation where your eyes get to be part of your nervous system being pointed at, your voices ability to evolve other peoples minds seems always limitless. Same. Although, I am in my 30s now and I have had some seriously bad and seriously good interactions with children I do not know. I used to absolutely HATE being around kids. I have learned that at least smiling can completely change a kid's attitude. If I get a chance I will wave and maybe say, \"hi\". It has worked wonders! It is gone from 90% who are just staring and may then turn to another kid and laugh to that same 90% smiling, waving, or saying hi back!

I mean actual dwarfs, I often see one particular guy doing comedy sketches.

Actually bothers me he has a video of him \"shooting a gun\" where he is not even properly shooting the gun and mistreats a several thousand dollar rifle that could have hurt him or those around him.\n\nBrad Williams is a comic, and he is fucking hilarious. I think it all depends on how much agency the person\u2019s given within their comedy. Is the joke or sketch something they are using to make a point or get a laugh (because, contrary to popular belief, disabilities and the weird situations they put you in can be hilarious)? Or is it a sketch that is making fun of them for being different and reinforce the sideshow freak stereotype, even if they are making fun of themselves?\n\nThe thing I dislike about Wee Man in Jackass (a spiritual precursor if not direct inspiration for many of the famous social media \u201ccomedians\u201d out there today) is he is not a comedian. He is the joke. Which can be said of all of the actors on Jackass, sure, but it really feels like Wee Man\u2019s dwarfism are why he was on the show, and he is a person second.

His role as a gag for the movie hurt pretty badly because here was someone that kind of looked like me, but was used as a prop for regularly-sized people to point and laugh at, and a lot of schoolmates teased me using lines straight out of the movie until I graduated high school. His later work (especially with Tyrion in the early seasons of GoT) showed a nuance and thoughtfulness that really made me rethink my dislike of him, and eventually come to be a pretty big fan of Tyrion with his portrayal\n\nI second Brad Williams being a dwarf in the public sphere using his dwarfism to make good content. He is a top-rate comedian who would be fucking hilarious even if he were able-bodied. He just so happens to have a disability that is put him into some situations that he can convey in an absolutely hilarious way. That ability to control the narrative of WHY your disability is funny and to frame it in a way that will not harm anyone else in its execution is what separates an opportunist from someone getting it \u201cright\u201d I am a 32 year old female dwarf. I think dwarfs in comedy in any way, shape, or form is hilarious! I was always the first one to make fun of myself in school so nobody else ever did. Maybe that is why I personally do not get offended or angry about that kind of stuff. But all of it is funny to me. I am on the fence about it.  My partner is a LP who works in performance arts.  Some things are funny.  A lot of things are exploitative. I am glad this was brought up, especially by someone who is not an LP. I think the situation matters of how the humor is being portrayed. I believe intent is everything. I am a dwarf and there are somethings that happen to me that are just hilarious. Maybe not in the moment, like hitting my shoulder on door knobs, or hitting my forehead on rear view mirrors. But honestly once the literal pain has gone away, I usually laugh at those types of instances. That is funny, and people of all statures I am sure could join in a good chuckle on those moments.\n\nIt is when you get into the tropes, stereotypes, and making fun of dwarfism. Someone posted about Peter Dinklage. I LOVE that dude. Awesome guy, very intelligent, fantastic actor, funny, I could go on. But I too HATED his character in elf. Dwarf people kind of have this stereotype that they anger easily. I have literally been compared to Gimmlee (sp?) from lord of the rings. This was while I was pumping gas at a Wawa. While I love the LOTR reference, I want to be treated/ignored like every other 26 year old woman who is just pumping gas, a very normal thing. Plus, I do not have a beard. But I digress.\n\nI will get down to the point by saying, if the intent is to further spread the foolish or quick to anger stereotype, and any other sort of negative view of dwarf people, then the joke is not funny. But if it is literally about things that only happen to LP that are laughable by all parties, then I say go ahead.\n\nLastly, Brad Williams is awesome, and I love his content. Sometimes I feel like he goes the line, but in the end he commands respect as a human being who is just trying to shed light on some unique experiences with humor. Brad from the show Mind of Mencia put it best \"I am not being exploited because I am getting paid!\" He is now a successful comedian who makes fun of himself as the basis for his act. I do not like it because people think it is ok to treat us as a joke, when we are trying really hard to undo that.\nThen there is part of me that would probably sell out and do skits and stuff if payed enough. Dwarf comedy is the lowest form of comedy around... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. But seriously if the joke is funny its funny. Comedy is subjective its ether for you or not for you, like me when it comes to female comics I find that many make extremely unfunny pussy jokes but many find it funny.

Someone wrote to me on Reddit to tell me his friend from highschool committed suicide because of the bullying she was experiencing in her community. They lived in Africa.\n\nI have seen posts from LP FB groups mentioning people unexpectedly dying and the cause of death is always skirted around with lots of mentioning of them being \"troubled\".\n\nI cannot help but think that the persecution we deal with daily, would lead a lot of people to dispair and thus suicide. Particularly if you are dealing with other life hassles such as employment, health and Family concerns. \n\nAnyway read anything about this? I suspect it would all be anecdotal as I do not imagine anyone is collecting this data. I am very interested in responses here. Yeah, I think there is anecdotal evidence only so far, but I would not be surprised. David Rappaport, Herv\u00e9 Villechaize, Verne Troyer, and Hank Nasiff (aka. Hank the Angry Drunk Dwarf) come to mind. Rappaport is one of the more clear-cut examples - where he voiced clear distress over how he was treated and committed multiple suicide attempts, eventually being successful. Same with Villechaize committing suicide and explicitly linking it to his dwarfism, though more the pain he suffered from it.\n\nThe others were not necessarily suicidal, but living very self-destructive lives that ultimately led to their deaths. I do not mean to correlate these directly to their dwarfism, their situations could have been completely unrelated on an individual level, but it does seem there is a higher percentage of people who develop suicidal tendencies or damaging habits. \n\nI was suicidal myself when I was a teenager. I would not say it was directly caused by my dwarfism, but I doubt it helped with my overall stress and outlook on my life at that point. Interested to hear the general view &amp; if there are any statistics on this..\n\nI myself was suicidal in my mid to late teens &amp; had all those other things which fould be a problem to many too. Unemployment, health problems, family issues &amp; of course the dwarfism.\n\nIve since got out of that dark place &amp; i did it partially by attending counselling &amp; training to become one too. I guess i found a happy thing to do. Do i still have bad days - yes. Yesterday was one of those, i went to an event &amp; when leaving, got the classic abuse.

I used to dwell on the abuse more too. It becomes easier to handle when you are an adult. I think it is just a developmental thing.

The basic points boiled down to is it, or is it not, a legitimate thing to have a phobia of little people?\n\nBoth sides in this argument were little people.  One side's opinion was that yes, a fear of little people is legitimate and should be respected.  The other side stated that a little person phobia was illegitimate, unfounded, and a form of discrimination.  They likened it to racism, basically stating that there is not a phobia of people of color.\n\nI will post my response in the comments, but where do you stand? So is it possible to think both sides are right in their own way?\n\nAs someone who is currently dealing with a fear of driving, riding, and sometimes being away from home, after doing all of those things for 30 years, I definitely can see how an irrational fear is legitimate.  I love cars, I love driving, I love traveling.  And right now, I have panic attacks if I travel far or drive much.  It is honestly fucking crazy, and not something I desire.  In this time of affliction, I have learned how anxiety, and phobias, can manifest, and be caused instantly, and take a long time to be undone.\n\nI also can see how you could see a fear of little people as discrimination.  Someone is attitude is changing based on something completely out of your control.  Because we want to be seen as normal, we feel they should not be reacting adversely due to something that we feel is normal.  Unscrupulous actors could use the blanket \"I am scared of little people\" as a means of avoidance, or as a way to make sure a person is not included in a group. I am a little person. Whenever someone has run away screaming from me as I am walking down the street, I think to myself about that person\u2019s childhood. Usually when Ive spoken to people who have a fear of LP\u2019s, they say usually the same thing: their caregiver showed them Wizard of Oz, or Leprechaun, or the Chucky movies at a young age and it scarred them. Or their brains cannot usually handle that one glance they thought I was a child and in the next they are scared because they see I am an adult. It is so weird! Yes, it is discriminatory and I relate it to the way people will scream \u201cMIDGET\u201d at me out of a car window. We do not run away from people in a wheelchair, but it is socially acceptable to believe Little People have no real feelings or thoughts or dreams or goals. We are some scary subset of humans to a lot of people. \n\nI have had people countless times walk up to me and say, \u201cHey, my friend hates/is scared of midgets can you go scare them? I will try to remain calm at first (on a good day) and ask \u201cI will talk to your friend as a human being and see what they say.\u201d \n\nAfter speaking with the terrified person they usually thank me and say the fear went away because they saw I was normal af. Lol I definitely agree with you that a lot of people use it as a joke moreso than a legitimate phobia.\n\n\"Oh haha I am/my friend/my mom is so scared of little people\" is definitely bullshit. It is being prejudice and bigotry. If you do not like someone for there physical appearance ( as in skin color witch you have no control over ) that is racism and very bad to do in today society.  If you do not like someone for there physical appearance ( as in height, handicap, wheelchair and etc, witch you have no control over ) that is ok in today society and if you say something about it you get put in the  PC culture category.  I though it was bad when I was growing up but it seems way worst now to me.  We have become a society of getting great gratification  when tearing someone down. You see it in the media everyday.  It is all about how someone is taught about other people who are different.  Making fun or mocking someone for any reason was learn/ taught to them by someone else. I met a girl once who when she saw me almost went in to a full blown panic attack. The odd thing was this girl was in a wheelchair. I thought it was strange. I am Hispanic and I have encountered superstitious  people afraid of me because of my dwarfism. This includes some of my family members. I remember not being able to be near one of my aunts when she was pregnant because it could \u201ccurse\u201d her child into being born with dwarfism. I have a friend that rarely let me over when I was younger because his mom thought I looked creepy. I am so sorry that was your experience. I am 100cm or 1m or 3'3\n\nWhat actual  I have never known this to be a thing. I know we humans tend to be afraid of many different things. But fear of dwarfs/little people/short people/midgets and all the other names. But as I am typing this I am remembering several time children have run from me terrified screaming bloody murder. But the oldest child that ran from me was probably about 10 but I also growled at him and I was exiting the mosque toilets and the corridor was a bit dark. However as one gets older would they not understand that we are just like everyone else just in a cuter package? Have I contributed to having several more adults that grew up terrified that a little person will sneak into their room at night to devour them? In any case I still now and then miss the times children were afraid of me now with my big fluffy beard they not scared anymore, all in all I feel phobia for another human is just plain stoopid. I am so sorry for your experience, when I read this I pictured her getting up and running away .... so in my minds eye you cured her (and yes I am a weirdo but my height makes me think its acceptable to let my weird flag fly) In my experience i would say fact. \nAlthough its rare in adults (still happens) i find young kids around the age of toddlers being scared of me amd stryijg to cry when they see me. This probably hurts me the most mentally out of all the other things which you get used to. But i cant seem to find a way around this issue, because i cant just brush it away as i feel im hurting people and the only reason im alive is to do ths opposite of that. I have a friend that is a 6'4 cop.  He is petrified of only two things: Little People and Clowns.\n\nWe always joke around with him that if he ever gets called to a domestic where one of the participants is a Little Person dressed in a clown outfit he will have a full-blown panic attack.\n\nSo yeah, I guess it is a thing with at least one person. I have met people with a genuine phobia of little people. Like actually sweating and feeling uncomfortable. I do not think it is a hate based phobia. In their case, I do not think it is like racism. I do not know anyone who actually hates little people. But there are people who see it as a deformity, and become viscerally, unwillingly, uncomfortable. It is pretty rare in my experience, but I am willing to bet money that it is a real, diagnose-able, mental condition like any other phobia. Now I am having images of a swarm of little people dressed like clowns rushing me in the street. I can confirm that would be terrifying.

So while I was talking about him I referred to him as quote \" The kids a fucking dwarf he is like 4 \"8 and he bullies some kid who is too stupid to realize it.\" Would this be considered offensive to the Little person at the table? I do not even know him that well so I am just wondering if this would have upset you. I personally would have considered it a slip of the tongue and not had to much of a second thought about it.

The thing im most thankful for is my parents teaching me independence. But at the same time teaching me that I have limits and its perfectly normal to need help As your kid gets older he will deal with occasional random acts of bullying in the street from strangers. The extent of it will vary according to your location and the local cultures. He will be able to manage it and have a great life, but you will need to help him develop coping strategies and conflict resolution strategies.\n\nBest resources I have ever seen regarding this are here: (\n\nIt is an 'visible difference' advocacy group in the UK focusing mainly on facial disfigurement. But the socio-political problems dwarfism raises are the same. I told my daughter the world would treat her differently so prove to them that you are not. She was independent to a fault. She asked for help when needed but figured out how to do things on her own. Hopefully your child will not require a lot of surgeries but if they do make SURE you take them to a doctor who knows about little people.

The bouncing coupled with the size can lead to a neck injury. 1. On the LPA website there is a list of dwarfism clinics. Even if it is just to check in every few years, get in touch with someone who specializes in dwarfism. My daughter's local doctors consult with DuPont in Delaware.

Secondly because they have grown up with this being totally normal and comfortable, and they do not give a shit about what other people say or do. They are very matter of fact about her. Everything that seemed really difficult and scary to me, was just their little sister to them. Their attitude toward her has meant that their friends, our neighbors, etc. never made a big deal about it.

I do not usually post personal stuff like this, but today I really appreciated what a dad did while I picked up my little sister from school. My sister has Dwarfism, I do not know the specifics but she walks slower than regular people and gets tired faster. I will share a different story though, when I was going around with my family to see the community colleges here in California, we visited one in Modesto. I was walking up the stairs with my mom and sister. My sister was 8 years old at the time, and she has an awkward step when climbing stairs. I looked back to see where my dad and brother was when I saw a couple behind us. The guy was mimicing my sister's way of climbing the stairs, and I promptly wanted to beat his ass and break his legs. That was the only time I truly felt furious, but luckily I contained my emotions. \n\nToday, I was really happy about what one dad said when me and my sister were walking to the car. There was a father behind us with his son and daughter. The son was talking and walking fast and was going to walk right past us when his father said, \"son, you can wait.\" I do not know, it seems like a small thing but it just made me happy. I truly appreciate people who will adjust to other people with conditions.  Anyone who tries to hurt or to be rude to my sister will be discouraged by my fists and my words. I hope all of you have a great day. Usually when my sister has bad experiences related to her dwarfism ( and people being ignorant assholes ) she tends to just brush it off. I get SO enraged, but she is used to it and does not think it is worth getting upset over. Thankfully sometimes people are kind and understanding! Thanks for sharing this, little things can make a big difference in someone is day. I can relate to feeling enraged. Some people are just so insensitive. Little things definitely can make a big impact on someone is day. As a dwarf I will say that its nice when people take the second to be empathetic to anyone who has a different way of dong things due to physical reasons.

I am a person of average height (F) in a relationship with a short guy and we are trying to figure out how to partner dance. I looked online and did find some partner dances with a LP and avg height person (sidebar-is there a short hand term for this type of relationship?), but everything that came up was with the tall person leading. We came up with a few ideas, but most of them would require tools that would not always be available (e.g. platform shoes/stilts and/or things with wheels so I can be on my knees). Does anyone here know of any videos or dance styles that are conducive to LPs leading partner dances with taller people? It would be awesome to see what other people have come up with.\n\nThanks! My partner has dwarfism and I am of average height. He is a far better dancer than I, so I let him lead and I do not worry about the difference in height.

This is a question I have been thinking for a long time, and one or two people have asked me how I feel about it before as well. So I thought I would propose this question towards everyone else in general. Does Anyone Watch Anime And If So, How Do You Feel About Dwarfism Or Exaggerated Short Stature In Anime/Manga? What kinds of pros and cons (no pun intended) do you see? Personally I think it depends on the story and genre, as it can go either way.

My name's Sion (like Sean, just Welsh).\n\nI have been thinking about posting this for a while, but I hesitated to. I passed a LP crossing a busy street today, and it made me excited because it is the first time I have seen a LP in public in *fifteen years*.\n\nIt made me excited because I have been thinking about how common LP are and how you meet other people with dwarfism outside of groups *for* LP and conventions. I am AP and a transgender man, and while I mostly meet trans men on /r/ftm and at the Philadelphia Trans-Health Conference once a year, I have met four trans men in the past five years (that I know of) in passing. I meet trans people much more commonly than LP.\n\nBefore then, if I encountered trans men, I did not know that they were transgender. In our community (in support and activist contexts), we talk about trans visibility and whether people know we exist. Sometimes people meet me and they have already known other trans men before me, but usually I am the first trans man they have met.\n\nI think people generally know that LP exist. I get the impression that LP are mistreated by others. I read a piece about ( for trans women  today and I was wondering if LP experience something similar (exploitative representation in a reality TV show versus ...*Game of Thrones*? to our *Dallas Buyers Club* v. *Orange is the New Black*).\n\nI was wondering if there are any transgender LP out there.\n\nIf anyone wants to be friends, I am here!", "New author question.

Are the terms Little Baby and Little Children ever used? Congratulations!! Little person and dwarf are the most commonly used terms I have found. Midget is best avoided as a lot of people have strong negative connotations to it. It does seem weird using \u2018little person\u2019, but it becomes normal lol. Enjoy your little niece (: I may be biased but dwarf babies are the cutest babies. If you want to learn more about dwarfism there is a big community around the organization Little People of America. It is US based but there is a lot of international attendance at their conferences and their website and social media are great to read! I would get her parents hooked up with them if they have not already. Dwarf babies are the cutest! Avoid nouns. Your niece is not a dwarf. She is a person with dwarfism. The destinction is important as her size should not be her one defining quality. \n\n\"Little Person\" is often used to describe any kids but in the right context, people know what you mean. \n\nJust treat her like, you know, a real person.\n\n\"My niece has dwarfism\" when explaining her size.

You should check out this Facebook group. Chandler, the woman who runs it has had limb extension and is super knowledgeable. \n\n To be able to play bar chords on a guitar, I would go through that on the fingers of my left hand.  Except I already had a trigger thumb repair and that worked okay for about a year and now it is right back to where it was, or worse. Are not those some of the most painful surgeries out there? Unless you absolutely require it, I would not go for it at all, bro Not an expert, but I think it would still work with the ilizarov principle, but it is going to take a lot longer to fill gaps as an adult and probably be more risky Hey bud, I have this wicked cool method to play all sorts of stringed instruments.

You will or you will not.\n\nBut seriously without knowing the dwarfism type and having genetic testing this could not be a more vague question. Okay. Thanks for clarifying. I believe you can get a referral for genetic counseling through your/your wife's primary care, urologist or gynecologist.  There are many different kinds of dwarfism including some that still are not figured out.  Sometimes it just happens.    \n\n\nYou should find out all you can about your wife's brother's diagnoses, so you can ask better questions when you get genetic counseling, but be advised that brother-in-law might not see it as a disability at all.    \n\n\nA lot depends on whether or not we have pain, other difficulties, issues beyond simply being below median height.  Be gentle, and listen. Okay. Thank you very much. I wish you and your wife well!   Ankle biters definitely have their pros and cons, and you should know all you can going into it. I am pregnant right now and have just seen a geneticist about this exact same thing. \n\nI have a recessive form of dwarfism which means it is very unlikely my kid will have it. If my dwarfism were a dominant type, it is 50/50 I would pass it on. \n\nYour wife does not have dwarfism so is not a carrier of a dominant type of dwarfism. At most she would be a carrier of a recessive type but you would need to have the same recessive gene for your kid to be born with the condition. The chances of this are super unlikely. \n\nI suspect your BILs dwarfism was just a genetic fluke and is not a gene that is carried in the family. However if he has a family of his own, it will be. \n\nOur of interest, is this something your wife and you are worried about? What is the narrative around your BILs height? Is it considered a tragedy? We are not really concerned if our child does have dwarfism. It is God\u2019s will. I am just wondering what the chances are. We do not have health insurance to see a doctor right now and ask these complex questions. I do not know anything about dwarfism at all. So the answers were very informative. I personally think it is rather miraculous and special. I do not see it as a disability. I see it the same way like being a red head. How God can create people in different colors and sizes. I am a very good person. And there is no narrative around her brother. If you want more detail with no doctors, try asking r/genetics. Some of the people who answer are genetic councillors and some of their info is excellent and professional. \n\nThey will want to know the diagnosis of your BIL. Do you know what he has?  No, I do not Ok. If you pm me a photo of him or someone that looks like him, I could have a good guess.

At times I feel it is so different, that we have lost the ability to relate to each other. This can cause family tension and occasionally family arguments. \n\nI am not sure if this is a 'being different' thing or just a personality thing on my part. Does anyone have any similar experience to this? I, too, am an only-dwarf (and child). I am not sure how old you are, but I am in my early 30s and I have been married now to an average-sized woman that I have been with for 14 years. I have more people in my life who are average-size around me (in-laws, etc.) than I did in my childhood.\n\nWhile I get what you mean to an extent, I think it is all in one\u2019s perspective - particularly from the person who is different. It takes both sides, though, to be empathetic to the other.\n\nWhat sorts of things make things blow up? Oh, the angst is definitely all mine but it still puts a strain on my relationship with the family. It also stems from being single so you probably will not relate.\n\nI am in my mid to late 30's and have never had a family or my own or even a significant romantic relationship. It is never seemed like a possibility for me - due my dwarfism. This leaves me feeling pretty dumb at family reunions and dinner table get-togethers. \n\nWhile most people would say I have a pretty good, successful life, I just feel like it is so far removed from their lives that I do not enjoy being around them and listening to their stories or sharing my own. This is perceived as antisocial behavior - which it is - and conflict ensues. Not me (5'9, F), but my boyfriend and his mom are the only people in his family with achondroplasia. I cannot speak to his experience with other family members, but I remember talking with him about how starkly different his mom's experience was from his. According to him, she never had much trouble dating and assumed that his height would not play much of a factor for him when he started dating as well. But of course, the experience of dating as a short woman is very different than the experience as a short man.\nSo even between the two dwarves of the family, it seems that there was a sense of not being understood and having vastly different life experiences, making it difficult to relate in some regards.\n\nI am sorry that you are going through this. While I have trouble relating to my family in other ways, it is no real comparison. I do think, though, that not being able to relate to your family in some or many ways is a pretty common experience broadly. That does not necessarily make it any easier though. I hope some other folks in a similar position as you can provide some solidarity and/or comfort, and I am sending you empathetic, virtual hugs. My (34, F, 5'9) partner (35, M, 4'3) had never had a significant romantic relationship before me either. But here we are, 2.5 years in, completely in love and talking about starting a family of our own. I can imagine how hopeless it may seem, but I am here to tell you that these things ARE possible. That is interesting.  Can i ask where you guys are based? I am in Australia and.the dating culture may be different here. I do not have dwarfism, but my kiddo does, most people who have dwarfism are born to average height parents. I am not sure if that is helpful to hear at all, that you are not alone there. I worry about my kiddos future regarding dating when I see adults with dwarfism struggle. I am truly sorry. I am mis 30s and a single mom and absolutely feel like my family's extra wheel. I do not intend on ever dating/marrying again and it is a source of contention with my family and I. I am not sure where I am going with this, really, but I am sorry you are struggling and feelong like an outsider. I am (M41yo) also the only dwarf in my family . While it is true you do have a different experience of life than others in your family, but that can be said of anyone. I know you are feeling alone , but your not. Have you tried getting involved in LPA perhaps? That may help you get in contact with people you can relate with more. Even meet someone special.  In what ways have you put yourself out there to try and meet someone? I am on a dating site and it is worked out well for me, plus I am in a wheelchair! Not trying say that I have it harder, what I mean is there is a lot of open minded people out there. \n\nI guess I am not understanding why you blame your dwarfism for it. I would like to help more if I can. One thing I have to ask, because it was something I did and it was a detriment to my love life, is that are your expectations a bit too high? A lot of society makes us think that if we are not dating THE MOST attractive person, than we have failed. This is ridiculous. I hope that does not affect you. \n\nWhat kinds of things have you tried? Before the pandemic, did you go out and try to meet anyone? at Bars or whatever ? Again, the online thing I find helpful cuz there is not any mistake in why you might be talking to someone in there.\n\nAnd dude, saying we cannot relate? We are all dwarfs here, we have all struggled with this issue at one point or another. We can all relate. New York City I am the only dwarf in my family too. I am not sure about distant cousins but when it comes to my immediate family I am the only dwarf. It makes me feel isolated because they cannot experience life like I do and vice versa. I am a woman living Australia. Culturally America is very different. I get hit on over there whenever I visit. I also get ridiculed less in the street in the US. This is surely a cultural indicator of datability?\n\nI also suspect women's experience is different because, as you said yourself, many men would rather be single chasing women out of their league, then in a relationship with women more suitable for them.\n\nI am  on dating apps in Australia. My standards are \"living, breathing male\". I even find it difficult to get guys to sleep with me for one night stands... so I am not sure I can get any more 'open minded'.\n\nI am actually fairly attractive. I have a great figure and am very fit. I am also very charismatic and outgoing and have like, a billion male friends, all of whom are not interested in me romantically. I have asked some of them out in the past. Again, many of whom are actually below my league attractiveness and personality-wise. They prefer to be single.\n\nso... aside from moving to the US and catching covid and witnessing the demise of democracy, I am kind of at a loss. Where abouts are you based? Yes, the third wheel thing is definitely real. I am sure every single person at the dinner table feels it.\n\nWhat causes contention with your family? Are they unhappy about your boycotting the dating scene or do you just find it hard to fit in?\n\nAlso, regarding your child, if you are in the US, I would get involved with the LPA pretty heavily. Friends experiencing the same stuff and learning to date at the same time and all that are really important.\n\nThe UK has something vaguely similar but not nearly as good. Australia has very little for kids over 5yrs. Where are you based? I am in North Carolina Yeah, I like that city. I live in California They seem to think I am not serious about not wanting to find someone to live the rest of my life with, which is whatever but also I am allowed to choose to be single, you know? I should not need people insisting that I will want someone some day.\nThey also make shitty comments about my kids (My older kiddo has severe combined type adhd and likely autism, he is loud and chatty and impulsive and my family does not seem to think adhd is real, then my younger kiddo is the one with dwarfism and my sister has made shit comments like \"if I did not know you I would say you have munchausens by proxy\" -which does not even make sense, I did not change his DNA to give him dwarfism or the complications that go along with his abnormal karotype, my mom has said things like calling him \"frail\" bc my sister's kid is a year younger and much bigger and more advanced motor wise, it is a lot of \"jfc this family needs work\") which means I have distanced myself significantly, but there is only so much distance I can do truly achieve. &gt; munchausens by proxy\n\nhaha, wow. ok. Your sister is a bit of a moron. Tell her to look 'munchausens by proxy' and then explain to you how on earth it could possibly apply to you. \n\nAs for your family... they do not sound soooo crazy. I get how those comments would piss you off though. Slower motor development is totally normal for Achon kids... 'frail' is just not really a decent description. They also do not sound very effectively supportive... As in, i could definitely see myself feeling alienated among them if I were you. But I suspect they are quite loving and think they are being supportive.\n\nAs for relationships, you clearly have a lot more experience than me in them so I feel a bit silly agreeing with your family, but I 'imagine' the companionship they bring is very nice, comforting and worth looking for. Part of my problem was assuming it was not possible, worth it and thus never trying. I regret it now because I keep thinking to myself 'what if I had really put myself out there?' Now that I actually am trying, I have decided rejection just is not as bad as regret. Rejection is not as bad as regret is a very insightful way to put it. I will try to keep that in mind moving forward. I do think you are right that my family thinks they are being supportive in some ways.  I hope you findwhat you are looking for in a relationship, you are deserving. Only dwarf in my (F 28 4'3\") family too. I cant speak to dating, as I am a girl and some men would really 'stick it in any hole', but it has been hard at times. I remember when I was younger, and boys would not be interested because yknow... dwarfism... but the older I got, the more men are okay with it (though boys still exist). But it definitely took a toll on my self worth and left me with a tonne of insecurities.\n\nRelationships will happen, but you just need to be at the right place at the right time. All my exes were people I have met online. That is the only place you can give them a heads up about your situations and it will weed out all the immature candidates. Its easier to be rejected when its only a swipe left that you will never know about. But putting yourself in a bigger market sure as hell helps. Bars help but it cant weed out the ones you do not want. Online dating gives you a bigger ocean to fish in. \n\nAs for my family, there was a lot of strain growing up. Im Asian, so there is more 'YOU MUST BRING YOUR FAMILY HONOUR' which is hard when you are struggling through multiple surgeries, a disability, etc. I have fought with them many times when it comes to their expectations but over the years they get tired and now we have a healthy relationship. I pretty much told them off how I would like to live my life, which included a lot of teenage tantrums. But after a while, I guess I wore them down to a point where I can sit down with them and explain to them my situation without it getting heated. Age helps too.\n\nI think you should sit down with your family one day and hash everything out. What they expect vs what you can achieve - be it relationships, career, etc. Tell them that the fighting has been hurtful, be honest, communicate and stand your ground. Try to explain stuff about dwarfism to them, and how your life is like, from your perspective. It is a long and hard road, but its a road we all must take nonetheless - whether its family or partner or even your boss. Having dwarfism is difficult but it is more difficult when you have family (who are supposed to be there) that dont understand or are total dicks about it. \n\nAll my love \u2764 hope the journey gets easier for you \u2764 My family issues are not similar to yours. They are very open to listening and accept my opinions about things. They are also very supportive. They always have been.\n\nIt is hard to explain but I am probably more projecting my problems onto them. My problems bother me more when they are around and it makes me tense and uncomfortable. So it is easier to just not be around them. It is actually very unfair on them. But it is how I feel.\n\nInterestingly, I never went through a tantrum phase and never got angry or upset about my height. I think I maybe I should have. It would have opened me up to voicing my pain and fears around my height. This is healthier than denying them and then become a seething ball or dignified resentment 20 years later. Ah. I think the best course of action is actually seeing a therapist about it. I know there is a heavy stigma around it, but I started seeing a therapist recently and I think at one point I just realised there was a lot of issues underneath the hood that I didnt know was still affecting my life. I think, personally, you should give therapy a shot. It is a great way to dig deep and find out why and how to help that part of yourself. Also it is kind of fun, like relieving fun, to have an hour where you just emotionally dump yourself onto someone. And this someone can actually help. Im doing CBT, so I get fascinating homework to do after a session that changes my behaviour thus changing my mindset. It is not like how you see it on TV haha. Its actually quite liberating \ud83d\ude0a you are already pretty self-aware of the issue you have, but going to a session or two can really clear it up and give you an action plan \ud83d\ude0a Thanks. I have already started seeing one. Took me a few tries to find one I liked but I am very happy with him.\n\nI agree, therapy is kind of fun. Hard too at times. Oh awesome! Its always just the first step that is hard. But its good that you have found an awesome therapist!

Thanks for giving it a name. \u201cIn psychology, the term 'family symptom bearer' essentially refers to a scapegoat in the family who displays psychiatric problems brought on by the extreme dysfunction, especially with regard to communication, of the family as a whole\u201d -*childhoodtraumarecovery.com*\n\nThat is really interesting....Something definitely worth looking into. Thanks for posting it, I would never come across that hypothesis. Thanks for sharing, yes I only learnt about it through accidentally going to a person trained in Bowen family system therapy. They said I was the family symptom bearer and scapegoat child. Is a complex family system and focus on the good relationships important and delicate... was extremely scary as therapy backfired and I got ostracised and disinherited by whole family Jesus...I am so sorry you had to go through all that. Therapy is supposed to be helpful... but if they could not see what a good person you are, then good riddance. They are clearly self centered and toxic. I know you will find happiness on your own terms that fits you as you really are.  Yeah I never got that either, I always assumed I would be on someone is bucket list, I do not really care if it is cheap and tawdry, sometimes you just need physical contact. Feels like people are shallower more than ever now even though they raise their personal tolerance social justice banner in public, hypocrites. haha. Man, the only guys who have ever dated me have been right wing. My friends would have called them ignorant and racist (they are very left wing). But hey, they are open minded enough to actually date me so... who is the bigoted one? ahhh, thanks... I think?\n\nI hookup with people quite often and I do not feel bad and objectified by it. Most guys I hook up with just want sex and it is not a height thing. I find being sexually objectified in this way, refreshing. It is better than being an object of pity or ridicule or just considered ASexual - which is more common.\n\nDo you not think some guys could want to fuck me because I have got great tits and a great ass? You think that is impossible?\n\nWaiting around for some magic guy to come along and see 'you for you' is the privilege of average looking women.

Woke blokes talk a lot of shit about how open minded they are, but in practice... lol. Not at all. Sorry, from your post it made me think you were looking for more than just hook-ups. I had my fair share of those in college, and I do not think there is anything wrong with that. As far as Trump supporters, please see current events. I do want a partner. I would love a family. That is what my original post was about. We have just drifted into another facet of the 'dating' conversation. At which point you implied no one would want to fuck me unless they had a dwarf fantasy. \n\nI am following the political situation over there. Trump is a dangerous asshole and is threatening western democracies all over the world.\n\nLiberals are just really annoying and full of shit. Still, if I voted, I would vote democrat. I was devastated when Elizabeth Warren was out of the primaries. I was not trying to say nobody would want to fuck you, unless they have a dwarf fantasy. I just know that there are sickos out there who view little people as an item to check off their bucket list, and I do not want that for you.

That is something I was planning, but was told that it may make them less \"independent.\" So I was unsure. I would always try to make them independent no matter what and show them how to thrive in a world made for a different stature...I just want them to grow up positively. I just thought a nice space, made just for them, would be relaxing and comforting for them.\n\nBasically I just want them to be at home and comfortable. What can I do besides love them, to make them be comfortable and happy? \n\nI am interested in a child of any age, I do not care from where. But if I do get an older child, I am already worried about schooling. We have an awesome school here that is just child and teacher that meet once a week and then the child works from home. I own my own business so they can always come to work with me and I am flexible with whatever...but I am reading that children with dwarfism today are not having that much of a problem with bullying? I guess it depends on the child/school. I know I did not have a great time in school and it scarred me a little. I do not want that for any child...Would it be best to put my child in a regular school or a private one as I stated earlier? Obviously, if my child has a preference I will go with that. Until then, I just want to know in your opinion what you would have preferred as a child, knowing what you do now.\n\nAnything you would have changed from your childhood that could have made you more comfortable? \n\nI guess I am just having trouble finding the middle ground between making them independent and coddling them? I know they can do whatever they put their mind to... I just want to make sure they thrive with me and at the same just feel the warmth of being \"home\".\n\nThank you for your time and any responses are so greatly appreciated. Thank you! ", "My friend who has Dwarfism, wants to start skateboarding with me! Do you think he will need a smaller board? I ask because foot placement is critical. I am afraid he might not be able to pop (smack the tail of the board down) and flick the nose of the board. \n\nHa very good friend of mine, but we do not usually talk about this sort of thing. \n\nI would appreciate any input! Not trying to be a smartass, but I actually believe due to his stature, he will have a lower center of balance, and thus be completely fine.  I have never heard of any LPs needing special boards.  /u/SmallManBigMouth, would you know anything that I do not on this? Well Im glaaaad u asked. I happen to be a former skater, worked at Eastern Boarder for a few years....etc. Anyway. the, ahem, *short* answer is need? no. I never used a mini until I was in my 20's. They gave them to me free to try and they were cool...but I grew up on a an average what 7.5 x 30\" (I think) or so deck. \n Being that I the same dwarfism (achondroplasia) as 2 professional skaters have, one being Jason Acu\u00f1a aka Wee Man of Jackass fame, and the amazing Pancho Moler ( who both used average decks, I would not say he \"needs\" a mini. \nHow tall would u say your buddy is? Oh and the lower center of balance thing? Im not sure...my friends always said this was true but my friends were not, uh, physicists. I never could tell, but I didnt fall down toooooo much. Well, a little . Awesome! Thanks much! He is probably 4'8 or so. I am terrible at judging hight so that is probably terribly inaccurate Im 4'7\" so I say just go for it dude! Yo yo", "SUPPORT DWARF ARCHERY STUDY BY WORLD ARCHERY \nDear Sir/Madam, \n\nAs a member of IDSF(\u0130nternational Dwarf Sports Federation), I would like to share a development with you.\nI have shared with you, previously, the developments in including short-posture archery in Paralympics. To refresh your memory, please find at the bottom the corresponding correspondence.\n\nI am happy to inform you that short posture archery has not been overlooked by the Paralympic Archery Committee even during the pandemic which has been a difficult time for everybody. \n\n \n\nThere is yet another development I also want to share with you. \n\n \n\nOn December 1st 2021, we had a Video Conference (VC) with Dominique OHLMANN (Chair of the WA Para-Archery Committee), Eric BENNETT (Member of Committee and Athletes) and Gizem G\u0130R\u0130\u015eMEN (Paralympian, 2008 Beijing Gold Medalist and former IPC Athletes Council Member). Here is some information about this online meeting: \n\n \n\nDuring the meeting, I first made a presentation about the importance of short postured people in archery. You can find the presentation attached. I advise you to read it before reading this mail further. The summary and the outcome of our meeting are as follows: \n\n \n\nThe most important thing to mention about the meeting without getting lost in detail was that the topics I have covered in the presentation were well-received.  \n\n \n\nThe most recent development in short-posture archery was the archery competition held as part of the World Dwarf Games in 2017. Everybody was impressed by the amount of participation and although it was just entertainment for some, competitors who attended have had the chance to prove their ability to compete in this field. The report prepared by Aric Smith is important too (you can find this report also attached). The competition, attendance and the report are significant achievements. \n\n \n\nIn our meeting, we\u2019ve shared ideas as to how we could include more short-posture athletes in archery. To ensure enrollment of short-posture athletes in archery, the participants suggested indoor (18m) archery events to better suit the shortness of their limbs as well as the morphology of their back musculature, not to mention other factors and technical details such as the size of paper targets, bending stiffness of bows and sight calibrations and other technical features adjustable to better suit the specific requirements of the athletes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWe have also agreed to hold an event in line with paralympic procedures, and use the data gathered from the organization to plan our next steps. The event will be held sometime between late 2022 and early 2023. Short posture archers will be invited and developments regarding this organization will be announced on the World Archery website. \n\n \n\nAnother issue we discussed was the size of our bows after we saw shots of Liam Smith (see. attachments) Participants inquired our bow lengths and informed us that a company, Hoyt, manufactures suitable sized equipment for short-posture archers.  \n\n \n\nLastly, in the meeting, I have shared our International Dwarf Sports Federation (IDSF) page with the participants. Upon looking at the member countries, I have stressed the need of communication between World Archery and IDSF affiliates, especially between archery federations and dwarfs\u2019 organizations. They\u2019ve promised to establish contact with these federations, reminding, also, the fact that such communication has to be bilateral in order to achieve our common goals. That you too, should be demanding in this regard is also important to note. \n\n \n\nYes, this is as much I can brief you about the meeting. \n\n \n\nArchery is a very rewarding sport for us. Some of the benefits it provides are that it preserves posture, adjusts and aligns the  spinal curvatures, strengthens the back and waist muscles during the pulling of the bow, increased condition as one walks during shots, increased focus, and it is a suitable sport for people of all ages, giving them the opportunity to compete for many years. \n\n \n\nI believe that this project is important for you, too. \n\n \n\nI also firmly believe that we have but another advantage, i.e., we have the numbers and many high-quality athletes as well.  \n\n \n\nAnyone wishing to become an archer can attain this goal in about 6 to 12 months and become an archer by-the-book.  \n\n \n\nI wholeheartedly believe that you will reconsider short-posture archery and share information on archery with your members and bring the matter up before your country\u2019s archery federation. \n\n \n\nLastly, please be advised that I am ready and willing to share my experiences as an athlete myself. \n\n \n\nHappy new year and best regards, \n\n \n\n \n\nUmut K\u00d6SEMEN \n\n \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Mr./Mrs./Ms. President; \n\n  \n\n \n\n    I am Umut K\u00f6semen, 45, from Turkey. I am suffering from Achondroplasia (Dwarfism). I have been involved in archery for 4 years under the tutorship of trainer Esen D\u00f6nmez. Since there is no classification for archers of short stature, I am unable to compete under the disabled category. To shortly summarize the reasons for my inability to compete; my physical performance fails me when I go out for a 70-meter open air range. Since my arms are short, my shooting range is also decreased. The harder I pull the string, the more serious a strain is put on my back, lower back and arms. On the other hand, at a distance of 70 meters, I have to raise the bow quite high in order to be able to see the target; yet, since the stabilizer blocks the view from the sight, I am unable to see the target. Being unable to find the suitable equipment also makes things even more difficult for me. All of the above causes discrimination on my side.  \n\n\n\n \n\n    I would like to share with you an important development concerning the inclusion of archers of short stature in paralympic archery.  \n\n\n\n \n\n    I had a meeting with Prof. Dr. U\u011fur Erdener, the President of World Archery Federation, on the 4th of April. I gave a presentation to him, explaining that essentially athletes suffering from dwarfism could compete at para-archery tournaments. He took great interest in the issue and listened to me carefully. \n\n \n\n \n\n     He got me to meet Secretary General of the World Archery Federation Tom Dielen and asked that I also give him a technical presentation. \n\n \n\n \n\n    I met with Mr. Tom Dielen on the 24th of May in Antalya where he was visiting on the occasion of the Archery World Cup Tournament. I told him about the World Dwarf Games 2017 and shared with him the reports by Dr. Aric Smith (USA 3rd Class Archer, NTS Coach, USA Official Archery Referee) and Kelly Chambers (NCCP Competition Development Coach). Mr. Dielen was quite impressed with the technical presentation which also included videos. He stated that he found what I explained to be quite reasonable and archers of short stature could compete at 30 meters in open air tournaments. Mr. Dielen also made a particularly significant point: If the IPC (International Paralympic Committee) were to decide to organize an event for archers of short stature, it would make perfect sense to let us compete at 30 meters. The tournament for the visually-impaired is held at 30 meters. If there was a demand for different distances, organizing tournaments at 80, 40 or 60 meters could pose an obstacle. Since the Committee is accustomed to the said distance, organizing a 30-meter tournament would be easy. He also stated that having target sheets of 80 cm instead of 60 cm would be much more sensible; but this was a technical detail open for discussion. In this sense, he stated that having a 30-meter competition was reasonable and expressed his gratitude for my offer concerning the organization of such an event. Mr. Dielen has also explained the procedures followed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and how a new classification should be introduced within paralympic archery. \n\n\n\n \n\nAfter this meeting; \n\n    Tom Dielen corresponded with the newly elected Chairman of the Para-Archery Committee Dominique Ohlmann and took steps to facilitate the communication between us. In our discussion with Mr. Ohlmann, he has stated that the issue was of a high priority in the agenda and the necessary works would be set in motion upon the first meeting to be held with the Para-Archery Committe. \n\n  \n\n    The more support we can get from as many countries as we can to get athletes of short stature to compete under the para-archery category, the better we would be able to promote the introduction of a new classification under the World Archery Federation.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n    Since our disability is of an innate nature and we have a high rate of young individuals among our population, I would like to exert with great confidence that we have a higher chance when compared with many other disabled groups. I am sure that your own country has its own communities made up of people of short stature, even with some having competed under different paralympic categories (athletics, equestrian, power lifting, swimming, table tennis and wheelchair tennis\u2026). I would like to ask, on behalf of athletes of short stature, why should archery not be included among the sports branches we compete in at the Paralympic Games? I believe that we deserve to be given a chance and I am sure that one day athletes of short stature will compete at the Paralympic Olympic Games under their own classifications. \n\n\n\n \n\n   As endorsed by Secretary General Mr. Tom Dielen, I hereby kindly ask for your opinion and letter of support to enable the competition of archers of short stature under their own classification. \n\n\n\n \n\n    I believe that you will approach the issue with sensitivity. \n\n\n\n \n\nKind regards, \n\nUmut K\u00d6SEMEN", "I am a nerd with a nerdy question, but I feel it is one that should be answered by this community to keep things PC. I hope this question is not too annoying and I sincerely apologize if it is, but, regarding fantasy worlds such as in Lord of the Rings, Dungeons and Dragons, World of Warcraft, etc... and this is important because I am writing one...\n\nHow does this community feel about mythical lore involving little people in modern society being descendants of dwarves and halflings from middle earth?\n\nAre there any other existing issues I am unaware of that little people have with mythical dwarves, halflings, gnomes, etc? I am cool with it. Sounds like a cool idea.  As an introvert who went into engineering I relate a lot to the fantasy dwarf stereotype anyway. I honestly love it. Its nice to see representation whether on TV or in books. Go for it! I do not mind just do not make it too stereotypical if that makes sense I like it because it shows representation for dwarfs but if they try to have someone who is not a dwarf play it then I am kind of mad but as long as it is not disrespectful or condescending I am fine", "\u00bfhow do i can meet a dwarf girl?

My cousin\u2019s birthday is coming up, and I wanted to get him special as it is a pretty significant one. I was wondering if anyone has found anything that is typically difficult to find that accommodates dwarfs (clothing, shoes, every day appliances). Thank you! Do not get him clothes or shoes because they will not fit. A front loading washing machine is a good appliance but I assume he already has one... Tbh, im not sure why his height would play into a gift idea. As I already mentioned before, he pretty much has everything and I would like to get him something that would be really unique and helpful for him. He is had a rough year with back surgeries as well, and I just want to help him feel as included as possible Is he feeling excluded? If so, what are the causes? This will help me think of a gift idea.", "App to meet others with similar conditions Hi!\n\nA group of people and I have considered developing an app for helping those with dwarfism, and we are hoping to get a little feedback on the usefulness of it. \n\nWe were thinking of a platform that enables you to find others nearby (using gps) who also deal with a similar disorder, communicate with each other and also organise events to go to together. It sounds really great; for those of us not involved with LPA-like organizations for whatever reason might not have a support group of people similar to us, having an app to fill that gap is an incredibly great idea!  The only problem I can think of would be people posing as dwarves using the app for whatever reason: sales (I could just see someone with an MLM seeing this as an untapped market), general bullying (general anonymity and an easy to spot vulnerability make our little community an easy target, no pun intended), or someone with a weird obsession towards dwarves who sees a way to meet some easily (unfortunately I have definitely been fetishized, and it is... incredibly uncomfortable, to be blunt).\n\nObviously there is going to be SOME sort of screening process.  I am just curious as to what the plans are to make that process rigorous enough to catch most of the pretenders, but lax enough that it is not going to be an undue burden on those of us that can provide proof of our dwarfisms One of the problems we thought of is exactly that - we would definitely have some form of authentication and making sure that the person genuinely has the condition that they are stating. \n\nWe would want it to be a platform and space that dwarves (and dwarves only) feel comfortable being on and not having to worry about other profiles being fake and so on.", "I am 4'8\" and have never received a diagnosis. Where do I belong? Can I call myself a \"Little Person\"? I am 34 years old and I have always been extremely small. I would say that I stopped growing at about age 9. I am only 4'8\" and I am very small framed with small hands and feet. When I was about 16 years old, I saw a specialist, had an MRI, x-rays and blood tests and the specialist told me that I \"was a mystery\" and I was left with no answers other than that. This combined with my parents mantra that \"There is nothing wrong with you so why keep pressing the issue?\" made me try to ignore my size and made me feel like if I found an answer then there might \"be something wrong with me\". I realize now that was internalized ableism and it took me a really long time to learn how to love my body and love my size. So that is partly why I am 34 and I still do not know. I do know that I want to learn to accept myself more and figure out my place in this world better, if that makes any sense.\n\n When I was pregnant with my daughter, my OBGYN really tried to push genetic testing on me, and to be honest at the time it made me feel very uncomfortable because I felt like it was a questioning of whether I should be passing on my genes. So I did not have any genetic testing. The whole experience has made me hesitant to ask my doctor now for genetic testing as well. But I have had people ask me if I am a little person my entire adult life, and because I have never had a diagnosis, I have never felt like I could call myself a little person. Can I refer to myself as a \"little person\"? Or does it require a diagnosis? \"Dwarfism is a medical or genetic condition that usually results in an adult height of 4'10\" or shorter, among both men and women, although in some cases a person with a dwarfing condition may be slightly taller than that. The average height of an adult with dwarfism is 4\u20190, but typical heights range from 2\u20198 to 4\u20198.\"  \n\n\n\n\nI suppose you could consider yourself a little person just based on your height. Though anything more than that if you have any concerns about your health, best to consult with your doctor. Im not a doctor and there certainly arent any able to give one without meeting said doctor in person. To be technically considered to have dwarfism, you would most certainly need an actual diagnosis. Is it possible you are? Does your height fall into the general median of consideration? Yes. However, some people are just shorter than others without having dwarfism . I would be very surprised if you made it to 34 as a dwarf without having a doctor make that diagnosis. Most, as in very almost all people with dwarfism, have some kind of expert they have seen as a child frequently, or still do.\nMy advice, if you would like to know for sure , is to see a specialist , they will be able to tell you what very specific type (among the many) you may or may not have.", "Videos from the 2017 World Dwarf Games ", "Whisper Challenge with my sister, who also has dwarfism :) ", "a question from a non-dwarf when i was a kid (probably age 6-11ish) i went to school with a girl who had a heart transplant as an infant, and as a result was about three feet tall and not expected to grow any taller. would she be considered a dwarf, or are dwarves specifically people with a genetic mutation from birth? i hope this question is not disrespectful! I dunno, that does not really make sense from my limited scientific knowledge--I do not think a heart transplant can stunt your growth like that even if it happened as an infant. Are you sure she did not already have dwarfism? People are considered to have dwarfism if they are:\n\nMale &lt; 5'1\", Female &lt; 4'10\"\n\nThe cause of the short stature actually does not matter. it is essentially an arbitrary medical definition.\n\nMost people under these heights have a pathology that causes the short stature, as in, they have achondroplasia or something else.\n\nSome people are just short due to their genetic lineage, for example Pygmy tribes.\n\nSome people can also be short due to childhood illness, injury or malnourishment.\n\nBasically, lot's of things impact human growth.\n\nI would recommend not using the term 'dwarf' as a noun. It implies people with dwarfism are an entirely different race or something, rather than just very short people. It is easier to understand what dwarfism (extreme short stature) is when you understand it to be a symptom of many different conditions rather than a condition in itself. i am actually unsure, i was under the impression that it was just because of the heart transplant. I agree.  I have seen people with significant medical issues, NOT dwarfism, who have stunted growth but no where to this degree and they often achieve \"average\" height. \n\n3 feet is on the very short side of things even for those with dwarfism. For the last part, basically it is, \u201cI have a form of dwarfism\u201d and not, \u201cI am a dwarf\u201d. That is the safe way to approach the issue, although it is true that some people do not mind being thought of as a dwarf. It is an individual preference. I went to primary school with a girl who would had a kidney transplant and stopped growing in height. We were told that the anti-rejection medication stunted her growth. She had other visible side effects as well. I cannot be sure, but I have heard this explanation for the late actor Gary Coleman\u2019s short stature. I am strictly NOT a doctor; you could also post this question on one of the subreddits related to things medical. I hope this helps you. No not really what would be considered a dwarf is someone who was born with dwarfism", "question about accessible toys?  Because of my skeletal stuff, I have a hard time reaching downstairs in a way that lets me use sex toys easily. I have heard through the grapevine that there are extenders for toys, so you can grip them easier if your arms are too short, but I have not been able to find any. Does anyone have any idea where I could find something like that, or otherwise short-arm-friendly toys? I am tired of hurting myself and pulling muscles over this. My issue is that of declining flexibility as I age - very different from your situation and by no means am I making light of yours.  I mean nothing but respect.  Fundamentally, however, it is quite similar, as I was never really flexible to begin with.  Reaching 40 years old has not helped that.  I will watch here for answers as well.  Thank you for asking this.\n\n(submitted with respect towards the Original Poster) Might be worth sending this company an email enquiry.

The kid has a history of abuse and because he was nice one time, the little girl with achondroplasia should let him be part of her playtime space?

No, that is messed up. Teaches the kid that he can be an ass all his life but redeem himself with only one act of kindness. No. Not how it works. Exactly.

Well, what should we do when this happens?  We cannot just go work 'regular' jobs, but we are still labeled as able bodied.  I am thinking there should be a default income we can receive even if we do not have jobs.  How much I have paid in taxes over the 20 years that I have worked should secure some type of income, if I lost my job. \u201c even blacks can flip burgers\u201d that was random.

Racist people may not hire blacks.  So they can move to less racist places. But they can still reach everything. We PHYSICALLY cannot help our own physical disabilities, so it is universal for us.

What I said is racism will not be tolerated , that is why I asked you first to clarify.  If I had just deleted it without asking , that would be more a kin to silencing you.  \n\nOut of curiosity, did you have to deal with customers in your last job that you lost? I have not lost any job, and yes I have had to deal with customers.  Even had customers that hated me because I was short and would ask for a taller person. The low population that we are a part of ensures that we do not get a defined voice for us.  I cannot believe everyone is just fine with this.  I am very lucky to have my computer programming job, but I have to look at my dwarf son and feel anger and fear for his future.   I cannot blame the companies nor the dwarfs, I do blame the government, if they do not recognize that we cannot get jobs because we physically cannot do them, then we deserve a living income. Or else let us create jobs in the government or private that would guarantee us employment Ive worked i will kinds of retail jobs for just about 30 years almost, I have never had to deal with anything that blatant.Where are you working with that happened? I live in America, is that where this job was too? Just wondering if it is a cultural difference in different countries where there is more prejudice against dwarfism? I have worked many retail jobs as well, especially grocery.   Let us take for example, stocking the shelves at night.  Unless you are really not a dwarf, you and your team would see how much longer the process takes you, and how unacceptable it is due to the other team members speed and opening the store on time. And I am in America. So it was someone you worked with that hated you and asked specifically for a taller person?! Did you try bringing it up your boss, or another higher up? Failing that, HR would have to address feelings of prejudice.\n\nOh, and was the \u201cwanting a talker person\u201d related to stocking shelves in a grocery? Are you serious?  No, it is about the store opening on time with stocked shelves.   It is no fault of the store or the team members, it created a huge amount of extra time because I would have use a step stool for everything.  Ya, sure maybe I should have told HR that I need OT I guess for my slowness?   I do not think you are listening or you work in a very 'short' aisle environment. That is interesting...in the UK I qualify for disability. I thought achondroplasia (and over 4ft) qualified in the US too, since that guy (Hank?) who was on Howard Stern\u2019s show had achondroplasia and got disability payments. Pretty sure he was over 4ft as well This is news to me that dwarfism does not qualify as a disability in America. That is crazy to me. I live in the UK and I am eligible for PIP (Personal Independence Payment) though I do not currently take it because I have a well paying job.\n\nIn general it sounds like how the US government treats disabled people is fucked up. The UK could still be much better too, do not get me wrong, but still... This is good, the dude that told me I was too mean and that he wants to ignore me shows up in this thread.  I am glad the UK works that way. Glad you showed up to this thread after I was too mean to you. You know what man, forget I asked, I was just trying to be friendly after getting off on the wrong foot.\n\nPS, I did not downvote you. No, I did not say you were too mean. Ironically, I told you that you did not listen to what I said.\n\nBut yeah, just keep putting words in my mouth I guess. Who needs a real conversation anyway. Who needs a conversation?

We are so depreciated in society that we need people to rise up now, just like black people and women have people who are actively voicing up about their ill treatment, this is not going to get better until we have some very loud voices, and knowing that our population segment is so minimal, it is going to take some louder voices. -sigh-\n\nSince when is telling people to stop treating us like shit and constantly pointing out the injustices we face \u201cbeing silent\u201d? How is standing up for myself- whether that is getting in someone is face or even physically confronting someone \u201cbeing silent\u201d? You know I have literally floored a guy who tried to manhandle me? I am not fucking about here.\n\nStop saying I am doing nothing when you literally have no idea what I do in my life and then tell me to do things that I am already doing, it is infuriating. And you have the nerve to say we need a movement and in the same breath you advocate for suicide and abortions when it comes to little people.... it is absurd. I think you are doing things to help us, absolutely.  However, we need more of a union and more people coming out of the shadows to object to how we are treated.  We need extremists, I did say I advocate for dwarfs to commit suicide and people have abortions if they knew they were having a dwarf.  This is because life is insanely difficult for us, and that the hate towards us is treated as just a joke.  Every medical procedure is for average people, we are a medical mystery.  I feel it to be utterly irresponsible to bring a dwarf into this world, now if we get some extremists to voice our ill treatment and it goes somewhere I would totally change my views.  I am not advocating a genocide per se, I am just trying to prevent the unnecessary ridiculous suffering of people who never asked for it. The fact that you have a son with achondroplasia and think this way just boggles my mind man.  Speaking as someone who was suicidal when I was 17, I also definitely understand that. I think from that experience, and the decision not to go through with it, is what makes me want to fight for people - both dwarfs and non-dwarfs - realising that our lives are worth living. Because they are. \n\nI am so glad I never went through with it, and I genuinely enjoy my life a lot now, but it does still come with a lot of pain and hardship that we should not have to put up with. \n\nSo I do get where you are coming from, but I definitely want to be the voice that brings people away from thinking they are better off dead, because I think that is rarely the case.  I am an atheist, and I am not against suicide in general, I have just learned from first hand experience that suicide can seem like the best option when it is really not - for a lot of people.\n\nFor those who experience debilitating conditions, chronic physical pain, and other factors severely limiting their quality of life, in extreme cases like those where no reframing of perspective can help their suffering - then yes, I think it is totally fair.\n\nBut I honestly believe that for the vast majority of little people, who have less debilitating forms of dwarfism (like achondroplasia) that is not the case. Even when it feels like it (and I know that feeling all too well). So many people I know love being a dwarf, and love their lives. The people I have talked to who hate it are a really small minority in the dwarf community. That alone tells me that a life with dwarfism does not need to mean a life of suffering. I do not suffer. I experience assholes, and discrimination, for sure, but  I am not \u201csuffering\u201d and I have so much more going on in my life that I cherish.\n\nFacing discrimination, prejudice, mockery, pain... these are not small things, and it is important that these hardships are acknowledged and fought against whenever possible, but living with these things does not mean a life is only suffering. There is enough goodness out there for any little person to find. I genuinely believe that.  Never said \u201cshould not be allowed\u201d. I think every person should be allowed to commit suicide if they wish, let us just get that out the way.\n\nAnd yes both physical and mental pain should both be treated the same.. I agree with you on that. I was referring to pain that is still chronic, severe and persists even after all possible treatments have been exhausted. And with mental pain - in SO many cases - suicide is chosen *before* the equivalent is explored for mental pain. So, if a little person actually goes through therapy, reaches adulthood and fully tries to confront their own struggles, to see if they can find a constructive way forward.. if they explore all avenues and still suffer so much they would rather be dead? Then ok. Fair enough. Some people find that how they operate mentally is not compatible with adjusting in that way, and that is okay. I just think it is exceptionally rare.\n\nI just worry that an *advocation* for suicide will lead to people who could find happiness killings themselves prematurely. I probably would not be here today if that was the case. And just thinking that thought just breaks my heart, honestly.  Like I said, before all avenues are explored in seeking mental help and support. Therapy, possibly even medication (if you get anxiety or agoraphobia for example). I would also say reaching adulthood is important - specifically finishing school/college. When you are so young, that is all you know and it completely warps your perception of what the rest of life will be like. For me, when I was 17, I had no ability to comprehend how my life could change. I did not think I could ever work a normal job, be financially independent, or have a circle of friends who saw me for who I am. I did not think any of that was possible. But I now know that they all came true. I am not saying every little person is guaranteed to have the same, but to kill yourself before you even find out? That is premature to me. Have you ever applied for disabilty?   I do not think you would be a failure to society. People who think that are not worth the time, truly. A decent society member recognizes that people with disabilities may not be able to work at all, and if they can, their work years might be cut short for various reasons. They also recognize that every able bodied person is one tragic accident away from being disabled, which is morbid to keep in mind but does bring forth empathy.\n\nObviously section 504 of the rehabilitation act provides some protections to the LP community as well.\n\nSocial security is attainable by many, but may be a fight. Just do not give up when that time comes. \nSorry to call you out here but what do you think the world owes you? What do you think life should be? free and easy? \n\nWhat should a little person do when they lose their job? The same thing everyone else does, get a new job, gain a new skill, become valuable to society through continuous learning and development. In regards to employment, think about what you can provide others and have the confidence and ability to execute. The fact that you are making a post on Reddit tonight means you have access to the internet, start learning. If manual jobs are excruciating on your body, do not do them. You can live a life and make a great living from a laptop if you wanted and only move your fingers a few inches. That being said, that all spawns from your goals and desires, if you think the worlds got it out for you, then your fucking yourself before you started. \n\nWe all pay taxes, we all do not get hand outs. Are you physically unable to provide for yourself? Do you have medical expenses that are causing you undue hardship? If so, apply for disability. That is what it is there for.\n\nYou want life to be easier for someone with a disability keep advocating for equal rights in the public. That being said, we do have it a bit harder and that is okay, acknowledge it and move on, use your differences as a strength where possible. I know many little people who do.\n\nTake some ownership in your life instead of saying fuck this, fuck that, fuck the world. You have kids, as a parent your job is to teach them to be resilient, resourceful, and self sufficient. Life is hard, it is also beautiful if you work for what you want.\n\nYou brought your kids in to this world, now help them thrive in it and push them to achieve, explore, and make their own happinesses. \n\nTalking openly about suicide with a child and not pushing them to seek help because of your own personal views is irresponsible and frankly being a negligent parent it. \n\nIf my parents were unhappy and when I was going through the ringer growing up and my parents said do not try, I would not be where I am today, happy, and with a great life. \n\nMany people with disabilities and much worse circumstances than yours make a positive impact in society and have a great life regardless of the cards they are dealt. Helen Keller? Nelson Mandela?\nSteven Hawking? \n\nLife\u2019s challenging for everyone, we have it a little more challenging, but hey, if we are willing to work at and ask for help when it is needed, life can be great.  The ability to deny jobs that are undesirable in my view for me personally comes from learning and obtaining the skills and experiences that have allowed me to seek other opportunities that are better suited? \n\nYou and only you control that and are responsible for that. \n\n\u201cBut people need to get whatever job they possibly can, for survival\u201d, if that is your view on work, well\u2026. I do not know what to tell you.\n\nPeople do not need to get any job that comes at them, if that is how your operating then your going to be left in a shit job that you hate and are there out of insecurity. That does not sound great. \n\nHow are you funnelled only into a job you can perform? Maybe it is the only jobs you are going after? What prevents you from being an office admin? a sales representative? a police dispatcher? A CEO? You do know that many LPs hold high ranking jobs in all different industries, were they funnelled into those as well? Or did they just own their success and do something about it vs complaining?\n\nThe jobs you probably cant do: be a starting NBA center\u2026il give you that one\n\nAlso, you are questioning my life as someone born with achondroplasia because i do not see the world through a  \u201cwoah is me\u201d , \u201cI am helpless\u201d lens\u2019s? I can assure you I am an LP and additionally many folks with disabilities do not share your views.\n\n You seem overly confident that your view is universal  Yeah, i did not disagree with that. ...You know that everyone needs help to reach power lines, right?

We are human too and deal with with everyday issues.  Check out my blog!  (", "Making a video on disability and your opinion is vital Hello there. Recently I have started a YouTube channel revolving around stoicism. Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that originated from Greece and is based around what is in your control and what is not. There are other points, but this to me is the main one.\n\nI am passionate about stoicism and want to reach all audiences, particularly those affected by disabilities or impairments of any kind.\n\nNow it has to be said, I do not have a disability or impairment. Clearly I may be incorrect in what I presume the difficulties are of having one, my presumptions may be wrong.\n\nWhich is where you come in.\n\nMy arguement for how stoicism can help with disabilities is that suffering, pain, frustration at life, all things we feel to some degree now and then, are felt most of the time, or some of the time, or even none of the time (as you can see, I need your help on this) by disabled people. What I want to say is that, because disabled people are more likely to be angry for losing a limb, being born blind, or going blind, or deaf, they are more likely to encounter frustrations and annoyances at either lack of mobility, lack of societal integration, or frustration at just fate itself. My point is, the obstacle is the way in stoicism. The more you are exposed to these kinds of thinking, which typically people who are lucky enough to be healthy do not think of often, the more obstacles you are able to rise above, the better equipped you are at life for dealing with problems or issues.\n\nNow, I can understand that this might get a number of different reactions, but please understand I am willing and eager to learn and improve my knowledge and will almost definitely integrate what you have said into the video I am planning on making.\n\nIf you do not want to post a response, please message me!

My arthritis has made it impossible for me to finally get better than Brian May.  Oh the humanity!  Seriously, my hands being small and arthritic, I never really got good and fast at bar chords.  But that is more due to my other health problems than the smallness of my hands--I have seen kids with smaller hands than mine play bigger guitars quite well.    \n\n\nAnyway I need to sell it so it can be loved, lightly lemon oiled, and given new strings from time to time.  It will come with a case and some extra strings and I do not know for sure what else that I will manage to find before I ship it. It has a strap that works for a LP.   It is a lovely guitar and has really developed a sweet sound as it has aged.  It is not heavy.  I should tell you about the time I bought a banjo not realizing that this is an instrument for very strong people.  It is heavy, not very well balanced, and has a loooong neck, sorta like a bass guitar.  \n\n\nI had a student Yamaha guitar as my first guitar and movers crushed it.  It sounded better than it had any right to sound, too, and I have missed that guitar.    \n\n\nI tried a mandolin but it took too much left hand finger strength to make chords.    \n\n\nSend me a private note if you are interested, and we can both look up what it is worth and work something out.

Are there any other modifications you would love in your home that I have not listed?\n\nAgain, thank you so much for any and all responses! I have lost several inches in height due to spine problems.  And I was right on the edge of being a Little Person before that.  Here are some really hard things for me:  \n\n\n1.  I cannot reach the handles of my kitchen sink.  The sink is too high, and also too far from the front to the handles.  I get soaking wet every time I try to do something in the kitchen.  I love cooking.  But it is not doable really.    \n\n2. The dishwasher is actually too LOW.  I cannot reach the back of the lower rack.  And the way it is installed now, which is to say badly, i.e. not anchored properly, the thing tips forward if I pull the lower rack out far enough to reach it.  The guy who installed it would not listen to me.  My husband thinks I could do more housework despite this kind of thing.  \n\n3. I cannot reach the bottom of the washing machine.  Oh, if it were set six inches down into the floor.  I have coordination issues and a step up would get me hurt a lot.    \n\n4. These things get harder with every week that goes by, with back and joint pain and coordination issues.   I get what you might call a ration of s\\*\\*\\* for not being able to cook. I guess that is all I am good for now.  A kitchen and laundry room that is usable might make me useful again.  I do not think even that would promote me to the status of a human being again. Height of tables and cupboards are not really the issue, you can overcome that with step stools. The issue is the depth of benches (front to the back) key would be to measure the arm reach and base your building off that. Not many LP's adapt a house to suit as it affects resale of the home as new owners have to re model the kitchen back to average persons usage. Would you like something temporary that would allow the countertops to be a better height? I.E. a platform with a ramp that could be removed before selling the home, like this: \n\nAlso, if you had a 2 story apartment, would you prefer to have stairs and an elevator or ramps to go between floors? I am hoping to future proof the home if the couple may have to use a wheelchair in the future. Yes a platform would be good. Have had one installed previously in a home. For a 2 story apartment, stairs would be suited however you could design an area that is built as hall cupboards that can be converted into a lift shaft in the future if it is needed.

Something id add is an extension to pull them down as we normally have shorter arms too.\n\n3: if the dishwasher is on the floor no issues for me and microwave should be on the countertop, does not have to be lowered although i think in thd US you guys have things different.\n\n4: for me this doesnt matter, both is equally as easy\n------\u2010---------\n\n1: yes to a bathtub. An issue is stepping in and out of it due to the short legs.

I saw this question come up and I would like to understand. Are there dating websites? Local Reddits for your city? \n\nMy partner had a colostomy bag and and I wondered if there were dating websites for this. I understand they are completely different cases, but felt there was a similarity. \n\nAlso, if this is offensive or not okay to ask, please let me know. I aim to be respectful and am just genuinely curious. Like, someone of average height looking to only date a little person? That feels more like a fetish. NO, someone with dwarfism Dating websites for us generally end up being 90% horny dudes with a fetish from what I have seen.  Sucks but it is what it is.\n\nLPA does some social events at the national con. Other than that, I have not seen much. also thank you for asking this so I can update my post Oh phew I am glad I asked lol! thank you, I could not see a good website for this. As with everything, there is ALWAYS going to be two minds on this topic:\n\n* It is a Fetish.\n* Everyone needs love.\n\nHere is my point of view. I am an average-sized guy, 5'7\" and I am happily married to the most amazing lady in the world. She also just happens to have dwarfism (she is 3'11\"). \n\nI was not looking for a little person. I think it would be kind of weird to go looking for someone with dwarfism (specifically) to date, much in the same way it would be weird to go looking for a bald black lady or a super tall lady. Love people for who they are. Their personality. Voice. Laugh. Intelligence. The way they make you feel, not for what they look like. \n\nWhen we first began talking, I was aware of my wife's height and dwarfism, but I was attracted to her personality. I loved her smile. I believe when you are attracted to someone because of WHO THEY ARE (as apposed to their body), you will naturally love the way they look. \n\n\\- We dated for almost 4 years before we got married.\n\nOf course I am aware that she is a little person. I am aware that others may notice us when we walk together. I know that certain adaptations need to be made to our home, such as the shower has two holding brackets for the shower head, or our plates get put down low instead of high. It is life. I rarely think of it. \n\nI also do not look at her any different. She is my wife and amazingly beautiful. Yes I do appreciate the length of her legs and find them to be sexy. It is ***not*** a fetish, I simply find her legs sexy because it is **my wife's legs**. I think that is natural. While dwarfism does impact much of what she can do, it does not define who she is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* As a species, we tend to find those we love as attractive. \n\nSo yeah, if you want to date someone with dwarfism, do it. But do it because you want to date them, not because you want to date someone with dwarfism. Aw this is sweet Yeah. As a 3'11\" woman myself, I really appreciate this post.  Thanks for writing it. I have looked at LP dating sites. From what I can tell they get hijacked by people just looking to post troll profiles and make dwarf jokes. \n\nI think the most likely way to meet other LPs for dating is to find them on Facebook or maybe even on Reddit. Problem is, people tend to be super defensive on Facebook. I see a lot of posts from LP women, bitching about LP guys trying to hit on them over messenger. \n\nI personally do not understand why this is such a bad thing. It is hard to meet people when you look different and it is fair of people to try. The guys could try being a little more charming and less sleezy though...\n\nArgh, whatever. Life's hard. Ratings hard. Most people are just trying their best. As a straight LP guy I have just given up.  Life is hard enough without constantly having your fears of being undateable confirmed. Where do you live? Not too far from NYC I thought there were better attitudes and more dating opportunities in th US. Also, you are quite tall for an LP which would really help. Are you involved with the LPA? I have very rarely encountered overt discrimination or prejudice outside of dating specifically, so compared to the rest of the world I guess attitudes are better.  From what I have seen, LP women generally do ok here dating-wise.   Unfortunately, here most women insist on their guys being taller than they are, it is a very strong social prejudice.  Dating apps have made this even worse.  Even trying in person, the worst a girl can say is not no, it is \"eww\".  The looks of disgust I got when I was still trying still haunt me.\n\nI never was really involved with LPA because I really did not want to feel like I was defined by what I was rather than who I was.  Probably a mistake looking back but it is what it is. Yeah. No I actually really understand where you are coming from. I was never really involved with any LP stuff in Australia and I probably should be. It is odd that our height is soooo defining. But it is. \n\nAttitudes in Australia and the UK are far worse. I have experienced an horrendous amount of harrassment due to my size. I have even had stuff so bad I have had to report it to the police. \n\nI am a woman. Quite attractive. Very outgoing with a very active social scene but I have found dating in Aus next to impossible. My likability seems to be ringfened to a-sexual relationships only.  I even find hookups hard to come by which is outrageous.\n\nI have had the \" factor quite a bit from guys here. Usually a group of guys will point me out and then they will start telling the shortest one to ask me out and he will get really embarrassed and then make a \"I am not a peado\" joke. So clearly there are some cultural hangups  getting in my way.\n\nAnyway. You should totally get involved with the LPA and leverage the \"tall\" LP thing. You also sound articulate and decent which is a bonus. \n\nI would love to have the opportunities American LPs do. Take advantage of them.

I went to the gp and asked if i may have a type of dwarfism. He measured me and confirmed as my first blood test was at 30 , it was likely I had suffered with hashimotos for much longer than from 30 when I was diagnosed.

Health issues unrelated to my dwarfism went undiagnosed for ages...I think if you are young they just automatically think nothing is wrong with you. How long were you at birth? Are you much shorter than your family? I (for all intents and purposes) self-diagnosed at 29 after realizing that SEDc did not make any sense and then subsequently spending countless hours on PubMed. Dunno I was small and they even thought I would stopped growing - we suspect my thyroid was dodgy from the get go - I have always been known as nap master general and was tiny, much shorter than my peers.

One of my characters is a Dwarf and I felt at this point I should seek some advice to see what Little People think of this character. \n\nThe book is a fantasy. It is also a parody and satire. It parodies other books and satirises our world. It is about a very generic fantasy quest (think LOTR) to vanquish an evil fairy queen, but the quest is broadcast on magic mirrors as a reality tv show. The main character is transgender (I am too) and good representation of LGBTQIA is important to me. There are also Black characters, Latinx characters, Asian characters, etc. \n\nAnd I have a Dwarf woman. \n\nIt is a comedy, so I have a few jokes in the book about Dwarves, but these are all about fantasy Dwarves. For instance, my fantasy race Dwarves all have Scottish accents. \n\nMy main question: I have had to distinguish between fantasy race Dwarves and humans with dwarfism in my novel. I did this by saying human Dwarfs are singular Dwarf and fantasy Dwarves are singular Dwarv. Is there any issue with this I have not foreseen?\n\nThe reality tv show producers will not let any human Dwarfs in the shows; they think it would confuse people to have human and non-human Dwarfs (and Dwarves) on the show. So Kirsty has to pretend to be a non-human Dwarf. She has a really bad Scottish accent, and a fake beard. She also does not like ale or porridge and is always reading. It is not very long before she gets outed by some fantasy Dwarves who say she is butchering their accent. \n\nAnd after that, she stays on the show and her friends accept her. \n\nThere is one height joke in the book, where the barbarian warrior (he is 6 ft 5) claims his dick is longer than she is tall (she is 4 ft tall) and she says it is not, and he asks her if she is been looking. Those two characters end up dating at the end of the book. \n\nDoes any of this seem problematic or offensive? As I said, I have mostly kept the jokes to being about fantasy race Dwarves, and about the Scottish nature of them (I am Scottish, so I can mock us as much as I want). \n\nAlso, one of my beta readers suggested Little People would not be able to spend all day riding ponies on a fantasy quest (it is not all day, they break for lunch, but it is a good part of the day). I did not think this was accurate, but I thought I would ask. \n\nFinal question. I am trying to get together some money (I am a student, and very poor, and trying to pay for an expensive transition so it is not easy to get together some money) to pay a Little Person to read the book and see if anything is an issue (sensitivity read). I am not sure when I will have the money to do that (or even how much it would cost) but if you have any experience doing this or any interest in doing this, let me know, and hopefully we can come to some kind of arrangement. And if you are very observant, and you noticed this was not a question despite me calling it one, you are exactly the kind of person I would like to hear from. The book is not totally ready yet, like I said, I am currently getting some beta feedback and editing parts. It will be ready soon. We are human beings, in the 21st century here and now, who share a characteristic that gives us health concerns, singles us out socially, and can make us a little sensitive to stuff like this.  Maybe you can understand that.  We are not a fantasy race with pluses and minuses.    \n\n\nThis is hurtful to me at least.  I do not know if everyone will feel that way. &gt; Maybe you can understand that.  \n\nI absolutely can. The entire first sentence, about health concerns and being singled out socially, can be applied to being trans too, so I absolutely can understand that, and its why I asked instead of just sending my book to an agent. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and reply. Im  a huge nerd so fantasy stuff i love but honestly jokes about be short are great because it gives permission to make savage jokes about them back. And with the jokes its all about context to tell whether they are trying to have fun or be a douche. If its fun ill usually give it back. \n\nI think LP could ride it just depends on the specific person. Id just note that the next few hours they are joints were stiff &amp; sore usually clears in an hour of rest.

Id just note that the next few hours they are joints were stiff &amp; sore usually clears in an hour of rest.

I will make sure to mention the stiffness after riding. \n\n Thank you for taking the time to read this and reply. Thanks for taking the time to ask. Might be a good idea to look into the symbolic idea of a little person, and how it was the first and easiest \u2018unique\u2019 human proportional art within developing civilizations, and the easiest to stay alive within deterioration of such civilizations.  \n\nWithin the lowest contrast of record keeping, little people were the easiest symbol that wasnt of war and birth, but a new, often difficult step in evolution only in hunter gatherer tribes affording such mundane ritualism. Therefor, novelty. \n\n Thank you. Going To take me a bit to read this, but the introduction is fascinating so I am looking forward to the rest of it. I feel if you use this as a starting point and attempt to put yourself in a littlepersons shoes within this era, youll be able to experience where the difficulties beyond societies definition of physical handicap lie. Personally I feel the conflict of prolonged silence possibly mutated with humanities artistic impression through science fiction and fantasy holds great pain.  \n\nImagine a brute soldier coming across a dwarf, and stating a complete assumption. Would it be easier for the dwarf to crash like water on rocks to define himself, or flow like the nile river mapping the understanding of others impression of dwarfism onto themselves, and playing with it like a jedi mind trick. &gt;  Latinx characters\n\nYou will no sell in Latin America if you keep that. If I keep the character, or the word Latinx? \n\nThe word does not appear anywhere in my book, I used it here because I thought that was the preferred way of referring to people from Latin countries. At least, this is what I have been told by some (US) Americans. That is the issue. Americans have created and imposed the word, not Latin Americans. It is a westernized concept that is not necessarily welcomed by the community. \n\nFilipinos have the same problem. Filipino is already considered a gender neutral term, but because Filipino amd Filipina get used western societies have been trying to use Filipinx, with pushback from the Filipino community. Ah, right. Thank you. I think it is important to clarify that for the most part these are words that are emerging from Latin/Filipino-American communities though, not white American ones, so I think we should be cautious in making absolute statements about the validity of the words. I know Filipinx people who prefer the term. It is especially popular I think at the intersection of the queer community and the Filipinx community. For non-binary Filipinx people for example, having a gender neutral word is a blessing. \n\nI do not mean to say it is the only correct word or that using the word Filipino is wrong (as a white person, that would be presumptuous of me), but I know it also has its place in certain Filipinx communities. I imagine this is likely also true for the term Latinx. I see. While I cannot speak for either community I have mostly heard pushback from even my pretty woke Filipino friends. As someone with experience being a dwarf (pretreatment) and or average height (post treatment), I can understand the positives and negatives of this. Some jokes may come off as hurtful, ignorant, or patronizing, whereas others may make valid commentary, humor, or whimsy. Personally I think it is all how it is framed. I very much so recommend looking at Toph from ATLA for direction on how to write this sort of state of being into a character. Jokes are made at the expense of her disability, and it is never tiptoed around, but it frames her disability not as a disability but a positive trait. By writing your character who has abilities others do not because of her height and how she has had to adapt may make her a more realistic and stronger character, but acknowledging the natural limits someone with dwarfism can have can be used for the satire you desire. You will have to very careful with this though as it can be easy to insinuate that this character is somehow less than human because of her dwarfism, which is a harmful portrayal", "hi /r/dwarfism, among other things I am looking for clothes that fit and some things for my home life hi fellow dwarves (this the right term?

You accidentally applied to my original post instead of to my reply. Ok I do not know, we sort of have to live with the fact that we cannot be what we want to be.

You just get a lot more of the usual; laughing, name-calling, photos, being followed, people talking about you all the time and just being considered a 'big deal' whenever you walk into a room. Dating and romance are also next to impossible.  \n\n**I have traveled a lot and noticed that how we are treated varies a lot and is very cultural. Some observations:**  \n\n\n* The UK is worse day to day than Australia but you have more luck with dating and romance. You also have greater employment opportunities due to their funding of disability access services. If you get abused because of your dwarfism it is also recognized as a hate crime.\n* The US and Canada is usually pretty great. I also assume dating is better because I was hit on a fair bit there (I loved that). Not sure about employment barriers.\n* Spain, Italy, France, Germany. are all pretty good. As in you will not get much hassle in the street. I cant testify to romance opportunities but guys from those areas visiting Australia and the UK have all dated me, so I suspect it is better too. Not sure about employment barriers\n* South East Asia - generally no harassment unless I was in areas with a lot of white tourism, then it was pretty awful. Suspect employment barriers would be massive. Suspect dating would be bad. My whiteness and wealth did not help me out in the tourist areas, as in I was still considered a joke. I am not sure to what extent my whiteness and wealth helped me out in the non-touristy areas.\n* Japan - generally no harassment. everyone is very civil and polite. Unsure about employment barriers. Not sure about dating. Suspect it would be bad. \n* South Korea - generally no harassment. everyone is very civil and polite. Unsure about employment barriers. Not sure about dating. Suspect it would be bad.   \n\n\nDid anyone get any supporting or contrary experiences of this list? I would love to know your opinions about other countries! 22 M with Dwarfism here from Atlanta, Georgia. Culturally Atlanta is hit or miss. I have been ridiculed on the street before, but not very often. Employment opportunities are not great at all. Same goes for dating.\n\nI have also traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana, and had a much better experience with people there. They seem generally more respectful. Not sure about employment opportunities there, and in regards to dating I got hit on a few times while I visited for a weekend. \n\nI took a 5 day trip to Vegas, Nevada last year, and it was indifferent when it came to people for me. Everyone was just kind of doing their own thing. I am not sure about employment, but I imagine it would be difficult to make a living out there with how expensive everything is. Dating seems like it would be difficult as well.\n\nedit: a word I imagine dating in japan would be easy as a dwarf if you are handsome enough; the japanese love little things. I know I would be a sensation over there lol Lol. I want you to go and test the theory :)! This is SUPER interesting. I have only been to progressive states in the US so my experience is probably not reflective of a national experience. I have never been out of country, so I have no idea what it is like beyond the US. Malaysian here (F 28 4'3\"). Dating here is alright. There are some good ones, but they are not in abundance. A lot of Asian people will not date a person with a disability because of the 'breeding' prospects. Like if we breed, will our kids be normal, etc. It was something I struggled with with my ex. We dated for almost 3 years but I have never been formally introduced to his parents as his girlfriend. And the moment he hinted to them, they quickly asked about my breeding prospects. I have decided not to have kids of my own, but damn it hurts just to hear you are nor accepted because your kids will not be 'normal'. \n\nThen I left for the UK for a year to study and oh my god it was like being in candy land. I dont know which was more exciting to them; that I had dwarfism or that I was 'exotic'. Both insulting but hey, it gave me a big ocean and a reaaal good chance. I dated waaay more there and found a guy I fell in love with and vice versa. We were together until I was shipped back to Malaysia (because Brexit happened just as I graduated and companies were unsure if they should hire foreigners. Booooo). And then long distance broke us up. \n\nBut I got to say, white people judge less when it comes to disabilities. Im unsure about Australia. I have only been there once (Gold Coast) and it was a family vacation. I didnt get any name-calling or people acting mean though. Everyone seemed nice. And of course I get the usual stares but I get that everywhere.\n\nParis was good, Prague was a delight. Singapore was a bit meh. About the same as Malaysia but at least Malaysians have the balls to be rude to your face. in Singapore I felt like they would look okay but behind you they would insult you (but im biased because the war between Malaysia and Singapore is in my blood \ud83e\udd23). Taiwan is fine but Chinese people are prone to looooong stares. Like take a pic, it will last longer. Thailand is amazing. No issues there. Super nice people, local &gt; tourists for sure. But the more hidden the gem, the more stares from the locals of course (chiang mai/chiang rai. Phuket and Bangkok was the most 'normal' I have felt. From the locals. Tourists in Phuket and Bangkok are the worst). \n\nI have yet to visit the US or Canada so I will get back to you on that once I have replenished my bank account and when the pandemic is over \ud83e\udd23 Ah forgot. Employment opportunities for Malaysia is fine. If you hire a person with disability you get a tax subsidy, so they are pretty welcoming as long as you can do the work. Im mostly at my desk working in digital marketing but I get asked during interviews if I have my own car and if im okay with travelling (which is generally fine as long as I dont have to walk far). Where I have been, my companies have been accommodating to my condition. They usually ask me if I need a ride or if I need special parking or if I am okay taking stairs, etc. \n\nBut this is digital marketing where the furthest ill have to go is see a client. Im sure if its a more physically taxing job, it will be different. I think the mindset here (that I have heard from many company owners) is that if you can do the job, they dont care if you have disabilities. They will treat you the same. I have had no issues with bosses and co-workers (other than the usual work-arguments). OMG. This is a gold mine of information! \n\nYes, I found the tourists during my South East Asia trip just awful. Most of the the locals were great.\n\nI am interested in your experience dating in the UK as I really do not think I went hard enough at it. Did you use dating apps or was it more natural interaction that blossomed into romance? Both. I joined tinder first and then found a watering hole. I think in the UK was the first time I got hit on at bars and stuff. That was like after over 20 years of my life in Malaysia getting 0 at bars or clubs. \n\nI guess I went at it hard because I broke up with my first love, and was like WOOOOOOO. My first love was great but I guess he was like one of the first guys who was actually into me and the market in Malaysia was not great at the time. So it was suddenly a slap in the face (a good one) when I got to the UK and suddenly I was hit on, etc. It was then that I felt my self worth get better and I became more confident and more myself. I used to dumb myself down for Malaysian men (except my first bf). \n\nAnyway, Tinder was great and then I used my watering hole as a safe space to see them because I was close to the bartenders and wait staff, so I know they will keep me safe. But I hung out there so much, I started growing my own family there. Fun story: I once had 3 dates in 1 day there, just because why not \ud83e\udd23 \n\nAhh... the dating stories... I miss those...\n\nFor Tinder, it was truly random, at times it was amazing guys, at times not. But I would say a good 80-90% of them are amazing. Or maybe im just lucky. At the bar, I fell in love with one of the regular's bestie, and we went out for a bit. Like I said earlier, I also get hit on, but it was about 40% of the time I was there (and I was there almost every day). \n\nI did get a boyfriend like after 2 months of humping around and checking off the UK map. Boyfriend was awesome. We still talk and when I go back to the UK we hang out. \n\nGod I miss the dating scene in the UK... life was good. Oh man. You are making me jealous. It sounds like I just did not do the right things in the UK. I was your age, am female but was sooo... standoffish at bars and Tinder was so new, I just thought I would get made fun of...\n\nHa, I wish i would met you for some advice earlier. Nah you should not be jealous. I enjoyed it solely for the fact that it felt like I had equal grounds with those of average height. Plus, im Asian, so I dont see white guys often other than expats who are absolute pricks or tourists who are on this spiritual journey but only want to hump Asian women. White people was a fun novelty for a while I suppose. But you are Aussie, so maybe being in the UK would have not felt that different than being in Australia. There is no novelty there.\n\nBut I do have to say though that white men really care less about a girl with dwarfism. It does not bother them much as compared to Asian men that need to bring their family 'honour'. Plus, where im from, race and religion can be a huge barrier. English men are mostly freethinkers or atheists, so my ocean was definitely bigger and deeper \ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso if you ever want to have a chat, just drop me a message! It will be nice to meet someone who has had travelling experience and has dwarfism honestly! Sounds like both of us travelling would be a hell of a time! Yeah, I was thinking that I like you. We are well travelled with similar educational backgrounds and are both quite outgoing it would seem:) I am interested in our different cultural backgrounds though! I suspect you are from a financially affluent family, this would have a massive impact on your experience with dwarfism. My family is classic middle class Australian. \n\nI will send you a private message and we should totally zoom. Hell yeah! I do not have many friends who have dwarfism and it is been a really difficult and lonely journey sometimes. Kind of wish I had someone to relate to in some way \ud83d\ude0a", "People with dwarfism, What are the fashion challenges that little people face? What kind of changes would you like to see in the fashion industry? How can we make it easier for you to style &amp; show your identity through clothing? &amp;#x200B; Personally, I find it hard to dress as a grown-up (formal attire mostly) when the clothes sizes do not go low enough. Dress shirts and formal pants need to be adapted, which means an investment on top of the price. Same goes for Jackets, sweaters, belts, coats, ties, even shorts (I rarely wear them anyway).\n\nI have stuck to shirts and jeans (also an Issue finding a good pair of jeans) for most of my life due to this though I have always wanted to wear casual dress shirts to work.\n\nShoes! Formal shoes are a bitch, you either have to pay the extra buck for designer kids shoes that DO NOT have plastic soles or wear a pair 2 sizes too big.\n\nAnyway, that is my 2 cents. where do you tend to shop for you clothes then? favorite stores? \n\nDo you find it difficult to find your identity through clothes? If so how? And how can the fashion industry improve for your community?\u00a0\n\nYou lose a sense of \u201cself\u201d when\u00a0you cant express yourself right.\n\nI believe style is huge a part of self identity and is a way to show a bit of who you are to the world. So if I would create a line of clothings, what would u like to see? Are bold patterns something you are open too?  Dressing yourself everyday with clothes that you do not want to wear with wrong fit, can affect self confidence no? where do you tend to shop for you clothes then? favorite stores?\n\nDo you find it difficult to find your identity through clothes?

So if I would create a line of clothings, what would u like to see? Are bold patterns something you are open too? Dressing yourself everyday with clothes that you do not want to wear with wrong fit, can affect self confidence no? Jeans I get them at Old Navy. I will add that jeans are also bothersome since my waist line and leg length are not conventional so I have to cut the legs off my pants every time. Problem is, leg cuts like slim fit mean nothing since I usually cut them a few inches below the knee (about halfway down the shin) and all jeans turn into loose fit then.\n\nShirts I get at Hot Topic or Target. Again I do not mind using them from time to time, but sometimes I want to express myself through my clothes. Sweaters are the worst, since they are knit I cannot adapt them so if I want to wear one I either have to fold the excess sleeve and end up looking like I have fat arms or scrunched the sleeves in my forearms.\n\nTies, It is really hard to find a tie the does not strangle me half to death (short neck) or is so long it dangles below my waistline and peeks out my suit.\n\nOh and SUITS! GOD, I love feeling dapper and well-dressed but if I do not want to look like a ventriloquist dummy I have to get tailor-made jackets and pants.\n\nI gave up trying to use belts, I prefer suspenders honestly (am a bit of a 'hipster' fashion liker). \n\nI would love to be able to use a coat that fits.\n\nShoes, hard to find boots that are not childish, also hard to find decent dress shoes that do not make you feel like you are going to Sunday school. Dress socks. \n\nI love fall and winter colors. Black, brown, blue, orange, green sometimes, some purple, red.\n\nI do not gravitate towards bold colors but that is just a matter of taste. sorry for the lag! \nbut do you think you can tell me your measurement for your waist line, hipline, and leg length? Do you have any tips on designing pants your size? \nAlso, I would like to design a tie for you. Can you clarify why most ties do not work for you ? sorry for the lag! but do you think you can tell me your measurement for your waist line, hipline, and leg length? Do you have any tips on designing pants your size? Also, I would like to design a tie for you. Can you clarify why most ties do not work for you ? I am 17 and I do not like dressing up in the girly clothes, but its kind of hard not to because the women's size is too big. Another thing is pants, oh my god it is such a hassle. Just trying to get a good fitting around my hips then having them cut shorter so I can actually wear them. I am not into sewing, which I probably should be, so luckily my grandma does it for me. But then again, I am a teen and my nice fitting jeans become a loose fit and I do not like it lol. It just sucks having everything so baggy and big but I deal with it. Great Question....\n\nFashion challenges are a continual issue for little people. Jackets, Sweaters and Long Sleeves are typically a massive fashion faux pas.  They are way too long, look terrible folded under and whenever possible must be hemmed. This adds extra cost to clothing so we have to be very particular about the fit.  3/4 length sleeves are the answer.  Whoever invented them was genius. ", "Sorry if this just seems like self promotion and does not belong here, but I just thought some people here might like to know of the story that I am writing/drawing, which has a protagonist with dwarfism. I did post on here a while ago, asking questions to help with my character development, and you were all very helpful, and I said I would keep you updated, so I thought I would make another post. \n\nIt is essentially going to be a bit of a crazy story, with some supernatural elements, and even some fantasy elements, with my main character (a long with a couple of others) getting thrown into the middle of it.

I am worried about it, but not until he switches schools with age.  Right now, he is with people who grew up with him in school, so there is not any bullying.  It is something I worry about often though. Hey. It is not healthy, but I block the world out when I am out and about. Noise cancelling headphones are a dream. When I was younger I was bullied through school, I learnt you have to find your \u201ctribe\u201d in life - there a good people out there :) I had problems with younger kids trying to prove their social status by bullying me at both high school and primary school. I found bullying them back, vocally, really helped. It was not that big of a problem because I was pretty popular otherwise. I was also school captain.\n\nHad I been socially akward as well as a dwarf... Fuuuck. Tough. \n\nMy biggest problem was and remains bullying by strangers in public spaces who figure they will not see you again so can do and say whatever with no repercussions. \n\nWhat is your current bullying problem? Maybe we can brainstorm some solutions. How do you stop yourself from projecting these fears on to your son? I have buried them at this point.  His school is wonderful and we have not had any issues.   \n\nMy worry will start again when he has to go to another school for grade 5.  That is when he will be introduced to a bunch of kids who have not grown up with him and I suspect that will be when the teasing starts up Hey thnx for your reply , my problem is nearly same as yours, getting bullied by strangers (specially kids) in the streets and sometimes I do not know how to act Where do you live?

What have a 4 month old daughter with pretty severe weight and feeding issues. My wife and I have been reading into some of the genetic tests that have been performed (but not yet resulted) and RSS symptoms describe her almost perfectly.\n\nI guess I am just looking for reassurance that being diagnosed as such is not the end of the world. I know that her height will not make her permanently disabled or anything, but what kinds of things should we look out for as she gets older? What sort of challenges will she face as a child? Hello\n\nI am super late but I am interested by your post as I do not see many about RSS on here. I tested negative for RSS though I share many (though not all) of the symptoms. From my understanding, it seems that RSS is a term that is used for quite a wide variety of similar-but-not-quite-the-same conditions. I have been told that I am sort of \"RSS-like\" as I share some features but I do not have a positive genetic test result. My geneticist's opinion is that RSS and RSS-like syndromes are probably actually many different genetic conditions (some of which we know how to test and some we have not found yet) so not everyone who has a number of the same symptoms will test positive for the same genetic test. \n\nIn answer to your question - just like for anyone with a growth condition there are personal challenges that come with being small and, looking a good deal younger than you really are. Other children (and adults though they should know better!) can sometimes be rude or mean or make unthinking comments that can hurt. Health-wise, I do not know where you live but for me in the UK I had a paediatrician until age 18 (I am now 25) who I saw regularly so she could monitor my progress and watch out for issues (for example scoliosis which I developed when I was an early teen and can be common in those with growth conditions). I know that feeding me was the biggest challenge for my parents for most of my early childhood.\n\nBut, from my experience at least, you might be reassured to know that while there are challenges many RSS children  lead normal adult lives and can generally do most every day things that anyone else can, and it definitely is not the end of the world! I did well at school, went to university, have a small but good group of friends, a job as a healthcare professional, I drive, travel, go to bars, have hobbies etc, etc! I know lots of other RSS adults who have very successful and \"normal\" lives. Personally for me, the challenges come mainly in the psychological/emotional side of feeling different and looking young, but I think a crucial thing is to grow up with a positive, open, honest and unrestricted dialogue where the child can ask questions, voice their feelings, tell you if anybody asks awkward questions or makes a rude comment or is mean to them, and share the load/experience with you to find their own pace &amp; place in the world.\n\nThere are a couple of groups (you may already be aware of) that may be helpful to you - the Child Growth Foundation is great for information, and there is also a support group on Facebook where lots of people are in your situation, going through the process of diagnosis and asking questions (you can find it if you search \"Russell silver support\"). I do not know if this was any help I feel like I have written an essay here! Feel free to ask me anything else if you would like. Best of luck to you guys and your daughter, I hope you get some answers soon and things start getting clearer. Thanks for the information! What kind of feeding problems did you have? My daughter flat out refuses to eat by mouth so we have to rely on a feeding tube.

I always thought If I had dwarfism I would find the term little person really insulting and infantilizing.

I am just genuinely curious. ronk amd stone Honestly you have basically got the same mindset I have always had. Little person sounds dumb\u2014at least dwarf sounds somewhat cool. \u201cDwarfism\u201d is also a medical term, so I am in no rush to be offended by it. I prefer my first name.

If I were to join, I would be in District 8-15 (San Antonio, TX). I do not think it is too pricy to join. I just wonder about the amount of opportunities and events to engage with others. What will/could I truly gain? Seconding the question, I have asked the same things myself a lot I think that depends a lot on the type of dwarfism you have and the inclusiveness of the chapter in your area. If you are an achon and the chapter is pretty inviting, it may be a great experience. I have heard from others with my syndrome (Ellis van Creveld Syndrome) that most of LPA is made up of those with achondroplasia and that it can be a pretty uncomfortable or downright hostile environment to those with other forms of dwarfism, so I have never bothered, especially since I am on the taller end of the spectrum for those with my diagnosis, which I think is on the taller end of the spectrum for dwarfisms anyways.\n\nI do not think deciding to or not to pursue getting involved with LPA should limit your involvement with groups of those with disabilities, though. I have done a lot of volunteering/advocacy/just generally getting involved in groups that center around those with physical disabilities, and have met some of my best friends in the world there! In my experience, it is pretty easy to relate to those with physical disabilities even if those disabilities are not dwarfism, and most cities seem to have a pretty vibrant community of those who want to meet more people like themselves! If I moved to the US I would join the LPA for sure. We do not have anything near as big / active in Australia.\n\nRe comments about type of dwarfism and LPA inclusiveness - give it a go and see for yourself. Keep in mind that a lot of clubs come across as cliquey at first and it usually takes time to fit in  and find your people.\n\nAlso - LP people meeting other LPs usually initially experience a lot of angst and insecurity because of the massive social issues surrounding dwarfism. Try not to mistake your own defensiveness and insecurities for the LPA being unwelcoming. Prefacing by stating that I am not a dwarf, just a parent of -- I am definitely getting different things out of it than my son will in the future.\n\nIn my opinion, it seems like a pretty good environment for people to connect and meet on a whole, so I would suggest its probably worth your while to check it out at least.

I wanted to reach out and ask for permission to post a link in r/dwarfism My friend monica passed a few years back due to medical malpractice. She was a huge light in everyone is lives. People on this sub might have known her as she was very involved in LPA and online. Recently, her family published a book of her poetry. I think some people might find it interesting.  I have mod permission to post a link.\n\n  Stickies for all to get a chance to see. This means a lot! Ty! Absolutely, my friend. Sorry for your loss, for all of our loss. I still remember the song that was playing when I got the news. I have a physical issue and I am determined to keep her spirit alive by not letting anything hinder my spirit. I am hoping some people here remember her. If not, that she continues to inspire people. I like your perseverance man. I am sure she would be proud too. I understand too because I have a physical issue as well (spinal cord injury) so it is always good hear other folks going strong. It is inspiring just like she still is. Thanks for sharing this. Roy ;-) Believe it or not, I am not Roy. But I do know him. And hes a great guy :)", "Would it be inappropiate to approach a Little People self-help group (kind of unique-ish situation)? Okay, this is the first time I open a thread in here, hope it works out, lol.\n\nSo, for a longer time, I have had a latent interest to seek out a support group or internet forum for Dwarfism. Thing is, I am not sure if I would be entirely welcome because it may seem like my situation is partially, if not even completely, self-made. That is because I am a trans guy (i.e. female-to-male transsexual) and, where I live, my height would be just barely within what is considered the normal range for females, but it would definitely be considered abnormal by male standards (I am aware that there are types of Dwarfism where people can reach a close-to-average height). A couple of years ago, a geneticist gave me a diagnosis of Familial Dwarfism simply based on the fact that, as far as I can tell, nobody in my closer family (which is huge) is noteworthily above 170 cm (5'7''?), except for one cousin (but more than anything, I attribute his height to that of his father, to whom I am not related by blood). However, that is really all I have in terms of diagnoses (but that is also because I did not bother to get more tests done after the two most probable diagnoses were ruled out).\n\nSo would it be okay to give it a shot or would it be weird? In case that helps any, I have 100% passing as male and, be as it may, I would not like to come out as trans in general.\n\n\n**EDIT** for clarification: I am not fishing for a diagnosis just for the sake of it, in case the above reads like that. If it was not for that, I would probably just say \"I am short. Period.\" and suck it up, but I seem to be kind of disproportionate insofar that my height (5'0'') is pretty much entirely due to short legs. In a group where everyone is sitting, you would not really notice I was short and I would even be taller than some, but my feet would not reach the floor (unless I use an adjustable chair set all the way down AND a footrest set all the way up) and I also have short arms and rather short fingers (would not say Brachydactyly because I do not know the exact clinical definition for that), so I do have the suspicion that there is *something* diagnosable. I think you would get more out of a trans support group. I know you said you do not want to come out as trans, but those kind of groups can be pretty anonymous. \n\nTo me, a 5'0\" able-bodied dude should not be in a support group for people with dwarfism. I am sorry. Dwarfism is not just about height. The point of a support group is to be able to relate to each other going through similar struggles, and I cannot say that I (as a dwarf) particularly relate to the lives of 5'0\" able-bodied men. You will only be there for a single reason that happens to be similar with one aspect of dwarfism.  I am a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

Pleasant post bussy The OP of the first link is a literal white supremacist who has developed a weird fixation on the idea that trans people are plotting to rape him. And you are brigading from the shitty transhatersubs. You sure are on your high and mighty moral horse. 14/88 fam  Oh and here is the person that documents everything I say for posterity. Do you keep files on everyone or am I special? Holy shit. Literally?! post bussy hmmm you did not deny your fixation for trans rapists. I do not think this sub is a good place to discuss it in more detail, but I find out a lot of people on Reddit support positions that I find to be rape (or akin to it). Was linked elsewhere as well. Not very kindly. Well, I actually think that this whole thing should be deleted because my original question has now been more than answered. However, I skimmed that one linked thread and saw accusations of \"appropriation\" and \"narcissism\" and I thought some explanations are in order (cannot do it there directly due to only having read-only access). So, at the risk of making even more of an ass of myself:\n\nAppropriation: The whole point of this post was to *avoid* intruding. I guess we might have a different understanding of what defines appropriation, but for me, personally, it does not already start with asking if one has a place; it would define it as barging right in and going \"Here I am, I am one of you!\" - which I am definitely not going to do. If anyone sees it differently and/or is offended by my original post, I apologise. It was a genuine question, btw. I am aware of the 4'10\" limit, however, I was not sure how much set in stone that limit was, mainly because of  ( (according to the article, he is 4'11\" and has hypochondroplasia).\n\nNarcissism: I assume that impression mainly stems from this:\n&gt; it does not help at all to make me feel any better about myself \n\nYeah, that is abysmal wording. I do not expect *anyone* to make me feel better, it was actually a sarcastic way of saying \"It makes me feel like shit\". I speak like that irl, but I see it does not work at all without the accentuation and mimics. I was not aware of that when I wrote it.", "Trying to see numbers \n\n( What if someone is in a relationship but is not married? Yeah, great question.

Hi, I am Megan, 17. I have SED dwarfism and I am 3'4.\n\nSo since I am asking you something personal, I will share mine too.\n\nI was about 7 years old and I was the first one to get on the bus because of my wheelchair. Soon after the other kids gotten on the bus (this was a special ed bus btw). There was this one kid, who I did not really care for because he was a jerk to other people. But out of nowhere he stops to look down at me and says, \"Hi you weird stupid fucking midget alien.\" Smiles proudly like he just finished a big speech and walked away. It hurt me so bad, I felt like I could not breathe because his words smashed into me and they kept repeating in my head. Notice this was in the very front of the bus, I sat right behind the bus driver and she did not even hear it (how tbh?). I am extremely shy so I did not speak up. I did not tell on him, I kept it to myself, which I regret because his words are stuck in my head forever. I sat staring out the window trying to hide my tears and control my breathing. It was terrible because once I got home I was angry and upset that I took my anger out on people who did not deserve it. It was selfish, but I was 7, I have not had anyone do something to me like that. No one really knows this, I never told anyone but it feels nice to spill it out sometimes. So that is my horrible experience, I am sure people have had it worse out there :/ Just know that whatever you have gone through, your true people will always love you and support you :) What a rotten little asshole he was Indeed he was. I moved schools a long time ago so glad I do not have to see him ever again", "Serious question How do people who suffer from dwarfism type? Do they have special keyboards if their hands/fingers are smaller? I type on a regular keyboard. Have my entire life.  And have a WPM higher than average. I have fat fingers, but I still can reach the keys.  But hey, just remember, old people can hunt and peck, so could someone who has a smaller hand. It is a bit harder as a child, but at adult age our fingers are typically big enough to use a standard keyboard normally Suffer? I hold my hands on the keyboard like everyone should and shift my hands closer to the keys I need to reach, otherwise I just look down and peck at the keyboard. I can reach all the letter keys comfortably except Q &amp; P, which I have to move my hands to get to. On older,wider keyboards it was much harder to type. I transcribe as fast as someone can speak, and log files of this professionally for a living. Have never had to use a smaller keyboard. We type differently. I do not lay my fingers across the keys--it is like they are constantly rotating around the keyboard. Also, not all people with Dwarfism \"suffer.\" Might want to switch up that projection there. Ikr Being of normal stature, regards keyboards, I type fairly fast. However have never learnt to touch type but simply use 2 fingers. Reaching any key is straight forward.", "The 'M' Word (Explanations, Links, and Personal Testimony on the use of Midget) A lot of redditors use the term \"Midget\".  This is incorrect.  It is just like calling a black person a nigger.  You just do not do it.\n\n\"But Zero, you have it in your username!\".  Yes. I do.  I know.  I have used this name for 10 years (since I was 12).  If anyone sees the username, they know it is me.  Sort of like a legacy.  When I made the name,  I was young and stupid, and not involved in the LP world, nor the LPA.  Now that I have grown older I understand why it is wrong and why it should not be used, but it is easier to use it and explain why I do (and open conversation about it, I have many people even refuse to call me \"ZeroMidget\" and refer to me just solely as \"Zero\").\n\nNow a lot of people ask why \"midget\" is a bad term.  There a lot of reasons, primarily stemming from the circus days.  Most little people were used as acts, and the common nomenclature at the time was Midget.  Now as time has moved on, it has grown to be more offensive than anything.  Personally I am not a damn circus act, and I know a ton of my LP friends do not feel they are either.  As taken from  ( midget was also used to identify someone with a dwarfism that was proportionate.  However, the fact that most proportional dwarfs no longer exist (due to medical advances, such as human growth hormones), even if they do 'midget' would not be right for the majority of LPs, who are NOT proportional.\n\nA few links related to LPA and their stance on the M word:\n\n (\n\n (\n\n (\n\n*More will be added, feel free to comment with links to articles!*", "I am thinking of including people with dwarfism in a fiction book I am writing and I would like some help with accuracy. How I am thinking of including dwarfism in my story right now is, a society of people with dwarfism that broke away from multiple other civilizations. In this world people with dwarfism can still be found in many places, but this one civilization is populated with mostly people with dwarfism and other people with dwarfism from other places are sometimes drawn to it.\n\nMost of what I would like to know pertains to biology. For example stuff like, \nDo people with dwarfism always pass it down to their children?(I assume yes)\nI have heard that there are different versions of dwarfism, and if that is true, I would like to know what the differences are.\nI assume babies born with dwarfism look different from birth and if so, How so?\n(From a strictly physical standpoint) What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of dwarfism?\n\nI am going to want to give people with dwarfism in this universe a general name, I am definitely not going to be calling them anything like dwarves or halflings because that seems to be in bad taste, so I would like to hear what you suggest. If I cannot think of anything that works in English I will most likely make up a word based off of root words from whatever language makes the most sense to the story.\n\nFeel free to let me know anything you think would be helpful for me that I did not ask about. And I would also like to hear about some things that bother you about how dwarfism is portrayed so that I might avoid them. ronk amd stone There is always going to be colloquial names for groups of people, especially if ppl with dwarfism are more common in this universe. Do not be too afraid of coming up with an edgier almost slur-sounding name for ignorant/ uninformed people to use in contrast to whatever proper name you would give them.\n\nAlso, it is not a certain thing to be passed on. I, for instance, am a first generation dwarf--meaning I did not inherit the genetic mutation from anybody in my family, but rather I was just unlucky enough to happen upon it. So my kids definitely have a chance of getting it from me, but I have also seen it where a guy with dwarfism has some normal height kids; like everything, it varies from person-to-person.\n\nHopefully this has helped somewhat, feel free to PM if you have more questions! It sounds to me like you need to do a shit tonne more research on dwarfism before you embark on writing a world for us. I would recommend this book: (\n\nAround 80% of people with dwarfism have no family history of it and are born to average height people. You would need to come up with a pretty convoluted story to justify how a society of us came to exist and how it is maintained as many LPs have normal height kids. \n\n**A useful thought exercise might be this:**\n\nIf your child was/is born with dwarfism, how would that child come to end up in this dwarf society? Would you be compelled to abandon it to strangers in the city? If so, why? What are the implications of these actions? Also, why does this child grow up identifying more with these strangers than with you, it is family? Thanks for responding to my post. I did not really intend on making this story about this place. I was just thinking it would be a local the main character(s) visit. The kind of story I am writing is sort of an alternate history of the world we are certain civilizations ended up in different places. So my thinking in creating a society composed mostly of people with dwarfism was to create a fantasy race more rooted in reality. \n\nWhen I say people born with dwarfism outside of this civilization are drawn to it, I meant that it is just a very appealing place. For example say you were 6'5 born and raised in Japan. You visit a country like America and everything is more conveniently your size.\n\nAnd I was thinking it would be appealing in a way that a big city is appealing to someone who lives in the country. And even outside of the analogy it would be a big city, perhaps even a country, so it would actually have that appeal too. OK, so you are making a distinction between pathological dwarfism (achondroplasia) and just a hereditary characteristic (pygmy)?\n\nIf that is the case I would want to know why the \"pygmy\" civilization was open to outsiders. I suspect, in reality, that there might be some real disassociation happening, especially if people with dwarfism were of a lower social status. The 'Pygmy' people might want to argue a vital difference between them and the dwarfs. \n\nSomething worth thinking about.", "Save the dehumanizing term \"midget\", what other term can one use to refer to someone? I personally do not like \"little person\", \"person of small stature\", \"person with dwarfism\" or any other similar words or phrases, so are there any other words or phrases which do not sound too silly, made-up or anything that one can use that humanizes people who are otherwise called \"midgets\"? Are you an LP or not? If you are, then whatever you feel comfortable with and will not offend whoever you are talking with.  For example, Peter Dinklage says he is fine with the term \"dwarf\" .\n\nIf you are not an LP, it is not your decision I am afraid.  In that case I would stick with Little Person. LP here ^ this I feel all of those words equal different definitions towards the same nervous system requirements, its just how you seek to use it in a sentence.  \n\nSince medical science has overshadowed the minds of most little people within their fear of death, the most acceptable seems to be \u2018person with dwarfism\u2019, then for more socio-political realms it seems to be \u2018little person. \n\nThe term \u2018midget\u2019 99% usually is spoken by a little person using it as a badge to protect their scar, or an ignorant or uninformed average person that doesnt understand the full power of language. \n\nI feel most little people have been playing this game their entire lives, and just want that to be least of their character, while realities like LGBTQ seek to cut up language until everyone feels comfortable with their own comfy badge. Just by reading this I am pretty sure this is an AP who wrote this...lol. Sounds almost the same thing that steve'o guy from jackass said in that video that was on here a while back. This is probably the best answer you are going to get, OP. I personally prefer dwarf or LP. I was diagnosed with dwarfism, therefore it describes me. \n\nLike calling somebody with diabetes a diabetic, or similar. It is factual. I honestly do not mind little person or dwarf. \u201cMidget\u201d really gets on my nerves and it sucks how I cannot actually show frustration because then people just do not take it seriously and use it again. That includes some of my friends Personally, (4'1\" here) midget never got on my nerves. When people would talk about me to someone else and they could not remember who I was they would say the midget and they would remember. Dwarf and little person sound weird to me but they do not bother me at all. I am human and they are describing me. Also, if they are saying midget or something, they are just not educated about the \"politically correct\" terms and I am not going to fault someone for not educating themselves on every possible politically correct term that they may or may not come across. I cannot when I know I am probably not educated in that sense either. \n\nFood for thought. As someone who has dwarfism but would also technically qualify as an \"AP\" (I think), this is why I prefer \"person with dwarfism\". More ideally, I wish there was a bigger push to change that it to \"person with skeletal dysplasia\" in order to thoroughly encompass all of us. If you technically qualify as an average person, your ability to be a part of the discussion in defining dwarfism should be noted. You are in a dwarfism reddit group, the commonality of eye-level holds tenure. LP here, joining a bit late as I just found this sub. If you are not an LP:  Personally, I prefer when people ask for my name and refer to me that way. There are so many other ways/attributes that someone could use to describe me besides by my dwarfism; purple hair, hilarious, animal lover, all around amazing person. ;) \n\nWhen you are talking about a friend with someone who has never met them do you say, my skin tone/nationality/gay/straight/etc friend so and so? Probably not. I will bet you say something like, \"My friend, so and so, loves that band too! You should meet him/her!\"\n\nThat being said, I do not tolerate the word midget. If you do not know their name and cannot ask I think \"person with dwarfism\" is an ok phrase. If  you are an LP then you get to decide what feels right for you. Why do you have to call them anything? It is all about context. U cannot assume everyone that uses the term midget is being mean. I meet a lot of people with my job and because I am very confident with who I am and my body  my audience is not afraid to ask me questions. I often get asked why midget is considered offensive.

Just watched The Joker and as usual the dwarf in the film was there for comedic relief. I cannot think of any dwarfs in films that were not made fun of. How do you feel about that? Do you like the fact that they are getting screen time, or dislike the fact its always for mockery? Honestly in terms of the joker I loved it. It was such a relatable moment.(having to ask for help with a door when you do not want it)\n\n I was happy they had a dwarf actor I always love seeing them. I might be a bit biased as I would like to be an actor. It only annoys me when it is unnecessarly cruel I otherwise enjoyed the movie. But i hate it when dwarf characters are only there to be dwarves.\n\nFor example, Tyrion in gave of thrones is a dwarf, but not only that, he is the smartest person, he is kind, he is funny, he is a drunk, he is a fully fleshed out character. Tyrion would still be a great charter if he was not a dwarf. \n\nIn joker, The character is only there to be a dwarf, that scene only makes sense if he is a dwarf, and people only laugh because he is a dwarf. Have you seen the film \u2018The Station Agent\u2019? ( 2003) Beats the hell out of the circus and pays better. Lol nope I have not seen anything unnecessarily cruel, other than maybe Wolf of Wall Street. It was not funny just because he was a dwarf. His reaction is what was funny. Him losing his shit and not knowing what the crazy joker would do next. Him being a dwarf only mattered when he could not open the door.\n\nAlso that dwarf also played Tyrian in game of thrones.

It really depends on the person staring at you. When the stares are coming from young kids, I really do not mind because they do not know any better and are generally curious. Except I get annoyed when a kid keeps on pointing and saying something like \"Mom, mom, mom look, look, look at her!\" and their parent just ignores them and does not do anything. The worst though is when I am at the mall and off to the side is a group of teenagers laughing and staring directly at me, by then they should be mature enough to realize it is not ok to laugh and point and make comments about a person in front of that person. It also depends on how long the stare is too, some people stare way too long.  I am 6'11\".  We should be friends and if you ever get laughed at by an asshole for your height i would be glad to go up to him and stare him the fuck down.  I have a severe chest deformity and honestly, i have never been teased because of it.  But that is prolly because people think twice about upsetting someone my size.

If that is how they treat people then they are royally screwed up the ass when it comes to real long-lasting friendships and romantic relationships.  Im fucking serious.

What if little people from times past were an integral part within the development of society through the clandestine act of freemasonry. \n\nWithin that fraternity allowed men with dwarfism to choreograph their duty and will within the outside world, by using their vocal ordainment onto men of greater stature. \n\nThey created a longing for a quest of rebirth, turning brute men into gentlemen. They created the ability for men to nurture women not as objects to breed, but the worship of feminine divinity. \n\nThrough this act of sacrifice, the little people within adolescent societies did not put duty in exposing their nervous system into the outer world, which created a poetic marriage spoken by the brutes on their travels, and therefor unleashing a certain submission in return for the knowledge of the universe alchemically purified into the dance on a chessboard.

I recently moved to a new city and lately I have been getting offers to work at private parties, malls and night clubs dressed as different characters for photo ops, greeting patrons and generally standing around dancing. While I do not judge people for what they do for a living, I remember being told all my life that I should not participate in such activities because they are exploitative and in some cases even offensive. I come from a latin american family and they never let me attend events that are popular in my country such as dwarf bullfighting and wrestling. But as I get older (I am 22) and I start to look for ways to become economically independent I cannot pretend those options do not look attractive enough. Still, I think it would not hurt to ask the forum before I make a final decision. **Also I would like to add that if you work in this industry I totally respect you and would really benefit from your perspective on the subject** If you want to degrade yourself and be seen as an object of entertainment that is on you.\n\nBut I will fucking starve before I do that or let anyone in my family do it.

There is an inherent hierarchy in it which is not discussed enough. Just like the entire view that our people exist entirely for comedic purposes or fantasy creation.\n\nAnyways, Im rambling but I think in the end if you have the choice to do something else, you would be happier with an alternative. I am intense because, in part, I see this swing to people being ok with it in a way closer to dragging everyone down.  I look at TikTok videos and such, and see dwarfs in primarily 99% comedy skits which degrade them based on their height.  Hell, look up dwarfs shooting.  I made (and will make in the future) videos to show that dwarfs can shoot any caliber they want to try.  But know the first videos that come out?

They are extremely useful. You should call them up, introduce yourself and totally just ask them.

I am 35 and have lived with being short pretty much all my life and accepted the good with the bad (yes there is good, but curse you upper shelves at the grocery store). I never really considered that I have dwarfism until it was mentioned to me by someone close to me that there is (perhaps many?) types of dwarfism where the person's limbs are proportionally sized. \n\nHowever after researching proportional dwarfism and reflecting on my past medical experience I am fairly confident that this is the case. I come from a very tall family my younger sisters outgrew me by 5, around then I believe my parents sought medical advice. I do know I spent a lot of time in and out of the hospital and was put on several different growth hormone treatments and even one experimental trial in which the doctor could not tell me if I was on the real medicine. Looking back I think it is a bit cruel to put a 12 year old through a trial in which they have to go through all the work of a treatment, but not actually getting the medicine but who knows if that was the case. Needless to say none of the growth hormone treatments worked to any measureable effect. Around 15 we had stopped any of the growth hormone treatments as they believed that the stage of growth spurt puberty had hit and any further treatment would likely have little effect and I also had another pressing medical issue. \n\nIn my early teens it had been discovered that my spine has a wedge like vertebrae deformity (spinal deformities is a common ailment of those with dwarfism at least that I have read). This was attempted to be corrected by chiropractic and physical therapy yet by time I was 17 it was determined that the best long term solution was surgical and at that point I had most of my upper spine fused. Now days I have a physical therapy routine and regularly visit a massage therapist for a rather painful (but helpful) muscle tension regiment, that combined with some pain management medicine when necessary makes the back issues manageable.\n\nAll my life I have had a minor visual impairment which I eventually got corrected with Lasik which has improved my vision even better than glasses at least in one eye (the other just hates me). I have also read that visual impairments are common amongst those with dwarfism.\n\nSince my mid 20s I developed arthritis in my hands, which stacks again in the category of things that is often with those with dwarfism.\n\nThen recently, last year I was having massive fatigue issues after 6 long months of tests and various medicine changes I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and after my research in dwarfism it made me realized that was something that likely should have been checked first.\n\nI do not have overly fond memories of all the medical stuff from my childhood and for the most part put it all in the back of my head but after reading about this stuff I think I need to get a copy of my medical records back then and see if I was ever formally diagnosed with dwarfism all I can remember is that my body had trouble accepting growth hormone was how it was explained to me as a child.\n\nUnfortunately my parents are not much help as my mother handled most of the doctor visits and interactions and at this point she is not very reliable and suffers from some pretty crazy delusions and my father just does not remember enough. \n\nI do know regardless of any formal diagnosis I think I want to start getting my hearing checked regularly (maybe yearly I do not know what a good timeframe on that is) as I have read that can be an issue as well and if my hearing is degrading slowly I would like to catch it.\n\nI am not out for sympathy or anything as I have no issue with being short or little person (I am sorry I do not know the correct term this aspect is still very new to me).

Yes there are characters who make fun of Dinklage's character but they are pretty clearly portrayed as being in the wrong. Even the one example people point out to where that is not the case, Dinklage joking he needs to use the little boy's room, seems to him saying that out of spite because he can tell Mildred, Frances McDormand's character, was uncomfortable to be going out to him.\n\nBut what do you think? Do you think the movie made fun of him? Have not seen that one, but I would not even consider that character from Joker to be offensive. It was set in the \u201870s, so the way the character was treated fit.\n\nI still have not watched Wolf of Wallstreet though for that reason\u2014 I know it is just going to make me uncomfortable no matter how \u201ctotally funny\u201d it is when they start slingin dwarfs. Well I obviously cannot tell you to be offended, it was just really the one joke about him towards the end, the Key Lock scene, that made me think \"Is this right?\" But if you were not personally offended by it or anyway, more power to you. Very late to this, but personally I am kind of torn on Three Billboards, mostly because of the greater context of Martin McDonagh's work. His earlier film, In Bruges, is one of my favourite films of all time, but in that film he also has a dwarf character in it that is constantly used as a springboard for the other characters to make jokes about, and say the word 'midget' a lot, for the duration of the film. It feels like he is drawn to it in a similar way to Tarantino and the N word a little bit. he just seems to want to incorporate dwarf jokes...quite a bit in his work. I found it passable in one film, but seeing it again just made me think \"...why?\" Hey, I know I am a bit late to the party and all, and it is not to defend the dwarf slinging. But if you watch wolf of wall street, you will immediately understand that the dwarf slinging is not funny because dwarf slinging is funny, as a matter of fact, nothing is really funny unless you can laugh at it happening outside of cinema context. Like immagine you are in the street and see someone slinging another person into a wall, the first reaction is not nessesarily laughter.

I am not sure when I came to this conclusion, it is just something I always \"knew\".\n\nDid other people grow up \"knowing this\"? Or did you grow up with normal expectations of love and a future? I felt the same way. It felt like a certainty that I was just not permitted into that aspect of life. It was only when I was about 21 did I start thinking otherwise (ngl, it was mostly the reaction people had to Game of Thrones that started changing my mindset).\n\nSince then I still have not had any luck (I am 27 now), but I am still open to it Have you gone on dating apps? Yeah I have, though I had just started doing that when covid happened, so I had to put it on pause. Restrictions are starting to lift in the UK so I am going to get on that again.\n\nHow about you? Had any luck on apps? I had some luck in the apps. I am a girl and 37 living in ultra image conscious Australia though. I regret not starting on the apps sooner. I recommend you get on them and try hard. You will meet a lot of dead ends but I think you will have success. I grew up assuming the dating/love life was not for me. I did not date much in my teens. When I was 18 I used a dating website and went on a few dates before I met my now husband. From my experience it was always in my mind that I was not datable. I am not saying everyone is going to be interested but even with AP's not everyone is interested. My advice is to put yourself out there, rejection hurts but it is better than living with a what if. Sorry, do you mean that it was \"only in your mind\" and that you were datable in other people's mind? Also, what country are you in? No matter who you are, there is someone out there who thinks you are their ideal mate. Do not close the door on possibilities. This is a platitude and does not address the question. Do you even have dwarfism? The amount of times people have said this or something similar to me. It is a lot. Hearing it these days I just have to grit my teeth and pretend what they said does not piss me off. Because I know it is people's way of try comfort me.\n\nCompare this to the amount of times friends have tried to set me up with someone/ one of their friends. 1 time.... 1 single time in grade 8.\n\nI have a good friend who actually tries/pushes me to try and date. Sadly they are awkward af and it has not worked yet. \n\nSorry for the rant this post kind of struck a nerve for me No. I think your observation is very good.  Noone has ever tried to set me up with anyone either and I am quite popular and have a billion friends. I think this is a greater indicator of how datable they think we really are.  My friends are keen to set up other people all the time. \n\nI actually had a confrontation with my father about this. He said \"I would find someone\". So I asked him if he would ever have dated a dwarf. He said \"no\". Then I asked him if anyone he knew would have dated one and he was quiet for a while while he thought about it and said he was not sure.  He is stopped giving me bullshit platitudes since. Yeah I have a fair amount of friends too.... the realisation sucked a lot of wind out of my sails. \n\nI do not like talking to my family about dating. I have 3 older sisters and they are all 10s. Good looking, smart, all have passes university, in great shape. \n\nAnd what a surprise they all have really cool partners. Be careful with the apps.

All my life I just thought I am short. Our doctor told us about a year ago we have proportionate dwarfism. She does not know what kind or why. Is it important I go to a specialist to find out? I developed normally as far as puberty (actually earlier than classmates), but my periods have always been super crazy. Now I have not had one in pretty much 2 1/2 years. I thought it had something to do with the possibility of having PCOS, but all my levels were normal, so doctor ruled it out. Could my dwarfism have something to do with it? I am just curious about a lot. I always knew my aches and pain were mostly from my stature, but not sure if that could effect other things. Also did anyone else get arthritis in hands and knees and carpal tunnel early in life? I am only 26. My mother has had multiple knee surgeries and hand surgery on her wrists in her early 30s. It might be worth knowing the type if you plan on having kids biologically in the future. \nBut as far as short stature and wrist issues, look up shox gene deficiencies. It can be very mild and some people achieve average height, but in others it is much more disproportionate. I do not think this would be impacting pcos or related things, but my family member who has this type of dwarfism is biologically male. Your joint issues could be related to skeletal dysplasia. \n\nYour period issues could be anything!

People who are blind are not commonly referred to as \"unseeing\" and so on. I cannot think of any other condition/disability in which those who have it have such a label as us.

All I experienced in terms of height was struggling a bit on my HS desks, being a subject of a crude short person joke, being a subject of paraphilia, being seen as an elem student recently, being seen as less intimidating and therefore easier to be agressive to by some youths and immature adults, and again, being told by random people who know little or nothing about my med history that I do not have dwarfism despite of me being diagnosed with it. The media does have significant info about what the average or short LP experiences social, from having photos taken of them by strangers, to being told they cannot get hired because of their height, even though they can work properly within that position. However, the media does not tell the general story of dwarfism. Whenever dwarfism is mentioned on TV or whatever, it describes the person who are at most a few inches above four feet.

I am an average sized person and I do not have access to someone irl that I can ask.\n\n\nThe scene: an engaged couple (male with dwarfism, female average sized, arranged marriage) is arguing. The male has done something wrong (contemplated killing the female character for personal gain/freedom, got close enough to stabbing her in her sleep, but did not) and the female is justifiably angry at him. Female character genuinely cares about him, likes him, and is falling in love with him. Male character has been burned before, but is starting to come around to the idea that she actually likes him. He has admitted to her what he did, and she is pretty much screaming at him.\n\n\nThe issue: As she is yelling at him, she gets tired of him taking it without complaint, and says something like \u201cStand on something so I can yell at you properly\u201d\n\n\nThe intended message: to break the tension of an argument in a slightly humorous way that leads the two characters to actually talking, instead of just yelling at each other. It is NOT intended to make fun of him, insult, or put him down\n\n\nI do not like yelling down at people or things smaller than me and I do not like people taller than I am yelling at me or looming over me. I have been that person that climbs on shit to get the same height as the person I am arguing with, partly because I think having a large height difference during conflict makes things feel unfair or abusive.

Yes, he deserves to be yelled at and she has the right to be angry, but she wants an explanation instead of him simply accepting her yelling at him.\n\n\nThe line is intended to make them both pause and kind of laugh, then take it from a high level shouting situation, to more of a low level sad situation where she is tearfully asking for answers. I asked a friend, and he said it needs to be an awkward situation already, like she is naked and he is essentially arguing with her pubic area (his idea, not mine). This does not really fit the relationship at that point, since they are not intimate yet, and I do not think it works. I would love to get some real opinions or stories of relationships between average sized people and people with dwarfism. \n\n\nTldr: is it offensive to have an AP tell an LP to \u201cStand on something so I call yell at you\u201d?

There are not many love stories like that.\n\nCan not give much input because I do not have dwarfism but my love is a dwarf (anchondroplasia). I am taller then my love but you know height  does not matter in love. To Me my love is just right. Would not want my love any other way. Maybe if he had a sore back or neck, and her said, \"ouch, my aching neck...stand on something so I can yell at you.\" I am just paraphrasing, of course. That way, its his fault that he cannot simply look downward.

I have felt sorry for people who were bullies in the past, got leg lengthening surgeries and then come back to LPA and were made to be outcasts. Just because that person had a cosmetic surgery does not mean that they are not still affected by dwarfism.  I was just curious. Myself and 2 of my kids have SEDc. I was diagnosed as an adult and have never been to an event, but I am nervous to go because of this.  They are not seen as \"lesser\", but do expect most information in general to be about Achons.

I wake up stiff and in tons of joint, neck, and back pain. Have you found a good mattress? Pillows?\n\nI would rather find ways to prevent it and alleviate it than eat pills. I know Ibuprofen and friends daily is not healthy... but I do not know how much more I can take.  I have found that doing some stretching exercises in the morning can help (being careful not to overdo it! you could hurt yourself more). I still take painkillers very often though... pills are the only thing that works reliably for me. A new mattress that is firm on the bottom and soft on top, and weed vapes that have half cbd/THC in them or edibles before bed. I do not take pills. Stretching my hips and lower back all throughout the day really helps.  I inherited my grandparent's therapeutic mattress after my grandfather passed and it is absolutely wonderful.  I know it is not in the budget for a lot of us (honestly, I am in the same position, I got super lucky), but if you are in a position where you can afford one, they are wonderful.  It is honestly kind of hard to sleep anywhere else after acclimating to it.  The only problem is that it is so comfortable, when I watch my friend's dog when I am working from home, he insists on sleeping right next to Uncle djm14 and makes me contort to fit him on the bed next to me, which makes me wake up stiff and sore, haha\n\nA warm bath/shower in the morning can help loosen things up nicely.  Stretching in the shower, or shortly after, can help work out some of the strains and aches you.  Movement in general can really help, if you do it properly.  My knees are absolutely fucked, and the best thing I ever did for myself was get one of those $5 peddling machines and use it for a few minutes each day.  The lack of resistance helps me just move, which is amazing for loosening up everything in my knees.  I would definitely try something, if joints are what are mainly concerning you, that helps you just move.\n\nIf you drink consistently, cutting down helps.  Alcohol can lead to joint pain and swelling, even just a beer or two.  When I got my knees replaced and I was going through withdrawal with pain medication, since beer was a depressant, I would drink a bit in the hops that it would help relax me enough to sleep.  It did not work, after coming off the meds I was awake for about a week straight, AND my knees started aching enough that I was legitimately concerned that I would injured myself when I was on the meds and just starting to feel it.  Turns out it was just the few beers I was having at night to try and tire myself out.  I cut those out and my knees still hurt, but they were not quite as swollen as they had been.\n\nWhat really helped me, though, was just laying down instead of sitting up when I was at home watching TV/reading/playing PS4 so my legs were not dangling, and then putting a box under my feet at work or when I am on the computer to stop my legs from dangling.  Once I did that, I was able to make my posture 10x better than it had been to that point, which has helped slow the degradation of my hips and lower back pretty substantially.\n\nLast but not least, ice packs and heating pads.  They are absolutely magical.  Heat for dull, achy pains and ice packs to numb sharper pain.  It is honestly wonderful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck, my friend, feel free to PM me if you have any questions.", "Would you rather have a child with or without your dwarfism?

Hello everyone, I actually do not have dwarfism however I am very short (I am 5'2, less than 1st percentile in height). I have been struggling with self-esteem for a while now because of my height (a long with other physical traits but my height remains my biggest insecurity) and even get suicidal thoughts at times because of it. I just wanted to ask how you handled your insecurities and self-esteem issues if you had them to sort of guide me to accepting myself. This is probably a better fit for /r/short as what an lp faces and what a \u201cshort\u201d person faces are not comparable. I can honestly say 5'2 is nothing to feel bad about. I agree with ZeroMidget that you face is not the same as what someone at 3'3 (like me) will face. That said I strongly believe self-esteem goes hand in hand with learning to love yourself and having friends that treat you like every other person. Friends that do not judge you for your appearance but rather judge you for who you are as a person will help you grow. And when you grow as a person then you will begin to love yourself and when you love yourself your self-esteem will get better. But to start you will have to put yourself out there, when I was younger I was extremely shy because of my height and would often hide away from everyone except my immediate family.

I just happened to find the height chart. My BMI scores 'overweight' but my body fat percentage calculation scores 'average', when not questioning my height. \n\nLaron Syndrome is just another word for growth hormone insensitivity. There is enough growth hormone (in most cases), but there are not enough cells (growth hormone receptors) that can process it sufficiently. Each Laron-type person has a 50% chance of having Laron-type baby. LS is not a pituitary disorder.\n\nBody fat percentage calculations that do ask for weight scores me as 'obese'. I am much taller than most people with the condition and I weigh about 122 lbs. It fluctuates from week to week. Even though my BMI is high, I do weigh 'below normal' on the standard CDC weight chart for AP at 20.\n\nI weighed around 130 at 20 and that weight is even off the charts. I am 22 and an African American female. Truncal obesity is common in Laron-type people, but I no longer have that. I was d/x on April 2016 by a Nurse Practitioner at a general clinic. Another general clinic d/x me with 'short stature', but I guess they did not know if I was a dwarf yet since I was under 21 (the max growth spurt age for AP). \n\nIf there is a Laron Syndrome weight chart, I doubt it would be the best for me when determining weight because most females are slightly over 4 feet.

I am interested in designing and making clothing for little people (specifically starting with women and hopefully branching out)  using my own sewing abilities -- but before doing that I need to know more about if that is realistically possible? I have done pattern making before but I am not sure if there is anything I would need to take into consideration when scaling patterns up or down for alternate sizing.\nWhat is everyone is opinion?

It is a great talk, very informing. She is also a LP herself. I am 4\u201d9 I also hem and alter clothes, I also buy children\u2019s clothes for me. But when you have curves as well things become a lot more tricky. I have stopped buying a lot of new clothes I mainly buy second hand so I can Frankenstein stuff together to fit correctly. I found the TED talk, and it was really informative, thank you! The point she makes about wanting clothing that reflects her personality really hit at what I want to do.\nMy mom is a seamstress herself and has been for decades, and when I ran the idea by her she said \"little people just buy children's clothing\" and brushed me off. But personally, I am busty for my size and have big thighs, finding clothing is a nightmare sometimes. I cannot imagine what it is like for women with adult women bodies to look for clothing that fits height and curves.\nMaybe I should try for stretchier material? Or add extra seams higher up to allow more fabric at the bust?\nEven not taking that into account, I want all women to feel like the beautiful adult women they are and to be able to find clothes they feel express that. 30 years ago I found a place that had work clothes and Levi's for the Chinese community in Portland. I shopped there forever, had all my needs met. Then the internet was invented and they went left &amp; went online. I do not shop online, but in a new town and looking here for Levi's in short sizes. Do not know if that helps but I do know that many in the Asian community are also short too. Where do they shop? The last time I tried a sewing project, altering a pattern to fit my curves, and almost nonexistent waist (I have ribs that go around the top of my hip bones, because of spinal problems that have robbed me of 4\" of height I did not need to lose) it was so awful and difficult to do.  I really wish the pattern had been made for me and those like me.  It came out wearable but it does not look right at all!   If you make patterns, maybe your costs would be a lot lower to start?  It would leave your customers a lot more room to express their own personalities with fabric choice.    \n\n\nWe all know, realistically, that unless we are thin and well-proportioned enough to venture into Asian clothing, we are going to have to have custom clothing to some extent or other.  I do not know how men manage. Thank you for the input!\nI would thought about selling patterns as well, I appreciate hearing that from you! If it is not a bother could I know some of your measurements? Height, bust, waist, hips? I totally understand if you would rather not though.\nI totally relate.

I wanted to learn how to play guitar, but my fingers are too short to play all the chords, so I thought I would try the ukulele and I can actually play it pretty well now. And a plus is that ukuleles are really easy to carry around.  I have achondroplasia and play guitar. I also know others with achondroplasia that also play. You can get into it for pretty cheap &lt;$100 and you can get it in a smaller body size (3/4, 1/2 etc.) Electric and some acoustic guitars have thinner and narrower necks.

Because every cal counter and nutritionist calls me obese since I am so short. I may be the height of a child, but I am a fully developed woman with womanly features.* \n\nHi all! This is my first post here, so forgive me if I break any rules. I consider myself highly blessed as a little person as I have yet to have any dwarfism related surgeries. I have SED-C which means other than being small, I have a curved spine, but I do not have many issues. I am pretty active. I have always struggled with my weight, though, and as a little person, it is really hard to know what an ideal weight is for my height. Because if you use a calorie counting app or a BMI calculator or ask a nutritionist, they ALWAYS tell me I am obese. But NO ONE tells me what a good, healthy weight would be for me as a woman who has boobs and a booty and hormones. All they do is look at my height and say \"OBESE ALERT.\" I fluctuate between 85-90lbs. \n\nAlso, I workout a lot. Mostly HIIT exercises, but I burn barely ANY calories. Meanwhile my friends burn sometimes 3x the amount with the exact same workout. But for some reason just a brisk walk around the block is so much harder for me and I burn way more. \n\nIf anyone has any insight to this or what a good weight goal is (that is reasonable). Because every calorie counter tells me I can only eat less than 600 cals a day in order to be healthy but then they always have a disclaimer that is like \"it is not good to eat under 1200 cals a day.\" But it is like then what is the best thing for me???? You should consult your doctor about this. \n\nI do not have a weight issue. Never have but yeah some of the BMI calculators say I am obese too. I base it on muscle tone and general \"slimness'. As in, do not look overweight.  In not sure this works for every type of dwarfism though. \n\nCan you just aim to lose weight until you think you look a healthy weight and then just make that your ideal? I had to google what HIIT exercises were. As for why you are not burning many calories doing these - maybe you are not doing the exercises correctly? Maybe your proportions make them easier? I know I can do pushups more easily than my Normate female counterparts and this is not because I am fitter than them.\n\nIf walking around the block burns more calories, then do this. It does strike me as more cardio than HIIT exercises.\n\nReduce your meal sizes and see if you can still function. I have been buying hellofresh meals, which I then halve. It works out pretty good for me. I do not have a weight problem.  \n\nI agree with 'Roses', just aim for a weight that looks not overweight.\n\nAlso, facebook LP forums tend to discuss weight a lot. It is one of their favourite topics. You might get more useful advice from those. Hi im also having a similar problem. Im 3'3 male with SMD(SED varient) and about 35kgs I do not do much working out.

Wondering what your height and their height is and how the relationship has been. I (34, F, 5'9\") have been living with my partner (35, M, 4'3\") for a little over a year so far, if that counts? Relationship is going beautifully. Completely in love and incredibly supportive. Not sure what else to say about it unless you have any specific questions? He is on reddit too and I could probably tag him in if you have a question only he can answer. What are some struggles you have because of the height difference? I am not in one I once dated a girl who was normal height, and kind of seeing someone at the moment who is also normal height. In general, I have found there is much more to dating and people then simply just height, if you both really like each other, it will not really matter. And I would recommend to not think of height as some sort of 'issue', things will play out as they are meant to. How did you two meet? At a festival. I was leading a theme camp and he had camped with our camp at Burning Man (I camped somewhere else) so when he decided to go to the festival, he asked to camp with us and I, of course, agreed. \n\nI did not care much about going out and partying, preferring instead to stay at camp almost the whole time. He too, so we ended up hanging out pretty much all long-weekend. At some point, we kissed, but a lot of people kiss at festivals so neither of us assumed anything by it other than \"we had a moment\".\n\nI was attracted to him at the jump--hes got almost all of the things Im attracted to in men: luscious beard, chest hair, full lips, and an interesting look. He had blue hair at the time. Obviously he stood out due to his height, and I happen to be especially attracted to people who \"stand out\" in a broad sense. And Im especially interested in unique experiences; if someone thinks something is \"weird\", I am probably into it. \n\nNow, I probably could have slept with him at the festival if I was just interested in a novel experience. And I probably would have, had I not been so attune to the concept of fetishization and wanting to deliberately avoid it (especially important for someone like me who is so excited by novelty and uniqueness). But after 3 dates post-festival, it became clear to me that I was attracted to more than the \"novelty\" of his height. I will not lie and say it had NO factor in my initial attraction to him (at least in noticing him), but I wanted to be sure that it was not a MAIN factor before I took things any further than that festival kiss. But the more we talked, the more boxes he would check off on my list of \"ideal partner traits\" and I realized that he was not someone I just wanted to hook up with, but was actually interested in starting a relationship with. He felt the same way.\n\nWe have been together for about 2.5 years now, living together for a little over a year. I can say for certain that he is the best overall partner I have ever had. I honestly could not imagine what a better partner would even entail. \n\nThere are a few times when the height difference is a little annoying (trying to talk while standing in a noisy environment, for example), but the proportion of annoying to super cool (He is adapted to using his feet like another set of hands!) is HEAVILY skewed toward the super cool. Most notably, we do not ascribe to a lot of assigned gender roles. Most of this is not directly related to his height, but it is certainly a welcome and appreciated byproduct of it. For example, I am the strongest person in the house so I end up doing things like yard work, and he does a lot of the household management stuff (e.g. ordering groceries). Its such a refreshing departure from other relationships where I have been told that doing certain things would emasculate my partner, or to \"just sit down and look pretty\", or that I have to do the \"women's tasks\" of the house even if I would prefer others. \n\nMost of the time though, we are eye level with each other because we are either sitting or lounging and I kind of forget about the height difference until we stand up and its like \"oh yeah! That is a thing\". \n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant. I think people are afraid to ask about our relationship for fear of being insensitive, but there are so many unique and wonderful aspects about our relationship that I get so excited to share when someone finally does lol! This might be the first comment I have read on reddit to actually inspire hope in me that I will ever be able to find someone, thank you for sharing your story. Da Happy to help. I hope you find the person that sees your shine soon :) Getting a partner! That is the difficulty;) \n\nMost of us grow up understanding that noone wants to date a dwarf and while it is not entirely true for everyone, it is true for a lot of us. \n\nIf you are in the states I would join the LPA and try and find a partner there. I understand the desire for an AP partner, after all, why should our height define us and dictate our partners also have dwarfism? It is fucked.\n\nBut if you want to be pragmatic and be happy, you might want to get over that and just get comfortable being in a happy relationship with someone else with dwarfism. do you want children? If so, are you worried about passing on the gene? Beyond the social implications, there are also many medical complications with diff dwarfism types Thanks for asking! Yes, I do want children, and so does he; we talked about it when we started getting serious. I asked him how he felt about passing on the gene, which I feel should have more bearing than my opinion. After all, he is the one who has had to live with achondroplasia, he knows what complications there are and how life is with this condition. For me to make a definitive statement as to whether or not I wanted to pass on the gene, without having lived with it, felt very...eugenic-y? Idk. \n\nOn the one hand, of course I would want my child(ren) to have the greatest chance at success in all areas of life. On the other hand, there are a lot of other, less obvious conditions but equally or more serious that are passed generically. Like, if I was born with a genetic congenital heart condition, would I rule out biological children? Hereditary cancer? Mental Illness? Addiction? Not that they are the same, but where is the line, ya know? \n\nBefore we met, he said he made peace with the idea of never being a biological parent, because he assumed that his partner would not want to have a dwarf baby. I love the idea of a mini him running around, and know that health issues can arise but if my partner is not too afraid of them, neither am I.  He knows more than I ever could about what it is like growing up and living with achondroplasia; so I pretty much defer to him on that front. I just know for sure that I want to parent a child with him, regardless of the genetic composition of the child(ren). I really want to experience pregnancy and childbirth (and the idea of trying for a baby sounds super hot lol), but I am 34 with PCOS so it may be harder to conceive naturally anyway, and I would rather foster/adopt than do IVF/etc. \n\nSo, who knows. I would love to incubate a little him in my belly, and he wants to go the natural route as well. I welcome unique experiences and am pretty confident that we could navigate whatever challenges came our way. I am dreading the likelihood of needing a c section due to a larger cranium, as I have always wanted to experience natural childbirth and hate the medicalization of the birth process. But ultimately, we do not always get what we want, and the most important thing is getting to raise a family with this incredible man. Whether he is the shortest person in the family or not does not make that much of a difference. okay cool! yeah one of my favorite shows is Little Women LA and one season they were all either pregnant or trying to be pregnant so this was on my mind.

My work has a unique work opportunity (paid) in North Carolina coming up on December 10/11 that specifically requires a couple of individuals with dwarfism.. we are having major difficulty connecting with the right people in order to fill this requirement. You would be assisting in a military training exercise and 1) must be able to travel to NC the morning of December 10th through evening of December 11th, travel and lodging paid for, 2) When called upon, be able to act out a scenario put together by the exercise coordinators, which may require being in proximity to simulation gunfire &amp; explosives, and 3) maintain a can-do, motivated, professional attitude throughout the evening with the understanding that your participation is assisting in training our military's elite. You would be paid a flat rate in addition to travel &amp; lodging covered.

Please private message me if you are interested in details (you will be required to sign an NDA prior, due to the nature of our company). Ngl the fact that you do not mention any details other than the state and your profile is new (made today) seems kind of suspicious. You say actors/actresses would be a good fit, why not go to casting agencys. Honestly, I work on the HR/administrative side (not the staffing side), so I probably come off as some crazy suspicious creep when I am just typically the one being crazy about agreements, NDA's, etc especially given our clientele (lol). I also thought this would be a breeze to fill but every casting agency specalizing in hiring \"little people\"/those with dwarfism wants an astronomical amount of money for the equivalent of probably 1HR of work tops (just a lot of \"hurry up and wait\", standing around, and so on).

I was that kid behind the gym, the kid chosen last, the kid who could not sink a basketball or run a quarter mile for any incentive. When I was younger we had programs in our district where we would try and get little people to be more physically active and this would involve playing sports on a level playing field.\n\nI do not know who your coaches were, it sucks if they were like that, but I always participated in the things I wanted, I was even on the highschool football team, did not care if I was putting myself in physical danger, I knew my own limits and did not have any grandiose expectations. I do not know if it will work for you but I have had the same issue. At one point, I nearly killed myself on one of those moving stairs machines. I am 4'10 and my legs are just under 24 inches long. Just enough for everything to be annoying. I cannot fit on standing bicycles and treadmills hurt my knees and back. \n\nHowever, I did manage to find something that does work.

So during early to middle childhood I was diagnosed with pituitary dwarfism as I produced so little growth hormone I hardly grew. I was projected to have a height of 4\u2019-4\u20196\u201d without treatment. As a result I had to have medical treatment (hormones, X-rays, contrast tests, nutrition supplements) to achieve a height within an appropriate percentile. However I still spent much of my childhood as a dwarf, and underweight for my height at that. My treatment was a success and as an adult I am actually above average in height. Despite this I find it hard to identify with people who do not have dwarfism or growth problems, even if they are shorter than me, as I feel I have not shared the same experiences. As an adult I feel it almost inappropriate to identify more with little people/dwarves as I am no longer physically a dwarf despite having childhood experiences with it and having the medical issue slightly impact me today. I would like to make a note that this was a truly dwarfism based on the size and amount of hormones produced by my pituitary gland, not simply a deficit of HGH that would make someone a bit shorter (I have no hard feelings for people with this)\n\nI suppose my question is what is the perception of people who are little people/dwarves as adults of someone who had their dwarfism treated? Is it wrong for me to want to identify more with little people/dwarves in terms of experiences because I feel I shared more with them as a child than people who did not have dwarfism?

All of a sudden you are an outsider in a very niche community. \n\nNot many people can relate to that. Not many people can relate to being you.\n\nBut hell that is the human experience is not it. It is different for everyone, you have a few things in common with them. Drink to that, talk about teh problems that only they would understand. \n\nThat is childhood, and the further you get away from that the more you reflect on it, and the less you have that you can relate to. That is a new community you are forming now, work, partners, the experiences you are going to have are going to put you in a new club. That does not diminish the value of all the communities you previously had anything in common with, because they are YOUR experiences. You will find you are not exactly the cookie cutter template borne human in your new club, but it also means you bring soemthing new to the table. Revel in it, draw the lines between your experiences. \n\nThis is not I think, exclusive to dwarfism reversed, but it is more to do with the human condition. If we find ourselves without doubt, we find new doubts for ourselves. \n\nThat this matters to you, hold on to that. It makes you a good egg. Even if it is a slightly taller egg than you thought you would grow up to be :) As someone who would give just about anything to have a cure be possible for me, this seems like considering yourself as a cancer patient when you are in remission.\n\nEnjoy the fuck out of being healthy and normal now, on behalf of those of us who cannot.

", "Please see comment for my question  Forgive me if this is odd. Our good friend has proportional dwarfism (I believe that is what it is called?)He pointed out that my 2.5 year old son shares many similarities as he did as a child. We have had alot of issues medically since he was born including hearing problems, multiple ear infections, severe eczema, tubes in ears, delayed speech, delayed crawling/walking. He also shakes violently in the morning which appears like a low blood sugar thing but the doctors cannot figure it out and have called it hereditary tremors. He had problems gaining weight as a baby but appears fine now. He has always been shorter and \u201cstocky\u201d. We have always been concerned about the shape of his head and his non existent nose bridge. I am just curious what you all see when you look at him? Is it even possible to have dwarfism and not know until much later in a child\u2019s life? To my nonmedical eye, he looks like a cute kid! Its  possible he has dwarfism... But idk. I think it is more likely he has something else going on. The delayed speech is from the tubes/ear infections &amp; hearing loss for instance.            \n          \nCould you meet with a geneticist to see if you or SO to see if you have any risk factors? What does his pediatrician say? &gt; The inherited variety of essential **tremor** (familial **tremor**) is an autosomal dominant disorder. A defective gene from just one parent is needed to pass on the condition. If you have a parent with a genetic mutation for essential **tremor**, you have a 50 percent chance of developing the disorder yourself.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt; (   \n\n\nMy son had developmental delays (and some odd splinter skills) and by the time he was grown up, the conclusion was that he has autism.  With so many of these childhood disorders, expert early intervention is absolutely vital.    \n\n\nTremors, eczema, delayed milestones esp. speech, and hearing issues--all of these should be addressed ASAP by experts so that the best help happens before developmental windows close down.    \n\n\nGah, right now so many things are harder to access, and you cannot get this time back.  I hope he has health insurance? Your insurance should help you find a good developmental pediatrician, who can then line up experts in other fields who can help your son.   Most school districts are required to start providing services to children like yours when they are very little.  Speech therapy and hearing aids (etc.) can make a HUGE difference.  I am not an expert but I know from our experiences that we could not possibly have found our son the right help in time without help, and that help starts with the developmental pediatrician and your school district. Preface: Not a clinician but I was misdiagnised with SEDc and eventually diagnosed myself with MPS IVA by reading an obscene amount of peer-reviewed medical articles. I am also on a lot of skeletal dysplasia groups so I am aware of some of the more obscure forms that are out there. \n\nAll that being said, **please take everything I say with a grain of salt.**\n\nSEMD-JL (Spondyloepimetaphyseal Dysplasia With Joint Laxity)? I am solely basing that off the fact that your son looks a little similar to another child I have seen with it. \n\nThe non-existent nose bridge is often a sign of genetic disorders that are inherited recessively and I think the large head (macrocephaly) might also be indicative of that. \n\nPlease, please, PLEASE take him to see a geneticist as soon as you are able to. They will be able to make an accurate diagnosis. Do you live in the US and which part? LPA maintains a list of skeletal dysplasia clinics. We have worked with two clinics and they are wonderful. \n\nHas anyone done x-rays on your son? Our doctors would not even mention dwarfism until my daughter was four, and at that point we sought out a skeletal dysplasia clinic and that was step one in the whole process (at that point all genetic tests came up empty-- it turned out her genetic mutation is not on standard panels.) Her local doctors were saying she was proportionate and had failure to thrive, but x-rays showed she actually had SED (which often looks proportionate until kids are a little older.) Many kids do not have a nose bridge!  He is so cute.  is his head on the growth charts for standard height children?  What is his percentile?

(sorry if those are not the correct terms) \"that I have dwarfism\" not \"that I am a dwarf\". People are not 'other things' because they have a skeletal dysplasia. \n\nAnyway, technically you do have dwarfism because the label applies to any man under 5'1\" and any women under 4' 9\". Dwarfism is not a specific condition. It is a label for extreme short stature, cause irrelevant. \n\nAre your parents small? You might have some kind of rare skeletal dysplasia that no one has bothered to study or diagnose. I have read a few articles about women who are very short who get diagnosed late in life as \"maybe having hypochondroplasia\". But it effects them so little that nobody looked into it. hey, sorry, English is not my first language, I did not mean to offend or use terms or words that offend anyone. I am from Guatemala so yeah my size is in my genes, but I have no developmental issues of any form. honestly I am sorry if I used hurtful words, I will be more careful from now on, and thanks for your thoughtful reply! I am 4'6 or so and also have no dwarfism condition diagnosed. It is fine--some people just get all up in arms about semantics of word choice, is all. Talk to your doctor about it if you are curious enough about your genes. I was not offended. Just letting you know the better way to talk about it. \"up in arms\" is a bit of an overstatement. I was letting him know how I like my disability to be talked about. It is also just better English. \n\nLanguage is important. It is why I do not go around calling people \"cunts\" unless I want to offend them. What makes you think you do not have Dwarfism? \n\n\"Dwarfism is generally defined as an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches (147 centimeters) or less. The average adult height among people with dwarfism is 4 feet (122 cm).August 17, 2018\"\n\n I would say that terminology is up to the individual. We get the same thing in the disability community, where they are people offended by things such as \"I am disabled\". Though if there are people who want to refer to themselves like that, who are we to say they cannot? I think when we hear about or see people with Dwarfism, we often see Disproportionate Dwarfism. Hence why you may think you do not have it. Like someone else said, best to talk with your doctor about it if you have concerns or need a diagnosis. The term \"I am disabled\" is a UK thing and links to the Social model of Disability'\" which states that \"Society's intolerance of difference, 'disables' the individual\". \n\nIt is a way to communicate that external forces are disabling - not natural bodies. \n\nIt is also very different from saying \"I am a disabled' or \"I am a cripple\" which would indicate that you are defined by the disability and that this is the most important thing about you.\n\n\"I am a dwarf\" literally defines you by your height. Which is absurd. I might as well be \"A gay\" or \"a black\". What I am is a person with a noticeable physical characteristic of dwarfism. \n\nI am not a language nazi. I know when someone is trying to be rude and when they just do not know. But I will suggest better ways of engaging with me and my disability if there are better ways to do so.\n\nAnyway, you all  have totally hijacked this thread - which is actually about the difference between pathological dwarfism and normal inherited short-stature - super ironic given you all claim to be \"not fussed\" about language. \"With me\" except this post was not about you. Also I see no issue with it, because someone can be all these things. People commonly say \"I am a teacher\" for instance. They can also be a man, black, so on. It is just one of many things we are. If you have an issue being refered to as such, then that is fine. Though going at someone for how they refer to themselves is what irritates me. Anyway, I think we both said our piece so we can be done with it. And yet, you are currently having a go at me for suggesting better language use - even when the original poster indicated they would be open to guidance on the matter. \n\n \"I am a teacher\" is very different from \"I am a dwarf\" and you bloody know it. What an insincere comparison. One is clearly an occupation and one is clearly an identity issue. Also, one of these things has not historically been used to ridicule us and strip us of our \"personhood\", over and over again. \n\nAnd do not shut this thread down by \"we have both said our piece\". I have not finished saying mine. Wanker. \n\nNow let us agree to disagree. \ud83d\ude44 You are not you when you are hungry, here, have a snickers. You may have one of the 400 forms of skeletal dysplasia that causes dwarfism have you even had genetic testing!?\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f There is honestly nothing wrong with what OP said...I get that you are expressing that you have a preference of how it should be talked about, but that is not the defacto better way to talk about it. And straight up telling someone it should be \"X, not Y\" is not just expressing a preference. It is okay, you did not say anything wrong pal. There are other ways to talk about it, and saying \"a dwarf\" is also acceptable. \"I am a dwarf\"... I get how it is a common phrase, and hey, it is a hell of a lot better than \"midget\" but I just think we can do better in 2021. \n\nPersonally, I would prefer to be \"A woman\" and if it is relevant, \"a woman with dwarfism\". \n\nDwarf, gay, black... These are all adjectives. Describing words. A dwarf, A black, A gay are using describing words as nouns. It is just not good English and it is not necessary. \"A woman\" is exactly the same thing...\n\nI call myself a dwarf, and I will continue to do so because it feels comfortable for me. I refer to myself as a person with dwarfism as well, but I really do not have a problem with either and will switch between the two. \"Dwarf\" is not an adjective, either. It is a noun and is primarily used as a noun. Sometimes used as a verb (eg, to dwarf something) but that is about it, it makes more grammatical sense to use it as a noun. Dwarfism is an adjective. No need to use it as a noun at all. \n\nWhen you say you are a dwarf, you immediately other yourself. As in, you are not like other people, you are a dwarf. It is so reductive. Is this seriously such a massive deal that it trump's every other thing about you? It is not a big deal to me lol, which is why I use both terms interchangeably. You are also saying \"dwarfism is an adjective\", also no? It is categorically not. \n\nI get that you are not changing your view any time soon, I do not intend to change it, as I do not even have any issue with it. Just thought your wording was a bit harsh to OP when he did not say anything wrong, and it is a shame they have since deleted their account.\n\n&gt;Is this seriously such a massive deal that it trump's every other thing about you?\n\nNo it is really not. Just like you saying you are a woman does not then mean that is your most defining trait. It is just a label to use when relevant, which is not that often, because it does not trump every other thing about me. I will also describe myself as \"A Scot\" does not mean me being Scottish is the all encompassing identifier I have, or make it reductive. Using nouns to refer to yourself is not inherently bad. Lol. Sure, I was so harsh he deleted his account. If that is truly the case, he is pretty fragile. \n\nTell me, can you give me another example of any other disability that causes someone to say they \"are\" that disability? \n\nMaybe \"a retard\"? Does not sound like I would be a fan of that either. A spastic? Nup, also not a fan. I would stick with person with and intellectual Disability' and person with cerebral palsy. Person first language is the trend these days. \n\nWhen people say refer to me as a dwarf, I know that is all they see about me. When hear people saying \"would you ever date a dwarf?\" I would know that they did not see me as a normal women. \n\n\"A dwarf\" is a stigmatised identity in Australia. It is not a simple statement of height. It is mainly used as a value statement and used to diminish every other aspect about you. Even when people use it innocently it often reveals their perception of you as \"different\". Autistic people generally do not like person first language, as they feel that their autism is an inherent part of who they are and do not what to downplay it. So that would be one example. \"An amputee\" would be another. \"A quadriplegic\" would be another.\n\nThis sounds like a difference in culture, then. Dwarf is not stigmatised in the UK, and is still very must the default term used in a very neutral way. I could totally understand not wanting to use dwarf if it was used in a diminishing/insulting way in the culture you live in. I lived in the UK for 7 years. I was called a midget so often over there, I was grateful to be referred to as \"a dwarf\". \n\nMaybe I just have higher standards than you after being back so long. I get called midget constantly, yeah. I have never had \"dwarf\" used to refer to me in any way that was insulting or othering. I have never felt negative connotations from it. And I have enough self-esteem to not take shit from people or let people demean me, even in tone. This is not a matter of me having lower standards for myself and I do not appreciate the insinuation. Actually, historically the word \"midget\" is the term that has been used to ridicule a person with dwarfism. Referring to someone with dwarfism as a dwarf is no different than referring to someone with paraplegia as a paraplegic. The diagnostic term before the different types of dysplasia were introduced and used was dwarfism. It definitely is not an identity issue since before and medical diagnosis or descriptive words we are human beings. The only way this term could be an identity issue would be dependent on the person individually. Hmm, I think people triage offence. Attitudes are certainly getting better in Australia... At least, you get less overt rudeness. There is still plenty of bigotry. \n\nIt is easier to start thinking about Dwarf as noun being unnecessary when you are not dealing with \"midget\" all the time. I know this because Dwarf as noun only started bothering me when I stopped hearing midget all the time. I was just really greatful to not be referred to as a midget. \n\nAfter a while of being just called my name, I realised there is very little reason to refer to me as a dwarf at all. Why that height specifically? Genuinely curious Wish I had a better answer. I think it is a general guideline based on people with it tending to be that height or below. I however, take it height alone does not determine having dwarfism. Technically you have dwarfism, because you are below the threshold height that is used to define dwarfism. There are a tonne of conditions and gene combinations that result in dwarfism.\n\nI met a guy once who was 4\". He claimed not to have dwarfism because he was short due to having Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). OI is actually listed in wikipedia as being a known condition to cause dwarfism - lol. I suspect he chose to define dwarfism as referring to people with disproportionate dwarfism, which might be what you are doing.", "Question for little people! sorry its kind of long :/  I am going to apologize ahead of time if this is a stupid question or ignorant in any way, it is not intended to be..i am just very uneducated on the subject of little people and their lifestyles.

Our question is, is it difficult to find these types of things made for little people? Do you have to get them custom made? Is it expensive?

I do not hear this so much anymore but back in the day I definitely did. \n\nThe answer is that \"midget\" is an offensive slang term and Dwarf is a scientific term that can be used without offense at all. Keeping in mind that some little people (which is the PC term that can be used interchangeably with Dwarf, more or less)  use the term midget comedically (like Brad Williams who is a stand-up with dwarfism) or because they might think the PC term is silly.

We are well aware that there are facial similarities with this particular type. You do not need to tell us. \n\nHmm...as far as challenges go?

It would be a complete victory, in my mind, if it were cured. Well no, being short is not a disease!

Suddenly, things were thrown into perspective and ai became very thankful for so many aspects of my life.  This is not to say that you should be thankful because it could always be worse, I just hope it does not take something so dramatic to help you realize how amazing you all are. It took a long time, but I can definitely say that I like myself just how I am: Broken and  oddly shaped with the mental and physical scars to show for it left by the growing pains from years past and ready to experience whatever new ones the future holds. As a dwarf who is unashamed and loves who they are.\n\nThat is just me though. They will have more career opportunities open to them and find dating easier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe just as easier for both the above if attitudes and representations changed to be more positive and more 'human' \n\nOh so we would much rather give in to the low of societies selfish biased expectations?.. rather than properly teach society the moral values like we have done with many other forms of diverse groups! each to their own but this drug are not really a choice. \n\nProduced by average height people, decidied by average height people (only the infants are the ones with dwarfism involved)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConcerns from many deliberately ignored just showing how harshly biased and anti-short height equality this messed up world is still in! They will also be able to ride a commercially available bike and drive a car without expensive and dangerous mods. They will be able to participate more easily in sports. There is heaps of practical, all be it no-idealogical, advantages to not being small. \n\nTheoretically all of these challenges should be resolved by embracing a 'social model of disability' but a cure is easier if it is available and social change is slow and probably dependent of vast amounts of national wealth, which climate change will soon deprive us of anyway. \n\nI actually used to feel like you about this but now I am just like, fuck life would be easier without this fight. And I would take a cure in a fucking heartbeat. Reminds me of people in the deaf community that advocate for preserving deafness. There is nothing wrong with being deaf, but that does not mean it is something we should be encouraging. Easier to just give up defeat?! Wow! Great! I do not understand you think is being defeated... Actually, further disability makes me more inclined to push for a cure. As someone with short limbed dwarfism, becoming paraplegic or losing an arm or becoming blind would be way more debilitating than it would be had I not had dwarfism. I would not be able to wheel a manual wheelchair, dress myself or reach for the brail placed out of reach on a wall.   \n\n\nThis knowledge actually makes me feel pretty vulnerable. Just wondering if you can post a link that contains more information on the treatment? I am just wondering because there are over 200 different types of dwarfism, which is a genetic disease in almost all forms. It  does not make sense that all forms of dwarfism can be cured with one specific treatment when you consider that the chromosomal mutations occur within different parts of a chromosome and in different chromosomes depending on the type of dwarfism a person has. This is referring to biomarin's injectable drug for achondroplasia. It is called vostoritide. Thanks OP needs to understand the complete definition of \u201cdisease\u201d as I think they are relying on the \u201cacquired disease\u201d definition. Here is the complete definition from Wiki, does achondroplasia fall into any of the four categories? ( And type of dwarfism that is centered on the FGF3 receptor will be included. Achondroplasia is just the easiest to use with clinical trials. The drug is not a cure. It is more similar to a dietary supplement. It is dampening a cell signal receptor that is overactive in achondroplasia. It will universally affect all cell types that express this receptor. So it should affect multiple aspects of achondroplasia. Patients are reporting improved muscle tone with more energy at the end of the day and are sleeping better, walking farther without squatting for a rest, running faster, enjoying all kinds of sports more. But it should also give more support for the back and knees in adults so to avoid surgery. Yes, eventually this drug is not just going to be for kids, but all ages. As I stated, it is not going to \u201ccure\u201d anything but it will improve quality of life for those with achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and a few other chondroplasias.", "By request of TehkSmall I post a picture of the time I met Kiran Shah at a movie set, we went out drinking.

I am still learning Was not this question asked recently? I could be wrong, but it seems very familiar Pretty sure I have not seen it here before. But if you find it,  I would be really grateful if you could direct me to it The problem with HR policy towards/for LP means that you are effectively pointing out differences; which becomes a circular chicken and egg issue with trying to make things more fair and balanced for them.\n\nLook, I get it. LP are people too and we want to make the world easier and better for them. My wife is a LP and I go out of my way to make my apartment more accessible for her, but if we suddenly had a policy or rule in place to accommodate her; then that may be a step too far.\n\nMost \u201cpolicy\u201d could easily be avoided through either adherence to the ADA or common sense/decency:\n\n1. Treat people how you would like to be treated.\n2. Recognize everyone is not the same and do your best to help them.\n3. Do not be a dick.\n4. Do not dwell on what makes us different, instead focus on what we have in common. But for an organization that is just getting started, what subtle things do you think we can include (either in physical infrastructure/specific policies) to create a company culture that does not put LP at a disadvantage?\n\nNot as something that we are suddenly introducing but rather as something that we have incorporated from the beginning. It does seem weird having a targeted policy for a specific disability. However, if you think you need one, here are some thoughts based on my own career experience / talking with others :\n\nDo not develop a promotion structure that relies on having held some lower level position that requires physical labour. This is a structural barrier to people with physical disabilities climbing the career ladder. There should be multiple pathways for career development.    \n\nOpenly encourage diversity and have strong anti-bullying policies. This really does help stop toxic work cultures develop. People with disabilities (and other minorities) can be really disadvantaged in bully / hostile work environments.  \n\nHave simple processes in place to enable the person with dwarfism to make the environment physically accessible. I work in large organisations and having to navigate funding / approval processes to buy something as simple as a stool, is waaay too hard. I am always on my own to do this. There is not never any sort of team / person to assist me with this and it annoys me. \n\nWhen coming up with Christmas party ideas, have a policy in place to ensure you pick accessible venues that all your staff can attend. I once knew a women with dwarfism who used a wheelchair and her workplace was forever throwing functions on the top levels of pubs with no elevator access. Yep this is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nThing is, we are a new company and we have just started our hiring process. We have received applications from several talented LP and we really want to give them the best work environment possible. \n\nThe thought is that if we incorporate this from the beginning, it will not be seen as something extra but rather as something normal What industry is this? Dwarfism is not that common.... I find it hard to believe one job advert has received multiple applications from people with dwarfism? We are in the Marketing Industry. \n\nDesigning Marketing strategies for our clients and providing them with viable options to further their presence in the market.\n\nThe jobs we posted at the moment for the new building, are mostly backend and does not require much client interaction which I suspect is the reason for the high number of applicants. We have around 10 LP in the 150 applications we received and were satisfied with quite a few of them. Just wanted to make sure that no one feels left out. Wow. Given dwarfism is like 1 in 200k this statistic is crazy high! Amazing. \n\nAnyway, really happy you are putting so much consideration into this. I remember entering the job market and getting rejected on sight before I would even open my mouth. I was the classic disabled person over achiever too. Did not seem to matter. Your assumption that LPs would prefer non client facing jobs shows a prejudice that I hope will not flow through to your hiring practices. This is actually an assumption I have heard multiple times and I do not believe it is accurate or informed. I have a client facing role and I love it. Yep makes sense. It is biases like these that we are trying hard to avoid at our place, but individuals(like me for example) still keep making these mistakes once in a while.

I was born extremely premature and I have a fraternal twin of normal height. I was two pounds three ounces and eleven inches at two and half months premature. I have proportional dwarfism. I do not know what kind or the details because I was diagnosed as a child and it was not shared with me until later in life. It is a long story, suffice to say a lot of my history was/is hidden from me by my mother. As an adult I went looking for my medical history, which is massive. However, there was a fire at the hospital I was born at; where I went to for years; and my history was gone.  My doctor does not want to perform any testing because he says it does not really matter. Sigh. \n\nI try to use humor as a coping mechanism. I am a bit like a squashed human. I have large shoulders and a brick like appearance. I was finally able to keep a pregnancy and now I have an average sized seven month old. Actually, she is a bit tall for her age. I love her and am thankful every day for her.\n\nI might not face the same issues as everyone else with dwarfism but I do have them. Oh, and recently discovered that had my parents given me growth hormones I might be a lot taller. But I am okay with my height. I am accepting of my body, not happy with it but accepting. My health is alright, which is okay. A lot of my issues stem from being premature rather than dwarfism. \n\nI have only met one other person with dwarfism. We hung out a few times but she moved and this was before internet was everywhere. Yeah, whatever I am old :P \n\nSo, yeah. Um, Hi. Only some types of dwarfism can achieve added height via growth hormone.  Are you upset that you did not get the benefit of growth hormones?  My child's dwarfism responds to growth hormone but I am not giving them to him because his bones do not grow properly. I am not so much mad at not being given growth hormones I am more upset about not having the choice to make an informed decision. There is a lot about my health that I have no clue on as a child because my mother does not like talking about it. She would only talk to the doctors when I was not in ear shot and the nurses would never give me any information. I never knew what was going to happen when I went to the hospital or doctor's office. She says she did not want me to know because she did not want me to feel like I was different. My dad is an amputee from his teen years. Sickness/illness/disabilities is not handled normally in my family. It is sort of just glossed over. So, if you son is old enough maybe you can talk to him about it? Not saying that you do not... However, if the side effects are too risky then growth hormones are not really a choice or option at all. If he is old enough he will understand. Yes he is not shielded from any of it and taking care of his health will need to be a lifelong process so I am hoping to have a healthy attitude toward it always.\n\nSome off his docs day gh would be ok. Others acknowledge that his disproportion would He worsened and we would be risking causing more pain bc of the way his elbows and wrists are. It sounds like you are doing just fine. Do not worry too much about regrets later. My situation is not the norm. I am sure your son will understand the measures needed to keep him healthy and happy. Good luck, and good health. Hi, I am 37F Australian. Happy to chat. I am trying to have a kid right now so maybe we have some stuff in common. I am also an identical twin, we are the same height obvs.   \n\n\nAre you sure you even have skeletal dysplasia? You might just be really short due to the premmie thing. You could try posting a photo on LP Facebook groups and ask for people's opinions about what you have. Many of us are pretty good and diagnosing other people:) In fact, some of us love to do it! Hello, \n\nSorry for the late reply. My twin is fraternal and she is taller than me.

Instead there are entire races of people who are just of small stature (hobbits, halflings, dwarves, gnomes, etc.)\n\nIn the material I am writing, however, there will be little people (like in Game of Thrones) who are the result of hormonal deficiency or genetic mutations.\n\nSo I have a few questions regarding the appropriate use of Little People:\n\nA) I would like to present to the players of my campaign the ability to choose a stature for their character. This is a fantasy and so I do not plan on including any complications of being a little person (such as scoliosis, arthritis, breathing problems, or hydrocephalus). D&amp;D provides a game mechanic called size category, and choosing to be a little person will set your size category to **small** instead of the default **medium**, and has no negative effect. Is this appropriate? I do not want to make light of the challenges little people face.\n\nB) In the material I am writing, being a little person will be much more prevalent than in reality - maybe about 5-10% of the population will be little people. Like in D&amp;D (where there are races of little people) I am planning on making accommodations for little people commonplace. I can think of things like chairs, counters, bathrooms, but I am at a loss as to what other physical features of a medieval setting would need accommodations.\n\nC) I would like to use the term 'little person' in the material I am writing. I am shying away from using 'dwarf' or 'dwarfism' because I do not want to confuse the terms with fantasy dwarves (and is fantasy like Game of Thrones, I feel the term 'dwarf' borders on derogatory anyway). In addition, I am using the terms 'typical' and 'big person' for those without size differences and for those with gigantism respectively. Are these terms ok?\n\nThanks for letting me ask these questions. I appreciate any and all feedback and criticism. just my opinion A) its fantasy go for it B) suggest adding some sort mode of transport, since horses would be too big, maybe rams? C)i have never really found \"little person, or little people\" to be offensive. Thank you!\n\nRegarding transportation, I will not be using earth-like animals so I am free to make up whatever I want so I will now include domesticated creatures suitable for little people. Instead of typical, can you do \"average\"? Yooooooo this is my question, I have hormonal based dwarfism and do DND haha. I see no problem with having a section of the population being smaller and in a smaller size category, but would think of creative names for those who are part of the same race but in separate size categories, a name that is not diminutive but somewhat descriptive. Perhaps the grounded and the ascended? Or the sleuth and the Fair? Yes.  Not halfling. Definitely not that Definitely. I also noticed the LPA website uses \"average-sided.\" I went with \"typical\" because it is used for neurotypical and neurodivergent, and did not want to use something like \"normal\" They are definitely not grouped with demons. They are grouped with elves because they are humanoids but are not human. In dnd they are a completely different race.", "Looking for Little People So, I am not a Little Person.

And although we may come from different walks of life, different shapes and sizes, different colours and tongues, different ages and ideas, we all have one commonality. We all have an unique individual experience of what it means to be alive as a member of the human race. A story of our own that reflects a small part of our entire existence. \n\nThe sheer size of that number has always overwhelmed me. 7.7 billion different experiences. Imagine the amount of stories humanity must hold with that many people. The number is uncountable. Imagine how many will be forgotten, or worse, how many will never be told at all. The rest of the world would never know them. Never laugh or cry at them. Never learn from them or be inspired by them. Because we will can never know what our stories might mean to another human being somewhere on our planet. \n\nAnd so I have started working on my new book. A celebration of humanity. Hundreds of short stories from all around the world that aim to capture what it means to be human and to be alive. These stories could be about anything.\u00a0 Anything that forms a part of your existence and experience of life. Whether it be a poem, a descriptive piece, a story of future dreams or a retelling of past memories, it does not matter. There is no limit on what it means to be human. It does not need to have a deeper meaning or a specific point. It does not need to have characters or a plotline. It does not even need to be real. It can be a complete creation of imagination. \n\nWhatever story you wish to tell, I want to hear it.

I am 4,6 so I am not the shortest dwarf if that makes sense but I was curious to know if this is a long shot or not any help or comments are welcomed Trade jobs really are going to depend on a variety of factors.  Yes, there are a ton of dwarfs in trades.  I mechanic and maintain my home as well.  I have friends who are firefighters, HVAC, etc.\n\nBut you need to ask yourself, honestly : do you want to do labor that is going to put stress and strain on your body?  Can your body maintain this for years to come?  How about your health?\n\nBy no means am I saying \"fuck your dreams, be like everyone else\".  Exactly the opposite, as the more tradesmen we have as LPs the better.  Fuck all of those who think entertaining is the only way to live as an LP.  I am just saying everyone is different health wise, and that is the biggest consideration.  Also wingspan, how long your arms are, can be an issue to consider as well. I work admin side in a turnaround maintenance company, so tradesmen of ALL types. \n\nJobs like these tend to come with strict guidelines on what companies are willing to take risks on to the point that people are found to work that meet those guidelines. This is not as much about dwarfism as much as it is about hiring anyone that requires accommodation in any fashion. In the long term, this affects the types and quality of jobs you get hired on for.

To preface this, though I am not a diagnosed little person, I am smaller than average at 4'9. \n\nI have recently been employed with quite a large bike company and have been motivated to take up cycling again as an adult. When shopping for a bike  I spoke to a few people throughout my business and there was only one (adult) bike that would fit me out of everything we had going. I went to a local shop and again they only had one option. While searching online there was little in the way of something that fit, without being a child's bike or custom made.\n\nI want to push for my company to work on a solution, though I do not know what that would look like yet. A page that allows you to input measurements to find bikes with the right fit? A new company partnership with a company like Bike Friday? Finding pro cyclists who happen to be little people to partner with?  \n\nWe are UK based but sell internationally. Have I missed a beat and there is already a company filling this gap I missed? Is there a market for it at all? I would love to be able to buy a decent bike one day, and have some options to choose from!\n\nI would love to hear your input if this is worth pursuing or if I am off in left field! I am a keen cyclist and have been for years. I am not pro though, none of us would be as there are no competitions for people with dwarfism. I have ridden with hand cyclists with disabilities but they kick my ass by miles due to: \n\n1. Their arm length\n2. Their excellent, elite sport equipment\n\nI know there are a few LP guys who road cycle and do triathlons. They are both achons and on the taller end. They have custom frames. \n\nI am a lot shorter 3' 11 , female and can just use an Isla Bike being 20\". Isla bikes is a small british company that makes adult quality bikes for kids. This bike changed my life. I have been a commuter and bike touring enthusiast ever since I found it. \n\nI had to swap the handlebars for m-type Brompton bars as I have much shorter arms than kids. \n\nIsla bikes have mentioned they get a lot of enquiries from LPs but that most of their bikes are unsuitable due to the proportions of LPs. In response, they have even made 2 prototypes of bikes specifically for Achon adults but it is unlikely they will be able to balance the cost of manufacture with the market to make them commercially viable. \n\nI can say with certainty that there is no commercially viable market for mass manufactured bikes for LPs. I get your enthusiasm but having some experience in manufacturing and business myself, I would tell you to save your energy. \n\nCustom frames are your best bet if you want elite quality gear but even then, you are not benefiting from the R&amp;D mass-manufactured bikes do.  Also, your bespoke frame is still limited to using prefab components that will also limit how truly custom your bike can be.\n\nI would seriously recommend looking at Isla bikes for a hybrid bike for yourself. They are just excellent. Every bike store I have taken mine to has been impressed with it. Bikes stores in Aus, England, Germany and Spain. They all say \"this is not a kids bike\" when referring to the build and components. \n\nAs for mountain bikes, your options are again, super limited however I did find a great small manufacturer in America who make the Lil'Shredder. I paid $5k US for a down hill duel suspension MTN bike. I would probably buy a hard tail version instead in hind sight because the back suspension is heavier than it is worth. \n\nAnyway, these are bikes designed for basically, elite downhill kids with veeeery obsessed MTN biking parents. Again, I did my own mods to the handles as my fingers are too short for standard break levers. Apologies for the delay, thank you so much for the in depth response. It really is eye opening.\n\nThis led me down a bit of a rabbit hole researching what is out there vs what is not available. I find it quite disheartening that there can be no professional LP cyclists, and I think that alone is a conversation worth having. Your comment of \"Their excellent, elite sport equipment\" being an advantage for others seems like something that may be able to be addressed. Again, a conversation worth having!\n\nI have recently learned of Isla bikes, but have heard they do not prefer to partner with online retailers, but again, may be worth a conversation to see if they could be swayed to support a good cause.\n\nWho knows, maybe nothing will come of this, but then again, maybe it will! I will let you know if I get anywhere! I would enquire into Isla bikes LP bike prototype scheme and see if there is anything you can do with that. It might be a good charity publicity thing but it will not make anyone money. \n\nHand cyclists benefit from the recumbent cycle scene so the costs of the equipment is subsidised by the non-disabled market. It is not comparable to the LP situation. There are more people with lower spine injuries than there are LPs of a particular proportion so again, they have a market advantage\n\nOh and I would also say that you should focus less on the professional racing stuff and more on the 'everybody should be able to enjoy cycling' message. Non-professional access to cycling would benefit far more people and also, there is not a point in having a professional league if most of the future athletes never get a chance to ride a bike just for fun.", "Trip to Disney My son, who has dwarfism, has been asking to go to Disneyland or Disneyworld for the last year but I have been hesitant to take him because he is only 35\" tall and so not tall enough for most of the rides. He is 9 years old so I feel like he is the perfect age but I do not want to spend all the money to go to Disney if it is not worth it. Any advice or recommendations? My daughter loves Disney.  We lived in Florida for 5 years and went twice a year.  There are plenty of things to do that are not rides. Meeting characters,  the young kids rides, the tiki room. He will most likely have a blast. I went to Disney world and was able to go on all the rides but one.  He should be fine. A lot of the Disney's rides are catered to children, so your child will be fine. And like the other person said, there is a lot more stuff to do.", "I could use some help. My daughter is beautiful, smart, funny, kind hearted,and also happens to be a little person. My husband and I are both average sized and have no idea what we are doing. Until today I was under the impression that her height was not a major issue for her socially. She just told me that she occasionally feels like she is less of a person because of her height and that she thinks all of her problems would be better if she was tall like me. I do not know how to make this better for her. I feel like all I can do is tell her I love her and that she is perfect the way she is.  Can anyone give me advice on what to do? I want her to know that her height should not stop her from being the amazing kid she is, but I do not want to invalidate her feelings. I am sorry for formatting and what not. I am posting on mobile and crying like someone just died. \n\nThank you in advance! Do you have some LPs in the community she can talk to? Maybe someone in their 20s or a little older than her to give her some perspective but who is still young enough to be relatable? Therapy might be a good idea too-just so she can have a healthy outlet for her feelings. Average height father of an LP here.  My son is too young to be worried but not me.

Teach your child how to defend herself, speak up for what she needs when she needs it at school, friends houses, events, businesses.... and she should not be embarrassed at all about being born a certain way. \nMy parents instilled in me what the name of my Dwarfism was, how to spell it, how to explain to other children when they had questions by the time I was 5 years old.\nI would stand by my answers and be confident in knowing that I was still me\u2014who i was at home, my hobbies, my family\nMembers, a whole support system, while still being open to others, and if someone could not respect me or my space after eloquently explaining where I am coming from, then that is a sure sign she does not need them in her life.\nI had to learn this later in high school\u2014some people are just not as emotionally evolved as a I believe some people with dwarfism have to be as a coping mechanism. \nI am an LP and I grew up with an all average height family, but am the oldest of 3 others who are all tall, and I was the normal bossy older sister. \nI am someone who was occasionally bullied by wimps in the street or driving by in cars, but they had no idea I was running my school\u2019s live television show and winning Prom Queen. \nAs long as you make your child feel as independent and resilient as you are, they will trust your lead. \nTeach her to explain people her boundaries! Thankk you for sharing your thoughts and experiences. I am trying to teach her to explain her boundaries, but she is having trouble finding the right words for them I think. She said that when people crouch or kneel down to talk to  her it makes her feel disrespected and small. She wants people to stop doing that, but does not want to hurt anyone's feelings in the process. How does she do that? I am a dwarf myself and in my experience when people are doing something that they think is helpful but feels condescending to me, I find polite honesty to be the best course. Most people do not mean any disrespect or harm, they are usually trying to be polite but often just do not know what to do. If people are bending over to talk to her or kneeling and such, I would suggest she say something like, \"it is ok, you do not need to do that\", in a calm polite way. Most people will pick up the message pretty quickly and the ones that do not, I would recommend she could repeat it to once or twice, but afterwards just leave it. That is on them at that point, not her. It is that thing of \"you are not responsible for others feelings, only your own\". She should not worry too much about what others think, be herself and people that are best for her will come to her, friends are really important but they need to be the right ones. The best thing she can do is learn to be confident in herself, not in a loud ego driven way, but knowing her own worth, and respecting herself. The rest falls into place a bit easier after that. At least for me it did, and it took a while to learn. Education is also good, she should not be embarrassed about or hide her dwarfism, should not go too far the other way either and boast about it or anything. But having to hide something you cannot change about yourself can be soul destroying. So many things like this get much easier to deal with once you truly value and love yourself, then what other people think and do matters so much less to you. It is not easy, but it is an empowering feeling. Thank you.  I am going to show her this and hopefully, coming from someone who has been through it, she will feel more empowered to be her amazing self!

I am writing a series where LP make up about 20% of the population in a quarter of the world. In this region, dwarfism is considered a grand blessing and indicates great power both in magic and in politics/society. It is not a race or something, it is just that people who are gifted tend to be LP.\nThat being said \nThere are(or would be) terms for LP here that are a little less modern or sterile compared to \u201clittle people.\u201d For the life of me, I cannot figure out what terms I could use that would offend the fewest relevant people. \nCan I say \u201cQueen Tiya was a dwarf\u201d or do I need to be more strategic \u201cQueen Tiya was a Queen very slight in stature.\u201d \nCan I say \u201cA lot of dwarfs attend this school.\u201d Or should I avoid labels that replace the people and stick to describing the actual situation; \u201cThere are a lot of short students at this school.\u201d Also, can I be frank and just say they are short or do I need to be delicate? Maybe delicate at first, to set a safe tone?\nCan two characters with established good-nature refer to the other as \u201cshorty,\u201d \u201csmalls,\u201d or other such names which specifically refer to their size? Remember, it is a good thing to be little here, like if you find out your kid has dwarfism, you are ecstatic and throw them a party. So calling someone short is never an insult here but I want to be sensitive to my readers.\n\nNow, I am well aware that I am *allowed* to write whatever I want. But this is a world where LP are actively in charge of the way they are treated because most ruling figures have been LP. So there is no way that anything offensive to LP would fly here. Idk any LP irl so I have nothing but conjecture. I just want you all to have something that in no way exploits other pokes fun at dwarfism. It is never a punchline here. This seems to be some sort of fantasy settings. My suggestion would be to invent words, at least two. One would be a word that came from the LP community to describe themselves, and the other could be a derogative term. The second may be used by some sort of bigot, or maybe a historic term from a past where LP were not respected or maybe even oppressed. Yeah I am asking the LP community to help me come up with a term... I guess that is not going to work! You might want to look at Egyptian churches a few different groups adopted little people from Greek and even Spartans as well as claimed unwanted or purchased children with dwarfism to raise them and educate them to be priests scholars and oraters for the churches.\n\nThey believe they were conduit for the divine.\n\nAlso it is pretty significant because they were pretty strict about who could not could not learn to read in Egypt. \n\nI am not personally familiar with all the terms they used but they were positive and I think that is important maybe not what you are going to use but at least something to consider. Probably not and I do not think that is a personal attack on you I think it is because you are not the first person to ask. \n\nIt is also not about you or your book because whatever answer they give it is potential that other people might not like it \n\nlike I said before there are some historical terms some of them have cool origin stories\n\nThey fell out of fashion for a reason and that was they were replaced with less respectful terms\n\nThose were eventually replaced with more modern also disrespectful and divided terms\n\nEventually little people got together and made an organization called the LPA among others that fights for awareness and has united everyone under one term. They are little people because not all people who are small are actually dwarves. To be completely honest not all dwarfs are small. I have met some who are as tall as I am but that does not change their diagnosis. \n\nIt is really awesome that you want to be respectful and that you are asking the community for help this is just a question I do not think many people are comfortable with.\n\nit is also question I know is come up in fantasy writing a lot. A number of others have come up with various solutions. What you are doing sounds very similar to Robert Jordan's eye of the World. \n\nI have actually seen events about writing little people at writing conventions specifically norwestcon\nIronically one of the people in attendance was JRR Martin before he wrote Game of thrones\n\nSo you seriously might want to consider networking with other writers and maybe communicating with groups like norwestcon which is a fantasy fiction writing community and convention that actually includes a handful of little people and has been part of the origin of some of the bigger names in writing fiction.

I am writing an argumentative/research paper about the effects of dwarfism, and was wondering if anyone here was affected by the disability and could give a statement.

I do not think I would ever say it to a dwarf in person, but I really find it cute. When I was younger I use to watch Austin Powers and loved the character mini-me. It was the first time I ever saw a dwarf. I enjoy small things too in general. I know I cannot be the only one since I feel like a lot of dwarfs work in the entertainment industry and they have multiple shows about little people. It seems I am not the only one that is interested in them. Basically my question is what do people with dwarfism think about everything I just said? I do not think so unless you think all people with Dwarfism look the same or that YOU WILL find them all cute. Which the former is not the case and you may never know the latter as you would not meet them all. When you say you find \"it\" cute. What is that it? \n\nAnd what about them or Mini Me do you find cute? Unless you are being weird or rude about it, no. It could be one of your \u201ctypes\u201d, like a generalized ideal. For example, I am generally am attracted to Latinx people, but that is not to say ALL. \n\nJust do not objectify dwarfism or any other conditions and I think you will be alright. Be sure to see the person. I look at it like on a dating site where they ask you generalized questions about your likes and dislikes. Its going to give you a generalized group of people that match your preferences, in this case people under a certain height parameter (although that does not actually work on dating sites, unfortunately).\n\nAlso, this is just my opinion. Other people with dwarfism might feel very different. I never thought about dating a little person. There is not a lot of them and maybe that is why I find them very interesting. Thanks for answering my question. I was kind of embarrassed to post it, but I wanted to know. A lot of people with achondroplasia are told they are \u201ccute\u201d, and most of them dismiss it just as quick because they are been told this so much. It is not that they do not appreciate it, but when you hear a generic compliment based on your short-stature; it becomes a compliment they may not find\u2026complimentary. I find men with achondroplasia super attractive. The men I date are usually shorter and stockier anyway, but men with achon I find their facial features very aesthetically pleasing. I do not even know what \"cute\" really means, though I know it when I see it!  but at 56 I am not it anymore. I am kind of glad you asked this question OP \u2026. I also have an attraction in this area and have always found it an awkward quality within myself only due to I am a firm believer that attraction and relationships and intimacy is something that really should come from a connection of minds , hearts , values and communication so therefore it is weird for me to think about being attracted to a \u201ctype\u201d as someone answered \u2026.. but I guess it is a very real psychological and biological human response to be attracted to some people over others. \nI think to ask if it weird is maybe to suggest that it is somewhat an outrageous concept though \u2026. And I do not think you should think of it that way \u2026. It is not at all an outrageous concept to be attracted to another person no matter race , age , sexuality , identity or any other trait that makes that person who they are \u2026. It is quite simply attraction \u2026. Although as stated at the start of this ramble I can understand that it might be awkward to instigate something if you were to approach a connection with someone from the perspective of I am attracted to you BECAUSE of your dwarfism , it would be much healthier and less awkward to approach the situation by thinking \u201cI am attracted to this human , I would like to find out if we can connect meaningfully beyond looks\u201d \n     As I said OP I have the same attraction and I know that it can be difficult \u2026 I live in a rural area and there are not any people with dwarfism in my area , so I cannot even try and add those humans to my friend group in order to discover and learn more \u2026. But do not approach the opportunity (if given it) as if you ,or they, are weird \u2026.. just embrace it as an opportunity to connect and learn and grow \u2026\u2026. All the best!! That is the only way we learn, right? Got To ask questions. Do not be embarrassed, there is nothing wrong with being interested and wanting to know more. I think someone is initial looks CAN be a stepping stone to determining if there is more to that person that would or could be relationship in the making.\n\nDwarfism is not exactly a race but it is a body type and in that regard, it could be a \u201ctype\u201d. \n\nI was not looking for a LP. I met my wife and was dazzled by her personality. Her face. Her voice. The way she treated me. I fell in love with her for\u2026her. Not her achondroplasia. \n\nYes it is true.

Pants are hard because not only do most of us need them shortened, we also need them taken in in the legs. My experience has been that the portion of a pant leg that should be on an average persons thigh, will hang around my knee. So they are often way too wide in areas where they should be more fitted. If I want a skinny for jean or legging, it takes a lot of altering to accomplish. And even as little people with similar characteristics, we are still all different. Shoes are difficult, though some brands do a great job of making adult shoes for small wide feet. I for one can wear adult tops and shorts, but sleeves are often still way too long. Many lps wear children's clothing, but children's styles do not account for breasts, hips, or booties. \n\nI wear a lot of stretchy shorts, capri leggings, and t-shirt dresses. My sister has good experiences with American eagle denim, however I do not. I like shopping at target and h&amp;m, though neither of those are perfect. Thank you for sharing!!

I can usually find something big enough to go around but either the arms are way too long or the actual length is too long for my liking. I am PSS BTW, and usually shop in petite ranges\nGood luck! You are doing an awesome thing and also love Sinead Burke she is fab Because i can wear kid size 8 t-shirts I just want metal band shirts and more anime/popculture shirts. I am usually can wear standard kid sizes but loose fits are very tight on me.  Turns out kids usually do not have post-puberty musculature and a beer gut. \n\nWhat usually really gets me though is that since kids do not stay the same size for very long, the quality of clothing tends to be pretty poor in my experience.  Stuff just tears or falls apart way earlier than a standard adult equivalent would, even if you buy higher end stuff. Depends really on the evenings activities. Sometimes the mission calls for a professionally hemmed tuxedo, sometimes it calls for a brief stop at H&amp;M or Nordstrom, most nights it just call for a thrift store buy that plays into the fact I buy children\u2019s clothes. Also Online niche fashion markets sometimes  yield good finds, although it sometimes gets expensive knowing ill have to alter it.  \n\nA 300$ jacket to pull in 30% clout feels like when I had a mohawk in highschool, its the fashion their staring at!

If you need any advice feel free to PM me. Dwarfism is covered under the ADA. This is a good thing, if he needs something and can protect him in the future.

I will definitely continue doing my own research because I do not expect people to do all of the work for me, but I was wondering if anyone here would be willing to answer some questions if they have the time? \n\nI am asking here, because since I do not have Achondroplasia myself, I would rather not run to google and risk misrepresenting things. (Facts are great and all, but I find personal experience can be more enriching when you are trying to write a character who lives with something that is so underrepresented in media.)\n\nI know that there can be physical barriers that my character may deal with and I wanted to know if any of you could tell me based on your experiences what struggles he might run into when it comes to fighting criminals.\n\nHe is 4'6. Uses butterfly knives and brass knuckles. \n\nAre there any other weapons/fighting styles that would be more ideal for someone with this condition than the ones I have chosen?\n\nAre there any limitations (social, physical, emotional, etc)  that might be easy for someone without Achondroplasia to overlook?\n\nAre there any tropes or stereotypes that are easy for someone without Achondroplasia to overlook?\n\nIs there anything that you would personally like shown or represented in a character with Achondroplasia?\n\nThank you so much for your time. What era? It would be easier if you framed the scenario and then people could respond to ways they would overcome such obstacles. As an achondroplasia myself, Id feel always aiming for the upperhand, whether it be through technology or manipulation of environment. \n\nIf the achon is equal to the other crewmembers in mind, perhaps his difference could be more to do with using his body (small places, under the legs, etc) however if his dwarfism isnt as accepted, perhaps he could always be trying to prove himself by imagining solutions others would not have seen.

It was sobering and yet affirming to me to find posts regarding Hurlers. \n\nI wanted to share a story of how he dealt with a specific bullying incident at the age of five. \n\nHe had severe hearing loss and was in a wheel chair on oxygen. We were in a drug store and a regular size boy walked up to him and began mocking him. The boy\u2019s parents were nearby and encouraged the taunts. \n\nI saw red and before I could respond to the boy my son signed \u201cFucking asshole\u201d to the boy.\n\nThe boy asked what my \u201cRetarded freak was doing with his hands.\u201d \n\nI told him he called you a fucking asshole and then I yelled at his parents \u201cObviously his mom and dad were too.\u201d\n\nThe pharmacist came out behind the counter and kicked the family out of the store and profusely apologized to my son in American Sign Language. \n\nSadly there were incidents with folks being jerks to us both before and after he ended up using a wheel chair. \n\nSometimes we handled it with grace and other times not. \n\nAnyhow, I appreciate being able to read your stories, your truths and even though my dear boy has passed on, it gives my heart joy and solace to read your posts. \n\nSo thank you for being here.

I am so sad to hear your son has gone but it sounds like he spent his life with a wonderful family. That is so great for him to have had! \n\nThis bullying incident is... Well, fairly indicative of the stuff we experience. It must have blown your mind to suddenly experience it as an adult. When my friends and family witness it (which is rare, as most people do it when were alone) they are usually pretty gobsmacked. I tqlk about it openly as part of my coping strategy, but I do not think it really hits home until they see it - How random, unnecessary and cruel it is. \n\nCan I ask where you are from? I find the extent of bullying varies from location to location. This is the kind of thing I would expect in the UK more than the US.\n\nAlso, did you notice a change in the bullying when your son was using/not using a wheelchair? I once read an article from a woman that said she copped less bullying when she started using a wheelchair. We are in the USA far Northern California, in a semi rural area. \nThe bullying incidents all happened in public spaces such as on the street, the country fair and in stores. \nThis was long before social media and the perpetrators have all been adults except for the boy in the drug store. \nThe vile comments made towards my son and I were cruel. \nThe wheel chair actually drew folks to him. Either utterly weeping old folks pitying him or rude folks. \nHe attended public school until he was too ill to do so and his teachers and classmates were very kind and respectful. When we finally accepted that there was not going to be a cure for his terminal illness and that freed us from expectations and I think allowed us to \u201cjust be ourselves as a loving family\u201d. \nAnd I learned to not engage with them when they were saying he should be euthanized or should of been aborted. That he was a waste of resources. \nYes, folks who we did not know would come up and say that kind of stuff to us. \nHaving Hurler syndrome meant for my our son was a dwarf sized person but it he also had progressive disfiguring of the face and body. \nThe old fashioned term for the disorder was called gargolism. \nThe assumptions folks made about him were very difficult to face and I had to learn how to protect him and not get arrested by being verbally or physically violent in my responses. \nOne of my best experiences after he passed was to stumble upon a Little People of America gathering in the San Francisco Bay Area at a hotel my father was staying at. \nHe and I were welcomed in to the meeting room to have drinks and to meet folks. \nThere were a few families there with children who had a Hunters Syndrome a sister disorder to Hurlers. As well as other super rare disorders. Everyone made us feel welcome. I am glad you found support in the LPA.

I know it is a fair way in the future but I am currently feeling pretty anxious about it. I am on the other side of this, my son is 8 and is the one with dwarfism while my wife and I are average height.  \n\nBullying has been a worry of mine since he was born.  Fortunately we have not had any major issues so far, but they are just getting to the age where it might as the height difference becomes more drastic.\n\nThe only thing I can offer is that it is a different world now, the bullying and attacks on people for things they cannot control is not as accepted as it was when we were children (I am 44).  It still happens, but more people are willing to stand up to bullies about that kind of stuff than they were before. My partner has achondroplasia, as does his mother, and he never expressed bullying as an issue for him. For him at least, his primary issue was drawing unwanted attention and people feeling entitled to his attention. Strangers on the street trying to touch him, taking pix nonconsensually, trying to demand he talk to them, that sort of thing. A vast majority questions I have gotten about him (as an average height person) have been asked by children and are usually the same questions. \n\nI imagine your son might get some kind of vicarious reaction if you are the one with dwarfism, and get annoyed at people asking questions about you.  Maybe getting him prepared with quick responses to common questions that end the conversation and practicing them with him so that it does not become emotionally charged for him might help? Not to sound mean, but please do not do this. Your child will live a life of misery if it is a boy. You should not have any children at all if possible. If you do it will be 80 years of sadness.

I am curious to learn what people in the dwarfism community think of these events. Has anyone here ever been to one of these shows or worked in this industry? And is this generally viewed as negative or positive thing for the community? I think you will probably find the community split, but not equally so, on this topic and topics like it.\n\nThere are some little people who see it as a profession / means to an end. There are some who see it as exploitation for that individual, as well as the community as a whole.\n\nPersonally, as a little person, I stand somewhere in between. I, and most members of the community, find, for example, just the use of the term \"midget\" derogatory. However, some (I would say a much smaller chunk - *no pun intended*) little people are super blas\u00e9 about the term and referring to themselves by it.\n\nBut, when it comes to the exploitation aspect of it - I get that some people feel they need to \"use what their mama gave them\" in terms of finding a career or line of work.\n\nWhere I throw it back to the person who might be in that situation is to say \"are you doing this because you *want* to do this and it makes you happy, or are you doing this because you feel the pressure of society's biases and stereotypes forcing you into it? If it is the former, cool; if it is the latter, though, they are not bettering themselves or the community by doing what they are doing, and they should find a way to gain more self-confidence and self-awareness.

I, myself, am against. Thanks for the reply, I can definitely see how it could be seen as exploitation which was my first impression when I heard about it.

I was also taken aback by the term \u201cmidget wrestling\u201d as I always thought \u201cmidget\u201d was an offensive term. I am surprised they still call it that. I think it is exploitation and wrong. I am other countries that is all that is available to us though.

I am wondering if any of you have personal experiences with furniture that works well. I know in the past, one of my colleagues has recommended the Leckey PAL chair because it is height-adjustable and has options for a height-adjustable foot plate as well. ((\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, she has had some feedback from families that this chair looks \"too different\" from the other students' chairs and therefore they did not like it. I am not sure if this feedback was coming from the families or the students with achondroplasia. Truthfully, the Leckey PAL chair is probably overkill for students with achondroplasia in terms of its features - the lapbelt and armrests would not be necessary... but I have had a hard time finding a better option.   \n\n\nThere is this adjustable footplate attachment that could go on a typical classroom chair: ( However, I think it would still need a booster seat of some sort so the student's arms would be at an appropriate height to access the desk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have also found this chair that is height-adjustable and has a height-adjustable footplate: (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you have any other ideas? The community college that I went to had the option of an adjustable computer chair. Or just a low key foot stool that stays under the desk. I think a plain metal/Black footstool is a better option because kids with achondroplasia have a normal sized torso. \n\nDo speak with the student before hand about it. \n\nI like the second opinion that is less overkill. \nA safe option would be to find a footstool, Then ask her during recess if she would like to test out his/her accommodation away from lingering eyes from other kids. When I was in school I always had a special chair. It was custom made but sounds more or less what you described at the start. It was widely different but I did not mind most of the other kids were jealous and thought it was cool. \n\nI think the parents need to realize that no matter what they are going to stick out in class. Might as well have a cool chair. So my daughter is going into 7th grade next year.  We have honestly just used the small chairs from elementary school and a foot rest. The desks in most classrooms adjust, and the elementary chairs fit her well. My two boys (one achon, one diastrophic) always used stools for their footrests.  But both of them independently decided about 4, 5 or 6th grade that they did not want to bother with them.  Sometimes, they would toss a backpack on the floor &amp; rest their feet on that, but by the time they had to switch in &amp; out of classes, they both flatly refused the stools.  I pushed for a while, then let them do it their way.\n\nSo, over time, your kid may change their mind.  They will let you know. I am achondroplasic. My brother and I made custom chairs and tables for my home. They look completely weird because they are short, wide and not deep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a classroom it would help to have a stool (I have one at work) and also something in the back tu pull the backrest a little bit forward. For the desk height, it has to be higher in proportion to the seat because of the arm length (torsos are generally regular sized).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout being too different, I used to try to be as little different as I could. This was an illussion that made me be very unconfortable for many years. Thee sooner we understand that being different is nothing to be ashamed of, the better off we are. But I would not know where to start to make a child or teenager understand that. Thank you so much for your response. This is my sense as well. I think the most important thing is finding something that will appropriately support the student's body for writing and school work. I am personally not too worried about a student appearing \"different\" because everyone is different and I personally do not think different is bad. I was watching the Brene Brown Netflix special over the weekend and she said something that really stood out to me: \"The opposite of belonging is fitting in.\" \n\nI find some parents are very fixated on not having their children appear \"different\" as though being different is somehow a bad thing. But it does make me wonder if they are projecting their own fears toward their child and how that in turn affects their self-esteem. :( Thank you so much for your thoughtful response. That is awesome that you and your brother made custom furniture. It is so important to be comfortable in your own home!\n\nIn terms of the furniture itself, I could get a height-adjustable desk with a regular classroom chair with a height adjustable footrest. That way it would all adjust to fit her proportions and could be changed as she grows. Also, I could add something on the backrest to adjust the seat depth, as you said. \n\nI completely agree with everything you are saying re: being different. I tend to think the more comfortable someone is with being different the more other people will be okay with it too. I also agree that I am not sure how to make a child (this one is in kindergarten) understand this... and especially how to get the parents to understand this, who are the ones pushing for furniture that looks the same as everyone else's. I am not sure if it is overstepping to bring this up to the parents, but I will probably suggest some books to the teacher with themes about how being different is awesome. I personally used a special chair in primary which was called the breezi chair. It was very different and to be honest i didnt want to be using a different chair but was persuaded.\nIn secondary i used it for about a year and would have preferred to not use it at all. I was pressured into using it and then i eventually made my own decision to use a step under a normal chair Right, the step probably sufficed.

If you cannot stand or sit very long, there is always jobs working on a computer while you lay in bed, as well as disability.\n\nAlso the way you speak, the way you self promote shitty rap music, and the way you act, shows lack of education / skills.  I am sorry, I have no respect for someone who sees the entertainment business as \"their niche\" in the dwarfism community.  It just furthers stereotypes, and helps no one. i do work with computers, and i  could collect disability, but i choose to try to force myself to work. this post was about my height, why are u even mentioning my music????  How do you know how i act??? lack of education?? to me it sounds like your being a Bully , trying to pick on , hate , and be negative !! YOU SHOULD BE BLOCKED AND BANNED !! \n(and just because im in the entertainment business, does not mean i help further stereotypes,  i try to only take serious rolls, and in my music i show that no one is liimited to anything. We Are Underestimate Overachievers! so s*&amp;k my D!CK from the back P*ssy!! internet gangster i bet u dont say that much to anyones face. Bud, you do realize I am the subreddit owner, first off.  Second off, the way you type, the way you complain when you break rules, etc shows your lack of education.  Third, turning down help, if you need it, is ignorant.  I understand \"forcing\" yourself to work, but whining about being \"too tall for this role and too short for that role\" gets you no sympathy with me, or many other people.  Fourth, I am not afraid to speak my mind to anyone, anywhere.  Instead of harping on your negatives, try focusing on your positives, and instead of acting like you are a \"gangster\", try to act like a decent human being. You are to tall for being someone with dwarfism, but just at the actual \u201ccutoff\u201d. Yet you are short enough to be part of us at r/short. Greets pal Btw pls stop spamming with Big Runts videos at our boards, ik ik yall are short and I actually support yall, but spam will not take you anywhere. Do not be any of those young soundcloud/snapchat black rappers that keep spamming and literally shoving their shit all over the place. Stop watching tv and movies, stop listening to music. Stop reading fiction books and magazines. Entertainers are highly skilled professionals who face extreme adversity, work very hard to hone their craft, and provide services you are all too happy to take advantage of. Do not shit in entertainers because you do not know what their jobs entail. And do not discourage people's dreams because they might face obstacles or difficulties achieving their goals. Be a support to people, not one more thing tearing them down. By adding \"in the dwarfism community\" you made your statement ableist. There are many successful disabled entertainers.  You are an ideal height for a Disney character performer. They actually used to prefer dwarfs for certain roles like Donald Duck. I am not a dwarf but I am your height and worked for Disney and I had a lot of opportunities because of my specific size. you are too tall for LP, since the max height is 4'10. \n\nlots of hollywood actresses are 4'11 or around there. why would they think you are too short?  im a male.

Are these common occurrences? How can I help him progress in these two aspects? Hi!\n\nI know it is a little late to answer this, but I am sharing a document published by Little People of America. Page 23 talks about toileting. Since it is a PDF, I am going to paste the content below: \n\n&gt;When your child is old enough for potty training, be adaptable. You will face some unique challenges. Initially a potty chair may be easier to use than the regular toilet. Most toilets will come up to your child's waist or mid-back and it takes some creativity to maneuver out of one\u2019s clothes and up onto the toilet. Little boys can urinate into a container and dump it. Your child may use a step\nstool to climb up and sit on the larger toilet. Those with short arms may use adaptations or adaptive devices to make it easier to maneuver pants down and up, and for wiping. Other possible challenges depend on your child's form of dwarfism. Fortunately, this is a topic which everyone has to deal with. There is a wealth of information through LPA such as in The Family Corner section on LPA\u2019s Website or the Parents of Little People 2 (POLP2) group on\nyahoo.groups online.\n\n\nPotty training gets referenced in other places in the pamphlet, so be sure to check it out! \n", "Hey guys, I just wanted to ask, what do you think of little people circus acts? As an outsider it seems really offensive-especially with the names of most of them-but also I would hate to criticize something which makes someone a good livelihood.  It is a holdover from a less enlightened time.  I do not like it but circuses as a whole seem to be dying so thankfully it will probably end within my lifetime.\n\nI do begrudge the people participating, but at the same time it is a living, and people do worse for less. What if it was more good hearted, ie \"little people wrestling\", would you be happier with it then? Same awful shit in a different package. I am glad they are getting the $$$ I disagree, it could just be called wrestling, but it doesnt hurt to stand out in some way. If it is about the wrestling, call it \"ultrafeatherweight\" or something.  Make it actually about the sport and it is cool.  Too often it ends up being a freakshow by another name, and that is why most of us look at it with disdain. Fair enough, I dont like the freakshow part of it.  But on the other hand I cant fault anyone if they decide to market it a little bit with somewhat freakshow language, it seems like it would be doable in a good natured way... Idk, obviously, I am fairly tall, so I might not be correct in my understanding of these topics Yeah. Given the exploitative nature of this origins of this stuff, and the fact that most of us still face some pretty serious deacrimination in economic, social and cultural realms, it is a little premature to just think you can rebrand this shit and call it \"fine and empowering, because we did not use the word midget\". \n\nI get the feeling you want to run a midget wrestling event and want to still be a woke, nice guy. Lol. You cannot. F no lol.  And also, are you going to take away peoples option to make money off their otherwise unfortunate circumstance?  I know theres a lot of assholes who go to said things, and I wish that wasnt the case, but shouldnt it be left up to personal choice at least to some extent? My partner was a LP circus performer.  He enjoyed what he did and he is very good at it.  He always had the right to turn down any acts that he thought was offensive.  He worked in entertainment for over 26 years (stripper, circus).\n\nI feel guilty from taking him away from that.  It has been difficult for him to find work outside of the circus.  He also misses the fandom that went with it.  He loves attention and commands it anywhere and anytime.\n\nI am a regular sized person.  I did not care for how spectators viewed him.  He loved the attention, but it hurt me to watch how other people treat him. I do not care about peoples personal choices. I want the choice to be able to walk down the street without being photographed and called a midget. Shit likes this teaches people to ridicule us. Maybe if jobs like this were harder to get, less demeaning jobs would be easier to get. All things considered, you sound like a dork, advocating for taking away peoples livelihoods because it doesnt fit with your feelings is kind of pathetic.  I have already said multiple times that I dont like the whole naming convention and the whole disgusting nature of a lot of these things, but there are almost certainly ways to do it in a way that is less than horrific, and it could even raise awareness, you never know lol.  I know this sounds really bad, but theoretically it could be possible, and despite how hard it might be to pull off, thinking in closed minded ways about it is fucking retarded. Lol, my bad.  I am reading through this piece I wrote and I suppose it sounds pretty awful.  I know someone who went to one of these event and it really pissed me off, but I was suprised at how kind heartedly he handled the whole thing, and even though I hated the whole thing, I also realized that there were probably some positive aspects which I had missed.  The whole reason I came on here was because I wanted to make sure I wasnt fucking anything up for anyone by criticizing these events, and somehow I ended up defending the thing which I began the conversation hating.  Thinking through it, it doesnt really seem like there are a lot of ways to do it without preying on peoples prejudices, and in that way, it doesnt seem like there is a positive way to do it.  Either way, having a closed minded approach is never something I am a fan of...  sorry this got so out of hand. I do not know what you want me to say. I have an experience of life with a condition that makes my life very hard. You do not. I am advocating for social changes that will make my life easier and the life of my children, you are not. \n\nBut I get that you find this an interesting think piece. It is fun when the you are totally not impacted by consequences of the answer. My friends and i discuss race politics and trans shit in much the same way . You do not get to come in here with zero ties to the dwarfism community and tell us how to think about being in the spotlight on such a negative way to showcase the \"otherwise unfortunate\" life of having dwarfism.\nYou know what is unfortunate? People treating the dwarfism community like side show business is *all* they are capable of.  If society treated little people as full equals and stopped perpetuating the side show crap, then the little people who are forced into the business for money would not feel they *have* to in order to take back their authority and reclaim their autonomy. **Little people do not exist for anyone else's entertainment.** Dont tell me what I cant do lol.

My daughter has achondroplasia and is old enough to go on a lot of rides, but is too short. I feel like a lot of rides are really designed around torso length, not the height of a person\u2019s arms and legs.  Any experiences with this that a person with achondroplasia wants to share? Not an LP but a fellow POLP. We had issues with this when we went to Disney in February. My daughter was like 1-2\" under the requirements for several rides. It was incredibly frustrating. I have the same idea as you that these rides are clearly designed around torso length and it is really stupid for them to use overall height as the determining factor. Frankly this is an issue I would like to see the LPA formally address with companies like Disney. I do not have any useful advice but wanted to share that you are not the only parent out there dealing with this. Good to know I am not the only one.  Magic kingdom at Disney world is mostly lap bar type safety. I can understand some of the rough rides might not be good for little people\u2019s necks and backs, but that is not the reason amusement parks are not allowing them on the rides.  Honestly, Im not sure if some of those rides are good for most people\u2019s neck and back! Lol. Thanks for sharing!

They did not classify it as 'dwarfism', just 'short stature'.\n\nFrom other posts, I am getting the impression that calling myself a little person would not be offensive, but is calling myself a dwarf even correct?", "How to not feel suicidal as a dwarf?

I understand though we have to tolerate a lot more crap so I get it.\n\nI have never felt inferior to average sized people, why should I? I have a good job, I work hard, and I know I am appreciated, you cannot have a chip on your shoulder all the time, people will notice.\n\nWhy do you blame your parents?

Maybe try a little people meeting or something? Hi carbonlam, do you actually have dwarfism? I can see from your other posts that you are convinced that you have a 'distorted' face, but there is no mention of dwarfism.\n\nI am assuming that you feel the challenges presented by your face are similar to the challenges presented by having dwarfism and are hoping to learn some coping skills from people with dwarfism.\n\nI am not sure if your 'distorted face' is real (facial deformity) or due to sort of facial dysmorphia. Either way, it seems like you would benefit from seeing a psychologist. You live in the UK, which I am guessing means you can access therapy/counselling through the NHS. A professional will be better placed to give you the life coping skills that you appear to need.\n\nThey will also be able to help you work through your fears of being single forever. I have just been told that therapy/counselling services through the NHS is a bit shit. Apparently you will have to access counselling online? Not great for someone struggling with feelings of isolation. \n\n  \nIf you can afford it, go for private counselling. If you cannot, ask your parents to help advocate for proper counselling through the NHS.

I am an average person. I always assumed that dwarfs generally do not appreciate being called \"midget.\" And that it would only be ok for a dwarf to use this word if it is in jest, but not OK for an average person to say. Is this assumption wrong?\n\nI ask this because recently on a subreddit for short people (without dwarfism), someone said something to the effect of \"midgets have it easier than short people\" and I replied we should not say that word, but it seems most people dissed me (( This has happened to me in real life too.\n\nWhat is the appropriate response in a situation like this? Correct them? Or not say anything at all? Or say something different? Did I say something wrong?\n\nThanks! Well, I would say the majority of dwarfs (the proper spelling when not speaking of fantasy characters) or little people, depending on what they prefer, definitely do not like being called midget . It is offensive to a lot of folks, whether or not someone of average height or even another dwarf thinks that is \"ridiculous\".  \n\nI am not sure how it got started, but I do not think that comparing it to the n-word is of any help in illustrating the point. Maybe its not as shocking, especially considering the well known history of that word, but that does not mean someone is silly for being offended. It distorts the point of why someone might not like being referred dismissively or intentionally offensively by this which has been used that way for many, many years. It just does not benefit anyone to compare.\n\nSo even if I dont get offended by the word midget (mostly because I wouldnt give that satisfaction of using a word to offend me so easily) does not mean I think it should be okay to use. Like I said, there are many different people with many different experiences with many different opinions and temperaments and I have to (and want to) respect the fact that its very offensive to a lot of people. \n\nI would hope any level-headed person, regardless of height, understand and hopefully empathize with that. It is typically used in a pejorative way so it should not be used. Unfortunately it can be hard to get the majority of society to understand this. As we are such a rare minority group. It is hard to gather enough momentum to make everyone aware. Making fun of us is still commonly acceptable. It is also unfortunately common to get the politically correct blowback Hmmm I do not know how you should respond to all that stuff... \nbut the history of the word midget is that it is derived from \u201cmidge\u201d and midge means small insect. And then it was also used to describe dwarves that were apart of freak-shows/circuses in the late 1800-early 1900s. Freak-shows were quite dehumanizing and by calling a little person midget, you are pretty much calling them sub-human/not human, especially since midge means small insect. All we are is shorter than average, so people should not be calling us not-human/sub-human by using the word midget. I agree with exactly this.  Whilst a word is just a word and only has power over us if we let it, I think there are some epithets which we should know not to repeat.\n\nWe are also all individuals and unique,.

Or is he saying the fact that it even exists is itself wrong (as in the story makes dwarfs into fictional magical creatures which is offensive to the fact that real life people live with dwarfism)?\n\nI am trying to figure out whether I agree with or not because on one hand I kind of understand but on the other hand I am asking myself \u201cWhat is the solution\u201d.\n\nIf his issue is the way the dwarfs are being portrayed, then that can be fixed.\n\nBut if his stance is that he simply does not think this is a story that should be told (again) because the notion of having the dwarfs itself is wrong, then that cannot be fixed unless they completely portray the dwarfs as something else (goblins, or even just fairies or soemthing) at which point I do not see how it makes it better for anyone because you are either going to get rid of an opportunity for 7 people with dwarfism to have a role in a major Disney film or you will have hem but have them play an entirely different magical creature which I do not really see as an improvement.", "Dungeons &amp; Dragons I have played and enjoyed playing Dungeons and Dragons for over a decade with about a hundred diverse players.

I am around 4'7''/4'8'' and I have a disability called arthorogryposis that causes shortened arms due to not having an active bicep muscles. I have been searching around for cars since I am close to getting my license however I noticed that I am unable to close the trunk on most of the ones that I have been looking for. I was just wondering what cars everyone drives and how you combat the trunk height issue?\n\nThanks!  Paracord (dangling) attached to the trunk / hatch works great. That is a good idea haha I did not think of that before! If you do not mind me asking, what car do you drive? I am trying to decide between a subcompact car or an SUV. It is going to come down to a test drive but was wondering what your experience is with visibility, etc?  I have a Rav 4, and it opens up from the side, would that be a good option for you?  None at the moment.  I totaled my 99 Civic last week.  But I am planning to get another civic, hopefully a hatch this time.  Also for me it is different, I have a long torso so visibility is no issue. I own a truck. But with my experiences with most car trunks, I close them from the side of the car. Right near the rear wheel.  Interesting, I will try that next time I am looking at cars! What do you mean that it opens from the side? :) (  You could also buy/ make one of these to keep in your trunk. It is rubber coated so it should not scratch your car. \n\n Ah okay that would be perfect haha!  Sweet :) I have one made in 2000, so I am not sure how common those boots are now.  I drive a Focus. We put some rope on and screwed it in to the trunk. Next car I want I am going to make sure I can just hit a something on my keyfob to close it.\n\n&amp;#x200B; Hiya - I know I am a little late to the party here, but wanted to chip in my two cent.

Now I have lost a lot of height due to spine problems.  \n\n\nIt all depends on you and what you are comfortable with.  It is not a phrase like \"legally blind\" which conveys particular benefits from society if you navigate bureaucratic mazes to claim them.  We can mostly use stuff regular people use though it is not always nice for us.    \n\n\n(Ladders.  Why do they come in only ONE scale more fit for 6'+ people who do not really need them as often as we do?)  We cannot drive all cars without special adaptations, but we can drive SOME cars without special adaptations.    \n\n\nTina Turner was 5'4\" in her heyday and she had legs that, come on, had to be half or more of that.  She might be almost our height these days.  Elizabeth Taylor was 5'2\".  Lady Gaga, under 5'1\".  Nicole Richie. She sure does not LOOK height challenged!  Must be the shoes.  Ellen Page.  Snooki Polizzi is only 4'8\"!  Jade Pinkett Smith 5' nothing, 14\" shorter than her spouse.  Reese Witherspoon.  Kristen Bell.  Paula Abdul, again right at 5' first thing in the morning.  Ariane Grande.  Kylie Minogue.  The Olsen twins.  Chandra Wilson.  The late Carrie Fisher.  Lil' Kim, 4'11\".  Well, I will stop copying other people's lists now, there are so many names I do not even recognize.    \n\n\nWe are all tallest when we first get up.  So lying in bed maybe do some positive self-talk about being big-hearted and all that.  Then stand up, have a giggle about being a dwarf, and you should not even need to think about it until you need someone to accommodate you in some way. Thanks\n\nBut the most problematic thing is that i cant drive and it is pretty frustrating What keeps you from driving?  I could not drive when I was pregnant.  I have other disabilities factoring in these days, mostly vision and pain (and pain management!) but I have been able to drive most vehicles we have owned.  Hyundai and Mitsubishi tend to have well-organized set ups for the petite.  My husband has a Chevy pickup truck I cannot drive.  The big bench seat simply cannot be put far enough forward, and if it were, nobody else could ride along.  \n\nDriving is so important for autonomy, but if you cannot, do not be afraid to try Uber/Lyft.  My son is autistic and was working, and getting him to and from work was really becoming a problem.  I was afraid someone would harm him, but we really had the choice of letting him try those services or not work.  So he did, and it was great.  He is had many great world-expanding conversations, and only once did he have a problem.  One driver pulled over and ordered him out of the car.  I do not know why.  He walked a long way in the rain to get to work on his own instead of calling for help.  I am sure the man misinterpreted something?  No idea. My feet dont reach the pedal and it is very difficult to use the clutch smoothly and results in very bad foot cramps You need pedal extensions. We have had I think two cars that were small enough that my mom and I (4'8 and 4'9) did not need them, but I would personally prefer to always have them anyway to feel safer. \nAlso I am in the same camp of recently learning that I am technically a dwarf, but it does not really change anything for me. I am the same height I have always been. Pedal extentions is a good i idea . Sounds like it, yeah. Maybe schedule an appointment with an endocrinologist(I believe that is the correct term?) to see if you can find a proper diagnoses. Or do not, you do you. I am not sure I get your bit about those celebrities... I mean, there is a difference between just being short and having dwarfism, it is not just a matter of height. I am sure you get that, but I am just not getting your point, I guess. Pedal extensions are easy to purchase and the car dealership at most places can outfit a special steering wheel for you for an extra $$ amount Having dwarfism (being a Dwarf) is a condition that affects your joints, bones severely. There are over 250 different kinds of dwarfism and a genealogical exam can help you find out what type of Dwarfism you have. I suppose I just wanted to encourage you?  I have no idea why I did that.  lol  I was pretty tired. Just because you are 4'10\" does not mean you are a dwarf or even have dwarfism. I am 5'2\" with skeletal dysplasia, so I have a form of dwarfism and not an LP at the same time. According to the LPA, a dwarf is a fully grown adult 4\u201d10 or under. Thanks You might be. I have a type of dwarfism called hypochondroplasia. It makes us look only slightly disproportionate and people with this type of dwarfism are usually almost average height (I am 4ft8in).\n\n\nMy legs look proportional to my torso but my arms are pretty short and I cannot touch the floor with my hands when I sit on the floor and it was my arms that made my doctor suspicious that I had a type of dwarfism. He then sent me to a geneticist to see if I have the genes for any types of dwarfism. I suggest having a chat to your doctor about it if you think you may have a type of dwarfism.\n\n\nHypochondroplasia is often diagnosed later in life and many people with it never get it diagnosed due to them just being a little bit shorter than normal and looking relatively proportional . it is likely a pretty common type of dwarfism and it is one that is completely benign. I found that to be very reassuring. I am going to go to a doctor in September for my deficiencies stuff.\nThanks for your response.", "I am an able-bodied artist looking for some perspective from differently-abled folks ", "LPA 2019 tips Happy New Year everyone! I am from New Zealand and my sister and I (both Achons) are planning on coming to the LPA in San Fran. We are very excited and have never been before! I know the packs have not come out yet but do you have any tips or info that could help us? We will explore LA for a bit then find a way to get to San Fran for the conference.  Lpa is amazing you will love it! I have been 6 times and have always had a great time and have new experiences.  6 times! You are a pro! Haha. So what are the tips?  If you have any medical advice you need take advantage of being able to book appointments with various drs upon registering and take any scans you nay have if necessary. \n\nThe expo and meet and greets are great you never know what cool gadget you will find and you will instantly make friends from all over.\n\nThe talent shows are fun experiences even if you are not into performing yourself. \n\nSan fran is a great city so really theres alot you can do even if you dont go with the pre organised tours although if you want to fully submerge yourself in the lpa experience maybe do some that interest you as they are always well organised. I would def stay in the main hotel as i have done it once not in the main hotel and it takes abit away from the experience considering you will make friends and want to be around where everything is happening. Right on!  I am going for the first time in like 20 years for me to the same one.\n\nMy only advice (based hazily on what my mother told me) is to sign up for the medical meetings etc as soon as they go up because they fill up fast.\n\nAnd do not be embarrassed about staring if you find yourself doing so.  I remember as a 12 year old it was *shocking* to me to be surrounded by so many other people my height, I could not quite get used to it.  I would never seen multiple other people with dwarfism in the same place like that.  \n\nI remember being pretty amazed at the tours and activities because they were so effortlessly scaled to people like me, it was kind of a new experience and one that I do not think many of us get a lot of the time in day to day life. Ok great so book in medical stuff and basically just explore and enjoy the new experiences! So you have been 6 times, are you from USA I am guessing? Hey thanks for the info! Wow 20 years ago, I think it would have changed a bit aye. Where are you from? haha I will stare but not as much as my sister, I went to the 2017 WDG in Canada so that was my OMG shortys everywhere! It is my younger sisters biggest ever short statured event though so I can imagine she will be in awe!  No I am actually Australian, feel free to PM me if you like.  Welcome to America! San Francisco is an amazing place to experience nightlife, fun tourism and smoke/eat some the best legal weed in the world (if that matters to you.) I am from Los Angeles, which is a 5-8 hour drive to San Francisco. I will most likely be driving with friends or taking the \u201cMegabus\u201d which is a double decker bus (pretty cheap when booked in advance) that leaves from different stations throughout the state and will drop you off up north in San Fran and vice versa. San Francisco is the most expensive city in some ways in the USA next to New York City  so keep that in mind if you are trying to budget. Because it is near Independence Day, things will be crowded and tons of tourists will be out but the packet that LPA puts out will offer you options to experience different days out with the LPA group and people who signed up. There is a dance every single night that most people congregate at. I am 28 years old and I would say the majority of the day for my group is spent hanging with friends, day drinking, LOTS OF SWIMMING/hot tub time, going to nearby places at the hotel to hang out, meeting new people, hanging out in each other\u2019s hotel rooms and having our own get togethers. There is an expo where you can buy things people have made for people with dwarfism/disabilities that helps you in your daily life. The tourists and random public that surround the hotel are always very shocked at first because of how many LPs are walking around that area\u2014but *most* are pretty respectful. I would say be extra careful going out at night and knowing exactly where you are going if walking (amazing public transportation in San Fran)  because there is a large homeless population (one of the largest) and a massive drug problem. I would say download Lyft and Uber and use those rideshare apps mostly. Have a great time and maybe we will cross paths!  Hey thanks so much for all the info! We are very excited and looking forward to the conference packs :D Really good to know about the transport to San Fran from LA. Obviously it is a while away but as a perhaps, maybe we could travel there together? We would like to go along the coast.

I am 21 and have pains and health issues that people get in the 50's (if they do at all). + Ive had enough of people seeing me as laughing stock. Wherever i go theres always looks and giggles and im not talking about kids im talking full grown adults. And i know the issue is with them because they were educated in the wrong way but i cant deal with it. Im fine most days and all this bs builds up causing explosions when im alone. I am going to see a psychologist and got booked to see one.\n\nI feel we are always going to be seen as laughing stock because of the history of dwarves and even now in the creative arts such as movies, theatre etc.\n\nWhat Is you guys' way of dealing with it (aside from not giving a shit because as humans we can only do that for so long)? I am 55, going gray, having lots of trouble with managing my weight (and we know extra weight looks worse on us than anybody!) and there is definitely a lot of physical pain in my life.  Once upon a time I was pretty, and fairly active, but now I need help with every thing (yes, that too.)    \n\n\nIt is very hurtful to be laughed at, unless you have the personality that does not mind being a clown.  It is not okay, and it is a kind of bullying, no doubt about it.  But does not that reflect on THEM? and their lousy personalities?    \n\n\nYou need some heroes who overcame terrible pain, and still did great things with their lives.  They need not be Little People.  Stephen Hawking is a hero of mine.  He was not a perfect person, but he overcame the most substantial physical barriers with his intellect.  Who would have believed a man so completely disabled could do so much, until he did?    \n\n\nPick something that you care about, and start working on doing what you can about it.  You may have the pain of a 50+ year old but you STILL  have more open doors than a 50+ year old can have.  And new research on pain (and your other health issues) may really pay off any time now.  They are not just saying \"Well hey here is another kind of natural substance we can make into a medicine.\" They are actually looking at how pain becomes pain, and how it can be turned off when it is a useless signal.   \n\n\nI want you to believe that because it is true!  I may not live long enough to get my pain controlled again, but odds are really good that you will.  When you are young, you may undervalue being young, especially if it seems you are missing out on the usual advantages of youth--attractiveness, good health.  You have SO many more choices now than you will have as you get older.  Get the best advice you can, get the best education you can, and then make choices that will lead you into the best possible place for you.  \n\n\nMany my age are bitter about how we spent younger years.  We wish we had not had kids, wish we had not married, or whatever.  At 21, you have an almost perfectly clean slate.  You cannot have made many mistakes.  Learn as fast as you can to ignore the laughter of the ignorant, because who cares what they think?  and seize your day.   Be your own best friend and get that good self-talk going whenever someone else has been thoughtless. We just have to prove to the world that we are more than just miniature people\u2014that we can provide more to the world beyond being mere visual gags. We need dwarfs who go on to do important things, and respect themselves enough to not allow themselves to be seen as a joke. Now that we live in a pretty equalized society (in terms of opportunity and means of spreading information), it is only a matter of time until someone with dwarfism becomes popular for something more than just their dwarfism. \n\nOnce the general perception goes beyond the disability, and into the individual, then the laughs will slowly begin to get quieter. It is only a matter of time, how you cope with life until then is up to you; do you want to bide your time, taking the punches until your situation changes? Or do you want to put the time and energy into trying to make that change happen now? Either option is going to be exhausting, just pick which one you prefer. Pretty sure we are just shitty Wal-Mart knockoff clones of the aliens, built here on earth to act as game wardens, preparing the aliens an ability to communicate with humans during their great harvest and purge. \n\nWe will probably get some shitty reparations and a gold watch for our service. I reckon aliens are far more comfortable than us 'Wal-Mart' knockoffs In my opinon, as far as there are even a few of us working in such industries which makes us look like clowns, this wont end.  And im not saying those who are should stop, at the end of the day everyone is their own person with their own morals and beliefs..  Thank you, i appreciate your time I want to ask if you are going to be okay but I know that that answer is usually going to be \"No\" or \"Not really\" at best.  But I hope there will be good times, and times when you are just content.  In this whole universe there probably are not many eyes that can see beautiful things, brains that can think great thoughts.  I hope those things can make up for the frail bodies and busy pain receptors we have.  I saw one sunset that was worth all of the pain up to that moment. To be honest, the answer to that question would have been a strong no a year ago as i was heavily depressed which comes in waves for me. For now the answer is not sure as i dont know what life holds for me as it can change rapidly. Ive come to terms with life in the context of some people have it left right and centre and some live an easyish life with minimal problems.\n\nP.s sunsets and nature in general is very amazing - one of the minor reasons im still alive is the beauty of this planet which again, us humans are f***ing up It gets a little easier to overcome depression when you have beaten it before.  It helps if you have a good doctor who can really listen and get you on antidepressants that work without making you feel like someone else.  \n\nI have taken lots of college courses in history, philosophy, chemistry, and math, but I love the long view I got from geology.  The Earth is amazing.  Life is strikingly resilient.  When an asteroid that might have been 50 miles across hit central America, it set fire to all the forests around the world.  For weeks or months, no sunlight could reach plants on land or in the sea. 75% of all species ceased to be.  Dinosaurs covered the world, and in one bad month every one bigger than a modern rat was gone--their descendants are the birds.  Mammals managed to scrape through that awful time.  And among those were the special few whose descendants were the primates, and somehow some of them tamed fire, simple machines like the lever, the wheel, the screw.  You know what else we humans might manage to tame?  Ourselves.  We have statistical science, we can measure what we do to the environment.  And we can change that.   We can stop overfishing, stop dumping plastic in the ocean.  (I am more concerned about the plastic than anything else. Life has overcome higher temperatures and lower temperatures.  It has never had to overcome microplastic.  But there may be reason for optimism on that, too--looks like microbes are evolving to chow down on and break up plastic.)  \n\nWhat do you love learning about?  You are a thoughtful, caring person and it is clear you are intelligent.  The world does not seem to make much room for people like you but if you meet people who care about the same things, it does not have to be as lonely. 50 miles is 80.47 km \nDidnt know there were microbes eating up all the plastic - i guess the world finds a way to survive every time. I recently got my degree (in film production) and can say that im not very interested in learning for myself anymore. I made a decision that as long as i am alive and on this earth, i will try and help people even if that means putting myself in 2nd place. Some could say that this is unhealthy but i see every day i am alive as a bonus. I may not be very suited for this world we live in, but i will try and help those in trouble which are more suited. Everyone is living through issues in their life, some more than others. Ive been learning about all the different people around me and how to help them overcome their problems. And if i truly care for this person, i will care for them more than myself. This could be seen as me trying to bandage my own problems and maybe it is, but these are some of my morals for now and i dont think they will change anytime soon..

Ffs \ud83e\udd23 yvan eht nioj Your post hit close to home for me. I have struggled with similar issues most of my life beginning in elementary school and now I am in my 30's. I graduated college and had a great job for a few years but due to my form of dwarfism have always required personal cares. Unfortunately, after about 5 years of doing a high stress job, life pretty much beat me down. Since then life has been a daily struggle of trying to manage both my physical and mental pain to just get through each day. I want to do something meaningful with my life but deep long-term depression seems to be a vicious cycle that I have not found a way to overcome yet. Anti-depressants have worked here and there but the ones that have for me came with side-effects I could not deal with. Anywho, I guess my point is, you are not alone and I am hoping that you, I, and others who struggle with these things can keep struggling on long enough until we find it in ourselves to breakthrough all the pain to find some joy in life.

It is a tale of masculinity in crisis/toxic masculinity, explored through the lens of the old wild west. As a filmmaker, I enjoy exploring topical/relevant issues via the medium of genre stories. The western has typically been the true frontier of masculine Hollywood heroes, so I believe it is the perfect structure to interrogate masculinity in the 21st century.\n\nThe main trio of this film consists of 3 would-be heroes who are each battling with a different aspect of masculinity; Dick Mitten is a young, timid worrier who is often branded a coward due to his tendency to avoid conflict and \u201cweasel his way\u201d out of sticky situations. John Manson is a character whom we meet as a fiery \u201cbearded-lady\u201d who abandons the circus he has been chained to for many years (Whilst in modern day, John could openly identify as a trans-male, the 19th century setting forces him to amp up his masculine traits in order to convince other men of his strength). \u201cItsy-Bitsy\u201d is a bandit with dwarfism; He is a boastful, exaggerating highwayman who may well be embellishing his stories of thrilling robberies and heists. \n\nI am incredibly aware of the importance of representation in cinema today; I am incredibly keen to explore the film\u2019s theme using these three diverse characters but it would be disingenuous to claim I would be able to truly author these character\u2019s voices without speaking to those who can share their experience. I am very interested in learning about how individuals with dwarfism feel about masculinity and whether their experiences have been affected or influenced by masculinity.\n\nI would love to hear from anyone whom this situation applies to. Whilst the film is still, at it is heart a comedy, I want to use humour to explore serious themes and therefore would be also very keen to learn about how individuals with dwarfism feel towards how dwarfism is represented in films; what sorts of things are positive and are there also any damaging/negative ways of representing this. \n\nI would like to thank anyone in advance from reading and responding to my post, I would be incredibly grateful to learn about people\u2019s experiences.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nSam In my opinion, we are seen as something to laugh at because of writing like yours when its only a small percentage of us which are happy about this. I know its the art &amp; we shouldnt be so sensitive, however when youre walking on the street and 8/10 are laughing or grinning writing like yours just makes the situation worse. \n\nIm sure youre an amazing writer &amp; this is all just one opinion.. Thank you for sharing your perspective as I think it is super important to hear all opinions! How do you personally feel like characters with dwarfism should be represented onscreen? Do you think there is anything/any particular way a character could be presented which would be seen as a positive representation? Just be realistic--I think that is what matters most. People in that setting are primed to view dwarfs as nothing more than jokes, perhaps not even considering him a real person.\n\nYou would probably just need a naturally written juxtaposition between how the character is viewed by others and how he truly is, but that is a lot harder than it sounds to do without coming off as \"heavy-handed\". I think that is a really interesting way of framing it; the contrasting juxtaposition of how he is viewed vs who he really is. A brilliant thought, cheers! The best character with Dwarfism I have ever read/seen was Tyrion from GOT. His experience was very relatable - even though I was a 28yo woman living in modern times and not an aristocratic man, living back in the ages:)\n\nWhat surprised me was how readily Normates were able to relate to his character too. All these guys with angsty relationships with their dad were talking about him as if they 'were' him. It was fascinating.

Hello everyone,\n\nMy 2-year-old son has achondroplasia.  Recently my wife and I were considering starting him on growth hormone (HGH) shots, however our doctor is strongly against it.  The doctor\u2019s reasoning is that it may not affect his final adult height, and may even be detrimental.

The study also mentions abnormal growth rates, however, another study (Tanaka, et al., 1998) states that \u201cGH did not promote further disproportion.\u201d  In the end, Ramaswami states that \u201cGH therapy coupled with the opportunity of leg lengthening^1 will alleviate the disproportion and carry the possibility of adult stature for patients within the lower end of the normal range.\u201d  So, it may make things worse, or it may make things better, or it may do nothing at all.  And then there is the increased risk of diabetes and cancer along with other side effects, like joint pain, edema, carpel tunnel...\n\nWe will visit our doctor February 23rd, **so I am asking for your opinions and, more importantly, experiences before we pursue this.**  I notice that my sources seem a little dated, however I hear mostly good things in my search; any insight would be most welcome.\n\n\nI also had some other concerns and questions:\n\n(1) I am assuming the injections are still once a day every day.  I read an article stating smaller doses twice a day might be more affective and other less credible sources mentioning oral treatments.\n\n(2) We will be going on vacation in the States for a month: would I be able to get a month\u2019s worth supply, would we have to pause treatment, or\u2026 well, what are my other options? (The big hiccup here is that we currently live in Korea and do not have US health insurance, so getting GH from another doctor in the States would be difficult.)\n\n(3) Also, in a long shot, if we do start him on HGH, will that make him ineligible to receive BMN-111 treatment when/if that ever comes out?  (We are not holding our breath for this \u201cwonder drug\u201d, however if it is available in ~10 years and it does show promise, I do not want my son to be excluded from the option to take it.)\n\n^1 Do not get me wrong, we are not proponents for the invasive limb lengthening surgery, however when he gets older it will be his decision whether or not to have it, not ours.\n\n\n*Works Cited*\n\nRamaswami, U., Rumsby, G., Spoudeas, H.

The location for the national is always changing. It is been a while for me. Granted I never went to a national. People pay for their own travel to conferences and meetings.  The regional meetings will probably be closer to you.  Going to a regional meeting is often a good start because there are fewer people there and your cousin can get to know people.  If you live in an area that is not really very active, you could also consider going to a neighboring areas regional. LPA is expensive... fucking expensive, almost prohibitively so.

If a \"cure\" were to come available, which seems very likely in a few years, would you promote its use for infants?  Meaning the future would have few, if any, people with achondoplasia and perhaps most forms of dwarfism.  And, if there were a pill children could take, which would block the receptors and allow bone growth, they would still have some noticable disproportionately, but would be tall enough to play sports and not be in pain.  Would you be worried about the childs identity? They may still identify with dwarfs, but not be short, so would there be backlash from the achon community which could lead to inner crisis for the child?

Let me know your usernames &amp; I will follow back!", "TTRPG designer and Fantasy writer with some questions. Hi, hope questions liked these are not asked to often, so I have come to ask about how I should handle dwarfism in my game and my setting. A brief background on the setting, it is a low-fantasy medieval setting with a focus on drawing ideas and customs from history, with the attempt at making some things more inclusive for the modern ttrpg audience. Many of the stories will have an emphasis on knights, or similar people through history, going on adventures and getting into fights trying to acquire titles and fame. Now a brief tangent, dwarfs in this setting are just humans with some form of dwarfism, not a separate race. With that brief overview out the way, onto my questions.\n\nA.)  Do you feel like dwarfs fighting in armor, and with weapons with near equal strength, effectiveness and skill to the average person is pandering or discredits your issues? I know besides stature there is other conditions that I have heard are typical- joint &amp; bone problems, breathing problems, chronic pain, etc. These are things I do not want to outright ignore, but from a game design standpoint should there be some mechanical emphasis on them and how strong of an emphasis? For narrative and worldbuilding,(story and such unrelated to game mechanics) How present should they be? And how meaningful should their impact on fighting be? Tangent: Now, I do not personally know how much dwarfism affects a person's capabilities to fight outside basic things you could apply to anyone- I can only make general assumptions but I try not to assume too much: Strength and reach are an advantage, so a 6'6 dude who can bench 250 is probably going to win a fist fight against a 5'4 person who can bench 200, like 9/10 times hand to hand. Throw a sword into the mix, then strength and size advantage are going to diminish a lot compared to skill.\n\nB.) Is adapting the real life causes of dwarfism something I should adhere to very strictly, or am I given some liberties and freedoms to adjust how these things might work? Starting with the most extreme example of non-general people, sometimes magical forces, spirits/spells/auras etc., can affect developing children and give them fantastical features like horns, antlers, rabbit ears, and it can affect their height. Now this is the more extreme examples of what sort of non-average people can be born which I want to share for context, so let us look at something that just affects height alone, and is not magical. Should it be the exact same as real world conditions like Achondroplasia, or should there also be say some genetic conditions in setting with their own different symptoms, that can be beneficial and hindering in their own respects: Like having dense bones that make you slower but more durable, or lighter and more nimble at the cost of being less able to take hard hits?   \n\n\nI reckon these are really the only 2 questions I have for now, hoping to hear feed back on them and I would like to apologize if I said anything offensive. Still trying to learn all this and hope you can all bare with me. We do get asked a lot of questions from writers. Not many go to such lengths to demonstrate their own efforts in the work though. Some are downright lazy \"tell me your story\"... Lol. You do not sound lazy.\n\nI found your questions re. Causes of dwarfism really interesting. I like that your sticking to dwarfs being short statured humans but I also really like the otherworldly causes of it, like spells. My greek relatives used to tell my mum I was short because I was cursed with the evil eye... one used to cross herself when she would see me. \n\nMaybe you could play into some bigoted superstitions held by the populace. If it is mediaeval they would not know what achodroplasia was so might as well be some ambiguity about curses and magic. I think you can take some liberties here. \n\nAs for fighting advantage... There really is not any. The size reach and weight difference makes it a complete waste of time for us. I used to do Taekwondo and fantasized about my nimbelness being good enough to mitigate those disadvantages. Its not, not by a long shot. I would look to GOT for guidance on this. Tyrion was never going to win a fight. He had to be smart and stay off the battlefield. \n\nI did read thare were LPs that faught in the  American civil war but they had guns and 'm still not sure they would have been able to keep up with troop movements. Maybe you could have an LP as an archer? They would need to be very broad chested with very long arms though so I am not sure what condition that would reflect except maybe some growth plate damage done to the legs in childhood.\n\nIf you have magic, I suppose they could be mages...?\n\nYou are mentioning of stocky builds and dense bones remind me a lot of the other species sci version of us. Windlings rule!  (Windlings were from the Earthdawn world, and my favorite RPG race to play.  About the size of a human toddler and winged.  My GM cut my by-the-book weight allowance substantially after I just started taking bowling-ball size rocks aloft and dropping them.)  \n\n\nI played a lot of RPGs, and always enjoyed playing characters whose small size provided advantages.  Of course being LP in real life is not like that.  There are usually health struggles, and difficulties using things of all sorts that were designed for big hands, big feet, long torsos, average or above average reach.  Just getting pants to fit properly....  \n\n\nImagine being in a grocery store and more than half of products are way out of your reach, the cart comes up to your chin, and people do not even see you and run you over with their carts and children.  I use restrooms that are supposed to be accessible, but cannot wash my hands as the sink is too far back.   It gets old.  (Yes, I carry hand sanitizer, but I would rather wash them!)  \n\n\nI never played a character with disabilities.  It just would not be fun.  However you design your world, do not just make a race the other characters will eventually see as disposables to send ahead and spring any traps.  Balance is key. First off I would like to thank you for taking your time to answer some of my questions. \n\nAlso I would like to say I do regret my example of, \"Should it make them dense boned, or Nimble?\" somewhat: Speaking from the perspective of game design, It is a very binary way of thinking about people, putting them into this sort of \"they are a +1 this, -1 that\"; Applicable to certain things maybe but this certainly does not feel like one of those instances. I think a better, more believable example would be maybe they are very disadvantaged in combat, but they can interact with society in different ways to the average character. Part of the game is interacting with the courts, and I could see a lot of interesting scenarios brought about because someone stands out from the crowd in any way. Maybe you might have to deal with people who are hateful towards you- but having a sharp tongue against them would prove very handy, since if you can throw a witty comeback well that might be doubly as humiliating to them. In other instances you might have to be seen as special, and desirable even amongst certain groups who find that sort of uniqueness worth investing in. People might be more likely more likely to listen to you, or ascribe positive traits like wisdom or even holiness to you- that might also be a double edged sword because well now you have a reputation to live up to. Would you agree or disagree with any of these assessments?  \n\n\nBriefly talking about combat again. So as far as the setting goes, there is definitely room for Little People in the world, they surely would be in the courts, in towns, part of a main caste of characters- I would love to write stories with them feeling a whole host of roles. When it comes to the accompanying game I am designing, the issue comes with combat. I do not want to get into detail too much but in summary, my game is about fighting and talking- if you are a character who cannot fight at all you are missing half the game, and I am sure some people would be fine with that, but even if a condition gives a player nothing but disadvantages in combat, I would still want them to participate in combat. I am wondering if maybe, I do have balance where they can hold their own, especially with allies helping them, would that feel disingenuous?\n\nAddendum: I do have other people with disadvantageous conditions in the setting that do fight, but I have seen actual reenactors, both women and amputees, fight in armor with weapons against men and the able bodied. Also in history there are very distinct examples, even if rare, of this thing happening. Armor and weapons are such equalizers and enhancers that, again I feel when they are involved skill out trumps strength by a significant margin. Now I have not seen a little person fight in armor, but if I can assume: Depending on the causes and any other conditions with it, if I had to bet money on the person with dwarfism, a longsword and plate armor vs someone with none of those, well I would bet on the dwarf. Especially if they are between maybe, 4'5-4'10: But I do not know, and this is just wild assumption and speculation on my part- but this is to say, I could believe one fighting in my setting very well, now's just the question from before, is it disingenuous to do so?   \n(apologies for this long ass response and if I rambled a bit) First off I would like to thank you for taking the time to reply.\n\nAlso, good old strategy there, \"Grab a rock and toss it where they cannot get to you.\"\n\nI guess, my response to this may be, with how I am designing. As a player of games, I do not usually do what makes the most sense statistically? Like I would wear a suit of armor that looked cool to me, even if the stats on it were bad, or I might pick a halfling in D&amp;D (who is size means they cannot use heavy weapons without disadvantage), but I would still grab a greatsword anyways because it is cool, and it is not to unbelievable for me to do so. And if my group would have my character die because whatever condition they had made them less effective, I just would not play with those. Like I want to play a character who is a person, and people in real life are not usually minmaxed. So, with that in mind, do you see any problem with me and how I am going about the design of the game, and subsequently, design of the world and the inclusion of inclusivity?\n\nAs for balance, well if balance might necessitates some liberties, how many liberties with how little people in the setting could I have before it no longer becomes a fair, and acceptable representation? How fantastical can it be, how realistic should it be, if it is fantastical what are some disadvantages I should focus on to make sure things are still genuine?  \n\n\nSorry if I am rambly. I am 3'11 and a woman. I would realistically assume the way I would make do in a mediaeval town is by having wealthy male relatives that could support me... Lol, not a very engaging storyline. But I would have been unmarriagable. Maybe I could have worked if I was lucky. If I was really lucky maybe I could have had an education and some appt with the church. I am not sure about sex work... That may have been an option. The LP woman in GOT was an entertainer... \n\nI read a great history book about the role of dwarfs in the Spanish courts once. They were educated and used as confidants. Their disability made them social outcasts which made them unthreatening to courtiers and privy to a lot of information.\n\nThe fighting stuff... I am not sure I can add anymore to what I have already said. Longswords and armour are heavy and require weight behind them. Maybe a tall dwarf male with no other medical conditions could beat a foe with no weapons. Games are usually pretty liberal with the possible so yeah, it could work. Maybe look to Naruto for ideas on this. They were always really creative with fighting skills. Alrighty, and again I thank you for your time I hope you enjoyed answering my questions. Also I want to apologize briefly, feel like I did not explain enough of the setting to paint a real picture of how the world works, but I did not want to fall into any more rambling about unimportant details. I will take your suggestions to heart and hopefully I can use them to make the best version of my setting and game there can be. \n\nIf you have any more suggestions or things you think I should consider I would love to hear them- also I would love to know which book spoke about dwarves in the spanish court. I have heard alot about court dwarves, though admittedly most sources out there are based on a later period than the one I am drawing most my inspirations from. I do not remember that specific one. The two I still own are : 'The dwarf' by Par Lagerkvist and 'the lives of dwarfs: their journey from public curiosity to social liberation' by Betty Adelson.  The first one is a novel set in Italian court  The second is a non-fiction history. The Spanish stuff may have been from the 2\u00f1d book. It is been a while since I read it. It was excellent but rather long.", "What do you guys do to lose weight?  Mostly calorie counting and walking a lot.

Dm me :)) ", "Question about video games Edit: Well, video games as well as D&amp;D or anything of the like.\n\nSo one thing I have wondered about for a while (I really hope it is not an offensive thing to ask) but when you play games like World of Warcraft, Dragon Age or anything like that with custom characters. Do you make your custom character look like you? And the big question, when you make your character based on your likeness, do you usually go for the \"Dwarf\" or \"Gnome\" option when it is there, or do you just go for \"human\" with \"regular\" height? \n\nEven if you do not play games like that I would like to know if you would pick the \"dwarf\" option and why\n\nOn a side note: how do you feel about video games making dwarf a \"race\" option instead of a \"size\" or \"height\" option? Even though dwarves in fantasy are typically used as a different species with their own culture and such.\n\nI really hope I did not say anything to offend any of you, but if so I will of course take the post down. Ok, guess its my time to shine. This is coming from someone who is been both a gamer for most of his life and recently delves in game design as well.\n\nFor years being able to pick a character that I identified with was not an option being that most video game heroes pandered to the male power fantasy (eastern as well as western). If a game was progessive enough to allow me some kind of agency, I would take it. Be it naming the character after me or customising their clothes.\n\nIf there was no such option for agency l, then I would usually pick characters or playstyles that resembled my approach at issues: stealthy tacticians that go for crit damage or rangers; as I knew perfectly well I would not be a powerful fighter or barbarian IRL.\n\nThen after a while vgs started to include fully customizable characters and I ate it up. I can spend hours trying to get my character to resemble me IRL. Yes l, height is still a big issue when shaping any character to resemble me as max/min height limit is generally standarized all across vgs. That is not to say some vgs provide a wide spectrum of height range.\n\nWhen it comes to dwarf as a class or archetype, yes it is usually based some way or another in the fantasized version of JRR Tolkien or D&amp;D, something I personally do not mind. Fantasy dwarves are bad ass (currently playing a female Hill dwarf monk for a 5e DnD campaign).\n\nSpeaking of DnD, when I first started playing I would usually gravitate towards rogue halflings because edgy teen. Then after a while I moved to half-elf rangers/bards. \n\nAs a small person growing up (heh) I never questioned the misrepresentation of dwarfs or ppl below average height in games or media. Sure I was aware of Tolkien's dwarves and hobbits, halflings in D&amp;D, Disney's version of Snow White, even Willow. But I never registered them as being in the same ballpark as actual small people nor was I really concerned with us being realistically portrayed. \n\nNow I have started to question any portrayal of a small person in any type of media. But still consider fantasy portrayals of dwarves or similar kin a band appart.\n\nNowadays I play whatever tickles my fancy. Huge barbarian half orc, mysterious human wizard, foppish elven bard l, grudgy ranger... the list goes on. I have come to a place where whoever I play does not need to appeal to my real life image.\nI have gone from expecting to find a character I identify with to making any character my own.\n\nHope that answered your question. I make myself short normally.  It just feels right.\n\nBut for a long time I played as a fuckin cow in WoW, so what do I know? I try to make my first character in a game a character similar to me: I am short, but I am broad and barrel-chested, so dwarven fighter with as big a weapon as I can get my hands on is mostly what I try to emulate. There is definitely an element of trying to recreate myself in these worlds, although more and more as my health has gotten worse (or if i am playing a second or third character in a game), I have strayed away from that idealized version of myself and played characters that are more what I would *want* to be if life came with a character creation screen.\n\nThis is a lot more varied, and is really game-dependent. In Monster Hunter: World, my character's a tall, ripped looking dude with a badass beard and giant staff. In Dark Souls, I am a medium height, medium build dex weapon user. In Pillars of Eternity (the most recent Baldur's Gate-style game I have played), I was an Aumani, a half-giant type, who was a martial artist. The races and genders are all pretty varied, and were largely dependent on my favorite books or shows and the characters in them as much as they were on me building an avatar to \"escape\" into.\n\nAs to how I feel about them being a race vs. just a size option... I do not really feel any particular way, I guess. If it were not relevant to the lore of the game (such as in Dragon Age where dwarves are literally their own race) it would definitely be questionable being other'd like that, but since there is generally a lore justification for literally categorizing dwarves as different races most of the time, eh, who cares Thank you! I have always gravitated towards playing as dwarves in games and D&amp;D myself, so I definitely get just going with what tickles your fancy compared to what resembles you. \n\nI cannot help but notice your username though, so do you mind if I ask how you feel about Tyrion? Him being called an imp and being mistreated by people due to his condition? As well as him probably being the best known little person character that is not used as a joke in media, do you feel it helps people get a better understanding of little people? Thanks for the reply. And honestly if I had the option to play as a cow in games, I would pick that every single time. You are welcome!\n\nI love Tyrion Lannister as a character and as a representation of how it is to live as a small person in a society that venerates physical apperance and height. I love Peter Dinklage's interperation as well.\n\nAnd I respect George RR Martin for being able to write a complex, believable character with below average stature. I do not know where he got his references or if he consulted a small person, but it is amazing how he was able to capture the nuisances, drawbacks and perks of being short in a tall world. Thank you, since you usually go for what sounds like the Warrior class, I assume you do not mind dwarves in some games not being able to be mages? (like Dragon Age, which I am currently playing as a Warrior dwarf). \n\nAnd for the record those are some good games you listed, especially Pillars of Eternity. If you want to play more of those old school RPG's I would recommend divinity: Second Sin, it is madd by the studio making Baldur's Gate 3. Thanks again. Tyrion was definitely one of the biggest highlights of the show as well as the books. I am a writer who honestly plays RPGs more for the story than the actual gameplay most times (the exception to this being like Monster Hunter, God Eater, and Warframe, the sorts of games where story is really just there to give barebones explanations of why your character is acting the way they are). As long as there is a logically consistent reason for a limitation like that that is not broken throughout the rest of the narrative (like if you got a dwarf mage companion whose magery was not ever explained, I would be annoyed), but Dragon Age is pretty great about maintaining consistency in that sense. \n\nI actually am a HUGE Divinity nerd; I have been following Larian for a while, Divinity is absolute gold! While I would have to give my favorite fantasy RPG series to Dragon Age, Divinity is very close behind. In general, it is probably my third or fourth favorite series, not-so-distantly behind the Mass Effect trilogy, Dragon Age, and then Nier: Automata Dragon Age is actually my favorite game franchise, nice to see someone that also loves it, while Mass Effect is probably my second favorite (I have a paragade tattoo, so you could say I might like it too much). I have been following Larian Studios since Dragon Commander, so I cannot wait for Baldur's Gate 3. Have to say, I like your taste in games. \n\nOh and thanks again for sharing your thoughts about Dwarves in games. Thank God we do not have to choose the character that most resembles ourselves.  I would get awfully tired of selecting \"Asshole\" for every game.", "I am sorry, but I really want to know this about genitalia and dwarfism and I hope its ok. I know that this is a \"weird question\", but it is something I have always wondered about. Its not my intention to offend anyone. Do dwarf men and female have normal size genitals? To but it in blunt terms, do dwarf men have normal size D's and dwarf women normal size V's? \n\nLogically, they should not. If for example and dwarf man was \"hung\", that would mean that his genitalia would be almost the size of his arm or leg. There is only so much blood in the human body and if an erection would occur that would probably seriously affect the blood supply to the rest of his body.\n\nAs for dwarf women, I dont know. It would be interesting to hear if dwarf women who have dated normal size men feel discomfort because of the \"size\". The thing is tho that babies with dwarfism are almost the same size as any other child when born, so there should not be any size difference down there for women, right? So, before I answer, some information about me specifically, since a lot of types of dwarfism/stature disorder are different!  I have achondroplasia, the most common type of dwarfism.  Essentially this means that while my torso is of an average size, the long bones in my arms and legs (like my upper arms) are much shorter, which means I am short.  Ironically, we figure that if my legs were in proportion to my torso, I would actually be a fairly tall woman - my mother is 5'9\" and I am slightly taller than her when we sit down on the same level!\n\nBecause my torso is average size, all my bits are also average size.  My sexual organs function as normal and are in the normal place, with no size differences.  All of the partners I have had have been of average height and have ranged in height from about 5'5\" to 6' or so.\n\nWhat **does** cause issues is the curvature of my spine.  While achondroplasia impacts the arms and legs more than the torso, one way it does impact the torso is an increased curvature of the spine.  The upper part of my spine looks about average, but the lower part where it curves forward has a much deeper curve than the average person -- this is what causes the \"pot belly\" that you sometimes seen on people with dwarfism.\n\nWhat it also does is make my hips align awkwardly if I am laying on my back, meaning that anything going in me is going to hit at a weird angle and possibly be uncomfortable.  Not because of the size, again, but because of the angle -- it took me awhile to figure this out and made gynecological exams a painful **nightmare** till I asked a gyno familiar with dwarfism what the hell I should tell doctors who were not, and she explained how **I** should explain the angle in which they should go in with a speculum.  Same thing, more or less, with a man's genitals.\n\nConsequently, the only real difference for me is that missionary is uncomfortable and awkward, which is easily remedied by using another position. I am 4\u20197\u201d and girls are always taken aback by my size. Not abnormally big but on the bigger end of average at  7 inches. Keep in mind like anything else, everyone is different. I will provide pics if I am talked into it lol. To answer on of your questions about blood flow: that is ridiculous haha.... for my type of dwarfism I have a normal torso but short limbs like Peter Dinklage and Wee Man, so blood circulation is normal like anyone else haha...Your question is like if I suddenly had big genitalia and was not born with so my body could not adjust lol. Anyways, hope this helped. I just want to ask why  Simplest answer: Dwarfism is something that effects the skeleton\u2014 our genitals are not apart of the skeletal system.\n\n\u2018Nuff said. Thank you so much for answering! Thank you for answering man! Np  Right, I would actually wonder if anything it would give men with achrondroplasia bigger penises because your heart is the same size but pumping through shorter limbs and therefore there is more energy left to divert to the penis.

I cannot speak to the experience, but I hear that it is common practice in Italy; moreso than in other parts of the world. I wonder if that might be a clue to help you find more perspective? I have not done much research tbh, but I have been wanting it for a while. It is just really expensive here in the US and my insurance will not cover it because it is \u201ccosmetic\u201d. I also heard it is extremely painful but if I can get like 5 inches from it, it would be worth it I can imagine that being a hard decision. I (F, 5'9) do not know much about the surgeries, but my partner (M, 4'3, achondroplasia) had considered them at one point. Ultimately he decided against it because, while the extra few inches would be great, he did not find that it would be worth the long period of time that he would be bedridden in recovery. I think he said 2-3 years??? I do not think his decision even factored the cost into it; at least, I do not remember him talking about that aspect as much as him not wanting to \"give up\" that much of his life. \n\nAlso, re: Italy, I am fairly certain that their surgeries are covered by their national healthcare system. So that may play in to why it is so much more common than in the US, for example. I lived in Italy for quite a few years and you are right, the healthcare system covers it. I met quite a few people that had it done and some that were having it done at the time. Nowadays you are not bedridden during most recovery time. I have seen that now they are even using internal rods to do some of it instead of external fixators. I (M,21) have had multiple surgeries before and because i know the risks &amp; how unlucky i have been with my surgeries have decided for years now that the risks outweigh the pros. Im from the UK &amp; it would be of no cost for me. My condition also makes me have very short arms, so proportion was a big part too. With longer legs &amp; arms 1/4 of the size of my legs i feel id look like  a dinosaur \ud83e\udd23 of course there would be looaadds of benefits if it was all successful, i just wanted to give you the reason why i wont go ahead with it, not trying to talk you out of it at all.. Can I ask which condition you have? My child had dwarfism and his arms are significantly shorter than his legs. Acromesomelic dysplasia What were the risks? And what was it like undergoing the surgery? I would be bedridden? Damn.. that is not something I can or even want to do.\nThough I am really tempted because a few inches could really help me out. I am kind of short even for  someone with achondroplasia. I think I need to do a bit more research.\nI do not have the money now but I do have a good amount saved up. If I will not be bedridden then it is something I really want to do though pain is another factor that is holding me back. Ive had to have spinal surgeries, ive not had limb lengthening done. There are a lot of risks with surgeries like these. A few are nerves &amp; blood vessel injuries where they cannot adapt to the new size of the leg which is why its a long process of recovery. Extreme ones can be loosing mobility in your legs. This wont be as prevalent but again theres a chance of anything when youre having heavy surgery. You would be bedridden for the whole process of recovery. Youll likely have to be in bed for a year at least, depending on how tall you want to go.. to be mobile you would need a wheelchair.. Is it the same? Though i doubt it the prevalence seems to be 1 &lt; 10 million \ud83e\udd23 There is a young American lady called Chandler Crews that had it done on her legs and on her arms. I am sure she had a blog and or website where she talks about her journey. I think she also has a page on Facebook. Good luck with whatever path you choose. Thank you! I will look into that! Oh. I guess that makes sense. Thanks for sharing. I know nothing when it comes to this so any bit of information is important for me. I guess it makes sense. Holy shit, I have this condition! It is not as rare as I thought.\n\nI have never had any surgeries though. I was always told this kind of dwarfism had next to no problems requiring surgery. What have you had done?\n\nI would love to get my arms lengthened but suspect it is quite hard and risky to do. If you are limited with funds, I would get your upper arms done first and then see how it goes. Upper arm lengthening is quite common with achondroplasia and will give you the biggest 'bang for your buck' re. benefits.\n\nWhile you will not be taller, you will be able to **reach** a lot more things. You will also find it easier to wash yourself and do your shoes up. Will pm you now Dont let me push you away from it but you should know about those points before you jump in &amp; make plans. You should talk to a professional who can give you proper advice I have read about this!  My kiddo's genes point to something else but it does not totally fit. His proportions look closer to acro than to what he actually has. There is a more severe version of what his genes point to, which genetics suspects is his actual Dx, but his legs are slightly longer than the very few people i can find with the more severe version. My kiddo's symptoms point to langer mesomelic dysplasia, his genres suggest the less severe leri weill, but given that his dwarfism was picked up because of his shortened forearms at 19w gestation, it is likely lmd not lw.  He is almost 4 now and his ulnas are probably the length of a newborn ulna. I should say, lmd and lwd are very very very similar genetically, which is why genetics assumes he actively has lmd. That has not even crossed my mind but that seems like a good idea. My arms are pretty short and just being able to reach stuff would be a game changer for me. It is ok you are not. I am honestly really grateful for the advice I have been getting. I understand, the common ground is mesomelia which is basically short arms (Humerus &amp; ulna+radius). If you have any questions feel free to pm me.. Just saw this bit.. I see since hes so young theres not a 100% diagnosis im guessing, which was similar to our situation because its so rare &amp; not a lot is known about it so doctors leave it open ended instead of diagnosing incorrectly.. Thank you! I might actually do that if you do not mind. I have questions. Of course! I perform these surgeries quite regularly so I probably have a bias view. That being said, so many patients find themselves happier and enjoying life more than beforehand.\n\nA good example to look up is Chandler Crews. She underwent limb lengthening by a colleague of mine and had great success. Sorry I never got a notification for this.\n\n\nThanks I will look her up!\n\nI just want to do as much research as possible for this. this is just not true lol.

It does not matter what you look like. It is not paedophilia because you are not a child. Thank you \ud83e\udd7a I am sorry if this question offended someone As long as you are both happy with each other its fine! \n\nShould not care! Size does not determine one being pedophilia whether a male or female tall or short. \n\nShould not matter what others think so long as your happy, your real friends/family will be happy and accepting of it. Do you really not understand what pedophilia is? just because you are short that does not make you less of an adult. You are a full grown woman with condition different than the person you are going to have sex with. That is it. You are a developed a woman with adult parts not like a child It is completely fine as long as both party\u2019s consent and are of age It is absolutely okay.  As long as you can physically handle it, and it feels good and is what you want, go for it!\n\nRegarding the pedophilia:  This is likely something that you are going to run into in your life at some point.  I have very definitely interacted with people who I refer to as \"pseudo-pedos\" on perfectly normal dating etc sites.  Talking about me being their \"little girl\" and all that rot that puts a bad taste in their mouth.  There *are* people who might attempt to fulfill that fetish with you but they are generally pretty easy to catch out.\n\n***But a man being attracted to you in no way implies that is why he is attracted to you.***  You are more than your height, you are a woman and it is totally normal for people to find you attractive.  Do not assume that he is trying to fetishize you unless you see proof of that.  Have fun! I am a woman with dwarfism. I do not at all look like a kid naked. I do not look like one clothed either... I look like a woman with dwarfism.\n\nThat being said. In Australia this was always a joke I would hear made to guys that told their friends the liked me or thought i was hot. Man people have fucking hangups over here. Also, I suspect this poster does not actually have dwarfism. 100% ok. Pedophilia implies there is an underage minor involved. You are both grown adults who can constent to sexual intercourse, so there is nothing wrong here. And try to let yiurself be comfortable with someone legitimately finding you attractive because of how your body looks rather than in spite of it. I promise you, if he is there for the right reasons, it will make everything that much more special. Listen to your lp inner voice .

This question kind of bothers me for a few reasons. I have NEVER thought my wife looked like anything except the most amazing and beautiful woman in the world. \n\nTrue enough, I am aware of her height. Sometimes she needs me to grab something off a shelf, help hang up a jacket, or carry her suitcase when we travel. No problem. It is my privilege and honor to help her.\n\n- she is not disabled. She is just shorter.\n\nIt neither affects how I think of her nor what she can or cannot do as a person. Most of the time I do not even think of her height. Occasionally I will see a reflection of us together in a shop window and I think\u2026wow. She is beautiful! Beyond reaching high shelves, there is little she cannot do that I can.\n\nThis translates into the bedroom. I have never thought there was anything weird going on. We make love as any other couple would. Occasionally someone will ask awkward questions \u201chow does sex work with you two?\u201d \n\n- just like anyone else.\n\nTruth is, you do not make love with your legs. I have never thought or had any weird fetish\u2019s concerning my wife. She is a person and I am very attracted to her and her body. I fell in love with her because of her personality. Her voice. Her face. The way she treats me. So yes I love her body because it is HER body, not because of the size or because of her achondroplasia.\n\nShe is my wife.

Although I believe that the real point is the social aspect, the one concerning relationships with other people outside the couple, not what happens in the intimacy of the bedroom.\n\nI am 6'3'' while my girlfriend, is a little more than 3'0'' even if she is 28 years old.I am well aware of the prejudices that a couple inevitably encounters when intends to start and continue a relationship in which they feel under the magnifying glass of the eyes of others.Even though we have a mutual friend, when we first met it was online because of lockdown but, despite this, since that first conversation on webcam we liked each other and we clicked.I liked so much her sunny disposition and her beautiful smile. There are people who, because of their character and their way of being, transmit energy to you. It had been a long time since I met a woman who made me feel this way. I soon realized that I was dealing with a very interesting person and that between us there was a strong affinity of character and mutual interest. Before being able to meet in person we had a lot of time to talk, to get to know each other, to gain confidence in each other. While this has facilitated our knowledge on the one hand, it has charged us with expectations on the other.Of course she told me about her condition of dwarfism, she explained to me what this entails in her everyday life. She told me that she is a woman as others, who has studied, has graduated and has a job that she likes. She drives a car that has been adapted to her physical condition and has been able to adapt in many circumstances, to lead a life as normal as possible.This further convinced me that I was dealing with a positive person even if, we are all humans, each of us has weaknesses that often reveal themselves when we know each other better. Only when we met in person these weaknesses of ours manifested themselves even if it was more the joy of being able to be together  than the fear of disappointment with respect to each other's expectations. Often even people very self-confident in other areas of life, in personal and intimate situations feel insecure because they fear the judgment of someone they like, or maybe they are afraid of not being accepted for what they really are. When we went on the subject, she made me many questions, she asked me what I felt for her. She was very interested in knowing if I liked her phisically and, looking into my eyes, she acted as if she wanted to make sure I was completely sincere. She was very honest with me. I got the impression that dating was quite uncomfortable for her, that interacting with others (and me too) in that context, probably took more energy than  usually does for other people. For my part, I had no doubt that I like her a lot even phisically but, at first, I felt uneasy about having a strong attraction for her. For some stupid reasons I felt guilty and maybe I was afraid of the judgment of people, friends and relatives. But, above all else, I was afraid of hurting her feelings, of not knowing how to behave both in a social context and in private.My girlfriend told me that, when we started dating, she did become more aware again of how people look at her as a little person, because, being with a tall  man, it made things socially very out of the ordinary. She told me she was used to this and she was worried that, me becoming much more aware of it, it might become a problem for me. In dealing with strangers looking at us with pity, or with my friends for what they might think of me. She did not want anyone to feel sorry for me.  Actually this did not happened or at least it did not affect our relationship. Now I am used to that and I do not mind more than a while if someone look at us in public. If it can be a problem, it is for those who have these thoughts, not for us that we are happy together.About the fact if it is okay for a woman with dwarfism having sex with a normally grown man, I think that between people who are adults and conscientious it does not change much compared to other couples more balanced in terms of mutual proportions in stature and size. Sex is above all something that has to do with the sphere of desire and attraction, it is also a way of communicating and getting to know each other. When two people feel a very strong attraction for each other, it is natural and spontaneous that they feel the need to explore the intimacy aspect of the relationship.They always find a way to satisfy their desire to be together and to make love. It is something that cannot be controlled because it is a natural need that becomes irresistible especially when there is a strong chemistry between the two. There are no prejudices that hold, everything else takes a back seat. Of course it was not all that simple at the beginning of our relationship, just because at first she was afraid I did not like her and she was ashamed to show me her naked body due to her condition of dwarfism. But she had no reason to worry about that. I have always thought of her as an attractive woman and nothing else, and I never stopped telling her and showing it to her.When she realized that it was true and that my feelings and attraction for her were real, things changed between us in this respect and we finally became lovers.If at first she had difficulty in embracing her sensuality, it was enough that she was herself to become the lover I have always dreamed of and for she, to feel happy and satisfied with our relationship.I know that each of us is different from the others and that each couple has their own particular story but, if I had to give some advice, I would say to remember some simple things that I have found extremely true. Being yourself is completely sexy. Having a smile is completely sexy. Having confidence in yourself is completely sexy. Nobody wants anybody that is scared to be themselves.So, just express yourself, do not be ashamed, do not be afraid and do not pay attention to what haters or envious people may think or say about you. It is you, it is your only life.If you find someone who is genuinely interested in you, and whom you trust and has shown you that you can trust him, why deny yourself that you can seek happiness.For my part, I think I am very lucky to have met her because she is a very special woman. Talking to her and being with her I get the impression, even from what she tells me, that because of her sensitivity as well as because of her condition she definitely see things that a lot of people miss or do not perceive in a certain way. Even her experience as a little person has definitely made her into who she is and she could never be more proud than who she is. She wants just to be respected. She wants to be accepted and wants to search happyness or just being herself, just like anybody else. Furthermore, it is physically impossible for a man to make love with a woman if he does not find her attractive. I cannot imagine her other than how she is. I love how she is also physically because it is part of her way of being. There is lust and tenderness when we make love. We do it frequently and we take all the time to do it well, with the necessary calm to enjoy every moment.We are very different in many ways but together we feel very good. She says that we complete each other and that, when we join our bodies during intercourse, we physically realize our need for mutual completion.", "What do you hate/love when talking to people? Hello, I am a Canadian 24 year old man who has recently realized their ignorance towards LP. I never felt negative feeling towards LP but have definitely been insensitive during my short time learning on this planet.

If he was driving in, then he would prolly bring the stool with him. But he is flying in, so you will need a stool, more than one if it is a big house\u2026kitchen, bathroom, garage, backyard, anywhere you think he will need to grab something up high.

It may be hard for you to maintain it while you are standing and talking since you may not be used to looking down at another adult.

So be sure he is comfortable sitting down, has a back support pillow available and a way so that his feet are not dangling over the edge of chairs but have support, just as your own feet need ground support when sitting on a chair.

Thank you so much!!! The baby is due in November, and you are right that she is a girl and she has an extra finger on each hand. Her heart is tilted and her limbs are measuring very small, but she seems to otherwise be healthy. The next step is an MRI in a few weeks to check on her lungs.

Monitor the heart closely, make sure if surgery is needed it is attended to ASAP.  Make sure to get the fingers wrapped with extra skin to prevent sensitivity.  Advocate for her to be treated normal growing up, do not be a helicopter parent but also do not make the child feel as if she is a burden.

This post will sound somewhat negative, but that is because it is important to me that people know what they are getting into. I love my life, but it is taken a lot of trial, error, blood, sweat, and tears to get here, and I did not have anyone to help me when things were rough so I have taken it upon myself to try and make sure that I do everything I can to equip people in my situation with the tools to understand their predicament that I lacked.\n\nI was born with a common atrium that required surgical repair as a baby, but the surgery went exceedingly well and medical technology has only gotten better in the \\~30 years since, and it should not limit my life expectancy at all. I know that heart issues are common, and that generally speaking they will not limit lifespan if given proper treatment from what I see, so I think my case is more the norm than the exception. I do not handle altitude very well and occasionally have palpitations, but that is really the only heart-related problem I generally notice.\n\nWhat really got me were my lower legs. Most of my surgeries have been on my knees (femural osteotomies and knee replacements are the most invasive I have faced), and I will likely have to have my hips worked on before I am 40 or 50 as well, although they are doing well for the time being. I have not seen anyone else with lower leg problems as bad as mine (lucky me, hah), but joint problems especially in the elbows and knees are pretty common.\n\nHonestly, the health concerns are not the most fun, but they are manageable with a good community of friends and family to support you. My biggest piece of advice is to find the kid a group of friends who also have physical disabilities \u2014 the biggest difficulty I have faced is feeling like I have no community I really belong to, or accepting friends or family that really \"get it\".

It is pretty notoriously unaccommodating for those with uncommon dwarfisms (even those with EVC I know who are pretty heavily involved with the association recount that it is not always the most accepting place), and my community came from a career in disability advocacy I started when I was \\~12. I practically tower over most persons with dwarfism at almost 5' tall, and little person-specific groups can be... judgmental about that, in my experience, as if I have not gone through the same shit they have. So if your family members' girl looks like she may grow up to be on the taller side of the EVC spectrum, preparing for that potentiality is not a horrible idea.\n\nI am sorry if this comes off as dour or bitter \u2014 I actually really, really love my live with dwarfism! There are just a lot of caveats I have learned over the years, and making sure parents and family members are properly prepared for the reality of living with/supporting a loved one with a dwarfism is something I am extremely passionate about. If you have any questions, or just want to put your loved one in contact with someone who is had a good bit of experience with the syndrome, feel free to shoot me a DM and I can get you my contact information so we can connect! Thank you both so much! We are all so excited for our new addition to the family and want to be as prepared as possible so we can help her have the best life. djm14, we would love any and all info surrounding how to be properly prepared in supporting her throughout her life! (I will send you a DM tomorrow morning so we/you and her parents can connect)\n\nI very much appreciate the warning on LPA. We are in the USA but in a very small town. I imagine it will be difficult to find her a community, but I have no doubt we will all pitch in to make sure she finds one. Any advice on how to do this and when we should begin our search? Any other resources or books to help us become strong advocates for her?\n\nAnd, again, thank you both so much for taking the time to comment. Everything you each have said has been so helpful and informative, and it sounds like you both have beautiful, meaningful lives despite the challenges of EVC. You all are incredible! Oh and to add: outside of LPA you just met more people with EVC than you probably ever will find in one place elsewhere. Do her parents have Facebook? There is a birth year group they may want to join, and I think there is an evc group (though I am not entirely positive on that, do not quote me). In my experience as the mom of a child without achon, these groups have been helpful and not unkind whatsoever, though obviously I only have experience with my child's birth year group.  There is also a bigger group with parents of all ages of kids.\nPlease pm me if you want the group info. They have been invaluable to me. Can you speak more about the LPA experience you had? My child does not have EVC, but does not have Achon, and I want to protect him the best I can. Your child has Achon, as long as they are not overly tall they are going to fit the LPA mold perfectly.\n\nBasically, if you have any other form of dwarfism, except maybe hypo, you are not seen as equal in LPA by a lot of people.  They are either mad/jealous you are taller or think you did not have the same experiences they did. I said he does not have Achon or EVC. He has a different form entirely. His form is rare, and he has extra genetic issues that could complicate his skeletal growth so there is no good way to predict how tall he will be. Endo guessed, a true guess, that maybe he will be 4'9. He is 36.5 inches now at 4.5yo. My apologies, my reading comprehension has went down the toilet since having our daughter and my return to \u201cwork\u201d. I feel that in my soul, no apology needed.", "why do dwarves have disproportional features i hope i dont sound like an ass here but when i thought of people with dwarfism i used to think of like hobbits from lotr, the difference being that they look sort of \"normal\" just really small. people with dwarfism on the other hand have some features that i cant really point out. what i am trying to say is why does a actor playing a hobbit in lotr who has been made to look small look sort of normal, compared to someone suffering from dwarfism most common forms of dwarfism have to deal specifically with shortening of the arms and legs. The torso and head still grow to average size.\n\nWhen they \"shrink\" average size actors to small size everything shrinks. head, torso, limbs... Exactly. I have Achondroplasia and it affects me just as described here. So if you are looking at say, Peter Dinklage from Game Of Thrones or Wee-Man from Jackass, they have same type as I do (as its the most common) and are not proportional like you described in LOTR. First of all, I can only speak for myself but I do not \"suffer\" from dwarfism. It is a genetic mutation that makes us physically different, not a disease like cancer..\n\nAnyways, the most common form of dwarfism called Achondroplasia is due to a mutation of a gene that affects the signals that are sent to certain bones that tell them to grow. So essentially the \"signals\" being sent to bones that have cartilage in them (legs, arms, face and spine) do not work correctly and they end being sent out at a slower rate and also not as long as someone without the mutation. That is why we always have shorter limbs and our faces all look similar in terms of shape. Our spine is also curved more at the base which can cause some spinal problems. Orthopedic problems are usually the main problems we have at least from a physical standpoint. Also our airways tend to be smaller. From an intellectual standpoint our intelligence levels are typically on average as our are lifespans. I am an engineer myself and my wife has her Ph.d and is a college professor. Dwarfism is a blanket term for many different genetic predispositions--not every dwarf has the same type of features or disproportionalities as the next one. In fact, they still have not been able to diagnose me with anything more specific than \"dwarfism\", meaning there is still many unrecorded forms of it to be discovered.\n\nSo, to answer your question, there is no consistent answer. Dwarfism effects the growth of the skeleton; that is why we are different in the first place. But those specific features will vary from individual to individual depending on what type of dwarfism they have. i dont know a lot about dwarfism s im sorry if what i said offended u, i just had a random ass thought and i decided to ask. this is the first time i have even acknowledged dwarfism as like a thing. pretty cool how you are a engineer though, and if u dont mind me asking, can u drive and if so do you have like particular needs to drive this actually explains a lot, i could never point out exactly what it was about actual people who have dwarfism compared to actors who have been shrunk down with editing. thank you, also sorry if anything i said came off as offensive i really mean no offense if i said what i said to the other two comments i would be beating a dead horse, i do however think this helps explain it really well and i find it to be really interesting. thank you for responding no problem.\n\nThe only thing i would try and change in your conversation is the use of normal.  People with dwarfism are short but still \"normal\".  Inside the community, people use \"average height\".\n\nit is a small distinction, but one I find important I personally have just pedal extensions that I can remove and put on any car or truck. I personally drive a large SUV so that I can pull an RV, etc. Some people with dwarfism may use hand controls if there legs are shorter though. Np. Some people are afraid to ask questions on the topic, but I enjoy giving insight from my experiences; at least someone beyond me is getting some use out of them, hah I would call it suffering lol. lol yup. Yup. And to add to that, you can even see a lot of variation within the same disorder. Those affected with SEDc, for example, can range anywhere from 3ft tall to ~5ft tall. Disproportionate short stature (DSS) is a form of dwarfism, one or more body parts are larger than the other. I know this is off topic but where did you get your extensions? I have used extensions from this company which I found are great at putting on and taking off if necessary. (i.e rentals)  \n(\n\nI have also bought in years past some from a company that long has served the LPA community but I will not purchase from them now due to racist comments coming to light from the owner.   \n\n\nEither way here is a whole list of adaptive products including some other pedal extension companies. Okay. Thank you!", "As a little person that needs to lose some weight, what are some things that have helped you lose weight? The extra weight is really starting to hurt my joints  Seeing a nutritionist helped me massively. Had a spinal operation which caused me to gain a fair amount of weight. Without much exercise I lost 13kg in around 6 months following a tailored meal plan - joint and back pain was reduced as a result which was an added bonus. Slowly learning Pilates stretches, yoga, and stretching every morning when I wake up and again throughout the day, once gently before I go to sleep. I do a lot of low impact exercises because high impact exercise is not good for LP joints. Which means exercising in ways that use only my body weight or a few light extra weights. Pushups, sit ups that work your upper stomach, and squats with small weights in my hands really helps. If I do this everyday, or at least stretch/stand up/move my ankles and wrists around/stretch my arms once an hour then i do not feel as sore. H.E.L.P.

Thank you so much", "Hypochondrosplasia question Hey all. So I have been going down a rabbit hole trying to figure out what could be going on with my son after he finally fell off the growth chart, at 1% by my (repeated) measuring. He was at 25% at age 1 I think. Physically he has a lot of hypo features, especially craniofacial, but his limbs are not really that disproportionate. His head is 99%. He has a very short neck that was very fatty when he was born. His arms are not really at all from what I can tell. He has lordosis as well as hypotonia/joint laxity. He has breathing issues as a baby and still has trouble with gagging on food and drinks. \n\nThe nurse practitioner at my pediatrician's office was pretty dismissive when I expressed my concern, but she also measured him an inch taller than he is (I have checked and double checked sitting and laying). He would be at 5% I would her measurement was correct. I followed up with the actual doctor and while I thought we were going to do genetics I got a call from Orthopedics and have an appointment tomorrow. Some folks in a fb group said an x-ray might not pick up hypo yet though. He is 23 months. \n\nI would just like anyone's opinion who knows maybe more than myself about hypo. Maybe some of you that are involved in the community have seen different presentations of it. I just cannot tell if I am barking up the wrong tree. I am kind of terrified about apnea since he is had issues in the past. Included a picture. \n\n(  Does not appear to have any common features of dwarfism to me...  I have noticed a lot of parents hoping for dwarfism not accepting maybe nothing is wrong with their child. I would be happy to hear he has no genetic or hormone issues. He is off the top of the chart for head and 85% weight and off the bottom for height. I think it is okay to be concerned. I have a daughter as well, and never had that gut feeling that something was off with her. I just want to catch anything as soon as possible. Hard not to be worried about the height/weight disparity. \n\nI do not disagree about his features btw. Like I said he is fairly proportionate. I just want to know what is going on. Something is pretty clearly up with his growth, to me at least. Not a doctor of course. Is there a geneticist locally that you can visit? It should be a very quick and easy blood test to find out? Every time I have called back up at our pediatrician's office they are busy or who I need to talk to is not there. I like the doctor but we may have to go elsewhere. I am *assuming* he also did a referral for genetics, but I have no idea yet. Figured I will see what the orthopedic specialist says. I have found that the parent totally has to be the quarterback/advocate or else nothing would ever get done. I would just call up the local pediatric geneticist person\u2019s clinic and explain the situation. They might be able to handle getting a referral for you if needed. They require one. Already did it since my insurance does not require a referral. However, there is apparently some free test that someone told me about. I guess they are doing genetic research or something since there are multiple genes associated with achondrosplasia and hypochondrosplasia. You just have to meet one criteria, and my guy checks a couple boxes (dysmorphic features/short stature, maybe disproportion if his noggin counts lol). The pediatrician can send it off and apparently it is free on all ends. Would still rather see an actual geneticist so they could tell me if they think anything else could be up if it is not hypo. My son has hypochondriplasia. Your son does not appear to have the features. He is almost 2 in this picture? He looks average stature to me. I believe my son had already fallen off the growth chart at 2 and was not in the 5% range. My son has hypochondroplasia. Your son looks average stature to me. He is almost two in this picture? If I remember correctly, my son was no longer on the growth chart at two years old. \n\nWe had some genetic testing that was done when a little over four years ago. At that time, they were only sequencing parts of the fgfr3 gene. Then we are able to detect one of the common mutations. There may be some mutations outside of this gene that there is no test for, so I am not sure how helpful genetic testing would be. \n\nDo you live near a clinic that specializes in skeletal dysplasia? Maybe it would put your mind at ease if you went to a specialist. For context, I was told when I was 24 weeks pregnant that my son likely had a skeletal dysplasia and his X-rays at birth confirmed some form of it. Well he off the chart now if he is at 1% right? I think under 3% is. His projected height if you do the \"double the height\" thing would be 5'2\" which is WAY OFF from his genetic potential. His sister as well as me and his dad are all above average. I am 5'6\" and dad is 6'. I was told his femurs were measuring behind in utero, but that it was \"probably\" okay. I am just really baffled by his height, then he has such a big head. \n\nI do not know how regarded the doctor we are going to is in the field but we live in major city. Ah sorry if my comment did not make sense. My son was maybe 1-2 SD below average, so he was not even on the chart (ie, not even 1%). Technically, 1% is still on the chart. At 2 years, he was wearing 9-12 month clothes. At 5, he is wearing 2T. \n\nJohn\u2019s Hopkins in Baltimore MD and DuPont in Wilmington DE have well regarded skeletal dysplasia clinics. We go to the one in Baltimore. Another option is to see an endocrinologist. I really do not see any features that resemble hypochondroplasia, but an endocrinologist might be able to help you if it is something hormone related. Our geneticist diagnosedy our daugther (hypochondroplasia) from an x Ray, and genetic test confirmed it. She was 3 for that x Ray but the x ray at 2 was suspicious and led to the genetic test. An xray is quicker and less expensive than a genetic profil. If something is different on the xray it should lead to a genetic profil. Thanks. We have a genetics appointment in roughly two weeks, and gratefully it is with a skeletal dysplasia specialist. I go back and forth about whether it is plausible or not, although since making this post I have discovered he seems to have the trident hand feature, which I thought was only achon, but apparently can occur in hypo as well. Do you mind me asking where your daughter fell on the average height growth chart at 2, if you recall? This guy seems to have crept back up to ~3rd percentile, which I know would be on the taller side if he were to have hypo. At two she was below the -5rd percentile, thus our doctor sent us to a specialist. First an endocrinologist, then a skeletal specialist. She has a long torso, which masked the short limb for a time but we knew she probably had something before her birth (her limbs were shorted than expected when i was pregnant).", "Describing someone with dwarfism in a book So guys, I am do not have dwarfism, but one of my book characters is. And the first scene he appears I describe him physically. I describe him first as a \"bulky little person\". And then continue with other things like his hair color and so on. So you think this is appropriate or you would describe him differently? You could use the word \"stout\" It seems fine to me, but it is not very specific.  Do you specifically have someone with Achondroplasia in mind?  It is the most common form of dwarfism, but we do not all look like that. I did have someone with Achondroplasia in mind. For the story he would be a middle age man, who had worked out a lot as a younger man, but he has let himself go a bit. Like he is still strong, but with some belly. What do you think? \ud83e\udd14 Cant you just say he has dwarfism?", "Applying for College Hi, I am currently a junior in high school and I have achondroplasia. I am interested in going to college for engineering and I was just wondering if anyone has any tips for a person with Dwarfism applying for college. Also, I was curious: does having Dwarfism make it more difficult or easier to get into a university? Its a good question.  Also, are there any specific scholarships that any achons have found helpful? They also have college applications on lpaonline.org. Dwarfism should not matter of whether you will get into a good school or not. It depends on your school ethics and completing coursework.\nI am sure Universities have regular scholarships where you can write a heartfelt letter of your condition and the hard work and passion you have of seeking success.  I am a college freshman who is in college for engineering. Here is my experience. Having dwarfism if anything helps your chances of getting into a university. A lot of universities seek to have a diverse student so being a dwarf you are already diverse in their eyes. In my experience being a dwarf has not made getting into university any harder. The diversity card will only get you so far, obviously they care more about academics and extracurricular activities. I know this is a late reply but feel free to pm me any questions you may have.  This is an old post, but thought I would reply. I have achondroplasia and went back to school as an adult and earned my electrical engineering degree. I am now gainfully employed in my area of interest. The one thing that I believe really helped me was being accepted into the entrypoint! program. I ended up having a paid summer internship with NASA and it was an amazing experience and helped my resume. They work with other companies such as IBM. Someone else from LPA recommended it to me who was a retired engineer from Texas Instruments.\n\n\n\nAlso depending on your financial situation, check with the department of vocational rehabilitative services in your state. Because I was determined to go back to college for engineering, they paid for a lot of my tuition and books as well for a laptop suitable for engineering at the time. \n\nGood luck with college. Engineering school is a lot of work, its hard as hell, but having the degree will help you go anywhere despite having dwarfism.\n\n", "Dating as a Little Person (an article) ", ".

Do not let how you may be feeling now cause you to believe that life will always be this way. Can you tell us why? \n\nI have felt like this at times, I think a lot of people do.

Quick question: First, thank you for your patience, I am sure you get annoying people asking you all asinine shit constantly. Unfortunately, I am here to be another one of those schmucks. \n\nSecond, is there a pejorative for people without dwarfism? \n\nI am a writer who has been commissioned a piece with a little person character who is a criminal (she is Irish and a con woman. Her character name is Lepra Con. I still do not know how I feel about this name) and who is finally caught by the detective that been on her ass for years. They then have hot criminal sex. But I thing is, I want it to be from her perspective so I can try and give some humanity to the otherwise lack of representation for little people, even if it is in this small, weird way. I also want to use the pejorative so that he (the detective) seems like the \u201cother\u201d in this small story. \n\nAnyway I hope you all have a happy 2021, goodness knows we all deserve it. I think there definitely can be resentment towards average height people, but that depends on an individual's temperament and how they were raised. If you want to write that sort of resentment, I would show the main character going thru simple difficulties of having dwarfism whilst going about her normal day of being a criminal, or just a person.\n\nTo contrast for the other character, it would be much easier to write. Just have them be normal and wholly ignorant about dwarfism, (as most average ppl are) not in a specifically rude or demeaning manner, but just a pure lack of perspective or understanding.\n\nI know I am being pretty vague, so if you want to talk more specifics feel free to PM me--there are not any questions you would or could ask that would offend me, do not worry. I use the term 'Normate' as a kind of... cynical/lighthearted pejorative. It is something I heard in the UK disability activist scene a couple of years ago to describe... normal people. It made me laugh my ass off. I have used it ever since and it makes some of my 'Normate' friends squirm a little - nothing like an objectifying label to make you feel like you do not belong somewhere. \n\nGenerally, however, there is no pejorative term for average height people. There is not a strong enough 'dwarf' culture anywhere in the world to cultivate this kind of language. Outside of the US there is no 'dwarf culture' at all.\n\nHaving dwarfism is generally a lonely experience. You learn what it means to be different alone and you learn to cope alone. \n\nDo not patronize your character. She is been through more than you. Is stronger than you.

Nah, other groups have huge amounts of people and we have like 300.  No one gives a shit about us. Not sure why this is downvoted. I think your anger is valid. \n\nBut I am also not sure why you think there are not groups for LPs. Do you mean political groups or social circles? Yes, I mean political and social.  If anyone wants to say there is no discrimination, they are delusional.  And it is up to us to mentally handle this huge burden, or else we are labeled as 'unstable,' fuck that.  The silent and very vocal discrimination that we experience on a daily basis would make any person crumble.  But you know, just follow society's rules and everything will be cool. Society does not give a fuck about us and has no motivation to see us as humans. Look, disagree with me all you want, but know we are passively judged all-of-the-time, as in people without achondroplasia think of us less than human (instincts wise and subconsciously). You can disagree with that all you want and live in a fairy tale land, because you might have got lucky (like me) and got a job that is good for you. What about all the others that do not get lucky?  We need a Malcolm X type of figure to really, clearly define our feelings of how we fit into society.   This is not sunshine and rainbows and positive thinking/awareness is going to be highly restricted to areas, we need an entire movement. Society does not really have to change anything except its attitude when it comes to racial or sexual discrimination. It does however have to change its attitude and behaviors when it comes to the disabled, it is why I downvoted that stupid intersectionality thread, like it is not f-ing hard enough being a dwarf now you want to subgroup us as well? To hell with those morons, but also to hell with anyone with dwarfism who is also a bigot towards other dwarfs, they should know better.\n\nI am reminded of the handmaids tale from this week when June Osborne said, \u201cwhy cannot we be as furious as we feel, do not we have that right?\u201d I agree with you. We have to put up with a tremendous amount of bigotry. Both overt and subtle. We also have to navigate physical spaces that disable us. Our struggles are both social prejudice and medical/physical logistical ones. \n\nGrowing up I was able to talk about the physical challenges but was discouraged from voicing the social ones, which for me were far more hurtful and damaging. When pop culture would ridicule us, my complaints were rebuffed with \"do not be so sensitive\". I was made to just .. kind of accept it as normal and fair enough and not seriois - Even when these same jokes would be thrown at me from strangers in the street by people who thought that they knew me and could dismiss my humanity based on my height. Even as they eroded my self confidence and made me want to not leave my house. \n\nYou are also right that the rarity but visibility of our condition means that we have very little social power. Our voice, our demands to not be ridiculed because of our disability are given no weight. There is no political fallout for making fun of us on national TV. \n\nRules for social justice seem to be ringfenced for minority groups with bigger platforms. They do not seem to be universally applied based on consistency of principle. It is hard not to hate the woke folk for their cognitive dissonance around racial slurs and disability slurs. \n\nThat being said, I do think the media is slowly getting better at not... Well, teaching the community to laugh at us so much. I have noticed i get less harrasment in the street than I did 5 years ago. I notice fewer people looking shocked to see me or taking my photo. It still happens but ... Small mercies. \n\nAnyone who claims this shit does not happen or does not impact our lives is usually just employing a coping strategy that works for them. It is delusional but not speaking or acknowledging this shit seems to make them less miserable. \n\nThat being said, railing about it and getting mad does not really do anything either. The only thing that works for me is graceful, articulate but forceful letter writing. It takes soooo much energy and soooo much restraint. I do it, but yeah I am fucking angry. You should be, letter writing are not shit today unless you have a massive following.  No person in my family could ever give me advice, none of my friends could neither.  This is real shit for a select few of us.  I have to feel so lucky and I have to appreciate so much that I am a computer programmer, in an office job.  However, I worked retail for years and know the real discrimination going on there.  I cannot blame the company though, they should not have to change their entire operation to accommodate us.  However, that cuts us out of a  good segment of the workforce and is always there in the back of my mind saying 'if you lost this job how would you survive?' I think you are catastrophising and genuinely have a depression issue. Sure employment is somewhat limited for us, but not insurmountable. Most developed countries do have welfare payments in the event the employment is genuinely impossible. \n\nAll your opinions are valid, but you take them to catastrophic levels. Yes, the isolation, harassment and abuse is very bad, but advocating suicide and abortion is... again, pretty damn extreme. Many people with dwarfism are able to live happy lives even with these difficulties. \n\nYou are also very unlikable which makes you less convincing. You sound like an angry old man with some valid complaints but they are lost in your ... ranting.  There are some jobs we are not able to do. Construction work is one of them but there are bloody heaps we can do,  so Im going to focus on those. \n\nYes there is real deacrimination. My sisters and I have won law suites over some instances of it. There have definately been instances in the past I wish I would taken to the law, when I was younger and had no guidance.

There are heaps of LPs doing more productive shit than advocating suicide and abortion and freaking out on fucking Reddit. \n\nI think you are having a mental breakdown tbh. You owe it to your son to demonstrate how to make the most of life. You do not sound like you are doing that. You sound like some dick that goes to shoot up a school because he is been bullied.

However, she has been growing while her cousin seemingly has not.

She recently visited her pediatrician with him for a general check-up and the doctor mentioned they have been tracking his growth for the past few years and think he might be a little person.  I think the pediatrician has been treading lightly around her because my sister can be a little tough to deal with sometimes.   I am not surprised this came up but she is really not coping and her husband storms out like he is having a tantrum.  It upsets me because I think the kid is amazing!  He is so unbelievably strong despite his small stature and so personable with his infectious smile.  He is definitely a little prankster and loves people!

I am concerned that she will be adopted because of her cuteness by a family that does not understand the kitten\u2019s needs (I am fostering for a local county shelter). It occurred to me that this kitten could be a perfect fit for a family who has a child with a similar condition. It can benefit the child to see that these conditions are naturally occurring in other species and the kitten would be in an environment of people sensitive to her needs.  I want to have advise from the community as of to whether this is a good idea and I should advocate for the shelter doing this, and how to go about it.  The last thing I want is to offend a a member of the community, in the reason I am seeking your input.  Thank you. If you are in the us, I recommend reaching out to your local LPA chapter. A lot of young children benefit from seeing others like themselves, even in animals. You should not offend anyone with at least making an offer. If you need help let me know! Thank you for your prompt reply.  I am in the US.  I will give this forum until Monday to gather more opinions.  If I cannot find my local LPA I will take you on your offer (we are close to one of the main metropolitan areas in the US, so I imagine I will have no trouble finding it).  Thanks again! First off....post a picture of this cute kitten !! This is a great idea! I remember discovering a German Shepard with dwarfism at a shelter and trying so hard to get it but it was already gone:( I totally felt some affinity to it because of our shared dwarfism. \n\nTotally hit up the LPA or even look at local Facebook groups for dwarfism, there will be heaps of families with kids on those. \n\nI agree, loving a cat with a condition like theirs will help them view their own difference in a more generous light. \n\nThis kitten will be snapped up quick.\n\nAlso, I would love to see a photo! Will do. Figuring out how. The only way I was able to do this was by making a link  Wow this is the sweetest idea! I hope you foster kitten finds a perfect forever home with a child who can feel truly connected to it! \u2764\ufe0f I love this kittennnnnn. I wish I could take her, my kiddo would adore her. I think it is a fabulous idea to find a family to adopt her in the dwarfism community.  Which region of the US are you in? Mid-Atlantic.  The kitten has not been officially diagnosed (the standard of care is to wait until she is three-months old and have x-rays taken), but the vet seemed fairly certain.  She weighs 798 grams this morning, siblings are 1100, 1245, and 1450 grams.  They are about 9 to 10 weeks old.  I do not have any power of decision (kitty is county property) and I am not allowed to advertise it until it is officially up for adoption, but I felt strongly that I could not advocate for my idea without input from LP families. I am not a cat person but would totally want this cat! I am a cat advocate. You should reach out for advice from Orphan Kitten Club. They do grants and things for rescues, but will also adopt out special needs kittens. Contact them over their email ASAP, perhaps they will give you some advice or even take the kitten off your hands.\n\n( Thank you for your input.  The kitten belongs to the county (I foster for their shelter). They have a relationship with all the local rescue centers but I will pass your suggestion along.

Hi! I am 21 and have a very mild form of dwarfism that puts me at around 4\u20199-4\u201910 ish, and something I have always seriously struggled with is bra shopping. I measure about 24 inches under the bust, which puts my bra size at 24DD. As I am sure other ladies on this sub know, that is about 8 inches below commercial band sizes start. I have been exclusively wearing children\u2019s sports bras for years and years now. I want to switch to bralettes, but I have had nothing but issues finding one that fits and has actual coverage. The ones I find that actually fit around the underbust comfortably are clearly made for women with much smaller chests than me,  and I flop out of the cups all the time. Lol. Not comfy. Ones I find that *can* cover my boobs are massive around the underbust, which slips around and provides no coverage at all and is exactly the reason I quit real bras in the first place. Have any ladies here had luck with bralettes they really like? I am thinking of trying yellow berry, which is a bra company for tweens but has a \u201cmore endowed girls\u201d section. I would also love to hear if any of you went the custom route for bras with a company you really liked. Thanks so much! \n\nTL;DR: need bralette recommendations for mild dwarfism with a not insignificant amount of boob LOL I also have a hard size to find. (30E) I have had success in just searching the size I need online and ordering from there. I am also fortunate enough to have a fabulous local lingerie shop that the owner will custom order the correct sizes for me, so definitely check for a local (reputable) shop near you.  I did do a quick search and found this website with your size:\n\nBra link \n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n*edit* removed link. The company was from Australia and the size roughly translated to a 48 (in) instead of 24. Sorry about that! You can find bras that fit in Australia?

First off, apologies for the stigmatizing sound of the title. \n\nMy (F, 34, 5'9) partner (M, 35, 4'3) and I have discussed having kids, and are well aware that there is a 50/50 chance of passing achondroplasia on to our offspring. I personally would welcome either potential, and given that I have not had to live with achondroplasia, pretty much defer to him on whether he feels he would want to pass the gene. He says he would prefer to go the natural route, so that is the plan (when it is time).\n\nThat said, he is been fairly lucky in that his health is pretty good and has not needed surgeries (yet, at least. Though likely will at some point). Neither he nor his mother (the only other LP in the family), are really part of the LP community/LPA. His opinion is the most important to me and our decision, but maybe not representative of the LP community as a whole. So I thought I would reach out to try to understand the issue more in depth, with more perspectives.\n\nI have done research to understand some common ailments, medical and social issues. So I know enough to know how little I could ever possibly know (and how little the medical community knows), and that the risk for serious health issues is for the most part, a game of chance. Thank god we have good health insurance.\n\nSo I guess I am just wondering how other people feel about passing dwarfism on to their children. Do you feel strongly either way? Have you had to make a decision in that regard? What were some of your deciding factors, things you took into consideration, and/or how did you come to whatever conclusion you came to? Any thoughts to share in retrospect?\n\nAnd finally, any advice (or resources?) for someone of average height who may end up giving birth to and raising someone with achondroplasia?\n\nThanks in advance, and I welcome feedback/opportunities for growth if any of this comes off as insensitive, ignorant, or misguided. Im still pretty new to dwarfism being a part of my life and do not have much support around it because he and his mom are the only LPs I have ever known. Im not sure about advice because Ive never raised any kids. One resource that cones to mind is   - That Is the website for (\n\nMy perspective used to be that I was apprehensive about passing it on, and that I didnt want to \u201cdo that\u201d to my kid. However, that is looking at having dwarfism as being \u201cless than\u201d someone of average height.\n\nJust because you dont have dwarfism, does not discount your opinion on it. You are just as responsible in having a child and your opinion matters just as much. If he fails to see that, its going to drive you two apart in my opinion since its going to come down to having kids at all or not. \n\nI think he should maybe work out some of the mentality that is making him feel the way it is, probably with a professional if does not find a way to see past passing the dwarfism gene as a negative.\n\nThis is all just my own opinion. I would amputate the gene if ever technologically made possible. I would never want to pass this on to anyone else, and personally I think that parents with genetic disabilities who actually want their kid to end up with it are delusional, awful people. Thanks for the insight! I agree that not wanting to \"do that\" makes it seem like LPs are somehow \"less than\". Reminds me of eugenics, and I am not cool with that, which is why I basically left the decision up to him. He says my opinion matters as much or more (since I would be the one with a potentially complicated and risky birth), which I appreciate. But still feel like I would rather he be the one to decide that since he has had the experience that we are deciding whether or not to subject a new human to. And ultimately, he said he would prefer the natural route, so that is the plan.\n\nI think it would be a unique life experience to raise an LP (I am sorry, but dwarf babies are extra adorable. But maybe I am biased because I am in love with one lol), but also would not want to force that just for the sake of a novel experience. That would not be fair to the new human. But I also welcome unique experiences in all areas of life, so this would be no different imo. Thank you for sharing your opinion, and I am so sorry that your experience has been so negative. \n\nWhile we arent at the point technologically to remove genes like that, embryos can certainly be selected for ideal traits (e.g. not having a particular gene). \n\nUnfortunately, that would require some medical procedures that I would not be willing to undergo, so our options would really be natural (risk of gene passing), a sperm donor (he would not get to have bio kids), or adoption (neither of us would get to have bio kids). I have achondraplasia, and personally I do not want to risk passing the gene on. While people with dwarfism are obviously just as 'valuable' as average height people, I would not want anyone else to have to deal with it.\n\nIn my last relationship, we were discussing hypothetical kids and I was only for adoption.\n\nThat being said, I do not think there is any 'right' or 'wrong' answer. Discuss it with your partner and feel it out so to speak. I wish you and your family all the best whatever you two decide. Personally, i (M,21) wouldnt want to pass it on. My reasoning is 2 main things: first is the physical restraints - i have had to have many surgeries &amp; may need many more just to live with less pain &amp; that isnt even guaranteed. This isnt 100% as people with my condition (acromesomelic dysplasia) i am learning have lived a surgery free life without pain too. Maybe its just my luck but i would not want my child to go through the physical pains im having to live through.\n\n2nd one is the mental health side. Were discriminated against &amp; laughed at wherever we go &amp; again it can be hard to deal with sometimes especially when physical touchiness gets involved.\n\nSorry if it seems pessimistic - just my opinion..\n\nOne benefit i have experienced - i believe i wouldnt have the personality/morals i have right now without my condition so im grateful for that aspect.. I honestly struggle with this myself.  Not anywhere near a point in my life to make a choice like that.  But from my point of view right now I think I would.  Because having bad parents I have found messes you up way more.   And so I am sure you will be good parents.   So do what you feel is right. My disorder is recessive and the chances of meeting someone in the wild and passing it on are extremely low. \n\nWith that being said, if I found out my partner had the gene, there is no chance in hell I would risk passing the disorder along and I cannot for the life of me comprehend why people willingly pass on disorders that make life exponentially harder for their offspring. \n\nI would like to say you could hold out for a few years and see how promising ( might be, but as stated in the article:\n\n&gt; Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene. Short stature from the failure of cartilage to turn into bone is the most recognizable symptom, **but people with achondroplasia can also face serious health issues such as sleep apnea or spinal stenosis, in which the narrowing of the spine puts pressure on spinal nerves. Some patients may need surgery to reduce pressure on those nerves or to straighten bowed legs.** I am (Female 36 Average) and my BF of 14 years (Male 36 LP) is concerned about passing on his gene. I think he is uniquely qualified to make that decision. I honestly do not have a preference and I understand the chances. I wish everyone who is trying for kids, the best. love your screen name. Just had to say that and reading these is hard. I am in an LTR with an LP and he is self hating and It breaks my heart not wanting kids because you feel less then etc and reading other LPs have the same feelings made me cry bad parents ruin lives. your all Beautiful all kids are and So many of you deserve so much better then you had. So thanks so much for the Laugh. Again great name. I love it I would not want to pass it on solely for mental health. It is really taxing having to live in a world that is clearly not built for you and to have people stare and point at you all day just makes it worse. There are ton of other reasons why I would not but why list them when only one reason is needed? This does not really answer your question but may contribute to your family planning. If you are average height with a partner who has achondroplasia, the chances of passing the gene to your child is not 50%, but instead 25%. Source? Everything I read (and principles of mendelian genetics) indicates that avg height + achondroplasia = 50/50; achondroplasia + achondroplasia = 50 achondroplasia, 25 avg height, 25 non-viable. Not saying you are wrong tho, maybe I have it wrong? No, sorry you are correct. Is not being delighted by whatever you get a good thing? Its not like they genetically selected for condition. Agreed. Good point. My parents are amazing and my mental health is great, despite the enormous baggage that comes with dwarfism.\n\nMy AH friends with the neglected parenting are way more fucked up than I am. despite having, in my opinion, a really easy time of life. Man, I am really impressed with your communication skills. You really ask and say a lot of insightful things. \n\nOn the LP facebook forums you will get a LOT more positivity around having dwarfism and having kids with the condition. They all post pictures of their kids and talk about their partners in really healthy, normal ways. \n\nI am actually going to go out on a limb and say that Reddit by it is nature has a lot more single people on it. Being perpetually single with dwarfism is really hard because its an significant extension of the rejection and loneliness we experience when someone decides to ridicule us in public. Only the romantic rejection comes from our friends and peers which seems to almost validate the more overt rejection from strangers. \n\nI would be a lot 'cooler' with passing my condition on (I do not have any medical issues) if I was in a normal, healthy relationship like my friends. Even with the constant aggression and abuse from strangers. Through a doctor selecting sperm and egg cells and genetically testing them, you could have a that does not carry achondroplasia genetics. Is that what you were referring to as a 'medical procedure' you 'would not be willing to undergo'? Is not it 50/50 that the kid is either a carrier or not, as far as I know, if one of the couple is a carrier and the other is not, there is no chance the kids will Express it, only ne carriers", "Anyone going to the LPA convention in Denver that begins at the end of the week?

I would not ask him dwarf questions on the first date.  He would probably rather you talk about you or ask him things like his hobbies or what not.  So he feel you really got to know him.  Not his dwarfism.  If that makes sense. Focus on who they are rather than what they are. Get to know the real them. Avoid jokes, stereotypes, and remember to just focus on their face. Avoid getting on your knees to look them in the eye. Do not be afraid to ask questions if it is appropriate (is it comfortable if I hold your hand, etc). Avoid generalizations and try not to make assumptions. Thank you all!! What the fuck? Things are pretty bad when your only bit of advice is \"only make fun of them if they are ok with it\". Jesus.

Went thru a spinal fusion four years ago, I can relate with some of what you are saying--although it sounds like you are having a rougher recovery than I did.\n\nIf it is still an option you are willing to look into, I would go on the oxy. I will admit that the physical recoil of eventually coming off of them was hard, but if you are in this much agony it might be the better option. The withdrawls will probably be more manageable than your current situation, though that is not to say it will be easy by any means. \nEDIT: I misread the part about you deciding to take them, but my point remains; if it is feeling this awful with them, do not be too hasty in going off of them this soon.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you need somebody to talk this thru with who is been in a similar situation. I am so sorry you are going through such a rough time. I had a spinal fusion from my lower neck to my lower back when I was just a kid and I definitely remember that it was super tough. I was on morphine in the hospital and then at home Tylenol with Codiene. I did not have any issues with stopping taking it when I no longer needed it. I bet you will be okay when you no longer need it too. As for dealing with this difficult time, maybe there is some situational depression going on? I have dealt with general depression off and on throughout most of my life and boy can it make anything worse. Crying at everything is a very common symptom which is what made me wonder if maybe this could be something you are going through at this time as well. Talking with someone about everything you are dealing with and possibly getting some tips and tricks on how to manage it might be helpful.

I just want to know if I can identify as a dwarf even though there is nothing technically wrong with me &gt;nothing technically wrong with me\n\noof. you are going to need to take yourself and that bad take far away from this sub. People with dwarfism have something wrong with them?? Well yes their height is due to a genetic or medical condition such as growth hormone deficiency That does not mean that have something wrong with them. As in a medical condition Well yes it does \ud83d\ude02 so you are saying they do not have anything medically wrong with them? I am 4'9, mid-20s, never formally diagnosed with any form of dwarfism (I likely have GHD or PSS). Doctors have wanted to look into it, but I never wanted to go through with it because I do not care. I call myself a little person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not sure why people are getting on you about your semantics. Technically, any disability or abnormality means there is something \"wrong\" with you. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nLittle people as a demographic have dealt with enough shit, it is condescending to think that dwarfs are so fragile that they cannot handle informal, unintentionally hurtful  language from another small human. What I find funny is why would you want to categorize yourself? Your just short, and what should you identify yourself as? Your first and last name. That is why we all have them is to identify each other. Sorry but no.  There is nothing \"wrong\" with having dwarfism.  Many little people have zero medical issues, there is nothing \"wrong\" with them. Yes but you are not meant to be born like that so therefore they have something wrong with them , if someone is disabled they have something wrong with them if someone has cancer they have something wrong with them", "How offensive is the word \"midget\"? AP here.  I grew up in a place that was extremely unfriendly to anyone that was \"unusual\" with regards to the average in basically any way, be it height, race, religion, etc. ...  It actually took me until I was in my 20s to even learn that the word \"midget\" had negative connotations.\n\nSo, here is my question.  How offensive is the word midget to you?  When you see/hear it used toward others, versus yourself, versus fictional characters?  If a company used the word in an interview or on some official channel, would it sway your opinion of the company and its products? I find it offensive, but I am also aware that not everyone realizes it when they refer to me using that term so I try to be understanding when correcting them. \n\nI try not to decide what other people find offensive. That is up to them. However, a company/official channel should know better. If they used it, I would not be inclined to have much time for them. Certainly, no one can speak for everyone, but do you think there is a general mentality of \"I am aware that not everyone realizes it  so I try to be understanding\"? With most people, yes. However, you will always get someone who is offensive for the sake of being funny, or because they genuinely have no clue of what the correct terminology is. You can usually tell the difference. What is the origin of the word? I consider it outdated and would never use it but I do wonder what the history behind it is that makes it worse than dwarf or little person. When did little person start being commonly used? I find it very offensive. When people say it to my face it feels like my heart just stops and I am frozen because it hurts so much. I feel like people say it these days to be funny but it is honestly not. It is hurtful and disrespectful. ", "I am an avg height woman dating a man with dwarfism. Do's and do not's?\n\nI have zero experience with men of his stature. He also has mobility issues. And also, I am very attracted to him. We have done days of chatting online, and one very lovely and wonderful in-person date.\n\nI am really, really worried I might do or say something dumb. He is not a judgemental guy, I just want to be smarter before he has to tell me what I did/said wrong.\n\nHe is an individual, sure. He is going to have his own ideas and preferences.\n\nBut, just in general. Can I have YOUR do's and don'ts, please? Pet peeves? Things he might appreciate me knowing ahead of time? I would avoid the word 'midget', even if you are saying it as a joke. It is probably too triggering. \n\nWait a while before you ask if your kids would have dwarfism - it is too loaded a question. \n\nWhen you are in public together and get negative responses / abuse from strangers, it is probably better to talk about in a not too heavy way. This one is tricky though, some people like to pretend it never happened. My preference is to talk about it in a way that makes it obvious that the problem is not yours or his. \n\nIf someone comes up to you guys and starts dumb / offensive questions, I would let him take the lead. Just be there to back him up, but do not speak for him.   \n\nNote sure about masculinity issues. Should you offer to carry things / reach for things? No idea. As a chick, I have no problem having other people offer to do these things for me. Thank you. I would heard that getting too angry or upset on his behalf might come off as being performative or insincere. So I would mostly let him handle it, backing him up. Thanks for that confirmation.\n\nWe both already come into this with the kids we are going to have. I believe. I can totally see how that would be a thing.\n\nHe does the public gigs that it sounds like a lot of you find demeaning and damaging to your community. I want to support him doing what he likes to do, I am not sure that this is what he likes, though. What should I (or indeed, even CAN I) understand about this?\n\nI have not asked how he refers to himself (little person/dwarf/person with dwarfism/etc). I feel like I have heard him use dwarf and the m-slur, casually. Should I assume it is dwarf? Or should I ask? Is that an uncomfortable question? \n\nTo make the conjugation from \"little person\" to \"little man,\" to describe him as a person, feels... demeaning? I do not know. I have 2 sons, and it sounds like what I would call my 6yo. It feels bad. Is this a common sentiment?\n\nThank you so much for reading \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude0a This is just my opinion as a guy with dwarfism, but I have always hated the term \"little person\" or \"little people\" about as much as the term \"midget\". I use the term dwarf to describe myself, and will use the word midget if I am trying to make a point--but little person/people had always sounded ridiculous to me. As a general rule, if you would not do it to a person without dwarfism, do not do it to them. If you are not sure, ask them. I would much rather a person admitted to ignorance than assumed the wrong thing. Little man is not a good idea. Little Person is pretty safe territory as it is never used in a derogatory way, even if it does sound a bit silly. Lol, I have never been yelled at with \"you fiucking little person' by a douche in a car.\n\nHis career choice... i would avoid talking about it unless he brings it up. He will be used to defending it but he will know it is a big issue for the rest of us. I imagine performers might see their career choices as limited too, so it might be a sensitive issue to just suggest he find something else to do. Try to avoid having any children. That is the only thing I will say. If you do it will lead to a child who will be bullied throughout school, and an incel throughout later life. Otherwise this is not a question for us. You will know what to do as you get to know your partner more. This is the worst answer May I ask, how did things turn out, OP?  Any updates you would not mind sharing? Everything is going rather well. We have been seeing each other for 2 and a half months, and we see each other as often as we can though we live like 15 miles apart. I have young kids, and public transport is dumb for someone on a scooter, so it isnt always easy, but most of the time we can see each other at least once a week.\n\nI am still very smitten. It was a love connection, haha...\n\nI have met his kids, he is met mine, they have all met each other. My kids are 6 and 7 so it was a minute before i could get them (esp my 6yo) to stop making observations out loud about his body (\"your arm looks like a croissant!\"), and I certainly wanted it under control before my kids met his kids (who are both achon also). But everything went great!\n\nMy kids' dad has met him, and they seem to like each other okay. He just freely offered for us to use his camper van when we said we were going camping, so I thought that was a very thoughtful gesture. \n\nSo basically, a lot has happened. \n\nI think the cold weather is hurting his body more than when we first met. I am both worried about and interested in seeing how that affects our relationship. He does deal with chronic pain, and when he hurts, it makes him sad about what he does or does not \"bring to the table.\"\n\nI love him very much, and I just want to be good for him.  He feels good for me. 15 miles is 24.14 km That is awesome!  Thanks for the updates.  I was curious while reading your earlier post from a few months before.  \n\n\nIf I was a gambling man, then I would say that he will mostly have much less chronic pain in the morning, than he might later in the day.  Perhaps doing adventurous things together in the morning is the way to go!  Then taking breaks to sit and rest for a while throughout the day at least helps me with hip and knee pain.  \n\n\nHow did did both of you first meet? Thanks for the tip. I am noticing that things are better in the morning. I am just not often with him in the mornings. I wish I was, but we have time.\n\nFunny enough, we met on Tinder. He and I are both ethically non-monogamous and were not really looking for anything very serious. His profile info was cute, his pictures were great, his \"anthem\" was unique, he \"superliked\" me, and the rest is history. \n\nHe really threw himself into it. I did not get the slightest feeling that he was afraid of rejection from the very beginning. His profile even said something like, \"let us talk. You can change your mind later.\" Very non-committal, which was exactly what I was looking for. \n\nAnd I was worried. Everyone I would ever dated was taller than me except for one guy who was one inch shorter. I tried very hard to scrutinize my own motives. Was it novelty? I have always been a collector of experiences and wondered if I was using him in order to sample something different. But it really wasnt. The way we chatted was easy and fun. He is creative, and funny, and wholesome, and just often enough, he is SO unwholesome, lol.\n\nI am excited to see how we do.", "I am a dwarf, look at me (essay, mild swearing, mild talk of sexuality) (I got angry a few days ago and wrote the following)\n\n I think I am becoming an angry dwarf, the exact kind of noisy cripple that always mortified me as a kid. The kind of person who would wear vibrant t-shirts proclaiming their pride at being short, or in a wheelchair. The kind of person who I used to try not to stand next to, for fear that people would think I was like them, as though I was tarred with the same negative \"cripple\" brush. My logic at that point in my life was that if someone did not notice me, they would not notice I was a dwarf. For the first thirty years of my life, I lived with that goal in mind while I dealt with the people around me.\n\nThere are two kinds of people who I deal with commonly and dislike equally: The people who want to fetishize me, and the people who want to make me a charity. The first ones I run into online, particularly when I venture into dating sites. They are the ones who message me and try to get me to play into some thinly-veiled pedophilia fetish, as though me being 4'2\" means I would totally be into that. They are the ones who inevitably start calling me \"little one\" and themselves \"daddy,\" and put in too many references to my height at the beginning to be even remotely comfortable for me.\n\nIt is probably no great surprise that my forays into internet dating have been brief and somewhat disgusting, though there have been some good results too. And while the call-me-daddy brigade are disgusting, they are at least obvious about it. There is not any subtlety even when they try to make it subtle, so it is easy to ignore them and move on with my life, adding another mark to the creep column.\n\nThe danger is in the second group. They are the ones who will smile at me, act civil, even act friendly, while in their minds they are offering silent prayers that I do not touch them, that I do not come near them, that I do not insist on needing anything special whatsoever. Like friends who will pet your dog awkwardly while cringing at the idea of touching something that slobbers, they are going through the motions. That puts me in the unenviable position of the dog, which is pretty much how they view me: Something strange, a little bit scary, probably prone to doing strange things physically and probably not very bright.\n\nA few days ago, a woman I know told me that it was a really great thing that I was working with kids. I said thank you, figuring with a brief flutter of ego that it was a compliment to my skills or intelligence. Then she went on, continuing by saying that it was great that I was working with kids because I could not have any of my own. There followed an awkward conversation after I inquired why she thought that and she stumbled through a vague justification of \"cripples should not have children.\"\n\nThis is not the first time this assumption has been made. For most people, the disabled are not thought about in terms of sex. For some, there is the vague notion that disabled people -- all of us -- just do not have sex, and instead occupy some odd, nun-like state. It is just one of the many bizarre notions people have, albeit one that is not brought up to my face nearly as often. Other assumptions are that I am going to die young, or that I am not that bright, or that I need strangers following me around to help me constantly, as though that is nice rather than just kind of creepy.\n\nThe perverts disgust me, but the dishonest people infuriate me.\n\nThroughout my childhood, my dwarfism was an embarrassment for me. I did not want it to be mentioned and I certainly was not going to mention it without the evidence of some dire need. Running a half mile instead of a mile in junior high, on the teacher's vague notion that since my legs were half as long, that is how things should work, was agony. I was different, and few things are more painful to an adolescent than being different.\n\nIn my twenties, I came to the realization that if I did not get over it in some way and accept who I was, and love who I was, life was going to be miserable. That change was not instant, but by the time I hit twenty-eight or so, I was pretty much there. I dated a bit, I gained confidence, and I decided that I did not care what other people think. If they asked questions respectfully I would answer them, if they were jerks, I would ignore them. I figured that was the healthy way to deal with things.\n\nIn my thirties, I have shifted again. Now I am just angry. It is not enough that people do not say these things openly. They need to stop thinking them. Rather than giving people the luxury of being ignored for their bad ideas and two-faced rudeness, it is high time that I stepped up and gave them some attention. Things do not change for quiet people, they do not change for people who do not make an effort. For most of my life I have tried to keep my head down, hoping people would not look at me and would not notice my dwarfism.\n\nFuck that.\n\nI am a dwarf.\n\nLook at me.", " Ignore this, testing ", "Looking for a LP to join wife in bedroom.

As for me personally, I am tall for a dwarf and built pretty stocky so I think getting compared to Gimli is fucking awesome and encourage the comparison whenever someone makes it I am 3'2 and I think people getting upset over the term is a bit silly.

Why me? Before today, I have always clung on to the hope that it was some hormonal issue that someday they will find a cure for (I am 17, there is still time) but as each day passes this hope just seems to fade away. Also now that I know it is genetic, there is no hope left, you cannot reverse genetic mutations. I am me. And this is my life, as much as I hate it. I will never get to live life as a normal person, I will never get to reach things on the top shelf, I will never get to take the bus without getting stared at...you get the point. \n\nAnd it really sucks. It fucking hurts. \n\nI have spent the last few years hoping that one day, by some miracle, I will be normal. But it is not going to happen and I am just lying to myself. \n\nI do not know how I will ever be okay with this. I am really sorry that you are struggling with these feelings. I think that the best thing you can do is surround yourself with good friends. Possibly meet others with similar experiences as well. If you have not already, find hobbies, skills, knowledge, and interests that will make you feel good about yourself. Self love is magnetic! I know its hard to believe when you are in a low, but personality DOES attract people more than looks. \n\nOn another note, height is not the only thing that makes someone physically attractive. Peter Dinklage is my one and only celebrity crush. I find him attractive because of his dry wit, intelligence, and well rounded personality. But, also his hair, eyes, facial expressions and the confidence in which he carries himself. The fact that he is short does not bother me at all. In fact, he might not have the personality that he has if he had not grown up with dwarfism. He would probably just be basic and I might have overlooked him the way I do other celebrities of varying heights. I feel genuinely safe watching him on the screen and his wife is incredibly lucky to be with him.  \n\nI know he is a celebrity so it might not mean much, but I just wanted to say that there are plenty of people who will see your worth. I know exactly how you feel, I went through the same thing despite being even shorter, and more obviously dwarfed. Acceptance is the first step, though--once you come to terms with the exact sort of life you are living, this get easier. But it is still okay to be frustrated, I am pretty sure Peter Dinklage is quoted as saying something along the lines of, \n\n\"Some days I wake up and still cannot deal with the fact that I am like this\"\n\nI know how much it hurts to realize the uncountable fantasies of being of average height are just that--fantasies. Hell, I still have those fantasies every so often. But if you can learn to accept the whole truth of your mutation, and everything that comes with it (both good and bad), you can climb to heights as high, if not higher, than your average fellow man.\n\nI know all of this is not much of a consolation, and I am sorry for that, but if you can accept the situation for what it is, you will succeed.

I interpreted this to mean 'shut up, we do not want to know\"... to some degree it does mean that but it is more likely that they do not know what to say and are uncomfortable. No matter what the reason, it was very isolating and lonely and often I really needed to express my experience and how it made me feel.  \n\n\nI was also lucky that during university I made some awesome friends who would listen to me when I would bitch about being laughed at or made fun of. The 'permission' to speak about it and be heard was empowering and made me feel less horrible and ashamed about how 'few but vocal' strangers treated me.  \n\n\nAs you are so young, and you are friends are so young, you might want to consider borrowing some of my words next time you want to talk about this issue.

I have also assumed that i would never have a relationship and the idea of being alone for my entire life does not help either.\n\nMy plan is to go to a disability therapist, but i was wondering if there was any advice that anyone has that could help me. Hey man, that definitely sucks. I have a similar condition, and the psychological effects it is had on myself and my confidence is really draining. But I have been learning to become aware of my thoughts and recognize the negative, non-constructive ones. Although I have never really spoken to a disability therapist, that sounds like a great idea. I hope it works out for you. Feel free to message me if you ever need to talk. thank you, that is really kind of you to say and I hope everything works out for you too Welcome to agoraphobia.  I believe this is a bigger problem in the LP community than is known/admitted/discussed.  Brushed under the rug by a ton of people.\n\nMy best advice: Look into self-help books.  They have helped me immensely.  Look for those focused on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Thank you, i will make sure to do so! if you dont mind me asking what area of the world youre from? sure, new zealand so i am a 21yr guy from australia. and i also have spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. \n\nFor warning these are just my thoughts and how i deal with things. I will admit getting stared at in public sucks, i try to remember that to most people have never seen dwarves before and cant help but look. it suck all you can really do is learn to not notice it. if someone is being particularly obnoxious i might call them out on it. it usually sends them running.  in terms of the self loathing ive had to deal with that too. mine stems from not being enough. but for you i think that is something you will have to figure out yourself or with a professional.  \n\n\nif you ever want someone to chat with send me a pm im always around to talk and we can share experiences and stuff. Hello bro! I am from Russia and I have the same disease, it is hard in my country with such a disease you cannot imagine.when I am in Europe it is much easier for me, they do not pay attention to me. but I still manage, I try to make it work for me. Parental love and friends helped me, see my instagram napoleonactor! You can write to me, I hope you will feel better, because everything will be fine! Hang in there brother, always be proud of who you are. That is really rough to hear man. I have gone through a similar experience in my life (achondroplasia). Teasing, stares and comments from others, not to mention different treatment can be painful and feel unfair. What helped me deal with these sorts of issues was essentially realising it is a waste of time and mental energy worrying about what other people  think of me. You will know the real people you want to spend your time with, the rest are a waste of your time. As to dealing with the rest, I needed to develop a better sense of self worth, from their, dealing with these situations became clearer. Seeing a therapist is great, that is a great way to develop your own self value. I would also recommend researching and practicing topics such as mindfulness, meditation and self love. It is a long road but it is gets a bit easier the more you learn and practice, the more you self love and value yourself, the easier it will get to do.\n\nWith regards to a relationship, I would not worry, it will happen or it will not. It is not something that is forced or hoped into existence. I know it is a cliche but learn to love yourself and your life first. Then try to get involved in social activities and if you find the right person, it will work out. Create opportunities for yourself and value yourself and see what happens. I have only been in one relationship and it simply was not the right person for me, and it helped me realise its not something one can force, or even desire of its with the 'wrong' person for you. \n\nBest of luck man, I hope things get better. And something else the world does not tell you is that you are full of potential, you are enough and have everything you need to be you best version of yourself.

I realised I do not know if you all prefer if people stay standing and look down to make the required eye contact or facial visual... thingy that is expected, or if you want to spare your neck muscles the misery and just want us to drop down so you can just... chill.   \nWhat is the etiquette?? Should I just outright ask your preference or do I just assume that standing is preferred? I do not get out... at all, so unlikly I will ever meet someone with this condition, BUT IT PAYS TO BE PREPARED, and Google was not very helpful when I tried to search, in fact it was a lot of information from... none-Dwarfism people, which added to the confusion.", "Leg lengthening? Anything you guys have considerd? I am 4\"8 and I was offered to do a leg lenghtening which would get me to 5\"1. It would be a complete life change but is it worth it? For a few inches? Is it anything any of you guys have done/thought of doing? None of my parents have any type of dwarfism, my dad is 5\"10 and my mom is 5\"4. But yet I end up with an extremly rare type of skeletal dysplasia, sorry I am not 100% sure which one it is. I am only 15 years old and the doctor said that people with my type of dwarfism can end up anywhere between 4\"7 to 5\"3, but I think that I am done growing, maybe another inch or so but that is it. So what do you guys think? \n\nEdit: Did some asking around with old doctors and stuff, I have something called hypochondroplasia", "In Memory of Andy (/u/SmallManBigMouth) Unfortunately today I received a message on Reddit that lead me to check on Facebook.  The other moderator of our subreddit, /u/SmallManBigMouth, recently passed away.  All of the details of his passing are unknown as I post this, but I do know it is going to leave a hole in our staff here, and he is definitely missed.  He definitely was always a level head and tried to be fair in all of his dealings.\n\nRest Easy Andy.", "Hi!

Thank you! ", "How does an LP compute their BMI? Hey there, I am an LP with achondroplasia and have recently been trying to shed a few pounds.  I am exercising every other day and paying attention to my calorie intake.  I was never obese, just put on a few over the last couple of months. I currently weigh about 112 and am 4'3\" but I have no idea what my goal should be.  The BMI calculator says I am obese, which I am sure is wrong.  Does anyone have a reference of what my normal weight should be? Thanks in advance."]
