["L4 L5 disc slip surgery. I had my surgery done on 29th Nov i had loss of sense in my penis and right butt, bowel control lost peeing was needed pressuring. Post OPERATION \n\nI can pee with less pressuring but bowel control or urgue to poop is not back and numb penis and butt is still there and walking is getting better without support. Im just concerned if i have CES syndrome or something.", "Still concerned. So I have had numbness in groin,inner thigh, one of my buttocks and occasionally in my genital area for about a month now. Ive been told by ER doctor and now a neurosurgeon that I do not have CES. I am concerned I do and that it is not being taken seriously. \n\nI do have a buldging disc at L4/5 and and minor bulge at L5/S1.  The neurosurgeon wants to repeat my lumbar mri but I really want my SI joint to be imaged as well as the lumbar does not seem to show much of SI. I have suffered with on and off sciatica for a long time but never had numbness like this.\n\nIs it possible this is not CES and may not lead to it? Go to different doctors. I think the biggest red flag is urinary or bowel issues. I sat in a hospital for days. When it was discovered I had bladder function issues, they started moving quick. I am sorry you are going through this. Get to another doctor. If you are having numbness it is an issue I would not let them gloss over.\n\nThey could be treating it as severe sciatica, which it could be. I am not a doctor. Go to another doctor. Thanks, what was you issue. Not being able to go, going too frequently? They had requested a urine sample when was initially admitted. I said I did not have to go. I was on a dilauded(spelling?) drip so pretty loopy my time there. They kept asking the following day, and day after, and then that is when they told me they need the sample so do it now. Then I told them I could not pee. Urine retention. So they cathed me as a then it was off to get an mri then surgery almost immediately after.\n\nThis injury is time sensitive. If there is compression of the nerves, you could be causing permanent injury. If you go to doctors, request the mri. If they deny you, tell them to put it down in your notes, that you asked for it and they denied you. That makes it the doctors fuck up if it comes back to them down the road. They are much more willing to make the case to your insurance that the mri is medically necessary. He is sending me for lumbar mri but I believe I have a compression in SI. When I asked for mri there he basically said it is not necessary. So when I go back to him with lumbar results I will ask again for si joint. So I am linking a map that shows the relationship between the nerves and sensation. I would look over this and try to compare the areas you have issues with, and the info on the map. Again, I am not a doctor but having information like this is useful when communicating with your doctor.\n\n\n\nI am in the states, and at the time had an insurance plan that allowed me to see any doctor I wanted. If you feel your doctor is not listening I would suggest going for a second, even third opinion. Doctors are consultants. They are not infallible, I can attest to that personally. But they are not dummies, usually. Just go in, tell them what is happening to your body as specifically as you can. If you are getting pins and needles and numbness, you 100% percent have an issue. Probably a neuro issue. So I would be looking into a neurologist and your primary care doctor asap.\n\nEdit: I would suggest a neurologist and not a neurosurgeon. Not at this point anyways, but again, I am not a doctor. Thanks. After your surgery did you get bladder function back? Nope. I am over two years past surgery. Incomplete paralysis from the waist down. Wheelchair, Foley catheter, diapers. Shit sucks. I hope you are able to get appropriate treatment. Sorry to hear that. Thanks for info. How do you think yours CES came about? How are you doing now? I had extremely similar symptoms as you. I was waiting on a new lumbar MRI before probably having surgery. Three days before the MRI was scheduled, I ended up in the ER with a MASSIVE disc herniation at L4-L5 that compromised my spinal cord and caused true CES.  I was in surgery within 7 hours having a discectomy and laminectomy to decompress the nerves. My surgeon said it was the biggest herniation he is ever seen/removed. \n\nMy point is, please advocate for yourself. I am not a doctor, and I do not think you had true CES at the time of your post. But you definitely had some warning signs of it happening in the future, especially if you and your doctors believe you are already at risk... i think if I had pushed my doctors harder to get imaging sooner I would not still be in a hospital right now.", "Saddle Anesthesia My left butt is numb and colder than surrounding area. I do not feel the urge to poop, and I cannot feel my rectum being full which leads to constipation. It is also difficult if not impossible to fart. I can urinate normally though. \n\nI understand that Cauda Equina is rare so it is unlikely, but could it be that constant straining due to constipation and hard stool can lead to it? I have suffered urethral prolapse because of straining. I have asked google and it always ALWAYS give the extreme diagnosis so I came here to ask what could it be. \n\nI am not here for medical diagnosis, but I want to know what questions to ask when I go to a specialist and where to start. See an Orthopedic Surgeon and request a lumbar MRI . I had Cauda Eqiunis Syndrome. My left leg was paralyzed and Saddle numbness, straining to urinate and could not have a bowel movement . I had spinal fusion surgery L4 L-5 in April. Now I can walk and most of the feeling has come back in my Pelvis. Same here. Still use an afo on left foot and am using a cane. I was paralyzed waist down and I have to cath multiple times daily. It is all about getting in as soon as you recognize the signs. You will probably be misdiagnosed... But at least they have the imagery. Good luck Any back pain, sciatica? When you say you urinate normally, do you still have the sensation that you need to go or do you just know based on how much you drank / time elapsed? You do not have to answer that but I had my surgery last November and I only urinate when I want to, that sensation just does not exist for me anymore. \n\nIf you see a specialist, you need to be upfront about where the numbness is and if there is any pain make sure to distinguish between where the pain is / what exacerbates it and where the numbness is and if it is constant. After my initial walk-in I was only prescribed painkillers and an x-ray but when I went to emergency 2 weeks later they told me after the MRI that an x-ray would not have picked up any red flags. I still have the urge to urinate. My main concern is the constipation as it is getting worse and my stomach is painful. I seem to have lost my urge to poop. And there is numbness in my right inner butt. Only on the right though. I would focus on getting the constipation figured out. Permanent constipation is one of my ongoing symptoms but it is manageable and one of the lesser symptoms for me. I took magnesium citrate for it once and it basically clears you out completely, you could ask about trying that out. I have the same symptom. For me, eating more natural foods with higher fiber helped a lot. Processed food tends to constipate me more, but the turn off is that it can lead to messier visits to the bathroom. Like standing up with half a soft turd sticking out your butt because your rectum is numb. Thank you so much. I will take it as soon as possible. Wishing you the best as well! I am hoping for the best as well. It is scary not knowing what this might be. Wishing you the best as well! You are welcome! Thank you. I hope you get some answers and relief! Lol - I laugh because this is the same situation I have been dealing with since April (did not think it was just me - just felt like that). Has anybody else had discomfort with gas, and the inability to determine if I just gas or a bowel movement. I have gotten into a bad cycle where I sit at the toilet multiple times an hour to relieve the discomfort, however know that this will weaken my bladder and probably is not doing me any favours in the long run. Yeah the gas is hard to gauge at times and have sharted while on a walk.  Take caution depending where you are at.  I used to to sit on the toilet waiting, but my feet fall asleep so fast it can be dangerous getting back up. If nothing happens with in 10 minutes, i am out. I also keep an extra set of clothes in the car with some wipes. Thanks. Lol - I had not even thought that far ahead re: spare clothes - thanks to covid but I will.", "\"Mild compressive effect of the cauda equina nerves\" but no surgery! So , may of 2018 I was working on my car. I pulled back on the torque bar and felt my back blown up.  Not my first rodeo , I have had several herniations before this one. I finished up my work and made it home (barely) . I recovered at home, didnt bother with the dr. Until one day my groin burned and I felt like I constantly had to urinate. I went to ER. They did an emergency MRI and kept me overnight. The resulting MRI said mild cauda equina compressive effect at L2-L3 . Neurosurgeon called the following morning and said it wasnt bad enough to do surgery and that I should recover at home.\n\nWell, I did that. And things over the last year have only gotten worse. I have seen 2 other neurosurgeons and they have said the same thing. I also had another MRI done in may when things got worse and there was no change. I have been not able to sit nor stand longer than 10 minutes over the last 6 months without severe pain. And lately sitting has caused some numbness and hot and cold sensations through my saddle region. I called my neurosurgeon again and left a message. \n\nAnyone else have a long, or slow onset or CES? I am urinating and using the bathroom just fine. But the rest of my life is ruined. In my experience, if you have symptoms lasting over a year and half and conservative treatments (oral steroids, physical therapy, etc...) have not improved your quality of life, then the next step should be steroid injections and then surgery. Had they given you any sort of trajectory of symptom improvement/deterioration and a plan for how to handle those possibilities? Have you tried conservative treatment and they have not worked? Then I might revisit this conversation with your doctor. \n\nCES is no joke. Perhaps I was fortunate to have acute CES after 6 months of worsening pain and receive surgery right away, but it is important that you advocate for yourself and your quality of life. Chronic pain can lead to some seriously dark and lonely places. I wish you well, let me know if you have any questions! Can you get access to another surgeon/hospital?\n\nWhen bits of yourself stop working its often too late to repair them; do keep pushing for treatment. I had a slow onset... But not as slow as you! I had extreme back pain immediately, followed by mild sciatica within a few hours. By that evening I had severe leg weakness. But I thought it was just a bulging disc...\n\nSaddle numbness did not kick in till a week and a half later (but only when I walked), and then, it only lasted for a week, then it went away and I was left with just extreme pain and had to use a cane. \n\nIf I had not just started a new job, I would not have tried to power through the pain. As it was, 4 weeks after starting the new job and 2 months after the initial injury, I finally got my surgery.", "Currently having major issues that I think are indicative of an emergency. How concerned should I be? I am sorry if this is difficult to read. I am wide awake in the middle of the night and pretty much panicking.\n\nBack in October 2020, my health took a sudden downturn. I had major bathroom issues and did not know what could have possibly been wrong with me. My primary care doctor was able to get an MRI referral cleared, and at the end of the month, I had the scan done. I learned I have a dessicated disc at L5/S1. \n\nFrom there, I was referred to a neurologist to determine the next step, which was scheduled for the end of November. During this month, it was seriously impossible to sit down. Every time I did, I felt pain, which was especially bad during long trips to emergency rooms. Due to a miscommunication, this appointment had to be rescheduled...*for early January*. I waited. Got COVID-19. Had to reschdule again. And finally, I made it back at the end of January. I was sure I would be told I needed a microdiscectomy, or at least physical therapy. He said straight away I would need a spinal fusion.\n\nI do not want to be specific about my situation, but I can say I have had no insurance through all of this, so I have had to wait to see if my health care provider would cover the costs of the surgery. For reasons I cannot fathom, it took until *June* to hear anything back about getting the surgery referral to the approval stage. And...about a week ago, I received a quick response informing me that the request was denied. It is been four months since the surgery was recommended, and it was quickly denied.\n\nanyway. I have been dealing with urinary hesitancy and retention since late May. It has complicated even bed rest and made me feel terrible. Near the middle of the month, I had an incident where a bowel movement made me feel sharp pain, and suddenly, it became easier to urinate. But this is hardly good news - when I say it was easier to urinate, I mean it was harder to control. I rushed to my healthcare provider thinking it was finally time for surgery...and they told me I was out of luck and I needed prednisone. This apparently was not a red flag, which seemed ridiculous. \n\nFrom there, I had slight improvement. But as of right now...it really feels like I am losing control. Wben I feel the (distant) urge to urinate, I deal with it as soon as possible. and it always feels inadequate. I feel myself controlling the flow, but I feel like I would be unable to stop the flow. When done, I still feel an unavoidable urge to urinate. Most troubling, I have frequent urine leaks. Even passing gas seems to be enough to cause a slight leak. and truthfully, I think the only reason I have not had an involuntary release is because I am able to react to any urges to urinate as soon as I feel them.\n\nI should say I now have insurance and I am thinking about going to a different health care provider...but I just do not know. I feel like I am dangerous territory, but that medical professionals will not acknowledge it. And I realize no one here would be able to say definitively that I am in trouble. So I guess I will leave with this - WHEN am I going to be in trouble? I want to do what I must to avoid permanent nerve damage, but no one is listening to me. I cannot deal with this. My recommendation is to go to a hospital and refuse to leave until they listen and take you seriously. I am so sorry you are going through this. I kind of did that during my most recent visit, but I spoke with someone who claimed they also had the procedure and they tried to level with me. I do not know if they were lying to calm me down - they certainly increased my fears about my future health, but I did eventually give up and went home.\n\nI think the main issue is that I have not had insurance. I am just not cynical enough to think they were being negligent. Maybe they truly had no option but to turn me away. My primary care doctor has told me that now that I have insurance, getting clearance for the procedure should happen shortly. ...Which will lead to a one month delay IF it is approved. \n\nBut because I have insurance now, I am thinking about going to a different hospital - one that was recommended to me by the surgery clinic I was referred to. I am not sure, honestly. I went to the hospital and had my surgery hours from my MRI. The only reason I said what I said was because my neurosurgeon told me I was lucky I went in when I did (about a day after urine retention began, but quite a bit of time after the start of severe pain) because I likely saved myself from damage that would disable me more and make me permanently incontinent. It terrified me and I tend to err on the paranoid side with this. What alarmed me with your post the most was the onset of symptoms. I was told it starts with retention before it becomes incontinence and when it gets to that point, the chances of coming back from it are much smaller. It can be an emergent situation and should be taken seriously once onset of those symptoms. \n\nBut I am not a doctor and I have not seen your MRI, so I am just speaking from what I was told and what I read in a CES support group. Im not sure if I got lucky with the ER staff and surgeon or if there truly is nothing for you to worry about. Well, truth be told, my symptoms have been drastically inconsistent for nine months. In October and November, bowel movements practically disappeared. November and December, I had incontinence. January to March, my habits improved a bit. April, I was doing well enough that physical therapy seemed to be an option. But in May, the incontinence returned and was worse than ever. Now I am in July and I just go when I can. (and I am having ample back pain and numbness all over, which makes me think I am finally in red flag territory.)\n\nI do not understand these nerve issues one bit. I do not know if my issues stem from nerve compression alone, *inflamation* - temporary damage - caused by compression, or permanent damage from prolonged compression. It just does not make sense to me, and it is impossible to find answers. I have seen that nerve damage varies from person to person. I am almost a year out and my doctors still do not know know if I am going to heal anymore or not, they pretty much all tell me it may or may not heal and they cannot say for sure either way and everyone is different. So I do not quite know how it works either. What I *have* gathered is that the longer the damage is being done (ie, the disc is compressing the nerves) the less of a chance there is of healing and the more damage is being done. \n\nI would not trust a PCP to be diagnosing CES, truthfully. Maybe try going to a different hospital and be insistent they do an MRI so you have a more recent one, and have a neurosurgeon look at it if possible. Make sure they know CES is your concern. If they say you are fine, I would at least suggest you ask your PCP for a referral to see a neurologist or neurosurgeon. That is the plan for now. I am hoping insurance will make an MRI possible so they can at least see the severity of my issues. I fear spinal fusion and how it will affect my health long term, but I cannot live the way I have been living anymore. For me they did not do a fusion, they did a decompression by removing most of my l4/l5 disc. I still have pain, but much less. My left side is numb but with a cane, I can walk and my bladder and bowel issues have corrected. None of this was guaranteed so I feel fortunate. CES does not necessarily mean fusion, and it does not necessarily mean complete disability :) sooner the better if it is CES though. Good luck! well...now I am just speechless. I toughed out the trip to the new hospital. came prepared for them to keep me. Told them I was still technically in control of my bathroom habits, but felt I was losing control. and they said the exact same thing my regular health care provider told me - they could not rush me to surgery and that I would have to figure out the surgery referral, because they can only react AFTER I have fully lost control. which is precisely where permanent damage can occur. and who knows how much damage has already occurred since I am having worsening issues. Are you kidding me? Did they even do an MRI? Are you in a rural area? I am in a pretty densely populated area of the country and wonder if that is why my experience was so different. This was not even on my radar, but my disc looked like a cyst or tumor on my spine to the ER staff\u2026they knew enough to know it needed surgery right away. But I did not have to fight for an MRI. You should go back tomorrow and say you have lost control. sorry about the delay. I have been deeply depressed. They did mention me needing a new MRI, but they said they were unable to arrange that because it was so late at night. They said I would need a new MRI and I would need to go see the neurosurgeon I was referred to again, but right now, I am not sure how to approach any of this.\n\nI do not know if I need to show up to the hospital again to try and get an MRI, and whether or not that will even be possible or when would be the right time to go. I do not know if the surgery clinic will accept my insurance or if I will have to get another referral from my primary care doctor. And the worst part, my doctor has been out of the office almost every time I have tried to get in touch. AND on top of feeling pain every time I am in a car, I also have limited transportation options.\n\n(as of now, my right foot has been numb for nearly two days, and I think the disc is pressing even harder on my nerves now. I feel incredible confidence that I am not going to make it through any of this with acceptable results.) I understand your feelings. I am very sorry you are dealing with this, you are not a lone, I know this post is a few days old. However if you have not had surgery please seek it soon!\nTake it from a male 9years post surgery L3-L4. Lived with the pain, bladder leakage for 6months. I have not fully recovered and never will. Have to live with mobility issues, chronic back and  leg pain, bladder and bowel incontinence (no IC's, straining for bladder) (manual stimulation for bowel) no sexual function. Just to name few.\nThe sooner surgical intervention is performed the better the outcome.\nGood luck! hey, you doing ok? the foot going numb seems to be a big deal, CES or not. did you get it checked out by a doctor? i would assume that the foot going numb,\n along with inability to walk or drive due to sciatica is am emergency situation, especially if it is been like this for a while and the pain has not centralized (as in the pain is still in the toes, does not seem to be \"retracting upwards\" towards the back).\n\nimo it seems like grounds for an emergency spinal decompression surgery at the ER.if things like McKenzie exercises are not helping either. or even just plain bed rest and then walking for...a minute or something outside on flat ground.\n\nif your PCP is not being responsive and this has been happening for a while it may be time to take matters into your own hands. saving those nerves and sensations, making sure that they are ok, is the important thing. have you tried calling during office hours and insisting it is an emergency prior to going to the ER?\n\nI am sorry to ask all of these questions, i know you are feeling down, defeated and depressed. but just trying to get the full picture here. you are not alone here, we have all been through something like this, been down this dark path. Actually, I am still able to walk and drive - I just tend to avoid doing so since I feel like I am risking further damage. Cannot walk longer than 20 minutes and I cannot sit longer than 10 without feeling significant pain, though.\n\nI have been to every ER available to me multiple times - at least three times prepared to stay for surgery. Each time I am turned away. Sometimes I am given prednisone, other times I am told there is nothing that can be done. Right now, my foot numbness is seriously getting bad. Like it will not go away at all. Neither rest nor walking changes it at all. And as much as I want to go to an ER to try and get some help, I just know I am only going to be turned away. They act as if my ability to walk is an indication that I am perfectly fine.\n\n(I should mention that some of my bathroom habits have improved, strangely enough. scared to bring this up because doctors will surely take this as proof that I am doing fine and completely disregard the foot numbness.) It is not as if I have not been seeking surgery. Actually, I committed to it back in February and assumed it would be scheduled within a month. It took roughly four months to receive a rejection letter. As of now, my bathroom habits have somewhat improved (after dealing with incontinence for a month straight), but I feel drastic and constant numbness in my right leg. I know if I were to go to an ER right now, I would just be told that my slight improvement in one area completely overrides my setback in the other area. I know the feeling I was sent away from ER 4 times from the same hospital. Even though I could not stand and was in overwhelming pain, could not feel my penis they kept sending me home. My wife made the decision to take me to a trauma center where they quickly determine that surgical intervention was required.\nIt seems that many so called medical professionals have difficulty diagnosing CES and the need to receive the pressure on the spinal cord.\nI wish you luck, try to find someplace that can treat you. The longer you wait with treatment the more long term effects there will be. What happened with the MRIs? Did you get them? Are you able to take those images to a neurologist or ortho-surgeon to look at? I am wondering if skipping your PCP and going straight to a specialist is better at this point\u2639\ufe0f as I mentioned earlier, there seem to be multiple paths forward, and I was not sure which was best. I got a chance to speak with my doctor (for another reason) and she said now that I have insurance, I need to see the neurosurgeon again and apparently he can order another MRI. I called the surgery clinic to do this. Then I was told that even with my insurance, I would need to get a referral to set up an appointment. It is a constant back and forth, and all the while, my right leg continues to have worsening numbness. gotcha. i definitely think getting the MRI would be good to rule out anything bad \u2639\ufe0f no idea how I can make that happen. It seemed like one of the hospitals I went to recently tried to set one up, but it could not be done. As of now, I have gotten a new appointment set up with the neurosugeon...*in a month*. My PCP told me the neurosurgeon would be able to order an MRI. But then, a person from the surgery clinic told me I would need to ask my PCP about scheduling an MRI BEFORE I see the neurosurgeon because having him order one would only delay the surgery even further (somehow).\n\non top of all that, I am having new issues with bathroom habits. and I just know I am not going to make it through this. I know it is been too long. and if I get to the point where I cannot control my bladder, I know I will not be able to get emergency surgery quickly enough to avoid lasting damage.", "Herbs or vitamins Hi, does anyone take any vitamins or herbs to help with CA rather than medication/operations etc from the doctors/hospitals? \nThanks. If you are having ces your first stop should be your doctor. Nerve damage is not something to try and heal yourself. After they say it is ok then the second stop should be a physical therapist. They can help you work on any mechanical issues that could be causing the ces. Best of luck! I take regular vitamins along with the nerve pain medications. I smoke flower and it has helped my muscle spasms, muscle tightness, helps tremendously with the pain and insomnia and my lack of appetite.\n\nI was on a very intense physical therapy schedule. I was inpatient for several months and then outpatient appx 3 times a week for another several. I had experienced paralysis from my CES. I am now walking, with drop foot in left foot, with a cane and looking to lose that in the future.  \n\nThe point is, utilizing the flower was and continues to be instrumental in my recovery. \nGood luck! Hey there! I take this probiotic for UTI\u2019s its from love and wellness. I have felt an improvement from UTI\u2019s. Hope that helps Flower works for me along with Gabapentin, cymbalta and tianazine (sp) I occasionally use Senna/Sennakot if my bowels are backed up from not eating healthy. It is very mild and does not give you any explosive urges. My doctor once suggested a \"toilet day\" at home once a month using laxatives to get cleared up. After trying laxatives once, I decided never again. Now I stick to Senna, it takes a long time to work for me, about 8 to 12 hours and does give some relief and therefore makes you feel more comfortable, but nothing replaces a healthy diet. Good luck!", "Urine Problems, Leg Pain, and Butterflies Hi\u2026just trying to see I am crazy!\n\nCurrent symptoms: for over a year my right leg has had dull, constant central buttocks pain and tingling along my entire leg. Certain positions are uncomfortable and I have lost sleep on this. I also developed UTI-like symptoms that started at the same time as my leg pain. Culture tests came back negative and ultrasounds say I have been fully emptying my bladder twice so far. I also have IBS (self-diagnosed) and just starting experiencing more constipation in the year but I assumed it was due to my period. I have gotten myself to a uro-gynecologist and physical therapist. I was initially diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, and now pelvic floor dysfunction. Oh forgot but I also have sexual dysfunction symptoms now. I am now also experiencing strange butterflies in my stomach (not due to stress or anxiety) that have made me writhe in bed for a week now.\n\nTonight is another sleepless night and I happened upon an article about CES. I know I plan to talk to my GP about my symptoms altogether, as she has solely been focused on my urine problems, but how do I advocate for myself? Do I just say I want an MRI based on my symptoms?\n\nShould I go to the ER even though I do not feel my symptoms are \u201csevere\u201d? I can tough out the pain typically but overtime it just wears you out. This does not sound like CES. It sounds like sciatica along with the other diagnoses you were given.

I am in ER right now almost positive it is what I got waiting for mri, and I am so worried. I am 21 year old too young for this shit man Yes. I was fortunate to catch it before permanent damage was done. I had emergency back surgery. Healing from the surgery took a while, and it took a few months to recover full sensation, but it did return. I get some slight pain in my back sometimes, but nothing too bothersome.\n\nI hope the MRI brings good news. Good luck. How early did you catch it? I am sitting here with next to no sensation in my penis and my thighs are feeling almost completely numb. I can still hold in pee thankfully but I feel it is fleeting. My low back is aching and my legs feel weak, but I can still walk. Got To wait a few more hours until they can review the results sadly  Probably about 3 months. It was intermittent pain at first and I did not realize I was losing sensation until about a week before surgery. Nerves have some capability to recover, especially if they are just bruised from compression.\n\nThey put me on some high dose steroids before surgery which immediately gave increased feeling. After surgery, I took oil supplements, flaxseed and omega-3 to help heal. Nerves heal very slowly though, even years, so I would not lose hope. When I had my issues back in 2011 L4-L5 L5-S1 i was paralyzed in 48 hr I had emergency surgery a few hours after I lost full sensation and  I was lucky to get everything back except my right foot. How old were you and what was your lifestyle if you do not mind me asking? Like relatively fit? It was the same month I turned 19 (June) just graduated high school, I made my disk bulge do to a weight lifting accident, went to the family doctor for 8 months she just kept giving me muscle relaxers kept living my life in that 8 months had move stuff out of a house and sand bag the home before a flood tried  to take it out, went to college orientation the week right before my back herniated, but what made my disk herniate was from coughing in a recliner when I was sleeping on vacation. Herniations happened on a Monday morning was on the table getting cut open that Wednesday morning. I should add. it took 3 weeks to get feeling back from waist to mid thigh, roughly 2 months to my knee, a lot of physical therapy, leg braces, wheelchairs, forearm crutches. I do not want to scare you just prepare you with what I have experienced in the past, also surgeries I had double laminectomy and double discectomy. \nI was 38 and had intermittent back issues due to a snowboarding accident in my teens. The last round I had a buldge for a few months that herniated and 3 days later I started loosing feeling in the saddle region. Went to the er that night without any sensation in the saddle and they removed the disc the same morning. \nRecovery sucked and pt was worse but after the first year I gained back 95% of the feeling. I am in year 3 now and would say I am closer to 98%. Thing still go numb occasionally usually because I slept wrong. I can lift, run, bike, climb, and f* just not as vigorously. \nBest of luck on your journey and when you get down we are here for support. Mri scan turned out normal so I have no idea what it could be now. Still waiting for neurosurgeon to come see me but fuck now I think I have got myelitis or something Man, not knowing can be scary AF. Let us see what the NS says. The human body is super resilient so you may not be the same after this but that just means ya got to kick a** a little differently.\n\nSending good vibes, you got this. Idk man I feel weak in my arms and legs and numb still. No sensation in my genitals. If that shits permanent I am going to be very sad. Thank you for the positive energy though it kind of calmed me down I feel you. It is easy to get in your head\u2026 what did neuro say? Stay strong, i do not have sh* for answers but if you need someone to talk to I will respond in &lt; 24h. They want to run some more mri scans of brain and upper spine to look for ms I think. Cannot think of what else it could be if it are not CES But numbness is not associated with ms, is it? Hopefully the new scans help uncover this mystery! It can be I think. Who knows. I will be thoroughly confused if those tests come back negative though. I had surgery in December, I am able to walk now and I have regained feeling in my growing up until the middle of my foot my toes are still numb. But there is hope. Man, that stinks. Well fingers crossed they can find whatever it is and have the pills at the pharmacy that will fix it for $5. I mean if we do not know it does not hurt to be optimistic! I am 9 weeks post operation. But I just leaked some urine again after coming from bathroom and lying down in my bed. I hope this is normal? Please be normal 2.5 years ago I herniated between L4/L5. It took 1.5 months before I got surgery. I had intermittent saddle numbness and loads of pain and bilateral leg weakness. On surgery day, I walked into the hospital using a cane. I walked out 6 hours later without it. \n\nI am 95% better. It took time to regain strength in my feet, and my left foot still has some weakness but otherwise you would not know how bad off I was. Damn bro that is fuckin lit happy for you. Turns out my mri came normal so it are not CES but now every nervous system function in my body is shutting down pretty quick idk what the hell is wrong with me. Shits scary Do you only have numbness in the genital region or also erectile dysfunction? \nI also have weird symptoms and cannot figure out what is the cause. Doctors are clueless. I also had erectile dysfunction. I was not completely numb but I had less feeling in my thighs and genital area. It was like touch was missing that sexual stimulation or something. It is starting to come back though thankfully. Still a little less sensitive but better than nothing Thanks for answering my question! I am in this condition for nearly 1 year. I cannot get mental erections, it is feels sexually numb. I also had nerve pain in the groin. And many weird nerve and muscle symptoms. Maybe I should check for CES. Btw. I hope you are doing well. Wish you the best. I think CES tends to make your legs numb as well, and give bowel/bladder continence issues. Worth looking into for sure though. It should show up on mri if you have had those. Maybe  pudental neuralgia or pelvic floor dysfunction? I know PFD causes pain sometimes, it does for me anyways. I get a sharp stabbing pain in my bladder and anus sometimes from it. Other than that idk man but I wish you the best of luck Weirdly, yesterday and the day before I was back to normal. Today it seems the numbness is back. Very disappointing and now I have no clue what is going on. Really hoping it is nothing too serious though", "Cauda Equina Syndrome has been created Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a condition that occurs when the bundle of nerves below the end of the spinal cord known as the cauda equina is damaged. Signs and symptoms include low back pain, pain that radiates down the leg, numbness around the anus, and loss of bowel or bladder control. Glad to see a subreddit! I am also in some closed Facebook groups as well. I was shocked when I did not see one available. I am going to be doing a lot of CES and disability type things with my immediate future so I wanted to get a subreddit started and hope that when I do launch that other groups and people will become involved here without taking anything away from those groups.", "Is it normal for symptoms to develop over the course of a few months? I went to the hospital for symptoms like groin desensitivity and back of thigh numbness a few months ago and they took MRIs and such and all came back normal, they sent me on my way and said it should get better. Well here I am still feeling like shits wrong and I feel like I am still retaining urine and have a less powerful urge to need to urinate among other symptoms. I am scared out of my mind rn and desperately want to go to the hospital but cannot afford another 30k expense and feel like maybe I am overreacting and should give it time.  \n  \nIs it normal for CES to develop over 2-3 months? The only thing that slightly reassures me is I thought typically it is over a few days it goes from 0-100. I have had days where I feel pretty much normal though, but something about today just makes me feel just as scared as I was day 1 IM not sure if it has to be bilateral. But I would honestly talk to a Neurosurgeon see what else they can do for you. Because I do think with less voiding, it can cause issues. Are you having issues with bowel movements as well?? Nah I do not think so, I still go fairly regularly. If I do have CES it currently is very mild, since I am still able to walk and am not completely numb anywhere, and can still control my bladder/bowels, it just feels lessened Hi! I am a woman and think I have the same symptoms as you. I can urinate but do not have the urge to go. However I am getting twitches in my body and headaches? I had CES and it slowly developed over the course of about 3 weeks before it became critical resulting in surgery. What did it feel like as it progressed? Was there pain early on, did it go away? What about sensation? Bladder/bowel control?", "Possible CES while pregnant I am not sure if I am over reacting or under reacting but it would be helpful to get some viewpoints from people with experience with CES just in case. I am 28 weeks pregnant and I know that back, leg, and groin pain are very normal parts of pregnancy. My worry comes from my symptoms plus prior medical issues. I have an untreated herniated disk and moderate spinal stenosis. My symptoms are groin pain and inner thigh pain on my left side. This past day I have lost sensation while urinating. I have not lost the ability to hold my pee but I cannot feel it coming out anymore. A little TMI but I have also had a small bit of fecal incontinence. The pain in my groin keeps getting worse. None of my symptoms seem too severe but I am still quite worried. This started 3 days ago. Should I go to the ER? Just an update if anyone finds this in the future. Have not been diagnosed with CES, but the trip to the er was extremely important. Diagnosed with preeclampsia and currently hospitalized. When in doubt,  definitely just go to the er. Could have been way worse if I would waited any longer.", "Symptoms, help Long story short I have worked a desk job for the last 4 years. I am 27/F about 115 pounds\n\nWhen the pandemic started I spent most of my day in bed. Around May 2020 I moved and remember hurting my back lifting heavy stuff but it did not last long\n\nIn May I started having pains throughout the pudendal nerve. Saw multiple gynocologists and they are clueless on neuro pain, no luck. Referred to neurologist. Neuro wants to rule out MS even though I have zero classic symtoms. I had a lumbar MRI that came up normal\n\nMain issue: I suffered with an acoustic shock in fall of 2019. It left me with horrible permanent tinnitus, nerve pain in my ears, ear spams, and irritation of my trigeminal nerve. The issue is, loud noise is very dangerous to me me and it has left me pretty disabled. MRIs go up to 110 decibels which has a safe exposure of a few seconds, and sound can travel through bone conduction via your skull \n\nThe Lumbar MRI was already super risky for me but I was in so much pain I decided to get it anyways. I wore double protection, plugs and muffs and while in the moment it was fine, my symptoms severely flared a few days later and I still have not improved (it has been 5 months now) and I can barely leave my house. \n\nMy other pain has progressed where now my genitofemoral nerve Area hurts, pudendal nerve pain, sciatica type pain. Since late summer I have had prickly leg pain where it just feels like I have a million little needles digging into my skin and it gets worse with applied pressure like sitting, pants, etc \n\nI have a bit of lower back pain too but the worst area is my legs and glutes\n\nDoctors keep tossing me back and forth and I do not know where to turn. I do not have any bowel/urinary issues really. No saddle numbness. The sciatica type pain is the newest to appear. I have been standing for work and now my shins hurt a lot and muscular pain in my legs.\n\nCan CT scans be done to rule further stuff out? Do they show compressions if I had a T-Spine and sacrum scan? More nerve tests? My bloodwork was fine. \n\nThere was a weird thing where something was abnormally high and my doctor said it was because I fasted. She told me the bloodwork was non-fasting...when I mentioned that to multiple doctors they still brushed it off and said it was normal, for ex, the normal range is 20-30, mine was about 100, and doctors said it is only concerning if In the thousands \n\nI am just so terrified that I am going to end up paralyzed and my other condition is very limiting as I cannot have a ton of MRI\u2019s to rule more stuff out. I signed up for Pelvic floor therapy but that is not for another month Sorry to hear about your pain... I am no medical professional but my docs did not think CA until I had bowel issues and saddle numbness. The second you experience either go back to your dr ASAP.\n\nHave you seen a physical therapist? Even after the disectomy I did not feel relief until I started a training routine with the PT. My only regret is not seeking one out sooner.\n\nI hope you find some relief... I would recommend a chiropractor", "Saddle Tingeling Hey everyone, does CES always come with strong back pain? I woke up with some pins and needles on my left butt cheek, very close to my groin area. Not much pain, maybe a dull feeling above my butt crack. However this is my only symptom currently. Google says ER, just curious how real life occurrences present. Are you having any incontinence? Or urine retention? I dealt with the pain for a bit (it was INTENSE pain) but my breaking point when I finally went to the ER was when I could not stand up and I could not pee.  I *knew* something was seriously wrong. My body was not working. \n\nThe best bet with CES is to get an MRI and see if anything is pushing against those nerves. The symptoms you are describing could be as simple as a pinched nerve. Idk. I am not a doctor, I just wanted to share my experience and put my 2 cents in. :) I am having a bit of grind retention as well. If it could also be from the medication I recently started. I appreciate your feedback! Google made it seem like if you have tingeling anywhere in the saddle area you need to call 911 so it was a bit unnerving I would definitely get it checked out but idk if it is at an emergency level if your symptoms are that mild. When I tell you my body was not working, I mean that I was unable to stand. I had my mom hose me off in the shower while I laid on the floor. I crawled to the car. I still stopped at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts for coffee on the way though lol!! Idk what is wrong me haha. I did not even finish it because as soon as they saw my mri they were like nuh uh no coffee you are going to surgery. Anyway.\n\nI think calling your dr and getting an mri referral is the way to go unless the symptoms get worse. Then go to the ER. Not a medical opinion, this is just based on my personal experience and I saw no one else commented. It is alarming what google says about CES, and CES *is* an alarming and scary thing that should be taken seriously. Any urine retention or incontinence probably means an ER visit is appropriate. \n\nWhat is grind retention? I tried googling and just got coffee stuff. Oh, and maybe call the pharmacy and ask about the symptoms? I totally forgot you mentioned that when I wrote my comment. Sorry that was a typo. I meant urine retention, just have to try a little bit extra to go since starting my new meds. My pins and needles went away during the night but are slowly coming back now that I am moving around this morning. \n\nI have a virtual drs appointment tonight so I am at least getting it checked out. \n\nDid you make a full recovery after the surgery? I did not, but I am in a decent place. I can walk. I am using a walker at the moment but do not always need it, I am just having a flare up of the two discs that were fucked when I had my surgery. My left side is numb waist down so I have to be careful walking but it is usually fine. I am peeing fine, no long term effects there. But my bowels are not the same. I make it to the toilet about 90% of the time but the control is not the same. God bless my boyfriend for understanding. But it does not happen often where I do not make it but it usually comes on with very little warning and I have to beeline to a bathroom *quick*.  Sexual function is still there, the numbness is only on the outside of my lady bits. It is hard, I am not going to lie to you. I had a really difficult year recovering (my surgery was 9/30/20 so I just passed my surgaversary). \n\nBut do not jump to conclusions. The urine retention us worrisome but I take medications that effect that (my painkillers mostly). Call your pharmacist and ask\u2026and ask your doctor. I would absolutely insist on an mri so they can see what is going on and if it needs intervention. Idk where you live but I am in the US and the imaging places are everywhere so if the first one you call cannot get you in within a couple days, call another. Sooner rather than later because if it is CES that is important to recovery. I thank the swift action of the ER staff for my good recovery. They worked quick man lol I was in surgery within hours of my MRI. Oh and ask for a copy of your mri on a CD. \n\nI know I say this in every comment but I am paranoid and want a disclaimer: I am not a doctor, just someone that went through this and read a lot about it after but I certainly might be wrong about my opinion here. That is why I am suggesting the MRI should be quickly done, so a doctor can look. And you, with the CD. ( can see it, even if you do not know what you are looking at. So do not freak out, but act swiftly. That is my advice. Well I wish you the best! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just checked and 2 of my 3 pills can cause urine retention. While its not bad, it mostly happens once and a while at night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy biggest concern is the numbness in my butt, which I am thinking is \"saddle\" as sometimes it does radiate to my groin. It went away totally at night what I woke up to change the kids but happened again this morning. Thankfully I have an appointment with my Dr tonight! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI appreciate your responses!! No problem! I wish you luck. I have a feeling it is not CES for you, and if it is you are not too far in and that is a good sign for recovery. Def talk to your doctor and make sure they know what you are worried about cause ces is relatively rare and put your foot down if you are denied an MRI. But good luck, you will be good. Thank you. I am praying I just pulled something but I have extreme healthy anxiety and it is just triggered to the max right now. Do you mind if I PM you? Not at all", "September is Spinal Cord Injury Month. I know all of us are dealing with this underlying condition called CES and its something we deal with on a daily basis. We will have good days and bad days, nevertheless we are survivors and making everyday count.  Good post. Thanks for posting. NGL, it is getting me down. Surgery for L3/4 CES last year initially went well until I developed an intrathecal synovial cyst at L3/4 a few months later causing CES all over again. Looks like I need revision surgery but this time with spinal fusion. Gabapentin, naproxen, oxycodone and paracetamol/acetomenophen are controlling the pain reasonably well but I cannot walk far or bend for any length of time so my ADL are severely limited. \n\nOn the plus side, I am not in Kabul getting thrown from a helicopter, so it could be worse. I am so sorry you are feeling that way. Revision surgery is rough, but you will get through it. All the medications you listed is rough on the body, i give you props for being able to handle that. I will tell you that  gabapentin does cause urine retention. Please make sure you are hydrating, drinking tons of water and pedialyte to restore your body\u2019s electrolytes. I know this may sound silly but using a water pouch filled with warm water on areas of pain does help soothe it. Feel better !

Hi there I will try to keep this short and to the point.\n\nI am a 37 yo Male who has been **diagnosed with Spondylolisthesis grade 2 at L5 S1.**\n\nOver the last year I have had the typical symptoms you would expect with Spondy (numbness, pain in legs and feet) but **recently I have started experienced worrying new Symptoms.**\n\nI do a lot of walking, and this summer I began to notice a **Painful numbness and other sensory changes in my genitals and upper inner thighs and quads. These symptoms are always most intense when I am walking or on my feet for a long time, and when I am sitting.** From what I have read and speaking with my doctor, we think that I have **irritated my Pudendal nerve.**\n\n He mentioned that the **narrowing of my spinal canal at L5/S1, the spot of the spondy, may be pressing on the Cauda Equina nerves but not excessively so to the point I have CES.** I asked him **if I should still proceed with my Spinal Fusion surgery and he said it would probably be a good idea to do so.**\n\nMy question is, **is there a link between Spondylolisthesis and Pudendal Neuralgia?** **Could the stenosis I have from my L5/S1 spondylolisthesis be causing my issues in my genitals? or is this Pudendal Neuralgia something of its own making? Should I still proceed with my Spinal Fusion and Decompression surgery?**\n\nThanks for reading and my apologies if this post was a bit all over the place, I am just so confused and scared about what is going on and worried that a surgery may make things worse. Any replies or help on this would be much appreciated. I have stenosis that occasionally creates numbness in my saddle region if I have enjoyed something in that area. This occurs post discectomy for CES in 2016. \n\nThat is about all the relevant info I can give on  physical symptoms you might be experiencing. I can also say that CES was the worst pain I have ever felt in my life and I required emergent surgery for it. CES can be acute like mine, but it can also develop slowly over time.\n\nMy understanding of spinal fusion is that it is meant to stabilize and protect your spine from movement that could be harmful. If you are unsure about your surgery, you could ask your doctor directly why they think fusion is the best option for you over other treatments, or you can get a second opinion. Generally, good medical professionals are willing to explain why they want to do something if you ask. Maybe then you can make a more informed decision. \n\nGood luck friendo. I hope you keep us updated!", "Lingering symptoms/docs have been useless Just looking for thoughts/advice.\n\n7 months ago had a tumor removed from kidney. 2 weeks into recovery I developed a numbness,anesthetic feeling inner to rear thigh and genitals. I convinced myself I had Cauda equina syndrome , but it was ruled out by numerous docs ,hospitals etc. I do have a herniated disc at L4/5 that I also just had surgery on. This anesthetic feeling in thigh and genitals is still there though and is it even from my herniation?!\n\nI am completely frustrated but learning to live with it. Urologist and spine doc bounced me around to each other now being referred to a neurologist. Any ideas? I had surgery for CES, and nearly a year out I have numbness on my left side. Damage to nerves takes a long time to heal, and a lot of times they never fully do. I encourage you to do physical therapy and remain engaged with your doctors to better your chances of healing, but to also adjust your expectations of being pain and numbness free. Unfortunately, nerve damage can be here to stay.\n\nEdit: neurologist is who you want to see, they deal with the nervous system. They will likely tell you what I just did. My neurologist told me it could take 6, 13, 18 months to heal. Do not give up but do adjust expectations. You are going to the right doctor. Good luck. \n Oh and keep expressing your concerns about CES. My issue is I was never diagnosed with CES. I would be more understanding of possible outcomes if the doctors told me I had this. I understand. CES is relatively rare so you may not have been diagnosed, even if you had the compression of these nerves. You said l4/l5 was operated on, so perhaps that disc was pushing up against the nerves and did damage. CES is lifelong, even after the operation. A neurologist is the right doctor to be seeing, you are going in the right direction for a diagnosis whether it was CES or not.

Are there any programs out there that could help?", "Possible Cauda Equina I need a place to share these symptoms because i am anxious and worried. I have had an L5-S1 herniation since January of this year. I plan to get a microdiscectomy on December 8th to relieve sciatica when I return home from school. Over the past month i have developed some urinary issues - mainly urge frequency. I do not have any incontinence, i have never leaked on myself and I have held it on a STRONG urge for about 3 hours recently.  For my bowels I still poop daily but it is only a small amount (I eat one big meal a day because i am in college). However, as an otherwise completely healthy 21 year old I should not be having these issues so I went to the ER because I read about CES online. The ER sent me home with a urology referral because without saddle anesthesia or foot drop a new MRI was not warranted. Urology tests came back negative so no infection. \n\nToday I woke up with what may be saddle parasthesia. The best way to describe it is if you rubbed your thighs together for a while and it starts to burn. I do not have any pain in my butt, I can still clinch my rectum fine and i can still get a strong urine stream out. Still no foot drop. I have full sensation everywhere, just worried as to whether this is an emergency or not.\n\nI really hope this is not CES because I want to wait until December for my surgery, i am getting my procedure done at a world class hospital and I feel like they will not butcher my spine. Just hoping my body can hold up for a few more weeks.

I got an CT that showed the protrusion in october and a steroid shot that dulled the pain for a while. Around christmas i started to notice paresthesia in both my feet and ever so slightly around my genitals. I got a second steroid infiltration and an mri which confirmed compression of the sciatic nerve.\n\nThe second shot helped immensely, the leg pain is completely gone most of the time. Sometimes a dull feeling appears when i am sitting, but it is rare and not very intense. However, a month ago I was in the bathroom before going to bed and I seemingly felt something pop and instantly both legs started tingling a lot more than before. After a week tingling around my buttocks and genitals appeared so I went to the ER. Immediately an MRI was taken, but it showed no compression of the sacral nerves and it has become slightly smaller than on the MRI in january, according to the doctors, so they decided not to operate. \n\nSince then (3 weeks ago) the tingling in my legs subsided a little, but there has been no improvement in my saddle region. On the contrary, a week later I got the sensation that something was stuck between my butt cheeks, so to speak, or a numb feeling. It does feel mostly normal when I touch it though, or maybe slightly numb, but that is difficult to say since i cannot really compare. I mailed my neurosurgeon but as long as it is not saddle anesthesia, he does not see it as an indication to perform surgery (since I am only 27 they want to avoid surgery if possible). But this has not improved since then and I have the feeling that it is getting worse very slowly. But I do worry a lot and I have had people suggest that i make it worse by worrying so much (i cannot help it, i am very stressed about this progressing to CES at the moment). I am a bit at a loss here, since I want to trust my surgeon, but I also feel that it is not going in the right direction. Also, when I sit down for more than 20 mins - half an hour the tingling in the saddle region increases significantly &gt; since I am only 27 they want to avoid surgery if possible\n\nEverything, especially this, is a repeat of what I went through for years which progressively became CES.\n\nThe difference is I had the \"too young for surgery\" conversations at 35. It hit me like a ton of bricks just a few short years later. I really regret not doing more sooner. It was my 39th birthday when I was finally rushed to ER by ambulance before the surgery.\n\nMy opinion is that you may not have it *now* but I would suggest that you are heavily predisposed to getting it.\n\nPlease seek additional professional opinions (I am not a doctor) and keep exploring it. The more you do now the greater the likelihood of recovery and more so so you avoid getting as deep as CES. If you trust your surgeon then explain your concerns to him, first via email, then in person preferably. \n\nIf not, there are other surgeons!\n\nHere we are mostly insured so cost is less of an issue.\n\nThere is only an advantage getting all communications registered is for later legal battles.\n( ask me how I know\ud83d\ude00)\n\n\nI have been buggered for the last 13 yrs. you get used to it... Thanks for your reply. I also feel this way about it. I really do not want to wait until the sensation in my bum starts to disappear, since I feel that this is letting progress things quite far already. I am going to contact my surgeon again and express my concerns and potentially get a second opinion. I am from belgium luckily, otherwise all the hospital visits and PT probably would have ruined me already :p I do think that my surgeon is very capable, but I also feel that it is a classic case of following the textbook indications and that my concerns are not always heard Gentenaer hier!

I have been having off and on sciatica since July. The pain stays on my right side and seems typical - lower pack, down the leg, and through my hip. A couple of months ago, I started feeling slight urinary tract discomfort and thought I may have a UTI. I spoke to a doctor over the phone, was prescribed antibiotics, finished the regimen, and all seemed well. Those UTI symptoms started presenting again last week. I went to an in person clinic this time and was told absolutely no infection. The sharp/burning pain seems to be connected to my sciatica symptoms and is more noticeable when I lay down, sit up, really when I just change positions. I have not noticed any numbness or incontinence at this point, but this unexplained pain is worrying. Has anyone here experienced something similar? I do not want to jump to CES unnecessarily and I do have an appointment with my GP scheduled for the end of the month, but I found this subreddit and figured it cannot hurt to ask people who have experienced CES firsthand. I also have costochondritis (diagnosed in April) but I do not think that would necessarily correlate. Thanks in advance.", "Can this be ces 3 years ago while lifting some stuff I suffered L5-S1 slip disc.

I am urinating more frequently though but the flow is fine. \nI can walk/jog properly right now.\nCan this be a case of ces? From what I have read on this subreddit, CES usually involves numbness of the saddle region, not \"discomfort.\" When my CES was at its peak, I would sit on the toilet and could not even feel the seat beneath me.\n\nThat being said, you can have CES and still have regular bowel/bladder movements. If you go to the hospital, doctors can/will also check to see if your bladder is voiding properly (they use a funky exterior wand to measure your bladder volume before and after a pee).", "Stomach issue I am after some advice, is it possible that along side my bowels becoming slower and almost numb that my stomach also desensitised?\n\nI am constantly hungry since my op back in March 19, and I just keep eating until I am in pain but yet I still do not feel full.\n\nI like most really hate what happening to us.

I feel like I am losing sensation around my groin, anus, and back of left thigh, but there is no pain in my back or legs. Nothing severe anyways. I have developed intermittent shocking in my left toes when I move them. The biggest thing for me is the sensitivity in the groin area and I feel like I have lost some anal tone. Like I could spread my cheeks and it is just gaping for a few seconds before it closes on its own. My urge to pee feels decreased.  \n  \nI went for similar symptoms back in august to the ER and they found nothing, so I would rather not spend another 30k on a problem that does not really need it, so unfortunately I can only ask you guys until I see my doctor. What happened last time you went to the ER, what was the outcome? I am currently dealing with pins and needles around the same areas but do not have pain or any of the other symptoms. I believe I just pulled something but I have an appointment with my PCP this afternoon. All my MRIs and tests came back normal, they discharged me saying I was fine. I did not have complete numbness or even really pins and needles though so I might not be a good comparison unfortunately. No it is Deff helpful! My issues are changing and no longer really pins and needles anymore.", "I wanted to post my MRI from a few hours before my surgery. I am curious to see how it compares to others. L4/L5 and L5/S1 are what they removed. ", "Future of the Sub I had grand ambitions when I started this sub a couple of years ago not long after acquiring CES. I could not believe that one did not exist. While rare there is a number of FB groups and other outlets online.. with the popularity of Reddit I was sure there would be a sub. But there was not.\n\nWhat has stopped me from growing this community? A lot of nothingness to be quite frank. Aside from a few physio sessions I have had no other real support post-CES despite always trying to find it. \n\nTo compound matters, I am also battling the health system that failed me and I have not known what of my personal experiences that I can share.\n\nNow 2.5 years on from original surgery I am back in hospital. Only this time I am in the right ward - the spinal ward. Great nurses and lots of patients (peers) going through all sorts of weird and excruciating experiences.\n\nWhat I have found is that while no two journeys are exactly the same we do have a brother/sisterhood of somewhat shared experiences,  psychological trauma and other goodies.\n\nIn part, it is helped me understand just how much I have failed myself, those who I hold near and dear and all of you in this hood in this together.\n\nI am still unsure what I can write for legalities sake but after I get out of here I want to put my professional skills and abilities to good use to give you all a special community where you are safe, wanted, feel validated, etc.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas or things they would like to see on this reddit community please share.\n\nCheers Hello. I am post OP since 5/1/2021 so I am still kind of new to the CES world. I also have had a bit of a problem finding support. I wish you the best and hope you feel better soon. Will check for updates. I am approaching a year post op and support is really hard to find. My insurance company will not approve d a rhizotomy because apparently the surgery \u201cfixed\u201d me. The CES Facebook group was so helpful but then you have to be on Facebook. \n\nI, too, was surprised to not find much here on Reddit. For gods sake I stumbled an active sub about hating ketchup! \n\nI hope you recover well and get to go home soon\ud83d\udc95 thanks for thinking of us. I was brought in with it on May 5th and had emergency surgery after a quick Mri. I am not based within the US but have noticed that here in Ireland we have a great structure to deal with this. I spent 2 weeks post op in a normal hospital to then be moved to a specialised one that got me back walk and using SIC's and so forth. I have finally gotten back to some normality but still cannot do some basics. \n\nIf anyone needs to talk or wants to discuss some info on this please feel free to reach out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is not a lot out there for this and any help with what people are going through is great. Thanks for this subreddit!! 2.5 years post op. Take things a little slower than I used to but no worse for wear. Try my best to stay in shape and eat right but still feel like the next issue is around the corner. Take it day by day and am thankful to have a forum where someone has at least heard of what im going through. Take care of yourself first, then keep us posted! I mostly lurk haha... But I am focusing on my recovery as well. Godspeed everyone. You all not alone I am very grateful to you for creating this Sub. I am not on any other social media and quite new to Reddit, but it seems I have found a safe place in the communities on here, whether it is lurking or contributing. I would not worry about the popularity of the sub, CES is rare, effecting very few people, hence your perceived lack of activity. I think the mere fact that there is a CES sub is great. Communal advice from people who are in the thick of it, is better that the information you find online. I believe it benefits the few on here more than trying to get the message out to the masses. Unless you are effected by it, you would not know CES existed. I did not. Thanks again for your efforts, it does count. People are grateful, even if they do not express it.", "Had a scare of CES back in august but all came back normal, I am still concerned I have it though So I had some symptoms of CES and went to the ER for it and they ran full MRIs and blood work and everything was normal. However, I still to this day have decreased sensitivity on my left side: back of thigh, left side of penis glans and shaft, around anus, weakness walking, less urge to pee, and I noticed recently that I get a painful nerve pinch when I do calf raises on the top of my left foot. \n  \nThey discharged me and said it should get better but it has not been. I saw a neurologist and they ran EMG and a bunch of other tests and those came normal too. I do not know what to do or who to see but I am worried it will be too late if I wait any longer and idk what they could even do for me.   \n  \nI doubt they will do surgery if they cannot confirm on a test and I do not want surgery if it happens to be something else.", "Back popping forward Hi there, I am reaching out because I am wondering if any of you have had the sensation of your back popping *forward*. I had an L5-S1 herniation 2.5 years ago with temporary paralysis in the right foot. My back has since been for the most part good and healed on its own. However, about 1 year post-herniation my back began hurting until I leaned *forward* to pop it\u2014 it felt like it would if you pulled your finger directly out from the socket. This would relieve the pain immediately. \n\nThis past week my lower back has been hurting in the L5-S1 area, and I have been feeling tingling on both sides of my back, fingers, and feet. I am supposed to go overseas in two weeks to a developing country and am thinking the worst\u2014 what if it is CES and I cannot get emergency surgery? It is very distressing because I live for surfing, so paralysis represents the worst possible quality of life scenario. \n\nAll this to say I am wondering if anyone has had the experience of the spine popping forward rather than backward, (or any other early symptoms that I should probably look out for.) I googled it and nothing. \n\nThanks.", "Shocks 21 years ces survivor.  Have not had shocks in months but sure getting excruciating pain now from shocks in my hamstrings. I usually do not complain but in between shocks I am thinking WTF 68 years old and still dealing with this BS. I will be alright just needed to rant", "My Journey with Cauda Equina Syndrome so far - Injury to 4 months post OP I just wanted to share my story as I do not really know of another place to go to share it but first I want to get a few things out of the way. \n\n1) If you think you have CES get help. Waiting is my biggest regret. I should have sought help months before I did and I might not be where I am today if I had. \n\n2) This is going to be somewhat graphic. I will try to use humor as I would rather laugh about it now as I have shed far to many tears over this damned thing. \n\n3) This bitch is long and there is no way a TLDR is going to do it justice. I am writing this just as much for me as for anyone else who may be interested in reading my story as I have enjoyed reading others, so strap in. \n\n\nIn October of 2020 I sought the care of an orthopedic about a change in sensation in my leg. I had noticed and ignored weakness and tingling below my knee for what had to have been a month or two but did not think to go to a doctor until I began noticing that I could not feel my leg below my right knee. The ortho evaluated me and ordered an MRI. My MRI showed  herniations between L3L4 and L4L5. The L3 herniation was the only one that was of concern to him and scheduled a steroid injection. He felt confident that due to my age (22M) there was a good chance 1 to 2 injections could clear this up, although I would need to loose weight to better my odds (I am obese however happy to report that is rapidly changing since surgery, something I should have done years ago) \nAs he leaves he tells me what I am sure he does every lumbar patient \u201cIf at any point you loose bladder or bowel control go to the ER immediately\u201d. \n\nIn the next month I would notice myself deteriorating. I work in warehouses and my role had me walking the floor all day, something I could have done and did with ease 6 months prior despite my size but was getting harder day by day. My leg would start shaking and occasionally give out. Thankfully I am relatively alone as I work in inventory and so no one was there to see. I felt ashamed of myself, like I was just being weak or a bitch and so powered through. It got so bad I had to push around a cart for support, stopping frequently due to pain. I had to make excuses to have others lift things for me which slowed my productivity. I thought all would be fine after my injection. \n\nIt is now the begging of December, I took the week off of work for my injection. By this point driving was my worst nightmare. I had to constantly check my foot to make sure it was on the correct pedal and more than once I hit the brakes when I meant to hit the gas or vice versa. To this day I do not know how I did not kill myself or someone else in an accident, but am forever thankful I did not. I had family drive across the country to take me to the injection and just help me in the following days. I felt some relief but it faded, but against my better judgment I sent my mother home. \n\nThe next week, on Friday December 11th I step out of the shower and walk to my laundry room to get clothes out of the dryer to begin getting ready for work. As I am carrying the basket of laundry through my house I feel an awful sensation in my back and my bowel evacuates on the bathroom floor and I collapse. No warning, no change in sensation, just shit. My only reaction was to begin scream crying. I knew exactly what happened, why, and what it meant. I call my parents as in that moment I did not know what else to do. They are in the car and on their way before I am done explaining what just happened. Next I call my doctor to find out what hospital I can go to that my Orthopedic can operate on me as I knew I would want someone familiar with my case to handle my care. I call a family friend to take me to the hospital as while it was an emergency I did not think an Ambulance was necessary, and began cleaning. I got myself back into the shower and washed off, managed to get the bath rug which had caught everything in a trash bag and packed a bag to go the hospital. And wept. In that moment I knew the coarse of my life what changed although I did not know to the extent. \n\nThe family friend arrives and the first thing he does is hand me adult diapers to put on. The first of many embarrassments I would experience but certainly not the last, although I admired them thinking on their feet and get a good laugh about it now when I think about it. We talk and they calm me down as I was just about having a panic attack and we head to the ER. Upon arriving I am told I will have to go back by myself but that due to the pandemic there are no rooms available and so it is a cot in the hallway for me. By this point it is 8AM. I have not eaten since 6 the previous night. I would not be seen until 4 PM when a doctor came by, brought me into the trauma room as it was the only private area and proceeded to check my groin, legs and anus. I had not realized it until then but I could not feel my groin, I could not feel his thumb in my rear and my left leg had gone numb too. I still had motor control of my legs but I was walking like a drunk giraffe. He concludes what I feared, Cauda Equina. I am told I will be given a room and will be next in line for an MRI. I finally get to my room by 6 PM right as my family is arriving and am told I will be taken to another hospital via ambulance to get an MRI as the one they had did not accommodate my size (we tried, I do not know how skinny people fit in that damned thing it did not even fit my shoulders in) and that that ambulance would arrive within the hour. I was also told I would not be allowed to eat as I was expected to have surgery soon. Well my chariot with flashing lights would not arrive until 1 in the morning. I had stayed awake because \u201cit is only going to be an hour\u201d and honestly I was afraid if I slept I would shit the bed (not that if I was awake I could have stopped myself). I was taken to the other hospital and had some wonderful conversations with the paramedic in the back, just trying to connect with a stranger, maybe make them smile as it was clear they were having a shit day. I then wait till 6 AM December 12th for my MRI and during which I finally sleep, and boy was it glorious albeit short lived. I get back to my room at hospital number 2 and get a call from my surgeon. He is just seen the MRI and is giving me the preop briefing then, warning me that if I do not change my lifestyle after this surgery I will be under his knife again in a years time, and even if not there is still a 25% chance he sees me again. Turns out he was in a conference in DC and had taken the first flight back for my surgery. I would have felt like a rockstar upon hearing that had I then not noticed my bowels had voided again. \n\nI am rushed back to the original hospital where a surgical team is waiting for me. In the OR, before I am put under the surgeon is telling me that I will have a partial discectomy on L3-L4, that he is confident there is enough disc remaining that fusion would not be necessary, which was a big concern for me. I am also told that there is no guarantee that my nerves will come back, but we are still in the window where there is hope. \n\nI wake up in my room around 7 in the evening and immediately feel different. My back feels like someone is been rootin around in it for sure and there are all the pains associated with surgery but it does not hurt like it did. I started crying immediately. Bawling. To have a pain you do not realize the extent of disappear like that is incredible. The nurse started crying watching me and my mom jumped up to hug me. They have me up and walking and in that moment I realized the road to recovery ahead of me. I liken myself to a drunk toddler trying to run. Wobbly as a newborn deer and cursing in frustration with each step. Once I get back in bed after walking an exhausting 20 yards I am finally fed. \n\nIt is at this point that I must step aside and criticize myself to make a point. I love food. You do not get to my size without loving food, and I would like to think I have a decent pallet. What I was served was 3 hour old, cold hospital cafeteria sustenance. I was told it was either supposed to be or was at one point chicken Alfredo with garlic bread, but my god was that the best meal I have ever eaten. I was at that point 48 hours without food, had gone through the most traumatizing 48 hours in my life and was 100% ready to eat my feelings. Even the nurse was surprised at how I devoured it. I have had many cravings on my weight loss journey, pizza, ice cream, fried chicken. Nothing makes me salivate more than thinking about that damn chicken Alfredo. I was given some of the best drugs money can buy and slept easy and pain free for the first time in a while. \n\nThe next day I get a far better breakfast and am told I will likely be discharged if all goes well in the next few hours. I am issued a walker, which I dubbed \u201cTexas Ranger\u201d as that is the kind of stupid jokes I find hilarious and speak with my surgeon post op. I am told he will see me in a few weeks to evaluate my progress but even then he says words I struggle with every day \u201cWe will not know to what extent your nerves will come back until about a year post op, if some come back at all\u201d. After that I am discharged and my road to recovery begins. \n\nThe first thing I have to get used to is having my parents in my home. I have lived on my own for a few years and love the privacy that came with it. I lost my sexual function so *that* kind of privacy was not the thing I was concerned about, but rather just being alone. But my lack of privacy became clear the first time I had to use the bathroom. Thankfully after surgery I regained control of my bowels but things like wiping my ass, pulling my pants up, getting in and out of bed, yeah all that I needed help with. I cried every time from the shame of it and respect the hell out of my parents for doing it. It is one thing for mom and dad to say they would I if they had to, it is another for them to do it and never make you feel judged for it. I\n\n would begin walking as much as I could handle, which was not much and had to deal with the parade of friends coming to check on me. I always tried to smile about it and make light of it but seeing the heart break as they watched their friend shuffle about with a walker will be burned in my memory.  After my 1 month checkup my family determined it was too difficult for me to be so far from their home and so I packed up the essentials and my cat and moved back home to begin PT. PT was the most fun and least fun thing about this whole process. I have a physical therapist who likens himself a comedian/personal trainer and so takes special joy in kicking my ass and I am better off for it. After 2 months post op I began walking short distances with my walker and a month after that was without it entirely. I will bring it out every now and again for a \u201cThrowback Thursday\u201d to get a laugh out of my family but am happy to report Walker: Texas Ranger is serving dutifully as a coat rack. \n\nSensation wise I have regained some feeling in my left leg. Now it just tingles as though it is asleep, my right leg or my \u201cshitty leg\u201d as my family and I jokingly call it, is still numb. It feels like I can never really tell where it is in space and so run it into things often, thankfully I cannot feel it, although checking for cuts and bruises has become part of my routine. I am convinced at this point feeling in my right leg will never come back. It was numb for so long before the surgery that hoping it does feels helplessly optimistic to me. Sexual function returned with the saddle sensation and I would say feeling in my groin is normal, but different than it was before. \n\nI still do not drive and am unsure if I will again, at least not without hand controls. In my 3 month check up my surgeon said my nerve damage is definitely severe but the amount I have recovered so far is exceptional and I should consider myself on of the luckily ones, but I do not feel like it. \n\nThe biggest thing for me through all this has been the mental struggle. I always felt pride about things like having a good job, my own place, a nice car and just being out there making it and that was all ripped from me. I cannot work or drive, I had to get rid of my place as it was eating a hole in my savings, I am back at home with my parents, and now I am going to have to sell what is my dream vehicle because what use is something you cannot drive. I am in therapy each week and have been working through it but each day I wake up hoping this is all some weird dream. I have hit points where I have hated my family because they can walk without thinking about it but am now in the stage where I am wanting to make the most to it, but it is not easy. I have began doing things I never had time for before, things I am passionate about and am excited to do them. I am also of course working on physical health as well as mental, and while going for a run is not really an option for me I am still able to watch what I eat and how much and in doing so am down over 50lbs since surgery.  I am excited and terrified to see what the next 4 months hold for me and even if I never get the feelings I have lost I think I am ready for it, but ultimately feel I will come out the other side stronger for it. \n\nI lied, here is a TLDR\n\nTLDR: Bad back but shit I am trying. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions no matter how personal, I will answer them to the extent I am comfortable! \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

I cannit fathom what you went through in your experience. It is horrifying and for it to happen at such a young age (not that I am old yet).\n\nYou are brave writing it all out there not just for the world but yourself too.\n\nThank you so very much for sharing.\n\nWelcome to our little community. My CES surgery was last September, I am 32. I spent that week in the hospital by myself and my mom spent it in the parking lot staring at the window to my room. It was the loneliest feeling ever. \n\nOP, you sound like you are doing awesome. At 4 months I was still using my walker. My \u201cshitty leg\u201d has not regained much feeling either but I have learned to adjust my walking so I am able to walk unaided at home (I still use a cane in public). At only four months post op you have a lot to be hopeful for still. I am sorry this happened to you so young. I am 14yrs in. Do the best you can and try to relax with the fact that certain parts of life are finished for ever. \nAcceptance is a gift ! 32y/o CES surgery x 2 April 2020 and again in Oct 2020. Sorry you are going through this also:( long road It is and every time I accept another part of this I feel better about it, it is just getting myself to that point is the hard part sometimes. I think that is something I am very worried about it having it again. I got to see the amount of disc removed and I am always worried that the removal of that disc will put more pressure on the other one that bulging. I do not know if have it in me to go another round with this.  I hope you are recovering well! I was very excited to find this subreddit. I have lurked for months, wanting to share but never taking the time or mustering up the gumption to. The lurking was the big reason for the disclaimer. I see so many people asking \u201cis this CES\u201d and that is scary to me. As much as I know I should not I often wonder how I may have avoided it if I had just gone to the doctor when I first noticed issues and I do not want others to make that mistake as well. As much as I am cautious to be thankful for it and as cheesy as it sounds CES has provided me some opportunities I otherwise would not have had. Living back at home has allowed me to build a relationship with my parents I neglected to as a teen and the weight loss is adding years to my life with each pound I loose. It is me trying to make the most of it for sure but I am feeling less destroyed by this week by week. I am about to sound cheesy too but you are really inspiring. I have kind of been sent down a spiral of grief for my old life. I had no time to mentally prepare myself for the surgery. I went to the Er for pain and urine retention and did not leave for a week. I had a really hard time with my legs after surgery, I had NO clue what I was in for.\n\nBut I love that you took the experience and made it positive. I think it is time I do the same. I really appreciate you sharing your story, I read every word and I never read posts this long unless it is a Wandavision theory. Get out there and get it, I believe in you! Same to you! You are going to do great with your recovery. Just being where you are at 4 months post op is awesome! I am 6.5 months out, but it feels like it is been an eternity! Today was my first day out in public without the walker or the cane. It was tough, not going to lie. I almost ate shit getting up out of a chair, but I did it! I am going to let your story live rent free in my head and remind myself to be grateful I am not paralyzed, pooping and peeing my pants, never lost sexual function...so many things to be grateful for. An attitude adjustment is needed in my part. Thanks for sharing...this condition is rare and I think it is important for us to talk about it.\n\nEdit: if I had an award I would give it to you. I refuse to spend money on Reddit so \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6 this is the best I can do lol I am 18 and I play football, I had taken some bad hits my last game I played but the pain went away. A couple of days later I am running during practice and I collapse on the field. I started to lose control of my left leg and needed help with walking Bc of the pain. The next day I start losing feeling in my left leg and my butt n my private area, I went to my sport doctor n then I went to the hospital. I come to learn I had ruptured a disc in my back. I had L4-L5 surgery n I got diagnosed with cauda equina. I am almost 2 weeks post surgery and I am walking well with the walker, I was able to poop on my own and I am gaining feeling quick in my numb areas. I also have little to no back pain already. Life is going to be tough but so far I have made fast progress n hopefully I can recover within the next 6-12 months. I am not giving up on my dream on becoming a firefighter yet. I am blessed to be able to have the ability to walk n just be alive. At two weeks it was all I could do to struggle through my home walking to the bathroom and back made me need to take a nap so you are killing it. It sounds like you got the right mindset and it was caught fairly quickly which only increases odds of recovery. I will share my experience with setting timelines. I wanted to be back to work in 3 months. I fought like hell and when the day came and my doctor extended my out of work I was devastated. I had failed. Well some therapy later and I realized even if he had written me back I could not have done my job and that was not failure. Failure is giving up the fight. There will be instances where you will be frustrated with your recovery. Do not loose sight of the goal, I believe in you. Thank you for sharing all of this - just found this sub and did not realize anyone else had it young (I was not yet 30). I had it strike in 2013 and I promise - it gets better. A lot better. \n\nI was newly married and suddenly could not dress myself, do stairs, drive - you know the whole drill. I was extremely lucky and just about everything is as it should be. \n\nI am really glad your family is so supportive, what a gift that is! I relate to damn near all of your experience, I went into the ER 4/29/2020 not realizing I would be there for 18 days entirely alone (covid restrictions)- yet here I am over a year later still intermittent cathing and newly discovered herniated disc. I am so thankful to have found similar stories to lessen how alone this all can feel. \n\nI do have questions- what treatments or prescriptions do you take (if any) for your residual pain/nerve damage? I think due to my new disc issue could be why mine has amped up but I just cannot seem to get the pain and numbness under control. Hoping for any new suggestions that I can bring up to my doctors", "Question about Numbness/loss of sensation Hi all, looking for some insight/advice. So back in January my inner to rear thigh on right side went numb/anesthesia feeling. Mri showed a herniated disc at L4/5. I finally got a surgeon to take me seriously and will be getting a discectomy in a week. I also have partial ED that I believe is being caused by this as well. I believe I have some sort of CES but doctors/hospitals do not seem to think so. I never did lose function of bladder and bowels. \n\nThat being said the thing bothering me the most is the loss of sensation on my inner to rear thigh. It is been like this for months and I am afraid sensation will not come back even after surgery. Does anyone know or been through this? Are those nerves dead and not coming back? Has anyone experienced long term numbness and eventually regained? The ED does not even bother me as much as I know I could take meds for that. \n\nThanks in advance for any insight. &gt; . Does anyone know or been through this?\n\nMany of us who have experienced CES have indeed experienced this. \n\n&gt; Are those nerves dead and not coming back\n\nNever say never. I have heard about people who have recovered nerve sensation years after the damage was done. However, most doctors (at least where I live) will give you 18-24 month window for recovery.\n\nI have had long-term numbness in some areas that *have* improved. \n\nHave you been diagnosed with CES? Thanks.\n\nI have not been diagnosed with it officially but I have self diagnosed myself. Whenever I type in saddle anesthesia (albeit only on one side) CES comes up. Also the numb genital area seems to lead to that every time. I was diagnosed with CES almost a month ago now, ED, loss of sensation pretty much everywhere in my lower body, and prior to CES I had constant nerve pain shoot down my left leg. Following the laminectomy/discectomy at l4/l5, numbness has improved greatly in most areas except my feet and the nerve pain is gone. And like the other reply, I was told 18-24 months for it to heal or most likely will not improve. \nI would rather deal with a little numbness in my feet than paralysis or a catheter. I totally agree it could be worse. \n\nHow long did you deal with numbness before surgery? \n\nDid your ed improve after surgery? There is always hope. I was lucky and my 1.5 months of CES only had intermittent numbness. I am 2 years post-surgery and I barely have any leftover symptoms (at least none that impact my day to day life).\n\nThat being said, there is an FB group of CES survivors where the opposite is true.\n\nI wish you the best of luck with your surgery!!! 14 years in so far, sometimes nerves can still improve in my case this happened for about 18 months. Since then there has been no real improvement in the damaged areas. \nGet advice. Google is not your friend. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc I had onset of numbness and tingling about 3 days before my surgery. Before that it was just the stabbing nerve pain down my leg. My ED has gotten better, not fully improved but seems there is improvement each day. I hope you have been diagnosed either with or without since you posted this. CES is a medical emergency. The longer you suffer with CES the more the damage will be long term. I ruptured a disc in my back which caused constant, extreme pain down my legs and later that day turned into CES. The numbness was all around my groin area and bum. I went to hospital at around 8pm, had an MRI and they confirmed it was CES. I then went down for emergency surgery at about 8am the next day and by that point I could no longer walk more than 20 steps or control my bladder. As I was being prepped for surgery, I coughed and wet myself. My surgery was on 9th December 2019 and today I am waking around perfectly normally with normal bladder functions. I have also regained 99% sensitivity around my bum and my groin area is 100% normal.\n\nIf you are experiencing CES symptoms, you need to press the doctors to sort it ASAP. I was told that if I had waited another day, I would probably have been paralysed. I hope numbness/loss of sensation are the worst things that happen. For me, it is 'how is the left leg feeling today?' Sometimes it is numb. Sometimes it burns. Sometimes it feels like I am getting stabbed. All of these sensations are better than plain old pain, which also happens.  But through it all, the tops of both of my thighs are 'stick a pin in them' numb. \n\nTo be honest, your legs might never feel right again. They have some nerve medicine if you have nerve pain, but I do not know if they do anything for the chicken skin feeling or numbness.

Essentially a nerve malfunction rather than a bowel movement issue. Almost a hypersensitivity to any pressure in the rectum - making it more about how you psychologically deal with that discomfort to ignore it so you do not have to go to the bathroom every 30 minutes? So, take this with a grain of salt. I thought I had CES due to rectum/butt check discomfort &amp; frequent urination that turned out to be Prosititits Lol - I have diagnosed CES. However I will look into this as well as who knows what else is going wrong now.

It is still very sensitive and I have to idea how big the wound is yet.\nIt was interesting seeing the operating theatre before I was anaesthetised, and the curved bars I was going to be placed over.

My pain level went through the roof , I lost complete bladder control but it only happened once, and then there was A LOT of blood in my urine. When I got to the back in the ER I told them what was happening. The Nurse asked me what I wanted to be seen for, she was rude. I said the blood in my urine worries me the most, it was a lot of blood. Well they did a cat scan and there was a stone in my left kidney that was cutting my kidney. When the doctor came in to tell me that I asked him about me losing bladder control and he said that was probably from the herniated disc and went to walk out. I asked him if I could get something for pain he turned around and said I will give you a little something but you need to talk to your back doctor if you need anything else. He prescribed me tramadol which did not help. I called my back doctor first thing the next morning and let his nurse know what was happening and I told her I needed something for pain. 20 mins before they closed for a 4 day weekend she called and said she had the prescription ready, I live 45 minutes away. She said nothing about me losing bladder control. 2 days into this 4 day wait I am in misery all I can do is lay here in pain and I am totally dependent on others at this point. I want to go to the ER but I am afraid they wont do anything again. I do not want to just here and chance becoming paralyzed from this. The pain will ease up for an hour here and there. As far as the pain medicine goes I have had 2 1 week prescriptions in the last 5 years, I do not like taking them but I do when I have no choice. I was healthy up until Dec of 2019 when I had P.E.'s hit both lungs February 2020 first ever panic attack, April 2020 Necrotizing Fasciitis Appendectomy, and November 2020 COVID put me in ICU and left me disabled. I just do not know what to do at this point...", "At what point should I worry about CES? I should start by saying I tested positive for COVID 5 days before posting this, so rushing to the hospital has not really been an option.\n\nSo...back in September 2020, everything seemed fine with me. My sciatica pain was driving me crazy and I was attempting to live despite barely being able to walk. Eating regularly. Nothing unusual.\n\nWhen October 2020 rolled around...*something* happened to me. I cannot recall if it was something big, or the end result of numerous small things. But at some point, I felt major nausea and my bathroom habits were completely disrupted. It became harder to walk and I stopped eating entirely out of fear that digestive organs were shutting down. I was a given a CT scan where it was discovered I have a dessicated and bulging disc. Despite having sciatica and numerous pinched nerve injuries, this was the first time I have heard about a bulging disc. Then I had an MRI which revealed moderate fatty liver - but I think it was only a minor factor in my digestive issues.\n\nI was left with two primary issues - being unable to sit down because it created painful urges to urinate, and drastically disrupted bathroom habits. Sometimes, I could not go at all. I was under the impression I could help my disc damage by walking, so I did so, and for a while, it SEEMED to help my bathroom habits. But after my first week of walking, I reached a point where I could not walk at all, so I stopped.\n\nThrough November, my bathroom habits were all over the place. But since I was so afraid of eating, I wound up losing about 30 pounds. And slowly but surely, when I reached the middle of December, I seemed to improve. My bathroom habits were back to normal, I felt less sciatica pain, and I felt great. It was like a miracle occurred.\n\n...And then we get to January 4th. I have never felt much back pain, but by this point, I absolutely did, and I decided to go take a walk because I had not done so in a while and I thought I was getting sicker because of it. I went through my normal route, and my legs hurt worse than they ever have. I had to stop and turn around. From there, it was like my legs did not heal, and my bathroom habits became as bad as they were when my issues first started. Urination was OK for a while, but then it diminshed. Even when the amount seemed normal, the stream was always weak.\n\nAnd now today. I felt a strong urge to urinate, which seemed odd since it came from out of nowhere. It felt like I had to fight it back. I went to the bathroom to deal with it, and almost nothing came out. And the best part - the urge did not go away after I was done. I figured something was wrong and started cleaning up...and then upon checking, it was as if something had leaked out. Not enough to qualify as a stream, but enough to suggest that something slipped out without my input.\n\nReally terrified right now. I had a surgery evaluation planned for the sixth, but since I tested positive for COVID-19, it had to be rescheduled. And I think my disk issue has just gotten worse since then. But throughout all of this, I have been very vocal about my fears concerning cauda equina, and it did not seem to phase anyone I talked to. I got the impression that I would need to be unable to walk before they would think cauda equina was a problem. And I can still walk, but my legs have felt consistently numb lately. It just seems like I am closer than ever to CES, but I have no way of confirming it since I am still in quarantine. First, I am sorry I have not been active here recently. \n\nSecondly, I am even more sympathetic to you due to Covid and CES being a medical emergency.\n\nIf there is any way at all that you can speak to a doctor please do so. They may have to find a way to do an evaluation given CES being a medical emergency.\n\nI hope things are on the improve both with your Covid and CES symptoms. Good luck!", "Rhizotomy denied :( I have been trying to get the first of two facet blocks I can get a rhizotomy. I had my surgery a year ago almost but the type of pain I am experiencing right now is not due my cauda equina, it is in a different part of my spine!!!\n\nThe doctor appealed severest times and exhausted his options. I am on the phone now on hold waiting to talk to some after being told \u201cthis is not medically necessary - you just had surgery\u201d.\n\n\nOOP THE CALL JUST DROPP WHADAYA KNOW.\n\n\nI am so frustrated you all.", "Do not know if this is CES or if it is possible for me to have it with replaced discs I have two disc replacements, one in L5-S1 and L4-L5, and rods from scoliosis from T-2 to L-2. I have always had sciatica and severe low back pain, today I woke up and had pain in both buttocks all the way down both legs. At first I thought it was pulled muscles from stretching or something during my sleep, now I am not so sure. What made me worry about it was genital and anal numbness that comes and goes. I have control of my bladder and bowels, and I do not even know if it is possible to have cauda equina with disc replacements.  I have never had numbness in those areas before though. I know I will need an MRI but I do not think it is worth an ER bill to get one there, would it be ok to wait to call my doctor tomorrow morning? An ER bill is worth it to rule out emergency surgery. Cannot speak to the disc replacements, but my saddle anaesthesia would come and go too - eventually it went away entirely... But that just made it harder to fight for a diagnosis. I would definitely go to ER and emphasize the pain and numbness.", "Is A CT enough to rule out CES I have a small bulged disk in the l5 So and have been dealing with back pain and sciatica down my left leg for about 7 months. Recently i took some medicine and, along with pain numbness and some tingling in my left buttock, i heavenly really been able to defecate normally for almost a week. This made me worried about CES, so i went in to the ER where they took a CT. They basically said that they saw my sciatic nerve is inflamed but they ruled out CES (which I am really glad about). I am just wondering because I have seen several posts here about people getting misdiagnosed, is a CT not a reliable way to diagnose this kind of issue? I am going to try to get an MRI in like a week, but until then i can be fairly confident in the results the doctors told me, right? Thanks. I do not think so. At least not on it is own. Check this out: \n\n\n\nI bet that there are specific tests though (anal wink, bladder clearance, saddle parasthesia, etc). If you still suspect CES, I would take the ER report and go to an orthopedic surgeon/doctor and/or a neurologist to get a professional opinion! and to be clear with this: even an MRI alone may not rule it out. CES seems to be one of those things that needs both imaging to confirm nerve compression, AND confirmation of symptoms, either:\n\n1. acute (e.g.: you have the classic \"red-flag\" symptoms)\n2. or gradual (e.g.: over time, you notice loss of sensation in saddle area or you notice less urgency when you go to urinate despite the bladder being very full).\n\nand to drive the point home: get a professional opinion to be safe of mind. Even get a few opinions from different doctors if you are that worried! My CES was misdiagnosed for a couple of weeks until I went to emergency and had an MRI. That is when I got the ambulance ride to the spinal surgeon. Hopefully you get that MRI done, CES fucking sucks. I initially had x-rays and was given painkillers but when I went to emergency for the MRI they put me on fentanyl and told me no red flags would have come up from x-rays. I was kind of freaking out from different symptoms so i finally did go to the er and get an MRI. The doctor at the er saw it then a spine specialist saw it and both said that there is no sign of cauda equina (they did say it was good that i came in to check though). They also said that even the herniated disk i have was very small so should not be that major of an issue. I guess this was just a stress thing making me feel stuff? I am not sure, although i am following up with other specialists. At least for now seems like I am fine, i still think a little like \"what if they are wrong and did not see the beginning of CES in the MRI\" but i do not want to be that hypocndriac.. I thought a lot of my symptoms were stress related too but it got the the point where the pain in my lower back and legs was so bad that I did not realize I lost all feeling in my saddle area. One thing you could try if the specialists do not come up with a diagnosis is to see a physiotherapist and work on building your core muscles, lifting techniques, etc. It sounds really basic but my doctors told me it is something that in the long term might have prevented the diagnosis in the first place and it is the only reason I was able to return to work.", "At ER now Hi all. At the ER now waiting forever to get seen. \n\nI have been dealing with numbness in my left left since October 2020. It started with just numbness and tingling on the top left thigh and has slowly gotten worse which it down the back of my leg and sometimes my feet. I currently have a 4 mm nerve sheath tumor on my cauda equina nerve and spinal stenosis. \n\nA couple days ago I realized I would just randomly leak urine throughout the day, and my urge to want to pee has gone up tremendously throughout the months. Along with that I have a some numbness/burning/tingling in my groin / left upper left thigh so I came to the hospital. my back pain ranges from a 3-10 it really depends on what I am doing etc. \n\nI am really scared that they are not going to listen to me about what is going on and it could get worse fast. I am also new to Reddit, I do not know if I am doing this right but I feel so alone over the last 8 or so months that I needed someone to talk to Man, sounds rough\u2026 sending some positive vibes your way, hopefully the doctors can help. I am sorry. I know the feeling, because of covid I was in the hospital with no one and it was really emotionally draining dealing with it by myself. \n\nIf the doctors do not listen, make sure you stand up for yourself. It blows my mind how many times people have posted obvious symptoms and then say the doctors did not listen. I am so sorry.\n\nAlso welcome to Reddit! Send an update Such a crappy place for a tumor.  Sounds like the compression on the cauda equina from the tumor is causing your symptoms.  Using surgery to get rid of the tumor sounds dangerous because it may cause more damage to the nerves. Is it an option to undergo some type of chemo to shrink the tumor?  \n\nYou are not alone. I too have the numbness/burning/tingling. \n\nMy doctor recommended I have an epidural. Last week they injected steroids and numbing cream into my Lower Lumbar. It lowered the intensity of the symptoms.  The steroids are supposed to bring the swelling down. You could ask your Dr. if its an option. Mine said its more of a band aid while we try to figure it out, but I will take it. \n\n The damage is not only physical. I recommend talking to a professional about the mental crap its been putting you through.  Good luck.", "Misdiagnosed All of these posts are great for me because I am on the potty pot right now.

Discharged without an MRI, advised to get one if it got worse,  a couple of days of that 10/10 pain and on my birthday it jumped to 15/10 pain and I had emergency surgery asap after that.\n\nIt is medical negligence. Yes. The unexpected fact that you can go from what you thought was a 10/10 to double the pain in one second. \ud83d\ude48\nKeep records of everything ! It took me 14 years to \u2019win\u2019 my court case. I was in an out of doctors offices and urgent care for months, no one would even take an X-ray.

That was April 30, 2021. I am currently in a rehab facility trying to learn to walk again and hoping I regain my feeling Holy shit, 14 years. What a battle.

I had numbness for a while in one leg and weakness as well as trouble balancing. I have also had tightness in my toes. I then just recently started to walk more flat footed. And over the past few days I have been urinating non stop. Problem is I have cerebral palsy from birth which already affects my walk and gives me issues with urinating too much or retention sometimes. I went to Nuero and he did tests of reflexes which are active and working ok.\n\nBut, weakness is there which he identified and a change in gait, usually I walk toe heel, now and walking more heel toe. Weird I know cause that is how normal people walk but it is not normal for me. I have low back pain near my Anus but no numbness as of it. Occasional tingling in legs as well. I am currently waiting for insurance to approve MRI but I am wondering if you guys think it could be CES and if I should just go to ER because symptoms have changed ect. \n\nI have anxiety so I do not know if I am just freaking out or if it warrants immediate mri.\n\nOpinions are appreciated What you are experiencing is different to me. I had numbness accompanied by an inability to urinate and defacate. My bladder was holding about a liter when it is supposed to carry half that and I could not relieve myself.\n\nHowever, if you are concerned I would get it checked out. You know your own body better than anyone and if it is different then that is a cause for concern even if it is not CES. Thanks friend MRI was scheduled today Good luck My CES was the result of an accident/injury as well. However, due to your issues with bladder and gait because of your CP, I am not sure that I can give you any answers that will help. The MRI is what will give you the necessary diagnosis. If it helps, I was in extreme pain and went to the ER for that. While in the ER I tried to stand up and could not, tried to urinate and could not, then lost all feeling in my saddle region. They gave me an MRI immediately after that. \n\nI see that you have your MRI scheduled. Good luck and feel free to check back even if it is just for moral support! I am late to this ball game, but I hope your MRI went well!\n\nMy CES presented differently than most people too. It was a gradual onset. My saddle numbness only lasted a week, and only happened when walking. Otherwise my main symptoms were extreme pain when moving, and severe weakness in my toes. I had a normal MRI, so I guess that means no CES right?", "CES International Conference  Anyone know if there will be a 2022 forum?", "Zoom Support Groups for Cauda Equina or SCI? I had surgery in mid December so I am about 4 months into my recovery, two of which I spent in hospital and a rehab facility and two that I have been back at home. I am finding that I would really like to get connected to some kind of support group for Cauda Equina specifically or even just SCI in general. \n\nFor the first couple months I did a really good job staying positive and taking it one day at a time, but I have struggled with some depression more recently, and have also just been coming to terms with the fact that this is going to be a long term condition and the future is very uncertain.

They have been responsive but intake nurses gave me some attitude when I said the Dr sent me here and recommended an MRI. (They have a machine but it is \u2018only for emergencies\u2019 and MRIs are usually scheduled through PCP w/insurance clearance). \n\nThey ordered urine sample and X-rays. Got out of X-ray and waiting for Dr now. This would only show bone injury, misalignment or disk issues, right? Everything I have read says to insist on an MRI. How do I do that? If they say I need a Drs referral, can an ER doc do that? Idk what the turnaround would be to get a referral and scan during Thanksgiving weekend \ud83d\ude44 Also for history: back and joint pain for years, sciatica off and on worse in last month which I have been trying to treat with exercise and stretching. Last week I overstretched and then started getting numbness and tingling in back, pelvis and legs. Harder to go to bathroom since then also but I am not incontinent and I can still pee. \nThis is an ER so I trust them to spot a true emergency I guess I am just worried if I have to get an MRI referral if it is safe to wait that long? I will talk to DR obvs. \nThanks in advance! After my MRI at the ER I went straight into surgery and they told me the x rays I had a couple of weeks earlier would not have shown anything. Hi, can I PM you later today? I was denied an MRI and now I am freaking out ok I did have CES and when it happened to me the pain was excruciating for 10 days as 3 of my nerves had been crushed up against my spinal cord due to a disc basically exploding into many fragments.  At day 9 I stopped being able to urinate (prior to that I was more often incontinent on and off), I was finally able to be seen by a Neurosurgeon on day 10 and was rushed into surgery.  Also found out I have a schwannoma on my Cauda Equina which is being monitored, but may require additional surgery in the future.  I had to literally fight for the 1st 10 days (3 hospital ER visits, of which 2 said it was just sciatica, on the 3rd ER visit I had to get into the doctors face and tell him that it was in no way sciatica and demanded and MRI, which he came running back once he got the read out and said I needed to see a Neurosurgeon, asap and was summarily discharged, it took me another 4 days to get into the Neurosurgeon).  Keep advocating for yourself, no one else will. They cannot see discs or anything vascular on and X-ray. You need an MRI. Immediately Thank you. Ugh, I hate that it is so much work for the patient when we are the ones that need care and do not have the expertise or resources of doctors. \n\nWhen did that happen? Did you have any permanent effects or did the surgery resolve it? \n\nI let them talk me out of an MRI and I was so upset with myself this morning. My symptoms are better today but I am pursuing an MRI, but will go back to the ER if it continues. I am just worried about permanent damage that could be avoided. My first time with CES, my insurance denied my MRI 4 times over the course of 8 weeks. Finally when I lost the ability to pee, I went to the ER and they forced the MRI. In at 9pm, surgery at 8am the next morning, out by 4pm. \n\nSome damage to my leg with function, but I was doing pretty good.\n\nInsurance then denied my surgery due to me not going to my PCP and getting a MRI. Eventually they changed there minds and I never heard from them again. I think it became obvious the process failed and if no one paid, blame was going to start getting pointed. \n\nNow, got CES again. Got my MRI last weekend, now waiting for the Neurosurgeon to confirm and set up surgery. This is following the same pattern as before, so I am feeling like it is a sure thing. \n\nI find it odd the ER is the side balking at the MRI. But X-ray will not show much with CES. MRI makes it relatively easy to spot. Thank you, gosh that sounds awful. Did the surgery fix the bladder issue? I let them talk me out of the ER with no MRI and I feel stupid and scared. Symptoms are better but still having tingling, numbness in back and neck, relying on laxatives. I am really scared I am having permanent damage and idk whether to go back to ER. I am actually thinking about how I do not have time for emergency surgery because of everything I have to do this week :/ wtf \n\nSorry you are going through it again, I hope this is the last time! So my bladder now works like a light switch, rather then a gas tank meter. I do not go to empty to full, I go light off to yup... Got To go. I will say, I am blessed I still can go and do not need any assistance or accidents. I felt after going thru my rough first time, it could have had pretty bad results. \n\nI have had horrible cramping, numbness, weakness, and general daily light pain from my bad leg since. \n\nI am hoping we are ahead on this second bout, if it is it.... But the pain is exactly the same as before... Nonstop, no days off.....so I would put money on it. \n\nSo, understand what ERs generally do. They make sure you do not die. Have you gone to your PCP and/or Neurosurgeon? My NS was the one who realized what it was, and was able to push everything else thru. You need to find the one person in the system who understands and grabs ahold. ERs are a hard starting point to make that happen IMO, even tho in my previous case, they handed my issue fantastic. \n\nI worked in the ER for years and it made me realize the difference between what ERs do and what people think they are for.\n\nGood luck on your journey.

I went to the ER in March due to a worsening of symptoms and was diagnosed with CES. My L1-L2 disc had prolapsed (some time ago, actually) was treated with a microdiscectomy. In the process of diagnosis, I also had a lumbar puncture, during which my opening pressure was low.\n\nAfter that surgery I first improved, and then slowly got much worse. I had severe pain in my low back and right leg, and violent muscle spasms that eventually progressed to span my entire trunk from the L1 level down and right leg down to the knee. I was also having terrible headaches and instances where I thought I might black out, which I attributed to the way my body deals with severe pain. I returned to the neurosurgeon who treated me for CES, who said the problem was lumbar spinal stenosis. I scheduled a L1-S1 laminectomy and had that surgery at the end of June.\n\nDuring that surgery, the neurosurgeon found an arachnoid diverticulum with a small CSF leak and repaired it. It was at L4, where a lumbar puncture is typically performed. The neurosurgeon proposed that it developed in part due to the low pressure. The stabbing pain in my back is gone, but I still have very severe (albeit more localized) spasms. \n\nThe right side of my low back and right hip were in terrible spasm after surgery. I was put on dexamethasone for general inflammation which alleviated the spasms. Once I tapered off, the spasms returned full force. I have done several short courses of steroids now and the spasms return every time. I also have fasciculations in my right leg from my hip to my knee. I saw the surgeon again today. He gave me a two week course of dexamethasone and diazepam, so these symptoms are controlled for two weeks at least.\n\nI have had spasticity for years and these spasms feel like spasticity, or at least some version of hypertonia. Those muscles are always far too tight, but they do not spasm as long as I am on a low/medium dose of steroids. 24mg methylprednisolone or 4mg dexamethasone daily seems to be the minimum dose that prevents spasm. These spasms are violent to the point that walking only a short distance is excruciating. I am taking 20mg of baclofen TID, btw. I have for years. That prevents the spasticity in my legs as always but does nothing for the new and more intense spasms I am experiencing.\n\nMy neurosurgeon says he has not seen this before. He is stumped and reaching out to colleagues for ideas. Anyone here have any idea what could be wrong? I am glad steroids are controlling it but that is a terrible long term solution. Without them I effectively cannot walk and I am quite concerned. I need to get back to my life at some point, ideally sooner rather than later. Thanks in advance for any input!\n\nBtw, MS has been ruled out a number of times, including in March. It is not MS. Is this from CES? Does anyone else have lingering or intense spasticity?\n\nCross posted to r/askdoctors. I cannot say that I have lingering spasticity except sometimes in the morning when I have slept weird. This sounds like something beyond CES unless you have done permanent damage to something. I might try a second opinion if your doctor cannot figure it out, especially since it sounds like you experienced a lot more in the spinal department than just CES.\n\nI am sorry if that is not very helpful. I do hope you feel better soon and can find an alternative solution to your pain beyond steroids. I have severe cramping in both legs, feet and occasionally lower back and ass. \n\nThis happens most often in the early morning 3am. \n\nThis started after my first op and persisted through my second op too. \n\nAlso if I make certain moves just a millimetre too much results in instant cramping. \n\nJust another joy of CES ( I am thirteen years in \ud83d\ude41 ) Are the muscles that cramp tight all the time? Is there any treatment you have tried that helps? Or any answers from doctors at all?\n\nIt sounds similar to what I am dealing with from your brief explanation. Once I go off steroids it progresses to span my entire trunk again in just a couple of days. I get effectively corseted in by my own muscles. They cramp so severely that those areas get red and hot. At that point I cannot even get to the toilet and I wish I had a catheter in again. Does any of that resemble what you have experienced?\n\nA millimeter's move in the wrong direction triggers them for me too. I am already moving strange just in an effort to avoid that terrible pain. The cramps are 95% early morning. Once I force/stretch the muscle back to \u2018normal\u2019 it stops. So no permanent one. \nIn the daytime something like bending my foot to put on a shoe, and going 1mm to far, is instant cramp. \nThe classic \u2018treatment\u2019 is magnesium/potassium or quinine. \nDid nothing in my case. \nSeems to be a result of nerves damaged at random: what a fun disease \ud83d\ude09\n\nI have recently drastically reduced my alcohol intake. That seems to have had a positive effect. Let us see what happens over time. Oh yes, I get that flavor of spasm too. Minerals and quinine did nothing for me either, but baclofen does help. And I can stretch them out, so at least I have recourse. I do not drink at all, not even socially. I bet that helps you in some regard. Alcohol triggered my nerve pain to worsen beyond words, and generally has a negative impact on any neurological problem. It does suck, since beer is delicious.\n\nThese more severe spasms are completely resistant to stretching, however. No matter how slowly and gently I try to ease them off, the stretching always makes them worse. I am still on steroids for now so I am ambulatory and all, but holy crap idk what to do. I was hoping this was some end product of CES with some set of solutions but that is seemingly less and less likely. Things keep changing, I find. Forget about \u2018cure\u2019 and treat whatever comes along.\nI am lucky in that I have good access to affordable medicine here. ( belgium )\nI will be going back to surgeon/pain clinic routine again.\nThis year a new problem came along : sacroiliac joint nerve root inflammation. Great fun, as painful as my initial disc is was just a day before lockdown which left me with no access to pain treatment... \ud83d\ude03\n\nNever take it personally.", "New shirt!

Lol - my first night back drinking after I got CES - can I get the shirt \"I am not falling down because I am drunk .. it is because I have cauda equina (it is just a coincidence  drunk)\"\n\n##gottawearthebrownpants# What if I am both?\n\nAll joking aside, I went to a Christmas beer fest after my back surgery and a cop came over to talk to me. Turns out when I stumbled off to go to the bathroom, he told another cop to keep an eye on me because I was \u201ctoo drunk\u201d. My wife overheard this and told him I just had CES and was not hammered. He chatted with me a bit when I got back and mid conversation says \u201cyou are right, this guy\u2019s not drunk\u201d which obviously confused me lol.", "just diagnosed w cauda equina... they are consulting the surgeon and planning my emergency surgery right now.. some support or personal experiences would really help me right now because i am absolutely terrified right now. my personal neurosurgeon is unavailable which is making it even more nerve-wracking... pls someone share your experience and help me calm down Hey, how you holding up? I totoally understand how scary and sudden CES can be. I ran three miles on a Saturday, herniated the disc that Monday, and was diagnosed with CES and had an emergency discectomy that Wednesday... Not going to lie, the first 3 months were a struggle but I found a good pt, follow the workout and stretching routine, and am relatively pain free! \n\nBest of luck, CES is not the end of the world, just a new chapter in your book... i am alright appareantly it was declared non emergent once a neurosurgeon looked at it... i am young and the herniations did not look big enough for an emergent procedure or even full cauda equina i guess just technically Please keep aware of any changes you feel. The smallest of issues may impact greater than you might suspect.", "Is this gradual CES? What to do? Do not know where to post this. For the past 8 years I would sciatica off and on. 3 years ago my urinary stream started weakening, and I have back pain/tightness sometimes. Also, my shins but most days. Sometimes when i have bad posture and sit incorrectly my saddle goes numb. My neurologist confirmed I have a compressed disk in my lower back...next steps? He advised PT but did not call my condition CES. Also, yesterday I tried to move something heavy and today my shins burned more and my saddle numbness came on more easily...should I think about ER? Go to the ER. Get the scans required. Better safe than sorry. If you do not have CES now then they may be able to explain to you what you are going through now and what you need to look out for, etc. Everyone is bodies are different.\n\nYour on and off sciatica sounds like what I experienced for about a decade before my back gave up the ghost. I would have it for a few weeks at a time and then it would suddenly go like it came (almost inexplicably) and I would be right for months at a time.\n\nThat you are experiencing weakening of your urinary stream and other symptoms is similar to my experience towards the end of my time prior to surgery. Thanks in there now Best of luck!", "My CES experience. I would characterize this as best possible outcome. I would been struggling with back pain in 2017. Well, lots earlier than that, off and on, but this was a bit that was not going away. I tried to grit my teeth and bear through it, but it got to the point where I could not sit, walk, and went to lay out on the bed for three or four days. Thankfully, was able to work remotely at the time, so my wife brought me my laptop, and I was just doing the work thing.\n\nIt was a Sunday, as I was the weekend coverage person for tech support. I remember laying on my belly in bed, typing away...when suddenly I realized that my back did not hurt at all. Like NOTHING. I would had constant pain for maybe a month, so I was excited. I carefully got up to go get my wife, plopped my feet on the floor, and then promptly fell over. Wife heard, and come and got me. I would lost all the feeling from my knees to my hips. Checking, everything from my knees to my belly button was just gone. I could stand and walk, but it was like a baby deer, I could not balance. \n\nMy wife insisted we go to the emergency room. I wanted to wait it out and see if I got better. God bless my wife, she won. She went to get ready, and I went to the bathroom out of habit because I did not know when I would need to go, and that is where you put on the deodorant and brush your teeth. It turns out I did need to go, even though I did not think so. The scariest part of this whole experience was trying to clean myself after the bathroom, because I could not feel my butt, at all. \n\nWife got me in the car with help from my kids, we got to the ER, they dropped me out in front so they could park. The ER folks knew I was having trouble standing up, and gave me a wheel chair. \n\nThey took me in on a Sunday...minimal staffing. They asked me my symptoms, and I told them I felt GREAT as far as my back went, but I was numb. They offered me pain meds, and I declined. They had to call the on call MRI person (which is rarely done on Sundays), who came in and gave me an MRI. When the results came back, they paged the whole surgical crew before they even discussed it with me. I got told I needed surgery RIGHT NOW and every second counted. Then they took 20 minutes making me and my wife sign things. \n\nI was in surgery inside 2 hours of hitting the ER. It was the first time I would ever been in surgery. They made me sign lots of papers saying 'hey you might die'. It was kind of scary. \n\nZonked out, woke up, huzzah, they say success, and I can feel all my dangly bits. \n\nON A SUNDAY. Every one of them was on call, none in the office. They were all there inside an hour. \n\nI got out with some nerve damage in my left leg. I have to be careful on stairs, or \"lol\" trying to run or something. The left leg has never been the same. I get inappropriate pain, and inappropriate sensations from my nerve endings there, sometimes the nerves in my leg freak out so bad it makes me cry out in pain. but overall, the on call crew that day saved me due to their prompt actions on 'on call' day. \n\nI got SO lucky. Oh man, that does sound like the best outcome! I am glad all went well\u2026 How long after your surgery did you regain feeling and function? Most of it was immediate. They did a double discectomy, so took out some bone, and two pieces of two discs. Where they were pressing on my spine nerve was the problem. The thing is if you leave it too long it can be permanent. \n\nMy left leg/foot came out substantually weaker than my right. I had to do maybe 2 months of Physical Therapy. \n\nMy left leg is now slower and stupider than my right. I have to remember to pick my foot up high going on stairs, and sometimes I limp when I am tired. The only places that I lost sensation likely for good are the tops of both thighs. I also get sciatica and strange pain in the left leg, but given all possible outcomes I was very lucky. That is awesome. It took me over a year to get to where you are. My S1 muscle chain on my left leg is not responsive but I have heard of people regaining feeling/function 5 years after surgery so I am still hopeful. Good luck sir. I did get surgery inside of 8 hours or so of initial onset of symptoms, so I was very, very lucky. This sounds similar to my experience- on call staff and all lol. I just had mine Monday morning. I have been trying to find info on people having experience during recovery with the nerves causing horrible pain- I am assuming it is the nerves trying to \u201cwake up?\u201d Yes. Stabbing/biting/burning/cramping Oh yes. The nerves are all like 'what is this? Feeling? Let us try every comprehensible variety of pain.' It gets better some, and there is medicine if it still bothers you after a couple months and you have done all your PT and stuff.", "Possible Cauda Equina Syndrome Been having urinary issues, having difficulty urinating, especially after siting in a char at work.

Our ER is overrun with covid apparently, so I had to wait 7 hours to be called back. Saw the doctor for all of 30 seconds, she did not even listen to me. Sent me for only an X-ray and then sent me home when she said my bones looked ok. \n\nI have saddle numbness, I cannot seem to pass gas easily. Going to the bathroom both ways feels different and weaker and like I have to push with my stomach to get it all out. I do not have any pain or weakness. Today I am leaking a few drops of urine throughout the day. \n\nI feel defeated already, because what am I going to do? Waste half a day at the ER again? And today the bladder issues are slightly worse so my hope is deteriorating. I am so sorry to hear this. My only suggestion (and one you know) is to go to ER again, and again. Or alternatively find a neurosurgeon specialist that you can get in to see. Myself and likely many on here cannot understate how quickly things can go wrong, and permanently stay that way. I was in hospital (for severe pain) already when I had the final nerve compression that caused my CES, and still took two days for an op. I am not advocating for the presentation. If symptoms that are not there - but as soon as my bladder kept letting go on their floor, they acted a bit quicker. You have my best wishes. Thank you. How are you now? I did end up getting an MRI and they said it showed no signs of cauda equina damage or compression. I cannot seem to find any other thing online that would present as saddle numbness/slight incontinence? All the best. Can you go to an urgent care instead? Get your vitals done.  They cannot aspirate your bladder if you have zero ability to pass urine, but they can evaluate you longer than 30 seconds, and refer you.   \n\n\nDoes any position help you feel more sensation? I ended up driving to the next town and went to their ER the next day, the doctor suspected cauda equina and they gave me spinal and brain MRIs but found nothing unusual. I also had post void bladder ultrasound and blood work which all came back within normal range. Still have the saddle numbness, urine leaking and leg weakish legs. referred me to a neurologist but I cannot get in until December. \nNo position makes it better but I notice lying on my left side seems to make jt worse.", "Crazy symptoms and possible ces God, this is going to be a long one, and honestly since the past 2 weeks have been crazy,\nSo it all started on 10th October  Sunday just after midnight where I very slightly inserted a small iron stick for barely a second, felt apprehensive had removed it, ever since then I have been feeling my urinary tract be blocked near the tip ( fossa navicularis) and I have been dribbling while peeing,  then on Tuesday we spoke to the doc, who prescribed me antibiotic named bactrim, things got better on Wednesday, and I was passing urine a lot then. On Saturday the doc gave me steroid too for the inflammation that was causing the block flow, Then came Sunday, and everything was fine until I sat on the potty, and was peeing and pooing at the same time and after that passing urine became even more challenging. I got an erection the next Wednesday  and, after 30 min during the erection I started with severe pain, in my scrotum, which traveled to the rectum area feeling pressured, in fact soo much that I felt like pooping even tho I did not need to,  the pain subsided in an hour or so,  except slight tingling in veins on my penis and scrotum, since then I have been observing a gradual decrease in my urge of peeing, until about yesterday they were decently strong, and my pee stream was better.

I would say you do not have CES. Or possibly just confused about wahat CES is. In brief, CES is a type of spinal cord injury. Symptoms of which include saddle numbness and limited bladder and intestine function. I doubt you injured your spinal cord while \"inserting\". A Urologist would be the best doctor to get your issue treated effectively. Good luck Sorry Wish I could help you. I used a catheter for over a year but never had a problem like that I went today morning, and the doc laughed at me and said It is psychosomatic lol Well that is a positive outcome that there is no physical issue. Take care. Well, he diagnosed me without any tests mri or scans, just cuz I had a stricture he was dead sure that it is not any nerve damage, my symptoms are getting worse, and unfortunately I am dependent on my parents and whenever I bring up this issue about my lack of urge to go to the bathroom problems with bowels, bladder they do not take it seriously, it is got to the point where, they will get irritated whenever I bring up my worsening symptoms, so this shit is for life I really doubt it is psychosomatic, I am just hoping something worse and critical happens to me so that they take me seriously, ig the damage to my bladder and bowel are already done, there is no going back, along with my erections, I used to masturbate and enjoy my sexual urges a lot before\n\nIg it is just karma, some punishment in life that I need to bear, lol", "Possiblity of Cauda equina I have not been diagnosed with cauda equina but have many of the symptoms.  \n\n I have curved back, low back, buttocks, pelvis, perineum pain and tightness.  There is weakness in both legs, I can barely stand upright, walk properly and empty my bladder completely.  I need to urinate frequently but little comes out and incontinence, without noticing.  I have foot drop, can barely lift the front of my feet or plant feet properly.  It is difficult getting up from a chair after sitting for long periods or moving my back out of bed.  I can barely walk any distance without the pain increasing and my back and legs giving way.  Always need to urinate but takes long time to start.  Rarely able to leave the house.

The advice might be better \ud83d\ude09 Have been to neurologist.   Would x ray show stenosis? MRI scan with contrast agent. Nerves are soft tissue, stenosis is calcium based. Have had two mris.  Told they ruled it cauda equina even though I still have symptoms.  Said no central canal narrowing but mild right foranimal narrowing.   Both mris were without contrast.  Heard it is better for your body being without contrast. Do you have numbness in the saddle region? If there is still sensation, and you are able to feel when to urinate or have bowel movements, I do not think it is CES, especially if you have already had a few MRIs and it is been ruled out by doctors. There is such a thing as partial Cauda, but again best to consult the doctor to determine best option and whether a laminectomy is worth it to decompress the spine and ease the symptoms. Some numbness, tightness in saddle area and pressure.  Difficulty moving from seat.  Am able to feel when to urinate but can never finish, there is always more to come out.  Maybe not but love to know why I have these symptoms.  Could there be a possibility that my whole spine was not lying on it properly and did not see everything?

Also if I am on cardio bike at gym too long this can occur when I stand up. Back pain never really severe, just routinely feels still or inflamed.  Yoga temporarily helps as does working out.

I became more constipated. My left foot and calf has had some numbness and tingling in the past 6 months or so, but I attributed it to tight calves. I got super constipated and had an impaction so the doctor prescribed me laxatives and an enema if needed. I strained hard to get a stool out and almost instantly felt a sharp pain and numbness in the rectum. Like a marble was stuck in my butt, or a butt plug like I have seen here. Due to the leg symptoms, bowel changes, and anal numnbess I went to the ER. They did a urine retention ultrasound which was fine and an abdominal xray (for stool impaction). He also did a rectal examination and there were no internal or external hemorrhoids he could see. They did not have an MRI there and the doctor said he had no reason to refer me because he did not suspect Cauda Equina and said this is nothing to worry about. I asked him for an explanation of feeling like a marble was in my ass and my hole was numb. He said he did not feel anything. I still have these symptoms along with my feet falling asleep frequently and weakness in my legs. I am getting a lumbar MRI done at a cash-pay clinic tomorrow.

On a hike (carrying roughly 80 pounds of gear) we stopped for a break after 6 miles and when throwing my pack over my back I felt a pop in my lower back. Was able to finish the last 3 miles we had with some pain on right side of my back. Did not think much of it and continued to work out/train over the next couple of weeks and my pain began to worsen and began getting sciatica symptoms on my right side. (Pain in hip down to toes, down my butt, and shooting pains whenever I moved a certain way, tingling in toes and some loss sensation). Plus some urine leakage after peeing and sitting down. At this point pain level was a 7 so I went in to get it looked at. I was ordered an mri and 30 days rest and was instructed to go to ER if pain increased or symptoms increased. \n3 weeks later my mri results had returned and my pain began to decrease and there were no signs of incontinence. I was told nothing came back on mri and that it was probably a muscle strain. I believed the doctor and went on way to full duty but I did not continue to work out.\nI continued to have very mild symptoms until About a month  while going pick up my dog during a mandatory month quarantine at home I had what felt like a firecracker go off in lower back and all the severe symptoms came back with a vengeance. I was more or less bed ridden for 3 days and back and radicular pain with incontinence that included sudden urges, frequent urination and uncontrolled dribbling at random times and even noticed ED. This continued for the next two weeks. Well my pain subdued to it is usual 2-4 with very mild sciatic pain present  and decided to power on. \nFast forward 9 months of regular infantry work. My daily back pain has increased to 4-5 range and with flare ups around 7 usually related to strenuous activity. With flare ups incontinence issues would be present. \nAt this point I knew something was wrong so I requested MRI results and read that that I had a minimal diffuse disc bulge at l4-l5 and a posterior asymmetric Bulge more on right contacting the bilateral intrarenal recess s1 nerve sleeves. I was set to PCS just days later so I decided to go to doctor at new duty station. While on PCS leave i went to see a neurologist who performed an emg that was positive for l5-S1 nerve pressure. I was informed that an mri many times does not show pressure that inflammation can put on nerves when I am conjunction with a mild disc bulge. \nWell fast forward 2 more months and I see my provider who refers me to orthopedic clinic and to have more images done. In follow up with orthopedic I was told my disc bulge i had a central protrusion that Indents the thecal sac, however that these findings and back pain are \u201cnormal\u201d in the infantry and I could carry on at full duty status. They did refer me to a physical therapist and a pain management clinic. 6 weeks of physical therapy did not help and I had 2 epidural injections that also did not help. With physical therapy I had a reflare up of my incontinence that has been the worst it is been. Urgency and frequency is through the roof and on multiple occasions had to pee in a bottle In my car on short car rides and visibly peed a decent stream on myself while trying to run to bathroom In the mall and some ED again. Went to see provider again who referred me out to a urologist. After seeing urologist he said back pain was likely the cause of both ED and incontinence. He scheduled me with a follow up in 30 days and referred me back to orthopedics. \nOrtho pretty much had the same to say and declared that mri does not show that the urinary incontinence and ED was back related. \n\n\nMy daily pain is hovering around a 5 with frequent back flare ups into the 7 range,  with all sciatica pain, incontinence still occurring and seemingly getting worse. I worried if I have slow onset of Cauda Equina Syndrome or just nerve damage in general it could worsen. My  mental health is suffering as well from all this . I am just not what to do from here. Any advice would be welcome\n\nTLDR: Back pain,sciatica, urinary incontinence, military sucks and keeps saying nothing is wrong. How is the numbness, can you feel your sexual organs or ass at all? I lost all sensation there before the surgery and it was a big part of the diagnosis. I also lost feeling in my feet, toes and I could not make my toes curl. I could feel my legs and calves (because they were in constant pain). I still do not get the urge to urinate, even after drinking 10 beer I have to remind myself I should probably go. I stopped waking up with an erection a couple of weeks before my ER visit but I was working 12 hour days and doing 3-4 hours of paperwork afterwards and thought that was stress related. I would say mentioning the complete loss of sensation in certain areas was just as important as the pain in other areas when it came to the ER doctors decided to rush me into MRI and then surgery. Yeah I can feel them but sometimes my butt tingles and goes numb especially in certain sitting positions , but I have trouble curling my toes with extreme back flair ups. I know I do not have acute cauda equina but I am worried about slow onset Could be possible, for me it was normal back pain that I experienced once a year and treated by a few visits to the chiropractor that progressed to a pain level of 10 along with no sensation below the waist in most of my extremities that needed to be operated on before permanent paralysis became a factor. Not sure how I would have reacted had the symptoms appeared more slowly. I have lived with CES since 2007. \nStill numbness in 1 and a half legs \ud83d\ude09 erectile dysfunction, messed up bowels etc Reasonable pain levels mostly, control with tramadol and weed. \n\nI had a bad back , in the traditional sense, for years. Then a disc ruptured, stenosis etc so sudden onset in my case. \n\nSurely if you are in the army you have access to free medicine ?\n( comes in handy when people are shooting at ya \ud83d\ude01) \nCan you consult with a different neurologist for another opinion? \n\nThe caudal equina is a location: the syndrome part can be a varied mix of nastiness. Just depends on which nerve gets sliced. \n\nGood luck to you. I had surgery for CES 6 years ago and your symptoms are definitely spot on. I am not a doctor, but if I were in your shoes I would be opting for surgery ASAP. I waited and by the time I presented to the OR I could not even move or feel any part of my legs. My bladder had almost a liter in it and I could not feel a thing or void.  \n\n\nGet a copy of your MRIs and get a second opinion, and in the meantime, \\*be careful\\*", "Possible cauda equina ? So I have had a L5/S1 herniation since January and i am getting jt fixed in December (could not do it any sooner bc of school &amp; summer internships) but this past month i have started having bladder problems. I feel a constant urge to urinate even if there is not much to let out. \nA few weeks ago I went to the ER at a terrible hospital in the state where I go to school and they said it was not a UTI, and it probably was not cauda equina because I still have saddle area feeling and that I am not urinating on myself I just have urge frequency. Also should not be an STI because my partner is back in my home state and I have not had any new partners since getting to school.\n\nI am not able to see a urologist for another few weeks but I wanted to double check here to make sure I do not need to go to another emergency room. Urinating 20 times a day is ruining my life. Consider that diabetic crisis causes frequent urination. 20 times a day would tend to fit interstitial cystitis, but hopefully it is not that.  (With it, some foods can really irritate the bladder, like chocolate, caffeine, acidic food taken for UTIs like cranberry juice, etc.) \n\nIf you are female, ovarian cysts can weigh on bladder and make it feel like an UTI, but ER doctors should have done an ultrasound and caught that as a possiblity. \n\nSince you do have a herniated disc, I wish you could see a spine specialist prior to December just to be sure the bladder nerve is not being impinged on.  Do you have any stabilization help for that?", "Can anyone help me understand this? My story in the comments. ", "Surgery 10/30 Hellooo\n\nI am a 32 year old female. On September 29 I went into the ER with severe pain. I had avoided going because I know how they feel about people coming to the ER \u201cwahhh I am in pain\u201d looking for pills. Considering covid, I did not think about the hospital until I could not urinate. I had to PUSH it out, and then I could not even do that. I had emergency surgery on 9/30 and they basically did an entire discectomy on L5/S1. \n\nThe severe pain is gone. I can urinate. I have most of my sexual function (it is been a process...there is numbness involved but I am still able to...complete the process?)...ANYWAY I just wanted to include everything to give a full picture of where I am at. I am numb on my left side waist down completely. I cannot feel anything except pressure on it if someone squeezes my foot. \n\nI am 6 weeks out of surgery. The pain is minimal. I am terrified my feeling in my left foot is gone and I will not get it back. I do not care if everything else stays numb...I just want my foot so I can walk. I am only 32. I do not want a walker for the rest of my life. The surgeon said \u201cbe patient, sometimes it takes years\u201d. I am getting frustrated!!! Anyone else have a similar experience? I would love to hear your story if you want to tell it. I am trying to learn as much as I can and I will be honest, I am feeling pretty down these days. It is been a rough 6 weeks. If it is any help I had numbness in my right thigh and feet for months after surgery. Have you started Physical Therapy yet? When I started I could barely walk due to the numbness. PT said we had to \u201cretrain\u201d the nervous system to bypass the damaged nerves. 18 mo later I still have numbing episodes but can also run a few miles pain free now!\n\nTl;dr: be patient with your body, the healing process literally takes years. When the dr say it is ok to move try to stay active to teach your brain how to work with the change in your body... That is a huge help thank you. I had started to make progress but had a set back. I am starting to get myself back to where I was but this really is such slow process. \n\nI started PT almost immediately. The hospital tried but my legs were so weak and the pain was agonizing. I was in tears every time I had to stand up for more than a couple minutes. Every time I went to the bathroom they had to give dilaudid to get me to calm down. Now I am able to walk around for a certain amount of time. We created a path for me around the house so I can do \u201claps\u201d. I am doing the bed exercises the PT taught me and just trying to basically get around, but safely. \n\nHearing that you went months makes me feel SO much better. Like I said, I will take permanent numbness in my left side...just not my foot. I just want to walk without a walker or cane someday. If you do not mind me asking, how is your gait now that your this far post op? Do you use a cane or walker or are you walking on your own? Do you have a limp or anything? I know everyone is different, like I said in the original post I am just trying to learn and hear stories from real people. My neurosurgeon said that my injury was pretty severe and it is going to take time. The severe part has me worried...I am hoping we caught it in time. Anyway I am just blabbering and renting now. I do not have anyone that has been through it to talk to. It is been kind of traumatic for me. I was not expecting this at all when I went to the ER. It sounds like you have Cauda Equina syndrome. Did anyone talk to you about that? My son had it 2 1/2 years ago. He was paralyzed from the waist down initially, now walking without a cane. You are lucky you went to the hospital when you did. He was in PT 4x a week.  It is a lifesaver. There is a great Cauda Equina support group on Facebook. You will hear hundreds of stories there. Give it time. You have made a lot of progress already in just six weeks! I am just at 2 years post op. Definitely PT. I used a walker for the first eight months and my mobility continued to improve. My numbness is in groin and saddle area back of legs and parts of my feet. There are days were my numbness is more pronounced other times where it is not full numbness but altered sensations. Hang in there. If you are on Facebook there is some great groups-where I have learned so much and had wonderful support. PM if you want more info. I have a fake Facebook for games lol. I suppose I can use it for that, support would be nice. My mother is amazing and she has chronic pain and a hip replacement so she understands to a certain extent what I am going through. My boyfriend and friends absolutely do not get it. It gets lonely. Anyways. Browsing through this board (I do not know the Reddit term for it, I am not really an internet person lol) has given me comfort and the responses I am getting are giving me hope. I am happy I posted this and did not delete it. Thank you so much.\n\nI am doing the exercises the PT guy showed me. He is supposed to come back but we are waiting on insurance approval I guess. Fucking insurance. \n\nI showered this week standing up for the first time. It was difficult but so gratifying. I am getting better, little by little. And even though im numb and cannot really walk, I can say with absolute certainty that I am better off now than I was before the surgery. The pain I was in before this was caught was EXCRUCIATING. Yeah, they diagnosed with that right before the surgery. Presurgery I had intense pain in my thighs but also numbness. I know, intense pain and numbness do not really go together but it happened lol. I also had numbness in parts of my feet and the left side of my...uh...hooha? Not inside, but the lip. Sorry for being graphic. The pain was unbearable. I could not stand or walk. It was not the pain though that sent me to the hospital, it was the urine retention. Like I said, I figured going in for back pain was a fruitless endeavor. People saying they are in pain are typically not looked upon kindly, especially since were in the middle of a pandemic. \n\nAnyways, yes. I am SO happy I went to the hospital and they caught this. I had a catheter for 5 days but I am peeing fine now. The hospital kicked me out after a week even though I begged to stay. The nurse that came to my house was surprised they sent me home given the pain I was in. \n\nMy pain management doctor and my surgeon are treating me and making sure I am healing okay and doing the right things. I am a little disappointed in my pain doctor for not catching this because I told him about my saddle area numbness. I was not retaining urine until a couple days before I went to the ER. \n\nSorry for the long response...In summary: yeah they diagnosed me with CES and did the surgery to take the pressure off the nerve, we do not know yet how damaged the nerves got, I feel your pain (literally and figuratively)!\n\nAs the others have said, keep up with the physical therapy! Before my surgery, I lost strength in both sets of toes and had to walk with a cane. I had surgery on May 2019. I got strength back in my right toes within 2 months. My left toes started working in July this year! \n\nIt is been about 1.4 years since my surgery and I am still progressing. My left toes are still weak, but I am able to jog and I barely have a limp anymore. I also still have \"fuzzy\" sensations in the left foot, but I will take those over the limp any day. (And I know it sounds ridiculous to whine about weak toes, but you do not realize how important they are for walking and balance till they stop working!)\n\nMy PT says that the worse your Cauda Equina compression is, and the longer it is compressed can determine how long it takes for the nerves to heal. Just keep blasting those neurons to trigger your brain to form new pathways! The toes! I totally get what you are saying. The toes in my left foot are numb as all hell...my right foot is numb but the toes are not and it makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE. \n\nCongrats on your progression! It sounds like you are doing great and it is given me a lot more hope for myself hearing these stories from you guys! \n\nHow long the compression was going on is undetermined however I have had an MRI once a year so it was less than a year. That is all I know. The urine retention started 2 days before ER visit, the saddle numbness was going on about 5 months maybe? It would come when standing and go when I sat down or laid down, but for a few weeks before the surgery the numbness would not go away with rest. The pain was coming and going but was really bad for about 4 months. I was nearly bedridden. At first my family thought I was playing it up so I could have people do stuff for me (my family is really traditional Italian just deal with it and push through the pain). Eventually my mother realized how real the pain was and begged me to go to the hospital. Finally agreed when the urine retention began...I hope and pray we caught it in time.\n\nAnyways. I am really grateful for everyone is posts. I am going to continue with the PT. My surgeon is going to order more, and we will try to get insurance to cover it but if they will not I will probably just pay out of pocket. This is too important (back surgery and the recovery from it is no joke) and everyone is advising PT. I got really lucky. The surgeon on call when I went to the ER is great. I like him a lot. He is pushing for more PT with Florida Blue. Insurance is such a pain in the butt. We already have enough pain in our asses literally we do not need it from them lol\n\nEdit: I am sorry this is so long. I am verbose. I cannot help it. I always give more information than needed lol Btw, I hope your son is well. I feel for him and anyone else dealing with CES. It is been a very difficult and trying 6 weeks for me since my diagnosis. I am sending positive vibes to him and you! I am a 34 y/o female who had surgery in August. I thought for a second I was reading my own post! I started PT 4x a week now and noticed that my ability to walk has gotten better. Ive moved on from a walker to a walking stick and only use that if I am going outside of my home. I have  gained sensation back on the outside of my legs but my groin and privates (outside) are still numb.\n\nI was almost a month with severe leg pain that started at my glutes and radiated all the way down to my toes. It was like a 24 hr / 7 day a week charlie horse. That Is that best way I could explain the pain. The surgeon said my spinal canal was very compressed so he said it will take some time. I go back in March for a follow up and hope by then my legs have gotten stronger. I used to have really strong dancer legs and calves that are now basically like jelly. :( Because of that I have really bad knee pain. I also have no muscle movement in my toes which affects my balance also. PT should help with nerve regeneration. I just want the saddle numbness to go away!!! I am having a microdiscetomy (L4-L5) in the next two weeks...I am a powerlifter. I can feel my muscles turning to jelly but I can mentally deal with that. I just want my hoohah to have feeling again...every time I think about it, I cry. Has it gotten better for you? Yes very slowly I am beginning to feel the numbness going away, I base it off waxing or plucking the pubic hairs that grow before I COULD'NT feel a thing anywhere down there. But I am starting to feel around my pelvic bone and along the inner most part of my thigh and slowly feel it getting closer to my private. So yes there is hope, just takes time. I also learned that carbonated drinks really flare up nerve pain.  Just waiting for the day to say I feel everything again! keep me posted! 4 weeks post-Op and while I am still numb on the back of my leg, foot, and calf, my saddle area is considerably improved - not 100% but better. I keep getting frustrated at how slow things are healing but then I remember how bad it was! Hey guys! Currently going through the exact same thing as all of you. I was a power lifter as well. Herniated two disks. Have partial CES. Surgery this upcoming week. I am just worried about my lady bits getting back to normal. Have you all made any progress since this post? Is there hope? How is your urinary retention and everything? I am so scared \ud83d\ude2a Lady bits are mostly back to normal (thankfully!) and urinary retention is not a problem. I never used toys before but they helped with stimulation and getting those nerves to fire post surgery. Still numb from the knee down on my left side and right foot. I have been lifting again but suuuuuuper light. I am learning to try to love sets of 10 at 50% my old 1 rep max. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I dream about a 2 plate squat again but I am not sure I will get back there... Good luck and feel free to DM me with questions! Hey OP! I posted a bit lower in this thread to reply to another Redditor, but I wanted to see how this affected YOU. Currently going through the exact same thing that you did. I have two herniated disks with partial CES. Pain/fullness/burning on the right side of the OUTSIDE of my lady bits. Some random infrequent tingles in other areas of my privates. Surgery this upcoming week. I am just worried about my bits getting back to normal. Have you made any progress since this post? Is there hope? I am so scared \ud83d\ude2a Thank you so much for the detailed and quick reply! This is encouraging to hear in an otherwise scary and unpredictable situation when you are really not sure what your outcome will be. I will definitely DM you with any other questions. I am glad that you are on the road to recovery! \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79 Hey :) I just recently had my one year surgiversary. My numbness in my last bits is still there but on the outside, I do have sexual function. I have pretty great control over my bladder, not as much over my bowels but I make it to the toilet about 90% of the time. My left side is numb from the waist down to my feet, my right side is too but not nearly as much. My feet are always freezing lol. I get pretty bad muscle cramps in my feet, toes, and calves. And I am in a lot pain (but I had a facet block that worked pretty decently so hopefully a rhizotomy can resolve some of this). That being said: I am very fortunate. I do not walk as well as I used to, but I walk! I think the swift movement of the ER staff and surgeon is the reason my recovery is as good as it was. It really sucks, but it could suck so much more.\n\nDo not be scared! It is what it is, and without the surgery you would be in a much worse place! You are going to do fine. I have not done it, but I have heard good things about pelvic floor therapy helping a lot with the lady bits part\u2026and sex therapists helping with the function part. I feel very lucky this has not been an issue but if it is for you, there are options! Recovery from this can take a super long time and it is important to not let yourself get too discouraged. My mental health has suffered quite a bit, so make sure you take care of that as well because as we all know\u2026that plays a part in not just sexual function but your overall recovery. \n\nEveryone is different when it comes to CES so do not compare your recovery to others too much but it can be helpful to get tips and tricks from other people who have it to help deal with life stuff that you never thought about before (like for me it is putting on pants and shoes).\n\nGood luck\u2026let me know how it goes :) Thank you so, so very much. You and Mac-n-cheez have made me feel way less alone. I have spent a long time stressing on this as I am sure you all did as well. I am glad that I found this thread today, a big virtual internet hug to both of you and I am SO GLAD you are doing better. Especially given what the outcome could have been. You have also given excellent advice if my outcome is not the same as yours. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c I am hoping I remember to come back in here and update in just a couple weeks! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb Lol! I did not have time to stress about it. The hospital was not very open with me about what it was and my surgery happened within hours of being told I need it. I almost WISH I had some time to prepare though (*almost*\u2026lol)! I would have been doing the same thing you are! \n\nJust be kind to yourself! And let me know if you have any other questions. \n\n( has helped me immensely, emotionally and physically and it is helped me navigate the past year. I made a Facebook just to join and I am so glad I did. The people there are kind and it is helped me understand wtf happened to my body.\n\nEdit: I was hoping my free award was the hug one so just pretend the silver is that one lol", "Pelvic pain? ", "Is this CES? I hurt my back almost a year ago while lifting some weights. It hurt quite badly the next couple days, but the pain subsided afterwards. \n\nAfter the injury my lower back only hurt in certain positions, but around 5 months ago the pain in my back disappeared and my my leg started hurting instead. So for about 5 months I have had this nerve pain all along my left leg when I position my back in those specific ways. Around the time the pain moved from my back to my leg, I also noticed that one of the toes on my left foot went almost completely numb, and it has been numb thereafter.\n \nI actually got my back checked out a while back when the only thing I had was lower back pain and he suspected a spinal disc herniation.\n\nThe thing is, for a couple days now I have noticed some slight bladder and bowel dysfunction. At first I thought my underwear was just damp from sweating, but yesterday I felt like I could not control my bowel at times and had a small amount of liquid leakage from my anal. In addition to that I have had the same sensation of something leaking during this day. Lately I have also had to go to the bathroom more often than I normally would and sometimes it feels like I really have to pee but nothing comes out.\n\nI have suspected sciatica, but I have been able to operate normally while avoiding positions that hurt, so I have not bothered to do anything about it. Now that these symptoms have appeared I definitely have to get it checked out, but I would just like to know what you think. Yeah, you need to go to the doctor. Do not wait. Tell them about the toe and bladder/bowel dysfunction. Nerves are finicky and when damaged they may not fully repair. Please, call your dr and make an appointment now. The bladder/bowel dysfunction is the warning sign of CES here. The left leg is signs of sciatica but may not have been CES at that point in time. Back injuries/compressions can deteriorate rapidly. Please get to the ER asap if you have not already. Ok, I booked an appointment a soon as I could. I will be talking to a doctor about it first thing in the morning on monday. \n\nDo you have any idea as for what to expect from the visit? Will they do an MRI or a CT scan on my back? I am glad you did. Probably an mri first. Hopefully it is nothing crazy and you can rehab in physical therapy. If they decide your case has progressed to the point where surgery is an option they will order a CT.\n\nWent though this a couple years ago so feel free to pop back in with questions.", "Does this sound like CES? MRI confirmed disc herniation from heavy squatting in 2012. Intermittent flare ups of back pain since then that went away on their own. Have been doing a lot of sitting at an office chair lately this last week. Back pain starts to come back, maybe 5/10 lower back right side pain. Yesterday I realize my right leg feels slightly more clumsy, and that feeling has persisted into today. It feels ever so slightly weaker. The back pain is gone thanks to prednisone, but I am nervous\u2026 what signs to look out for that would let me know that I am in danger of CES?", "UPDATE: I am now 24 hours post microdiscectomy and I honestly could not feel more relieved. Although I was never diagnosed with CES I believe I had slow onset CES. I was dealing with frequent urination and minor anal leakage for over two months which stopped IMMEDIATELY after the surgery. I am at home with my family recovering now but I cannot express how grateful I am that this is behind me. To anyone suffering through this I send you nothing but love and hope you can overcome this. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Random internet stranger is sending you love and support Just wanted to send out some love and support to all my fellow internet strangers dealing or strugging with CES in your daily lives. Hang in there good people, keep with the physio and therapy, push yourelf to improve different aspects of your life. Dig deep. Hold your chin up. Eat healthy. Get quality sleep. There is much love to experience out there for all of you if you look hard enough. Please be grateful for all the goodness in your lives and most importantly, be kind. Please reach out if you are strugging, it is taken me years to come to terms with it. We all have something pysically in common. Having CES isnt a choice, neither is it outcome of being a bad person. Take care of yourselves and your loved ones. All the best my friends. High 5! Thank you. I really needed this right now. I just read \"cauda equina syndrome suspected\" in the notes of a lumbar CT scan I had today.  The note was not written by the radiologist who interpreted the CT, but by the NP who who ordered the CT scan, after reviewing my X-ray report (not the images).  I know I need to just chill out until someone is able to look at all the evidence together, get a full history from me, etc.      \n\nFor the second time in a year, my PCP has suddenly vanished (quit? fired? joined the circus? I do not know), so I will have to start all over with a new person in mid-January (first available appointment).  Sort of an unfortunate time to be having the issues I have been having, and receiving technical reports (x-ray, CT) with no one to go over them with me.    \n\nAnyway, I really appreciate your thoughtful post, and your kind offer of support.  Please do not be offended when I say I hope NOT to become a member of this subreddit, ultimately...!    \n\nI do have a question, if anyone feels like answering:  I am curious about the path that brought people to the eventual diagnosis of CES.  What were the earliest symptoms, and how did they progress?  Were there other diagnoses that were considered and ruled out along the way?  And what findings or symptoms ultimately led your doctors to deciding you had CES? Fingers crossed you get some resolve to your issue. Long story short, I woke up from my 2nd lower back surgery with no bladder or bowel function, but they kept me so drugged up I didnt realise there was a real problem. It floored me. It took me few weeks into the recovery to realise that I had serious issues which were not improving. It was the urologist which diagnosed me after I went to see him over my inability to empty my bladder. He told me to start using a catheter to empty my bladder which honestly gave me such relief its changed my life. I have been to multiple other neurologists for opinions who have confirmed my CES, but none of them would consider any form of operation to correct it. The consensus was any further operations would in fact make it worse in my case. Good luck! We all do. Pass on the love. Oh wow. If you do not mind me asking, were the two lower back surgeries being done to relieve pressure on your cauda equina, and they did not work?  Or was the CES actually caused by the surgeries?  That must have been really difficult to come to realize that recovering from those surgeries was not going to include regaining full bladder control...    \n\nCould you tell that your bladder was not being fully emptied, or did the doctors determine that?  Because I guess I assume my bladder is empty after I go - but do I really know that?  Hmmm...  Thanks for the details.  And good luck to you, too! I dont mind at all. The CES was the result of the 2nd surgery. I injured my back at 19 years old. I ran out of talent while riding a quad bike and fell off a small cliff, the bike followed and landed ontop of me. The injury didnt rear its ugly head until much later in life. \n\nI didnt know that my bladder was still full after I tried to urinate. When I visisted the urologist, I urinated into a jug so they could measure the volume, then they inserted a catheter and measured the additional urine that came out. The difference was staggering. I was probably only emtying 10-20% on my own. He explained to me that over a long period of time the urine retetntion would make me sick due to the inability to flush out the toxins produced. Effectively you would slowly poison yourself without empying your bladder (in simple terms). The bladder is designed to expand and contract, if you dont empty the bladder, it will never get the oppertunity to heal. \n\nFirst option would be to visit a urologist. They will help you determine the size and type of catheter to use and show you how to do it. (That Is if you have medical aid ect)\n\nFow whatever reason you dont have access to a urologist, you could self-catherterise (its so easy) to see if there is anything left over after you urinate. They can be bought at any pharmacy and videos how to use them are found on YouTube. Very Important: Ensure you disinfect your hands every time you handle the catheter prior to insertion to ensure you dont get a UTI. \n\nI keep a few in a ziplock bag (with disinfectant) inside a pencil case which I carry with me. I keep them all over, laptop bag, car and office in case I ever them, I have got a back up.\n\nKeep us in the loop. Take care!", "\u2018Dancing molecules\u2019 successfully repair severe spinal cord injuries  Maybe some hope on the horizon of medical advances.", "How worried should I be? Hi all. I would so appreciate your advice. I have had many years of back trouble (am now 50) and have been very overweight a long time. I would had a lot of low back pain and compression type feeling when I sit, and also have EDS/hypermobility. I would noticed a feeling of needing a wee even though I had one ten minutes ago.\n\nA few months ago, after a lot of low back pain and sciatica, my left foot stopped working. I had limited movement and it felt numb (I would had neuropathy on both soles for 10 years). I worked hard with physios on zoom and removed crap from my diet. I felt better and my foot improved but still is a little fuzzy. \nThen my back went bang- I was in agony. Serious pain killers. It took weeks before I could stand up. MRI showed several disc bulges- one L4/5 pressing on stenosis. (Also arthritis in facet joints). Clearly the L4/5 pressing on stenosis area is causing the compression and messing with my left leg/foot.\nMy spine man is going to do me a caudal epidural (not holding out much hope for that) but I am living in fear of cauda equina. \nAll I can do is lie down on my side. Sitting is too painful so I cannot get any work done. I am also shielding. My bum is tingly and a bit numb- saddle area seems okay. Lower back feels like it is been hit by a bus. \nI would love to know your thoughts. Should I be worried? Should I insist on an operation to remove the disc away from the stenosis- it would probably be very risky at my current weight. \nThanks in advance.\nP.S have lost 3 stone so far. Just schedule surgery and get it over with. It is very dangerous to allow that type of nerve pain to continue. It is your body\u2019s way of trying to tell you something. True Cauda Equina will mean that one day you will not be able to pee/ or incontinent. Do not let it get to that point like I did. Just go see a neurosurgeon honestly. I have seen a spine surgeon but he is not willing to operate due to my weight. It is a massive worry as I am doing the best I can but have a lot to lose and cannot exercise. I have emailed him a list of my concerns and I hope he will get it next week. I was 100kg most of my life and recently dropped to 80kg. \nAt 100kg my surgeon did not have a problem operating.\nMy last operation in Oct 2019 was for stenosis removal again, I have had cauda equina since 2007. \nUp walking round the ward 10 hrs after op, home after five days. \n\nDo not wait.  Good luck. Thank you. I am 119kg. Working hard to get more off. I have not been diagnosed with cauda equina-  yet- but am nervous about doing nothing. You are already exhibiting signs of CES. Do something before it gets worse. This shit does not just go away...\nAn operation can contain the damage. \nAnd should you die on the table then it is problem solved! \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude48\nI have this condition due to my first op, carried out too late; after 23hrs of leg paralysis. I am thirteen years in now. \n\nYou get used to it \ud83d\ude33 The spine doctor says that since my saddle region is okay, I do not need to be worried yet.\n\nThey say go to accident and emergency in an ambulance if you get these symptoms \u2013 but surely by this point it is too late? I have two spinal surgeons looking at my MRI scans. They show various disk bulges, a recent Tear to the L5 S1 disc, arthritis of facet joints and spinal stenosis. The compression I feel when sitting is due to the L5 L4 disc pressing on the stenosis area, and now the torn disc as well. They seem to think that this is not in the area of cauda equina, Even though I had left foot drop a few months back and my foot still feels fuzzy. Then I can only wish you good luck. \n\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Sorry to hear that. Just stay hopeful and do the best you can then. I am about 350lbs. I am not sure what that is in kg but I know it is more that 119kg. They operated on me at the end of September after a trip to the ER. I had true cauda Equina though. I was retaining urine. Next step was incontinence. They operated the morning after they saw my MRI. I wish you luck and I feel your pain. I hope you are doing better. If not, I will say that you need to advocate for yourself and look for a doctor who will help you if this one will not. Doctors often refuse to diagnose or treat CES util it is too late and the patient has permanent nerve damage. They think it is so rare that it either is not happening or it will not happen. \n\nYour discs may not be pressing directly on your cauda equina, but they do not need to be doing that to cause dysfunction and injury. If you have ANY spinal cord compression causing such severe symptoms, I would think  it needs to be relieved. \n\nI have had two spinal surgeries. First was true CES (L5-S1). Later, I had a cervical disc that was compressing the spinal cord and causing CES-like symptoms. Both times, I had to demand care repeatedly before anyone would take me seriously. I got lucky the second time and \u2014 after months of begging my GP and various specialists for help \u2014 found a great surgeon who located the problem and took care of it. But when I had true CES, they waited well over 48 hours after diagnosis, and by the time they got around to surgery, the disc had shattered and pieces of it were lodged in the cauda equina. \n\nIf your doctors truly think loss of life is more likely than loss of mobility, then you have to take that into consideration, but they should have a frank discussion with you about risks and maximizing quality of life. \n\nTL;DR: You are right to be concerned. Get a second and third and fourth opinion if necessary. Do not let anyone but a reputable neurosurgeon cut you! Ask lots of questions. Do not be afraid to be a pain in the ass.\n\nETA: My second surgery was not an emergency and was booked at least a month ahead of time - so waiting is not necessarily bad, but if you have to wait, I would ask why they are sure it is safe to do so. Thanks for this- food for thought!", "Cauda Equina Syndrome: Resources Support Groups | Rick Janetzki  I have this awful syndrome.... It is been 5 years  since the surgery and I know the function that I have now is what it will be forever. While I am happy I am not wearing a diaper my vag is half numb and there is a small issue with leaking ... It has ruined my sex life and I have pushed my husband away totally. I cry when I do have sex and have severe anger issues about it. We are both 51 and have been together 20 years. It is taken 5 years to get to the point of sex maybe 2 or 3 times this last year.  I use to be multi orgasmic and our sex life was beautiful. Orgasms were always easy and I was never one of those girls who could not achieve lol... I LOVED sex! \n\nSide note... One of my breasts did not grow when puberty hit and I eventually got silicone implants that leaked after 10 years and I had them removed. So I have residual numbness there as well. Not to mention one is flat the other a b cup... I would not get more implants. So they remain disfigured and one of them does not work at all.... It never bothered me until now. This issue makes things worse. \n\nI have stopped feeling human... I feel nothing regarding sex works on my body. The feelings that come up for me during sex just make me cry afterwards. I feel my husband, who is quite healthy needs and deserves someone else. It would break my heart but it is already broken. I have given up and dug myself into a deep hole emotionally that I do not know what to do.\n\nI just do not want sex anymore... But I do miss it alot. And it is not fair to him. I tried faking it for a while but the numbness is more apparent during sex and the focus there just leads to anger and frustration for me. And orgasms are not the same and hard to come by or severely muted.... If that makes sense... \n\nHe says sex is not the only part of marriage and we have experienced way more than that in 20 yrs... And he is right... 4 kids and now 4 grandkids... Life IS more than sex but this is just too much. He says God made sure I had a ton of orgasms before so they would average out.  \nHe is a Saint, but I KNOW HE HAS TO MISS IT more than he is saying...we love eachother But I feel I am holding him back. \n\nI feel worthless and so so so much depression. It has stopped my life. I have stopped living. I sleep alot and have stopped caring for myself and feel stuck stuck STUCK.... I feel I am sabotaging my life at this point... Thanks for letting me say it sort of out loud. \n\nAny advice is appreciated.", "Need advice! So, here I am a 21 years old F diagnosed with 1 herniated disc( L4-L5, circumferential herniation but mostly on the left side)  and a protrusion (L5-S1) also mostly on my left side. I have deen dealing with sciatic pain since 2016 when I was really really in pain. My left leg hurt but no numbness, or extremely sharp pain or burning sensation. Only my left leg hurting. My doctor advised me to rest, take meds and start PT asap my pain was almost gone. I felt better and better with mild pain but I was off meds and all good. Recently I was really ok, no pain, until uni stuff kept me at my desk for longer than usual. Cherry on top: I started feeling like really mild symptoms of sciatica on my right side: a bit of pain in the leg and back. I have to admit that I neglected my posture and I sat for too long at my desk without breaks or stretching. I cannot sit for a long time in a chair.\nI am terrified now. I am really scared of CES even though I do not have symptoms. What bothers me is that the pain switched from the left leg to the right one. I do not have numbness in the saddle area or problems with the bladder/bowel. Just some really mild spasms like twice a day or idk strange sensation down there(idk how to explain it, maybe is just anxiety or something- it is like when you get that bad feeling and a wave passes you body i guess) \nMy MRI says nothing about CES, it says that there is no modification in the conus medullaris. What says tho is that there is no canal caliber modification exept L4-L5 area where the caliber is ~8/8. \nI am really scared... Software developer here that had an l4-l5 fusion due to CES. I feel compelled to say something because your symptoms match mine almost exactly. The plus side is you are doing what I wish I did by seeing a PT and staying in shape. I still have bad sciatica but doing the workouts/stretches/posture work the PT recommends makes most days pain free. The down side is like you, I may have a busy week, sit longer than usual, slack on my workouts and the sciatica/back pain comes back. \n\n\nMy advice, find a pt that works with athletes and tell them your goal. Then have them help you draft some short, medium, and long workouts. That way if you are busy maybe you just do a short workout. Or if you have been lazy for a few days crank out a medium or a long. Either way just make it part of your daily/weekly routine. Oh, and the first sign of tingles or numbness call your dr ASAP!\n\nBest of luck! How did your symptoms evolve pre-op? I am really scared and I am constantly searching for new symptoms and it kills me mentally. The docs I talked to till now and many other persons said that we can talk about surgery when the pain is excruciating or if i lose bowel/bladder control.  I do not know how much of a danger those discs are to you - and of course you should not have spinal surgery unless it is necessary - but if it will be necessary eventually, I see no benefit in waiting, as things can change very fast. I waited till the pain was excruciating  and now I have permanent nerve damage - all the classic CES symptoms. But I did not know anything about CES, so I did not know wtf was happening and neither did my doctors. You are in a great position to advocate for yourself, so I would get another opinion and ask why you should wait for surgery, especially if you are going to need it in the future (I had a neurosurgeon tell me 5 years ahead of time that I would need surgery some day, so evidently they are able to tell, at least sometimes). I do not really have excruciating pain, I have never had. When my pain was at its peak id say it was 6-7/ 10, and that was a long time ago. But just the pressure and the stress I have it makes everything worse. Thank you for your support! It helps a lot So I am in my 40s and have had back issues since a snowboarding accident in my teens. I had a bad herniation @ 29 y/o where I could not walk for 3 days and had to get a steroid and muscle relaxers. Though out my 30s I would have spasms that grew worse until 39 the same disc herniated again. A few nights after that my groin started going numb so I went to the hospital and they pulled the disc the next morning... post surgery still sucked. Walking was painful and the numbness would come and go. When I started pt (sports therapy) the therapist found where my posture was off and what muscles were weak and started giving me exercises. Now I am in the best shape I have been in since high school and the pain is managed by workouts, stretching, and sauna... if I could press rewind I would have visited a PT earlier. Thankfully, I have never experienced that pain level of not being able to walk or get steroids. My groin area has never been numb or something, nor my legs, never ever. I am just soo stressed about this situation maybe sometimes I just overthink it. I am glad you are better and better. Best wishes! Best of luck, hope you can find a good pt so you can feel good and not have to worry! Thank you soo soo much!! I hope it gets better", "Please help me - seeing a spine specialist tomorrow but not sure if my symptoms warrant an emergency visit. (23F) In July of 2021, I was diagnosed with pelvic floor dysfunction and clitordynia.

I received clitoral nerve injections of corticosteroid and lidocaine and did pelvic floor physical therapy. My symptoms began improving ... until this past weekend. \n\nThis past weekend I started having a flare of clitoral pain, lower back pain, and sciatica-like pain in my left leg.

Will update.", "Can anyone verify if my symptoms are likely CES? 38 male, 5'8 165lbs. Fit and active weight lifter for most of my life.\n\nI started working at a warehouse in March 2019. Between that time and December 2019, I estimate that I lifted likely 75,000 30-pound packages of drinks in that 9 months. Some packages had to go as high as around the 7ft mark above my head and onto a shelf  and others down to an empty pallet on the floor. December 2019, I started having autonomic dysfunction symptoms (\"Dysautonomia\") that no doctor or specialist could find a disease or condition to attribute it to. Rapid fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate by the second, shortness of breath, shakiness, trembling, adrenaline flushes, etc. Intermittent stomach pain, bladder pain, colon pain and lumbar pain. I have had them on and off ever since. \n\nIn November 2020, I hurt my back at work. Something happened while working. Stabbing lumbar pains that feel like a nerve is being crushed between vertebrae when I bend forward, backward, left or right. Trouble standing up straight and too much pain to stand up straight and walk at the same time most of the time. They sent me to a worker's comp panel doc. Nearly 2 months of physical therapy. Non-contrast lumbar MRI ordered after over a month. When the physical therapy failed to work, she discharged me saying there was nothing she could do for me. She sent a letter to my employer stating that my autonomic symptoms are the cause of my back pain. My personal doctor wrote a letter refuting the worker's comp doctor. He said that they needed to treat my back injury separately because simple autonomic issues do not cause back injuries or interfere with them healing. In the letter, it said to see my neurologist for treatment. I had seen him before and he looked at the MRI disc and documented Sciatica. At that time (late January or early February), I had it in just the right leg running down to the foot. Now it is in both legs even when just standing. When I told the worker's comp doc in person that he said that, she brushed it off. \n\nIt is now months later. I got a worker's comp lawyer in February. After discharging me with ongoing 10 pounds and under lifting restrictions and limited bending (which she played off in the letter to my employer was because of my autonomic symptoms for them to accommodate them), she also noted in her doctor's notes that I failed to attend pain management. I was never recommended to go at all. No documentation, no referral and she cut my benefits shortly after due to the letter to my employer. I had no idea that she wrote that in her notes until my attorney found out from the opposing counsel. Insurance adjuster wrote in email that I had the right to see a new treating doctor and then declined it 10 days later by controverting the case after I had picked another doctor. They have not paid a dime of worker's comp. Employer claimed indemnity. Insurance company claimed only partial responsibility. Now I am lightheaded 24/7, walk with an odd stagger-like wide stance gait, I am a bit off-balance, still have stabbing/pinching lumbar pain and having trouble walking and standing up straight at the same time. My bladder and bowels have  been increasingly malfunctioning over time with 24/7 pain and discomfort in bowels, bladder and stomach. All 3 hurt at the same time. My bladder and colon hurt so bad some nights that it feels like I am dying. Bladder and bowel malfunctions. Sometimes 3-4 days between a bowel movement and then soft stool all at once, indicating that it was not constipation due to hard stool. The intestines simply are not functioning properly. It feels like the pain is radiating from my lumbar through the middle of my body and into my colon/bladder and stomach. I told the worker's comp doc in person at a visit months ago and she said, \"That is because the nerves go around to the front.\"\n\nI cannot stand or walk over 5-10 minutes without my legs feeling like they are burning, tingling, muscles not working properly and sometimes certain odd feelings of numbness on the outside side of my legs. I have to sit down to urinate because it takes a number of tries. I am still not sure if it empties completely. When I go to sit down on the toilet, I usually spray myself with urine because I cannot hold it while sitting down. I can generally hold stool and urine for a certain amount of time, but it is a much stronger urge and hits with little warning. As soon as I sit on the toilet, my ears both start ringing and my heart starts pounding. After urinating, I will sometimes get very heavy aches in my bladder like the bladder itself feels extremely tired/fatigued. Burning bowel pain for hours after a bowel movement. Sometimes I feel really rough contractions in my intestines. Diarrhea on certain days with little ability to hold it for long. Leg weakness when walking...it just feels like I cannot control my legs as well.\n\nI have an upcoming spine doctor appointment days from now. Could I have CES of a progressive form?  Given my symptoms, would nerve damage have already started occurring? Would it be permanent or salvageable? I know that is technically hard to answer at this point.\n\n(  This album has 40 of the most clear images from my MRI.\n\nMRI translation: \"Mild-to-moderate degenerative spondylosis at L4-5 associated with Scheuermann's disease. The L4-5 disc space level demonstrates moderate degenerative spondylosis and narrowing of the disc with prominent Modic changes related to stress response. There is a bulging disc indenting the thecal sac across the midline. In addition there is a left lateral and left foraminal herniated disc protrusion and bone spur measuring 3 x 6mm in size touching the epidural space with minimal extension into the left neural foramen. The right foramen is normal. The L5-S1 disc space level demonstrates a small amount of fluid in the right facet joint. There is no evidence of herniated disc or spinal stenosis. The neural foramina are normal. Age of injury of all bony changes: Chronic. Age of injury of all herniated discs: Indeterminate\" \n\nI suspect that the spine doc may want his own MRI since it has been nearly 6 months after the injury. Would CES have shown up on the non-contrast MRI? No mention of it being checked in the translation. CES  is not one thing but can be many symptoms combined. Your mri report reads like mine, but I had other symptoms. \nIf you have access to a neurosurgeon then you have to trust the buggers! Ask what their experience is of CES.\nMy case happened all within 3 months. Culminating in 23 hours of agony and , unfortunately, 11years of courts and lawyers. \nGood luck. Keep records of EVERY interaction with medical people. What were your other symptoms?  Severe pain in left buttock, right hip and left quadriceps. I would already had two epidurals, with surgery being planned for the disc hernia a week later: two days before that the hernia popped again. Utter agony. Into hospital, left lying with partial paralysis for 23hrs. \nHad to learn to walk again , bowels and bladder fucked. Random damage below the lesion. That sounds miserable.\n\nOut of concern for having progressive CES, I have compared my MRI images with other known cases of Cauda Equina Syndrome. While it does not look quite as bad as theirs, it still seems to be pressing into the nerve considerable. Their examples are the left two and my most prominent and visible image is on the right. \n\n(\n\nMine looks to only be partial, but I definitely have a lot of bladder and bowel issues going on. I woke up at 4am this morning to burning bladder and bowel pain. Sometimes I feel some pretty violent muscle movements in the bowels, especially at night when lying down. \n\nI am not sure what is going on with my legs. My gait has changed considerably because of the way my back feels and it just feels like the muscles in the legs are not working right. I can still walk, but my stance has changed some. Intermittent tingling, burning down both legs when sleeping. Standing up for 5-10 minutes can make my leg muscles feel really tired.\n\nCould this be what they call Sciatic List or more so related to the CES, do you think? My doctor visit is in a couple of days finally, but it has been 6 months since the initial injury. I suspect some that it may have progressed some because the insurance company was playing around. I do not have the saddle numbness, but some loss of sensitivity in the groin and erectile dysfunction. Sudden bladder urges that go from not having to go and instantly feeling like I need to go NOW. The anal sphincter muscle seems to be reasonably working otherwise, but the bowels definitely are not moving stool through like they should be. That is probably why I hear my bowels and bladder constantly make growling noises all day and night, too. If you are expecting sound medical advice on Reddit\u2026 you have my sympathy. Present a synopsis of your symptoms to a neurologist. Insist he reads it and signs for receipt of same.

I am 29 years old and I have had back pain and sciatica on and off for a few years. Made sure to exercise and walk often and it always went away. Untill this summer.. I tried PT, went to a chiropractor, but nothing helped. Luckily I was taken seriously and had a MRI planned for September. But never made it so far. \n\nIn August I noticed that I could not really get a stream going on anymore. Went to the doctors but they did not think of CES. Next day I lost sensations in my saddle area. I did not know this was the first red flag, was never told. Couple days later I lost the ability to stand on my toes. This was very alarming to me, still did not know I should have gone to the ER. So next day I went back to the GP who did some tests on me. Even though they did not suspect CES, my urinary problems got me send to the ER. After that it all went fast. Bladder echo, emergency MRI, and a few hours later I was in surgery to get rid of my massive herniated disc. \n\nEven though I was outside of the 24/48 hr adviced threshold, I did make a full recovery. It took about a month. 1 day post surgery my bladder function was back. Slowly my strength came back. And lastly the saddle area regained all sensory function. I do still have burning sensations but I expect with PT and light exercising to that my nerves will heal and calm down eventually. \n\nRecovery is harder than I thought and hoped though. Especially mentally. I am still trying to process what happened and the feeling of my own body betraying me. The months of pain, despair and eventually the fear of losing my mobility and my independence. \n\nReading some of the stories here I am so thankful that I was listened to and that I was able to get surgery when I did. Regardless, it was traumatic to be rushed in to the OR not knowing what is about to happen or how I will wake up. I hope that soon I am able to feel happy and confident in the future again. To anyone struggling with this awful disease, I wish you all the best. Reading your post gives me a bit of hope. I recently had a spinal fusion and laminectomy done in the hopes of dealing with degenerative disc disease at L5/S1. Everything was going fine and control over my bathroom habits undeniably improved following the surgery. But once I got home and had no way of getting sleep or proper rest due to pain, something went wrong. I was told there is a chance that the disc at L5/S1 may have become herniated, and that certainly feels like what is going on. I am now finding it harder to urinate, my left leg is constantly numb, I feel random spikes of pain in my pelvis, and sitting upright is starting to hurt me (which is something that had improved following the surgery).\n\nI have an MRI scheduled for next week, but until then, I am trapped in the house trying to deal with all of the anxiety of what I am going through. CES was my biggest fear before the surgery, and now it has become a possibility once again. But I will keep some of the things you said in mind so I will know when I may need to go to the ER. Ditto - I had intermittent CES symptoms and took 2 months before getting surgery. I am super lucky in that I am 95% better - just some latent weakness and paralysis in my left foot. I read through your post history and I am so sorry that you have to go through this. I hope you are able to get some rest while your waiting on the MRI. Please do not forget that you have had surgery and your system has to heal. Your nerves might be acting up because of the surgery. But I understand your fears completely. I was so scared of not healing right that I did not really sit for the first 3/4 weeks. Only to quickly shove some food down. I am still scared of sitting actually and try to avoid it. I really hope you get good news and can start to heal both physically and mentally. Take care. It had not even occurred to me, but maybe that is part of the problem. Before the surgery, I avoided sitting at all costs, and immediately after the surgery, I was told sitting was fine and that I would have to do it - which I did. And then I became comfortable with sitting again. But for all I know, maybe sitting once more has contributed to my renewed problems. You are 2 weeks out of surgery right? All i know is at that point I did not sit for more than 15 minutes tops and that was what I was told. Third week I started sitting more often but still not exceeding 15 minutes.  Fourth week I became more active and that is where my energy went (mostly cooking a meal throughout the day). The past two weeks I have been building my activity up and can now sit comfortably for 45 minutes. \n\nIt is hard to find a good planning online for how to build up your strength. From what I know sitting is the most burdensome position for your back to be in. And your muscles are now still healing from the surgery. So they are not able to support you like you used to do (plus you lost strength pre-surgery by not being able to sit). Obviously I am not able to give medical advice but you might need to rest more at this point in your recovery, if I am comparing it to my situation. I have my doubts at this point. Numbness has carried over to my lower back and I cannot really get any rest no matter what position I get into. It just feels as if something has gone wrong with a disc once again - and for all I know, it could be the L4/L5 disc.", "Should I Get Checked for CES? Hello, I am 19 years old, and I was wondering if I should get checked for ces.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, I was at the gym deadlifting, and then later that day, my lower back felt sore. A few months later, my back felt a lot better. A month ago, at the gym, my back yet again felt sore from deadlifts. Then about 5 days ago, I feel that I may be experiencing some symptoms related to ces.\n\nRegarding my back, I am not in pain, but sometimes I do get occasionally soreness, which made me wonder if maybe I herniated a disc. As far as my legs go, I can walk perfectly fine with no pain, but I do feel as if my calves are a little weaker than usual. For my bladder, I have been feeling like I have to urinate more frequently than usual. For my saddle region, I have feeling down their, but I feel as if I have less sensitivity than usual. Lastly, regarding sexual function, my elections tend to not be as hard as usual, and I have a little less sensitivity than before.\n\nWith that being said, does this sound like I should see a doctor regarding ces?", "There are a lot of posts here asking if their symptoms are CES\u2026this is more of an experience post. The onset of my cauda Equina was 2020, my surgery in October of that year. I have most function, but my left side is fairly numb. I get around okay\u2026.until I do not.  Meaning\u2026I seem relatively able bodied. I walk with a limp but looking at me you would never know how disabled I really am.\n\nToday I went to the gas station and as I was trying to walk out, my bad leg gave out and I fell. Pretty hard. Everyone looked, with jaws dropped. Some asked if I was okay. No one reached out to help me up though. I do not have great leg strength, so when I am down on the ground I have a really hard time getting back up. I did eventually. I used the door handle to pull myself up. Someone held the door shut so it did not open while I was using it to get up, so that was nice. It was a little help. \n\nI immediately started explaining myself but like\u2026.how do you explain CES? I just said \u201cmy legs do not work like they used to\u201d and I walked out in tears. \n\nI was with my mother, who is been helping me since onset\u2026she did not see me fall and I am honestly grateful for it because it would have caused an even bigger scene than it already was. \n\nIdk guys. When this stuff happens I tend to shrink into myself and backslide in my emotional capacity for handling how I deal with the new limitations on my body. \n\nI just wanted to post and share. I thought a post about living with CES would be a different addition to the sub that we do not get often on here. This is playing over and over in my head and my *whole body* hurts right now. I have a terrible scrape on my knee and my back hurts. I do not have insurance right now so I am praying I did not mess anything up.", "Please Help  - Genital (Pelvic) Numbness, Possible Retrogade Ejaculation, and constipation. BACKGROUND: spent the past 1.5 years completely sedentary (barely left the house once a month due to online work and pandemic). Spend the majority of the day sitting down (bad posture). I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, so I suffer from bad joints and connective tissue etc. \n\nSYMPTOMS: started 4 days ago. I think the S4S5 region is effected based on my symptoms. \n\n1. NUMBNESS - I woke up 4 days ago, and felt numbness in my pelvic region. \n\n2. EJACULATION - I tried masturbating (sitting) that day and orgasmed but very little semen, probably around 1-2ml (I usually produce quite a lot - around 10-15ml). I tried again standing later that night, and again, comparatively a lot less. \n\n3. CONSTIPATION - I have eaten a lot of the past 4 days (and regularly drink 3-5 litres of water daily); and have gone to the toilet like once per day, not passing a lot. I feel like I am straining quite a bit and my upper and lower pelvis regions feel numb.\n\nAny recommendations regarding treatment and who I should see would be appreciated. Furthermore, any physio exercises?", "Tingling? Hi, having odd feelings this past week. Whenever I lie down to sleep, I start getting numbness through my body, including inner thighs. I am currently experiencing on and off tingling in genital area and legs. I had some back pain, mostly on right lower/buttock that ached down my thigh.. but that is feeling better than it did now. I feel headachey, and weak and bit lightheaded and numb in places like legs and arms. Seems my headache gets worse when I lie down too. No issues with going to the loo, although for a couple of days it seemed like the sensations were dulled and I was not sure when I needed to go. It is just this on and off tingling atm.\n\nI went to and spoke to a couple of doctors, one twice and they did blood tests to rule out like lack of vitamin b12 to explain the numbness and it was all fine. Both doctors did physical examinations and said no neurological cause could be found. That perhaps caused by a viral bug. I was told to contact doctor again in a week or two if I still feel bad. This may not be anything like CES but I cannot help but worry about it. It feels very awful to wake up to numbness throughout, even my mouth/teeth feel so weird and dulled in sensation. If your arms, mouth, teeth are involved, it is unrelated to CES. Get help. Good luck. Thanks for reply. I did try get help, but yeah doctors were not concerned. I'l have to wait until next week if I still feel the same", "What, if anything helps the tailbone pain? Please help I get a severe sharp shooting pain in my tailbone.\n\nHistory: 7 years ago CES, had 2 discectomy surgeries and left with permanent nerve damage.\n\nAcupuncture, any specific exercises? Please help Cannabis helps my nerve pain the most. Have tried gabapentin, but that made me dumb as bricks at its lowest dose. Currently on max dose lyrica and it does not do much, if anything.\n\nSmoking the electric lettuce though, that stops all of the buzzing/burning pains, and greatly reduces the sharp pains. Both in intensity and frequency of shooting pains.\n\nFor me, it is only smoking the actual plant. Vape pens, wax, topical rubs do not touch the pain. Edibles help me sleep. But smoking the plant has been the only way I have been able to manage nerve pain. Wow really? I have tried weed before but I really do not like that \u2018high\u2019 feeling where I overthink and hyper focus on things. Not to mention it is illegal here in the U.K. \n\nDoes long time weed use affect brain cells? Well you asked about pain, so I am just sharing my experience with a similar situation. I am able to control the pain with cannabis about 80% of the time instead of being a miserable SOB. That is a huge win for me.\n\nI hope you are able to find something that works for you.", "How do we heal the potential permanent nerve damage pain caused by Cauda Equina Syndrome? Surgery was on 4/20 after TWO Months on a waiting list. The main point of this post is because I am looking for ways to encourage / speed up the nerve pain healing process (primary sphincter, but secondarily the soles of feet, testes and penis). \n\nIt took 9 weeks after a seizure which caused CES to have surgery (L5-S1 discectomy). Now I fear it is already too late and I will be stuck with this pain forever.\n\nI am very open minded to any and all therapies, medications, and esoteric solutions. \n\nI have been prescribed Celebrex just yesterday May 7 and have been on pregabalin for around 10 days. I take CBD/THC oil (cut out joints) and omega 3.  \n\nI am still experiencing severe pain.\n\nWhat other medications or therapies have been knows to help encourage the cauda equina nerve pain to heal to avoid permanent damage? \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and for any advice you know of and can share! The only information I have come across is to treat pain symptoms, but not much on nerve repair (the source of the pain).\n\nHow did I get here? See below in comments for more info. Our stories are long, and I do not want it to detract from the reason I am posting (permanent nerve damage concerns) but for context I will try to summarize in point form:\n\n- Dec 8 2020 began having back spasms above the waist\n- Feb 14 family doctor put me on strong meds - cyclobenzaprine + Advil + ratio emtec (which is codeine + Tylenol) and tells to start all of them the same day\n- The same night I have a seizure (from the meds, I do not have a history of seizures) with 3-5 minutes of convulsions (friend on the phone witnessed it)\n- Feb 15 severe left leg numbness and pain. Pain above the waist is all but gone.\n- Feb 18 I see a physio who says it is either sciatica, a hernia, or a stroke \n- Feb 19 go to ER and CT scan reveals advanced degenerative disc disease of the L4-L5 and L5-S1 discs. Dr sends me for MRI which I get around the end of February\n- MRI reveals my disc was shot out 3.3 cms from the seizure, and is crushing my CE nerves.\n- Because of Covid, I only get surgery on April 20 but my surgery was never classified as emergency and this misdiagnosis is starting to sound like I am in for a lifetime of chronic nerve pain.\n- My body is a rough shape, and I need at least two more unrelated surgeries this year (maybe 3) so I am desperate to reduce my pain (permanently) over time before it is too late.\n- Thank you for taking the time to read all this and for your help! its been 2 years since my surgery i cant sit and stand for long periods still experiencing cauna and my left leg is numb as fck. im getting use to it but the cauna still persist Thank you for sharing! Has anything worked successfully to reduce nerve/cauda pain? Especially in the first months/year?\nThanks again for your help! Also, how long did it take for you to get your surgery after the nerve issues began? Sorry this is so long\u2026.\n\nWe are all really different so not sure if this is relevant but thought I would share. First of all - I promise it gets better! I had surgery in 2013 as a 20-something female.\n\nThere is not much you can do on the nerve pain but learn to love it. Means you are still alive and still have nerves! I had ZERO painkillers after day 5 post-op so you have got a lot more \u201csupport\u201d there. Nerve pain is very difficult to control, pain \u201cexperts\u201d put millions into researching it and they do not have much for us yet. Part of the pain is natural to healing as the nerves reconnect or awaken. The first 2-4 months was daily pain, then it was a few days a week. Now it is random but maybe once a month and only for an hour or so. It dwindled down to a manageable level within a few months. \n\nThe damage is done already we are all in the healing phase now. Eat healthily, drink a lot of water, try to be active, the usual stuff. My pain was always much worse after physio but I could not dress myself/walk so I was pushing hard to regain function. \n\nI have seen specialists in the USA, Germany, and the Middle East - they all say they can prescribe painkillers but it will not eliminate the pain. They can drug you silly but that is no way to live either, in my opinion, so I got on with it.\n\n3 people I know with a lumbar fusion have similar (less serious) nerve pain. Not a single one has been eliminated by meds. Not trying to discourage you but maybe consider adjusting your goal. 100% Pain free is not our reality anymore - perhaps a more realistic baseline will help. Otherwise if you shoot for pain free you will always be disappointed. Something traumatic happened to us and our bodies are trying to deal. It gets a lot better but nerves are the slowest-growing type of cell in the body. We all would have been better off to break a bone or rip a tendon. It has not even been a month yet for you; for context I was not able to put on pants or socks by myself yet at that stage :)\n\nMaybe try logging your improvements, keeping note of pain location, improving functions, improving strength. Then when you are discouraged you can see how far you have come. \n\nEven by May 20 you will be a month out so your muscles will have healed a lot, your incision will be healed, but your nerves are just getting started on their healing. There were days I cried with frustration with the pain and was sick of it all, but it really did get a lot better. I wish I had lowered my expectations and increased the timeline to recovery.\n\nTL;DR hang in there - it gets better but you may have a few months yet. I am crying as I read this the first time :( I will read it again later and try to see it in a more positive light. Journaling is something I want to start ASAP Btw and I was actually looking for an app yesterday. Sorry :( really did not mean to have that effect. \nThe pain did diminish, starting like week 8 the hot/stabbing pains came less frequently. The cold/pinprick pains became on/off after about 6-8 weeks. After about 4 months I was I would say, most of the way better in terms of pain.\n\nPeople who get nerve grafts are told 12 weeks of pain to be expected. So maybe set a monthly bar- what kind of pain have you have in the last month? Where was it? How many good days did you have?\n\nYou will see progress every month; you will be a lot happier by July 20, I am sure. August 20 again you will have seen big improvements in the pain. Oh you are very thoughtful but I can take it! Initially I just had that strong emotional reaction to the hard truth. My mother has chronic pain and we have been chronicling her pain relative to how much CBD/THC oil she has. I really should get started immediately in the same way for myself. Thanks for the idea! I am 14 years in at the moment and in the beginning the nerve pain was quite exceptional with my legs. Putting on socks was like bathing your legs in liquid fire. This lasted for perhaps a year and a half and has now died off completely. I am able to survive well on tramadol and large amounts of weed,  not CBD. It does change as time goes past. Acceptance of the condition is very helpful. Not giving in but accepting that certain things have changed forever.\nGood luck to you!\nEdit: keep all paperwork and records, you might have a case for malpractice. I did. It took an 12 year legal battle for compensation. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Thank you for sharing! I am in Canada so I doubt it would be worth pursuing malpractice. Also, the two surgeons I saw were personal referrals through my family/friend network. \n\nI was told to stop smoking weed for at least 2 months to reduce the risk of infection post-surgery. I have not touched it so I may just stick to the oils as smoking weed is expensive and I do not have the disposable income at the moment. \n\nDo you think tramadol helped reduce your pain permanently? Charlotte mentioned you cannot really \u201ccure\u201d nerve pain but I am holding out for anecdotal evidence out there! I could not agree with this more. I am 7/8 months out from surgery. Still time to heal but it is looking more and more like my new reality is going to be the pain and numbness I am feeling. I try to just stay grateful: I can walk, I do not need a catheter or ostomy bag....I do not expect to heal more, so I am not disappointed if I do not. Glad you are on the path to healing! Changing my expectations really helped me cope with the changes in my body more than anything else.\n\nI still have numbness in patches, but, like you say, no catheter, no ostomy, can still walk\u2026 really happy with all those facts now, and grateful. I find it harder at this point to manage other\u2019s expectations of my healing than my own! Constantly reminding my family this is my life now...we can hope for healing and work for it but expecting it is doing everyone a disservice.\n\nI think with CES, your body will never be the same. I went through a pretty long grieving process following my surgery. It helped me learn to create realistic expectations: I expect to get up and do physical therapy today, I expect to take a short walk today, I expect to clean the kitchen/do the laundry/etc... No idea if it did or not.  I have since had another op on next vertebrae down, 13 yr after original op, so I have more/different damage.\nTramadol is cheap but addictive; one has to be aware of that fact   Do not treat it lightly. 10 yrs in the making but my surgery is an emergency Just so I am clear, you had cauda equina nerve pain for 10 years before you got surgery? That sounds terrible, I am so sorry\u2026 prior to diagnosing cauda i have symptoms that are manageable but at the end cauda hits me ang emergency surgery was done Hey I was thinking of you and wanted to see how you are doing\u2026 you ok OP? Hey! Thank you so much for checking in! \n\nI have seen some improvements with the back, but the nerves are still getting sharp pains/attacks in the #1/#2 areas (sorry still learning the lingo haha).\n\nI am using a cane now to get around outside of my apartment. \n\nDepression/drinking has been a challenge as of late but I am dry tonight so it is a start!\n\nHow are you keeping up? Like so many here I do not know whether to laugh or cry lol. I thank everyone for their stories though. I am 7 months post op, still with numbness, incontinence, complete ED and I think I am at about my lowest point in thinking I will ever be functional again - notwithstanding I do know the research says I have about 16 months or so before what I have regained is all I am likely ever to get back. I have gone from sleeping one hour forty min max, then waking (repeat all night) - to the last two nights I have slept for 4 hours straight. I think I can only repeat what others have said grab onto whatever small improvements you notice and start trying to live as much of life regardless (I am planning to go to Asia in June - so let us see how well that goes with bad bowels \ud83d\ude05). I take magnesium to manage the leg cramps, vitamin b complex and alpha lipoic acid supplement because of their tentative link to nerve health. I am still getting the electric shocks which as someone else noted is a stage of the nerve regeneration - so could not be happier and would not complain if they kept up forever - knowing anything is improving. Good luck with it - do not give up - I think you can pretty much also message anyone here if you ever need to chat - lol we are a pretty unique medical group \ud83e\udd23 so we might as well help each other all we can. Take care.", "Mom's Spaghetti In July I got very sick (thought it was Covid, but tested negative) and immediately after symptoms dissipated back pain began. Recently I had an EMG on Oct 6th and during the EMG when the doc put needle in the leg I felt pain when he bent my foot up. Then when he stuck the needle\u00a0 in my lumbar my legs went completely numb.\n\nThe next day I regained some feeling in my legs but still was unable to walk. It is now Oct 11th and I am still unable to walk. The Physical Therapist doing my assessment gave me a 0/10 on leg strength as of Oct 8 and described my legs as flaccid. Since then I have limited range of motion in my legs. I can move my ankle left to right, wiggle toes, and bend my knees slightly. I also am unable to control my pee. I am constantly leaking. I have had an MRI with and without contrast of my lumbar, MRI of head, neurology exam, xray of both hips, and a spinal tap. All came back normal including the EMG (minus spinal fluid assessment since I am still awaiting results). \n\nI am just not sure where to go with this anymore. The option right now is rehab for a month so I can walk again. But I would really prefer answers any advice on what to ask the doctors? \n\nTL;DR Got sick, have chronic back pain, got an EMG and now I cannot walk. What should I be asking my doctor? For Guillian Barre test. I feel like the EMG may have triggered a flare up in your muscles in your lumbar which may be why the nerves are being pinched so badly causing the CES. are you taking any anti inflammatory? I just spent a week in the hospital and they tested me for this.  It was tested from the csf and results were quick. Definitely ask if this was done. \n\nThey sent other csf off for more testing like MS and Parkinson's.", "Finally a subreddit! I was going to make one of these after building up my karma but I am so glad there is finally a community on here. I agree. This affliction can make you feel extremely lonely.

Has anyone experienced pregnancy after CES? I am 8 years post-op but not sure if this is possible. Apparently I am not able to have an epidural from the scar tissue but not sure about the rest. Going for an MRI to see how the injury is looking and get info about potential pregnancy but thought I would ask here in case anyone else has gone through this?", "CES Diagnosis; Questions, Fears, Advice? Hello all, \n\nSorry if this is a little long winded, this weekend has honestly been so confusing and scary for me. Last Wednesday (5/27) I had a diagnostic procedure done (facet joint injection block) because I have been in insane pain for a little over 2 years now. I was so excited because when the procedure was done (and lidocain was in my system, blocking the pain) I felt pretty good. I went home Wednesday afternoon and woke up around 1am on Thursday morning, feeling like I had just been hit by a bus. \n\nMy dad has degenerative disc disease and has had many surgeries and procedures done, so he said to just take my medicine and lay back down because I was probably just sore from the procedure. It was normal. I also knew that the pain relief would only be temporary, so I thought nothing more of it. Thursday afternoon when I woke up again, I could not straighten myself up. I do not know how else to describe it but, I was walking like a granny and in a LOT more pain than I had been in ever before. I ate, stayed in bed, and just tried to rest. \n\nFriday around 2am, I tried to move in bed and I felt the worst pain in my entire life. Both of my legs felt like they were being ripped off and my back was literally *throbbing.* I tried to move again to get into a more comfortable position, but I ended up getting stuck with half of my body on the bed and half off. I could not move, nobody was awake and I just tried to do everything myself. It took an hour and a half of me sitting like a slash / on my bed before I heard my brother get up and I had him help me sit up. Once I got right, I had to go to the bathroom. I tried to get up, but I could not get my legs to move. It was not that I lost feeling, they just felt like I had iron weights on my feet. \n\nAfter being helped into the bathroom, sitting on the toilet was agony and I realized that I had not urinated or anything since Wednesday night, and it is Friday morning at this point. When my mom and dad got up they took me to the emergency room and sadly they could not go with me. It was hours of doctors looking at my back and after a CT scan (with and without contrast) they said they were sending me to a bigger hospital in the city (I live in a rural town in Kentucky with very limited resources). I was taken there to the emergency department (SUCH NICE ROOMS!) and stayed there while I was looked at more.\n\nI had a catheter for the first time in my life, and if I can ever help that it will *never* happen again. They did an MRI, again with and without contrast, and then I spoke to a neurosurgeon. I have CES, he explained what it was and why I was feeling the way I was feeling and said that I am going to have to have surgery. Sunday afternoon they sent me home with medicine and an appointment for June 15th to meet with the neurosurgeon again and plan my surgery.\n\nI am honestly just-- I am scared. My dad had back surgery and it ruined his life because the surgeon came in drunk and operated on him. My granny had surgery and for months she could not walk. So I guess here are some questions I have:\n\n1. Have you had surgery to fix any issues related to CES?\n2. If you had surgery, what was it like? What was the recovery like? How is your pain now?\n3. Is there anything I can do in the meantime that will help with the pain? Even with medicine, sometimes I am in pain that just does not want to stop.\n4. If you use a walker, does that help? I have one, but I am embarrassed about using it.\n\nI know this is a lot and I am really sorry. I am just really anxious and I am trying to figure out how to deal with the anxiety and fear of all of this. First, if you have diagnosed CES then it is a lifesaving emergency surgery that is absolutely urgent. This is NOT something that can be delayed. \n\n1. Yes, I had an L4/L5/S1 discectomy, laminectomy.\n\n2. I could not pee or poop in the 24-48 hours before surgery. I was transported from one hospital to another. Surgery took a few hours and I was in the ward afterward for almost a week. Pain was gone almost as soon as surgery was over. Just the wound site was painful.\n\nI now have urinary and fecal incontinence. It took my diabetes to the next level and I have a bad foot ulcer that is now healing with podiatry.\n\nI have been lucky. I can walk and do not have drop foot like so many others who leave hospital in a wheelchair either temporarily or permanently.\n\n3. If you have been diagnosed then get to a hospital. You require emergency surgery. Failure to get this surgery will permanently impact your bowels, bladder and motor skills.\n\n4. As I said I am lucky but use what you need to get by.\n\nYou need surgery. \n\nI am not a doctor but this is my reality.\n\n(\n\n( Do you have complete or incomplete CES? CES is an emergent situation and you should double check about waiting for surgery. \n\nI went to the ER with CES at 6pm on a Saturday and was in surgery by 11am Sunday morning. \n\nYour situation may be different than mine, but I might clarify why you are waiting. I am not sure, but I did call my surgeon back and he is supposed to return my call soon. I have never felt so helpless and I have never felt so much pain. \n\nHow was the surgery? How are you feeling? Oh, wow! Thank you so much for this information. I am really grateful that you took the time out to write all this down. I will look at your links, too. \u2661 I felt significantly better immediately. I have some flare ups now that include some stiffness, tingling in my legs and pain that does not even touch the pain the I experienced preserver. I am back to running and working out and feel very good most days. I attribute that 100% to the speed at which I received surgery. All the literature I have read coupled with the experiences of other CES sufferers say that the longer you wait, the more likely that damage will become permanent. \n\nFor medical system reference I am in the U.S.  in a suburban metropolitan area. Hi, I thought I would share my CES experience. I was terrified too. \nI had sudden onset symptoms on 7th May this year, with urine retention, saddle and leg numbness, and leg weakness. I had to get an ambulance to the hospital at around 10pm.\nMy MRI on 8th May was the most painful experience of my life. I was confirmed with Cauda Equina and rushed straight to theatre. I got to see the theatre as they were setting up and I had my anaesthesia in there. I had a discectomy as my herniated disc was one of the worse they would seen in terms of digging into my nerves.\nIt is not been easy, I was home 4 days after my operation. I had urine retention afterwards and had a catheter for 3 weeks. I also had a toilet frame. \nI went for a trial without catheter for a week, and had to measure my urine. Luckily my bladder calmed down and is now working normally. My bowels have been fine since 1 week after my operation luckily!\nI walk with crutches as I still have a lot of numbness in my legs and feet and I am having physio. I am hoping my sensation will come back but they have not sugar coated it and said it may not. I will have to adapt in that case.\nAs I say though, mine was a particularly bad case and they do not seem as worried about yours as you did not have immediate surgery. How are you doing now? If it has or does get worse go straight to the emergency room.\nI had no time to mentally prepare for this so it has been very hard in that respect, and frustrating.\nI had increasingly worsening back pain for around 2-3 years beforehand.\nI wish you loads of luck, and I am here if you want a chat! Many people do recover fully within a month or\n2! Just checking in - how are you doing?\n\nI think I am the exception to the rule, but to answer your questions:\n\n1. I had a discectomy/laminectomy on L4/L5.\n2. On surgery day, I walked into the hospital with a cane, had my surgery at 6:30, walked (without my cane!) out of the hospital at 11 and was back home in bed by 11:30. (Okay, so for context, I am Canadian and we rarely get overnight stay + I was super doped up.) But I was without pain right afterwards! I had a couple of weeks of extreme stiffness, but a bit of movement helped alleviate it right away.\n3. Unfortunately nothing helped my pain. I was given various forms of nerve pain meds, but nothing helped. I just eventually learned ways to cope (laying flat, not standing - even when I washed dishes I sat on a chair).\n4. A cane helped me a lot because my CES resulted in severe leg weakness. I essentially had to throw my hips forward to move my legs. When I went into stores, if they had the little electric sit-on grocery carts, those also really helped.\n\nAs I said, I am probably the exception, but I went undiagnosed for 2 months, and now, a year later, the only ill effects is some lingering left leg weakness. Supposedly it can take 2 years for nerves to heal, so I am still hoping! My physio is helping me a lot, so I encourage you to work with one as soon as your doctor clears you for it.", "My doc says it looks fine.....But I do not feel it....Cannot sleep well and have a ton of lingering pain in pelvic area.....Can USG Physio resolve some of my issues !? ", "Cauda Equina schwannoma? Does anyone else have a schwannoma on their Cauda Equina.  Would love to know if you have on again/off again CES symptoms?", "Dad has Cauda Equina Syndrome Good Morning,\nI have found this sub and wanted to reach out because my dad has Cauda Equina Syndrome. He is been recovering since he had emergency surgery in Fall 2017. His mobility had improved, going from wheel chair to walker to 4 point canes to single point canes. He still has drop foot in his right foot but gets sensations in the area. He is doing physical therapy and does exercises on his own as well. He has a very spastic bladder at this point in time and also had horrible hives. I am wondering if anyone else has experienced hives and if so how did they solve them. \n\nMy dad is not really doing much besides going to the gym, PT, or watching TV. He is very down and most likely is extremely depressed but has a very archaic view of mental health even though mental health issues run in his family and he views himself above it. \n\nI think he would feel a lot better and less trapped if he had more hobbies as well but makes excuses when I try to suggest anything. It is frustrating seeing my dad self destruct like this and refuse any suggestions and need for mental health help. He also treats my mom very poorly and is very self centered right now. \n\nAny advice to help out with this situation or how to help with hives? I assume a lot of people afflicted by this get psychiatric help because it is quite a life changing event. Thanks and best of luck with all your recoveries I had cauda Equina in 2016,  I can relate to the spasms the bladder dysfunction as well as many of the other lasting effects that have become everyday life for me. I do not know about your dad but for me my body only knows two positions that I can maintain for more than a few minutes everything else cause extreme pain. I can Stan and lay flat. Those positions are not good for hobbies. My social life has become non existent as a result.  The one thing that does seem to help me physically is that I take a good quality food sourced b complex daily. I have tried cheaper options but I do not get the same result. The B complex helps my spasams and restless legs. It takes a couple weeks to become effective but a few days of not taking it I I suffer. The other thing that has helped my frustration was a Levo tablet stand it works with my inability to maintain certain positions.  Every part of your life can be affected by Cauda Equina you social, physical and sexual abilities as well as your mental health. I am still frustrated that no one listened to my early complaints and my body suffered great damage as a result.  It is a loss a grieving period for your old self it does not go away but for me the little things make it easier. I am sorry that your dad is going through this. One thing I would say is that everyone is experience with CES that I have come across is markedly different. As a result, it can feel very isolating at times. Life definitely changes, but it should get better over time, especially if he had supportive people in his life like you. \n\nThat being said, I would absolutely suggest consulting a doctor about the hives and and ongoing physical problems he may be having. I might even see if he would be willing to have you tag along to the surgeon or the doctor to ask questions.  He can always talk to us here or there are multiple Facebook groups that might be a good spot for him to find support as well.", "Odd New Symptoms, Do You Think It is Okay To Wait Until Monday (2 days) To Get An MRI? Hey guys,\n\nSo I have protruding/bulging discs in L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1. One of which (L3-L4) is causing \"severe central spinal stenosis.\" The L5-S1 disc is also very small/thin.\n\nThis has caused severe sciatica/numbness in the left leg, and I basically could not walk or stand for more than 5 minutes.\n\nI saw a spinal doctor who sent me to physical therapy where I have been doing exercises and trying spinal decompression.\n\n1 month into therapy and my symptoms in my left leg are improved... numbness is not nearly as noticeable and I can walk long distances again... however... in the last week, I have started to experience numbness/slight weakness in my right leg (calf, knee area, and foot). This is brand new.\n\nAlso, something odd seems to be going on with my penis... I am experiencing \"shrinkage\" all the time, and there always seems to be additional urine I have to \"shake out\" when going to the bathroom.  It is like my pelvic floor is being weird. Oddly, erections have seemingly improved.\n\nI do not have any lower back pain, I do not have numbness in the pelvic area, I have not had a loss of bowel control...\n\nI would like to get an MRI to make sure my situation has not gotten worse despite improved symptoms in my right leg... do you think it is safe to wait until Monday (it is currently Friday) to get an MRI? Reason I ask is that it is the difference between an emergency room visit (thousands of dollars) and my normal MRI provider ($300) is pretty significant.\n\nThanks in advance for any insight. It is a catch 22 - supposedly CES requires emergency surgery asap to reduce the chances of permanent damage... I went undiagnosed for 2 months but am about 90% recovered (I have lingering weakness and sensory issues in my left leg a year later).\n\nWhile pelvic numbness and loss of bowel/bladder control are big signs, they are not always present. I never had bladder/bowel problems, and my numbness only persisted for a week and a half.\n\nTL;DR there is no right answer here. Also the American health care system sucks because you are faced with this decision due to money issues! Clearly I am late to the party, as it is currently Wednesday, but I wanted to check in and make sure you are okay and got your MRI!", "Dealing with possible early onset CES. At what point should I start panicking? I am already in a panic. But it is more of a quiet and defeated panic. I had a spinal fusion roughly four months ago to try and deal with degenerative disc disease (after pretty much an entire year of dealing with nerve damage). Despite dealing with new numbness in my feet and other issues in the weeks following the procedure, I eventually saw undeniable improvement in my nerve function. I felt like I was out of the woods and just needed to worry about recovery. \n\nAnd then, about 3 weeks ago, I heard a loud pop in my back. It did not cause any pain other than a temporary sting. I figured it was nothing. Then, days later...incontinence and low urine flow. I thought SURELY this was some sort of minor disruption and that my nerves would recover in no time. And now I am here weeks later dealing with the same issues I had before the surgery.\n\nSymptoms\n\n- Pins and needles between inner thighs/genitals\n- Numbness in or around back passage or buttocks\n- Increasing difficulty when trying to urinate\n- Leaking urine\n- Not knowing when bladder is full or empty\n\nInitially, I had no issues with bowel movements, but after about a week, those stopped entirely. And when they did occur, they were horribly inadequate - as if my body just stopped digesting food properly. But more than anything, I am concerned about my issues with urination. Aside from what I have said already, there are times when I will feel a sharp pain in my penis that feels a lot like urine being forced out of my body (this feeling led to an involuntary urine leak on two occasions). But if I take the time to try and urinate, barely anything comes out. It FEELS like I have 40 oz trapped in me and I cannot hold it anymore, yet I can barely get 4 oz out of me. Like the painful urge just disappears as soon as I try to deal with it.\n\nFrankly, I am still unclear on what it takes to reach a diagnosis of CES. When I spoke with the surgeon about this, he left me with the impression that I would have to be unable to use my legs to have CES. Meanwhile, I appear to be losing control over urination, and I can walk just fine (with slight sciatica pain returning). But the thing is, in the rare moment where I can get a decent urine flow going, I will consciously stop myself to see if I am still in control...and I can still do that. And even though it seems like I have diminished feeling, I do still feel things. \n\n**So what am I looking for? WHEN does this become an emergency? When I completely lose feeling? If I cannot move my pelvic muscles at all? Do I technically already have it and it is just a matter of time before I fully lose feeling or control?** I am at a loss on all of this.", "Doctors do not know what is wrong (venting) First, a questin before I vent- anyone here had/have cauda equina syndrome with only minimal spondylolisthesis on lying mri?\nOver three years ago I had minor back pain, bilateral leg pain  that worsened  with walking and decreased urge/sensation to pee. I was doing a lot of exercise. Went to a doctor and he basically ignored me and said not to worry about it unless I am incontinent. Like the stupid person I am I kept overexercising. I do have  a history of hypochondria which maybe causes doctors to ignore rare red flags.\n\nA year later went to a different doctor and my symptoms progressed a bit and I told him it seemd I had a numb saddle region, he said there was nothing he could do but come  back if I have more questions. \n\nMonths later I came back and finally got a lumbar MRI, a neurologist appointment, and a referal to an urologist who refuses my insurance. I think at this point I had bilateral leg pain worsened by walking, no urge/sensation to pee except at night, nsfw &gt;!a penis numb to light touch!&lt; .\n\nSo, on the lumbar MRI was minimal spondylolisthesis which the neurologist said was not causing my symptoms. Even though I read later laying down MRIs can underestimate spondylolisthesis slippage but a neurologist should taken that into account surely, right? But the neurologist appointment was weird he asked me to remember three words and left the room and came back, what did that have anything to do with my symptoms. And when I mentioned the NSFW numbness, he said not his job, but the urologist job. He did order a neck MRI though causs I had tingling fingers too. Insurance refused it.\n\nSo, I was frustrated I am terrible at talking with people even if they are listening well to me, so I stopped seeing doctors for s long time.\n\nAround a year later I see my doctor again and got a referal to a different urologist. Urologist thinks it has nothing to do with my exercising. Urologist says he does not know what is wrong and will run nerve tests in my NSFW regions in a few weeks.\n\nI think it maybe too late. My symptoms now include bilateral leg when walking, no urge/sensation to pee, nsfw &gt;!penis numb to light touch, soft erections, and even though I can ejaculate no orgasms!&lt; I an afraid some of my symptoms are permanent if my problems are permanent.  I do not  understand why none of the medical professionals I seen did order an emergency battery of tests for my symptoms. \n\nI know other people have it much worse medically such as being paralyzed. But o am unemployed loser in his 30s who is probably autistic. I never even dated. NSFW &gt;!depresses the fuck out of me I may incapable if penetrative sex even if sm a woman wanted to fuck me.!&lt;\n\n\nI have a high tolerance of pain and find it difficult to explain my symptoms to doctors. My parents got upset be cause i said they have been gaslighting me I think because they assume only psychopaths gaslight. Examples of their gaslighting is that they say it is just health anxiety or I should not bother seeing an urologist. Another example is my mum saying I will not be paralyzed cause that rare. My symptoms are already rare and the causes of my symptoms are by definition  rare. Maybe instead of gaslighting me of my parents helped me figure out how to communicate to doctors I could have gotten the help I should have years ago.\n\nIt is definitely not health anxiety, health anxiety does not cause my type of symptoms.  Even if psychosomatic it would be something far more serious like conversion disorder or functional neurological  disorder.\n\nI am not looking forward to living decades more NSFW &gt;!without the ability to orgasm. I find much of ordinary life torture even with not working. Not being able to release with orgasms depresse me. And even worse I am mentally hornier than ever.!&lt;\n\nI am superficially in good health, I still do my calisthenics and light weights workouts because I am an idiot. Weirdly enough my workouts do not seem to aggravate my symptoms but walking long distances causes leg pain. What is also annoying is I have no clue what is causing my symptoms. Is it the spondylolisthesis that the lying down MRI, may have underestimated, is ot my thoracic or cervical spine? Is it some weird disease or is it perhaps I am.just insane?\n\nWhat also bothers me if this is because of my exercising then it shows that trying to better myself is a huge mistake.\nSorry, I just needed to vent. I know there are people with way worse  symptoms who are happy but I am mentally weak.\n\nTdlr stupid idiot has CES red flags for years. Doctors have not figured it out. I am afraid it was due to my overexercising. Also, anyone had cauda equina syndrome with only minimal spondylolisthesis on lying mri? Spondylolisthesis is not necessary for cauda equina syndrome. It is more common to be the result of a disc herniation. Your symptoms do match cauda equina syndrome, but I would look past spondylolisthesis for another cause.\n\nThe neurologist you saw certainly seemed incompetent. I had to be extremely persistent to get correctly diagnosed. Even with similar symptoms to you, I saw at least half a dozen different medical professionals before I was referred for an MRI which correctly diagnosed me.\n\nYour symptoms are like what I had though more severe. I also have a high pain tolerance with difficulty explaining symptoms. I think this is because I am on the autism spectrum. I have no diagnosis, but had suspected, and my experience has convinced me. Look up \u201cinteroception\u201d. Work to communicate what you are experiencing with your doctors effectively. While ideally others would help us, ultimately, we are responsible for our own health and happiness. We must be our own advocate.\n\nI am in my 30s too. Staying active is good. Regardless of what the cause is, continue to be active while it does not cause pain. I have been working on listening better to my body so that I do not overdo it. This increases in importance as we age.\n\nI had a disc herniation with cauda equina syndrome that merited immediate surgery. This was done 11 days ago. The pain (except from the operation site) was immediately gone. I still have some numbness, but it is less severe than before surgery. It affects me intimately and that depresses me for the exact same reasons it does you. That is a natural response. I am young and healthy, so I hope to regain sensation with time. With correct diagnosis and treatment, perhaps you may find the same. My MRI report read\n\n\"There is minimal anterolisthesis of L5 on S1. Bilateral spondylolysis at L5 is visualized without evidence of underlying edema. The vertebral body heights are maintained. The marrow signal intensity is maintained. The conus terminates at T12. The fluid signal intensity of the disc spaces is maintained. There is no focal herniation, spinal canal, or neural foraminal stenosis \"\n\nSeems like there is nothing wrong with my discs, the only things on my MRI were spondylolysis and anterolisthesis. I do hope that after the urologist tests my nerves in my NSFW &gt;!penis  !&lt; area that I will more easily get more MRIS and stuff.\n\nI have had these symptoms for years now though. Some of them stayed mostly the same.\n\nglad to know your numbness is less severe already I think that is a very good sign. I think I read it takes up to months or years before the nerves heal to their full extent so you do have very good chance of getting more sensation in the future I think.\n\nQuestion how long did you get surgery after the symptoms started? I am afraid since I waited so long  some of  my symptoms are permanent\n\nEdit- I am also probably way more challenged for communication and stuff than you. Partially cause I was spoiled and over protected for most of my life. Like I have a very hard time making phone calls and appointments.\n\nanother edit- that sucks you had to see six different medical professionals. I HATE having to talk  in person or on the phone  to all these doctors. How long ago was the MRI? It is worth doing another if some time has passed. The issue may be more obvious as symptoms have worsened.\n\nI was lucky. I had surgery \"only\" 11 days after symptoms started. This was only through firm self-advocacy, yet I may still have permanent effects.\n\nNo matter how long has passed, it is worth determining and addressing the cause. You want to limit the progression and give yourself the best possible chance of recovery. Back in 2018. But my symptoms have stayed mostly the same. I think getting another lumbar mri will be difficult with my crappy insurance.  I am actually hoping more for further investigation with the spondylolisthesis  like with standing x rays just to see if the degree of the slip is that much bigger.  Maybe I will more easily get tests after my urologists tests my nerves in a few weeks.\n\nFreaking heck , insurance refused my neck mri when the neurologist ordered it. Blah I think it is partially because none of my doctors have really listed my red flags anywhere, one of the reasons why I feel i need to get the urologist to to see if there is \"objective\" evidence there is something wrong with my nerves.\n\nIf my problem is from my lumbar spine it is probably the spondylolistheis since that is the only abnormality really seen.  I do not really have sciatica, but I have  bilateral leg pain that gets worse with walking. Sitting does not really aggravate it and I think with a disc the pain is worse while sitting than walking/standing.\n\n11 days is still way longer than doctors should have have acted. They supposed to act within 48 hours!  But I think you do have hope since it seems like your compression was not completely and since you already had the numbness lessen to a degree. But it may take like years to fully heal.\n\nedit- you are far smarter and courageous than I am, seeing six specialists within 11 days. After my doctor ignored my decreased urged to pee and bilateral leg pain, I did not see a doctor again until like a year later during my yearly check up. (I felt anxious talking to doctors cause I have a history of hypochrondria, like I thought I had rheumatic fever before.  But these symptoms, I do not see my mind causing no sensation to pee or the weird numbness.) I found sitting did not make my pain significantly worse. Only transitions between positions were hard. Walking usually helped with pain but not if I overdid it. A major difficulty in getting a correct diagnosis is that I had relatively little pain in my back; it was referred to my buttocks and legs.\n\nI am sad that it took so long to get a correct diagnosis, but the primary symptom was pain, and I had been dealing with sciactica-like pain since November. I only know exactly when the cauda equina began with the benefit of hindsight. I experienced sudden, severe pain while carrying a laundry basket and my symptoms were markedly different and progressed afterwards. I was only able to identify numbness 4 days prior to surgery, and that bowel function was affected 2 days prior.\n\nIt may very well take years to fully heal. It is hard to accept. I can only look forward, consider my age, and hope I have many good years after healing ahead of me. It is weird, because to me an actual competent medical professional I think would be more conceredn with bilateral leg pain than back pain for various reasons.\n\nBack Pain is SUPER common, most people who have it have nothing seriously wrong with their spines. Yet, bilateral leg pain is actually a red flag!\n\nAlso, when it comes to back surgeries, for back pain alone, surgery does not help much, but for referred pain or sciatica surgery is usually more useful. Yeah, that is why I say I was lucky. I did not see any specialists, but simply happened to be seen by different doctors and nurses during each appointment. I had three appointments in the 11 days prior to surgery. I made the third appointment, 2 days prior to surgery, to seek a second opinion. There they referred me to the ER.\n\nI do feel fortunate to have been intelligent enough to realize the severity of my symptoms. I had not considered myself courageous, but thank you. It has certainly been a difficult month.\n\nAnd yes, cauda equina is extremely rare. It is a zebra when doctors are looking for horses. Heck, my doctors and nurses may never see another case.\n\nI hope you can figure out what is affecting you, whether it is cauda equina or something else. It is affecting your quality of life, and the sooner you can figure it out, the sooner you can do something about it. What caused you have to have cauda? It was a consequence of a herniated disc at the T12-L1 level. It put pressure on the conus medullaris. I am doing much better now.", "Prostatitis or Cauda Equina ", "3 years post operative my left foot is still numb from knee to foot. im becoming more used to it. but at night the pain and numbness sometimes bothers me. still having cauda equina syndrome which i feel numb on my butt area. for the longest time ive been pooping goat like shit. tried several laxatives after a few days im constipated again. sometimes my erections are strong sometimes weak. im loosing the hope of feeling better \ud83d\ude22", "Really stressed and confused - need advice (sorry for long post) Hi all,\n\nI have been really struggling for the past three months since this all started. I had back surgery (l5 s1) about six years ago. Reinjured my back this June just doing too much at once. Initially I had an appointment with my prior surgeon just to check in as I had back pain For about a week or so and had an aching feeling in my leg. But the weekend before my appointment, I was sitting down and realized I had completely emptied my bladder without knowing. Because I had always heard this could constitute an emergency, I rushed to The ER and they scanned me in the MRI- I was fully expecting needing emergency surgery but to my surprise they said I only had a small disc protrusion at the l5 s1 and not compressing my cauda equina nerves.\n\nI was relieved but then later that week started having saddle area numbness. I continued to have random urinate leakage but nothing like the first incident. I was scared of course and actually headed back to the ER and again they did a lumbar scan and said nothing had changed. My surgeon reviewed these scans and agreed no surgery was needed.\n\nOver the past three months I continue to have urinary leakage, frequency, need to get up at night to urinate, increased leg pain, intermittent saddle numbness, and am very afraid. I am 37 and was very active before this and also have to take care of a four year old by myself. It got very stressful for me and I finally took a medical leave from work last month. I also feel like my balance is off. \n\nI have now had four lumbar scans, a sacral exam, thoracic, cervical, and brain. I have gone to two neurosurgeons, an orthopedic surgeon, three neurologists, had EMG and NCV done- and nobody has recommended surgery. I had a urological work up which found an overactive detrusor which \u201cseems odd in a 37 year old \u201c ie the doctor told me it is likely neurological issues with my spine. But she is a urologist - not a spine doctor. \n\nI went to the ER last night because my leg pain has been getting worse. Again, a lumbar scan and told it is just a small l5 s1 protrusion touching my s1 nerve but no compression. \n\nI do not know what to do because now I am told just to treat the symptoms. I am depressed, anxious, in pain, and struggling. By all my research these symptoms are of CeS and I cannot find any other explanation. I do not want to get worse and worse and I fear that I am. They want to give me an epidural shot but given my symptoms I am just shocked. \n\nAnybody run into this situation? The doctors do not call my scans normal but have said I do not have CeS,  yet cannot explain my symptoms. I live in Los Angeles and am seeing some of the best hospitals and doctors to my knowledge. Do I trust them or do I keep fighting for my health? I feel like I am taking crazy pills and it is making me feel subhuman. I really do not think I can take this torture for more weeks on end. \n\nReally sorry for long rant but I cry multiple times a day and have sunk into deep depression over this. Thanks in advance for any insight! Bumping this for any advice / similar experiences - thank you! I am so incredibly sorry you are dealing with this. I have CES symptoms after a lumbar puncture - whole saddle is numb and I am incontinent and yet MRI is \u201cnormal\u201d. Please keep advocating. It could possibly be inflammation that flared up from the previous surgery causing the symptoms and perhaps you just need a steroid pack. Thanks for replying! How long have you had the symptoms and what are you able to do for it? I have now taken 3 steroid packs and still having the incontinence (not fill out loss of everyday control yet but leaking when this was never a problem before), random numbness, and really weird feelings in both legs. I am supposed to get an ESI in a week but it is been three months and I am so mentally and physically down it is crazy. I am sorry you are dealing with this too... And also - were you officially diagnosed? This is all so scary and isolating No problem! It is been eleven months now with the symptoms. I also do not have full loss of control of my bladder just constant leaking. It is very upsetting and I completely empathize with you. Especially because you are not getting any straight answers on how to move forward. I have not been given a diagnosis other than \u201cradiculitis\u201d...ie the cauda equina nerves are inflamed. It can turn into arachnoiditis. \n\nTbh I would be very wary of an ESI because they can cause inflammation and arachnoiditis. \n\nMaybe the small protrusion is causing the symptoms? I do not know. I am so sorry you are not getting answers. It is so anxiety inducing to not have a course of action. Oh my gaw! Ughh! I am sorry for you as well. I also have the diagnosis of radiculitis but I thought that meant irritation of the sciatic nerve in any form? I am a bit scared of the ESI and especially arachnoiditis but living like this is awful too. Have you treated the urinary symptoms and have doctors provided any insight further for you? Keep fighting for your health! I had emergency surgery just over 2 years ago. I had symptoms for a week before surgery (saddle anestesia and bowel and bladder retention. My bladder was ounces from exploding.) and now I have permanent symptoms. Please see another ortho. My symptoms might have lead to surgery, but my scan came back as only a \u201cmild protrusion\u201d and that is part of the reason there was a delay in my surgery/getting me in to see an ortho. It was a different story when my ortho went in and did the surgery, he said the protrusion was \u201cmassive\u201d -his words. \n\nI do not want anyone to suffer like this permanently. It is so weird, I have been to so many doctors. But my pain has gotten worse and worse", "Check for other exacerbating issues with CES I had an L4-L5 herniation when I was 25 that resulted in CES. Both legs were paralyzed for a few months, then the left leg came back and fully recovered.\n\nI am now 36 and over the years the right leg has gotten slightly better year by year. The improvements are small and not noticeable to most, but they keep me optimistic.\n\nI am somewhat obsessed with going to the gym and constantly working to improve my leg. I occasionally will go to a neurologist or neurosurgeon to see if any advances in medicine can help.\n\nOn my most recent visit, I noticed my legs had actually been getting worse (increased numbness and tingling in my feet). The neurosurgeon did a reflex test and said something I have never heard: \u201cYour reflexes are hyper responsive. This suggests double crush, meaning a disc higher in your spine may also be herniated and contributing to your foot drop\u201d.\n\nSure enough an MRI of my cervical and thoracic spine revealed 2 herniations in my neck. After they were fixed, I still had increased numbness months later in both feet. After exhaustive trial and error, I found a topical medicine I was using was causing the numbness: topical minoxidil and finasteride.\n\nSeveral weeks after quitting the topicals, the numbness and tingling is 70% resolved and I am gaining more function in my right foot. I believe the herniated discs in my neck were restricting new signals to my lower body and limiting my recovery from CES. I think they had likely been herniated for years. Unlike our lumbar spine, cervical herniation are less likely to heal. Combined with the topical medicine that was essentially attacking my nerves, it was the perfect storm to stop me from recovering.\n\nI suggest anyone with CES have cervical and thoracic MRI\u2019s done just in case.", "I have a dessicated disc that has caused spinal stenosis for 10 months. I have had disrupted bathroom habits the entire time. As of now, I no longer get any urges for bathroom breaks. Is this considered permanent nerve damage? I have treated this seriously ever since I started having pain while sitting down in late 2020. I have been given the runaround, dismissed with prednisone, and have had great difficulty getting approval for surgery all throughout 2021. And now, I no longer get any urges to go the bathroom. At all. And somehow, this is not enough to alarm any health care providers I have seen.\n\nSometimes when I adjust, I can feel the presence of urine in my body. If I go through the motions and force movement below my waist, I can manage to remove SOME urine, but not much. Bowel movements are worse. It has become normal to go up to three days without a BM. I have no idea how much waste is just trapped in my body, or how it may be affecting me. I have not had any involuntary releases. I have come close, but I have not had full loss of control just yet. There is just something seriously wrong with the removal process.\n\nRight now, going to the hospital is not really an option because in my state, COVID cases have completely swamped nearly every hospital. I actually went to the hospital and specifically asked to be transfered elsewhere so I could get an emergent MRI done a few weeks ago, but this was right when cases were beginning to rise and I was told that a transfer would not be possible.\n\nI just do not know what to do. I have done all I can to try and prevent permanent damage, but I cannot help but feel as if it has already occurred. And who knows if some sort of loss of feeling has occurred in my waist. You need an MRI urgently. This is your priority. The longer you wait the more damage you will sustain and the more grim your potential diagnosis and long-term ramifications will become. Yes. Scan plus neurologist time Try calling your health insurance and see what providers give coverage and see if you are able to see a neurologist within your network. If you are not able to go to the bathroom, that will affect you in the long run with UTI or IBS. If you are unable to go number one then your bladder can face complications in the future, possible catheter. I hope you are able to see a provider soon. If there is blockage, try taking a stool softener or MetaMucil, that does wonders. believe me, I have been aggressive about tackling this issue for over a year. It is as if each doctor I see refuses to acknowledge the severity of my situation. \n\nThe only thing that gives me any hope is that this has gone on for an entire year, but I still have not had total loss of control. Even so, I feel that moment is right around the corner. Do not have the answers for you but wanted to let you know I have got the same symptoms for the most part and same experience dealing with docs. It seems that no matter how worrying or potentially permanent the symptoms are docs do not care unless there is a reason they can see as to why it would be happening. If you had foot drop or incontinence that would prob help with the urgency but without those there is no sense of urgency at all with anyone I have seen. I have been to 2 neurologists and a neurosurgeon and have had extensive tests. Because they do not see any MS or any discs out of whack they are basically shrugging their shoulders and telling me to do PT meanwhile I can initiate urination when I try after getting very slight indications I may need to use the bathroom but I cannot really feel the urges at all. I feel it more as abdominal pressure than anything else at this point. Hope you find some help and get the bottom of this.", "Anyone have slow onset CES presenting like this? Last MRI shows no bulges or herniations. So I work an office job, have been sitting and staring at screens for years all day everyday between that and my side gigs outside of my day job, do not really exercise, obv sets the stage for back issues eventually. I am in my late 20s. \n\nBasically had been going to a physio for knee issues summer 2019. They had me do McKenzie push-ups as they thought my knee issues were referred back issues (they were not I had never had back issues before and I now know I have grade 1 cartilage damage in both knees causing that pain but I decided to humor them at the time). Basically I ended up getting injured from doing those exercises with the physio. The pain in my lower back was on and off for months in varying degrees of severity after that appointment. Finally I bought a car this past spring and the seats did not agree with me and that seemed to push the back issue over the edge. I had severe lower back pain after driving the car 2 hours home from the dealer but initially had no neurological symptoms. After a couple days daily driving and the car as I was trying to see if my body would adjust to the seats I noticed the following symptoms:\n\nHeaviness in both feet (most noticeable when wearing shoes)\n\nConstant urge to urinate (which is only present occasionally now, it stopped being constant after I stopped driving the car regularly)\n\nDribbling slightly after every time I pee unless I wipe myself off (I have never had to do this in my life but I have to do this every time now) \n\nReduced sensation of when I would need to urinate until I was absolutely bursting, so urgency\n\nReduced sense of needing a bowel movement (just feels like pressure, no reflexes or waves of needing to go I seem to have lost those sensations)\n\n\nSlightly reduced saddle sensation that is only noticeable when wiping, I do not notice it outside of that (it varies in severity in proportion with my other symptoms)\n\n\nAlthough I feel like my right leg has had short bouts of feeling weaker than the left after sitting on a hard seat for an extended period of time, I have never had drop foot, have no issues standing on heels and toes, and very minimal weakness-type symptoms, almost none. \n\nWhen I was in the new car it would seem to make symptoms much worse, and the longer I stopped driving that car and settled for daily driving my other car (which had always been fine) the better the symptoms would get. \nEventually I determined I had to sell the new car as it seemed to be perpetuating my symptoms. I got rid of it and things were somewhat stable, but many things still seemed to bring on the symptoms. Strangely, except for when I do things that specifically aggravate my back pain like washing cars or picking up heavy things, or sitting too many hours at a desk, I have only very little back pain and no leg or foot pain the majority of the time. Also, the foot heaviness was initially only present for a few days after driving that new car and then if I would spend 2 weeks not driving it it would go back to normal. One weekend over the summer I did a bunch of kayaking then washed the cars on the Sunday and after that day the foot heaviness became permanent. \n\nThings that to this day cause low back pain to increase as well as increased sensory issues in feet and urinary/bowel issues: \n\nSitting on hard seats for too long, driving in general for too long (1-2 hours gets bad)\n\nSitting more than 40 hours a week in an office chair seems to cause symptoms to worsen (obviously)\n\nDriving a power boat (the rocking motion going over the waves flares up the feet heaviness and back pain rapidly)\n\nWashing my cars\n\nPlaying ping pong (on account of the constant bending down to pickup a dropped ball)\n\nI have seen two Orthopedic surgeons and a neurologist about these issues. All say that because I do not have severe pain and can walk fine and have not lost control of my bowel or bladder, I should not be concerned about cauda equina syndrome. \n\nFirst ortho:\n\nYour MRI scan shows a healthy spine, there are no visible disc bulges or herniations however your pain symptoms and what causes them to increase do suggest a slight disc bulge may be possible, but again if you did have one it is not visible on the MRI scan and is very unlikely to be causing your other symptoms\n\nSecond ortho: \n\nYour mri is clean, I agree with the first ortho you saw that you should not be concerned about a herniated or bulging disc causing these issues, go see a neurologist to explore this further. \n\n\nNeurologist: \n\nIf your neurological symptoms were from a disc issue you would likely have much more severe and regular pain issues and they would be referred down your legs. I do not think this is a disc issue. EMG test of right leg is clean, I agree with the other two orthos that your lumbar mri looks clean and healthy. I think your issue is caused by myofascial trigger points which can cause pain and urinary issues and the sensory issues in your foot but I would like to do an mri of your brain, thoracic spine, and cervical spine to rule out MS (which I feel is unlikely as the patterns are not really consistent with that) and any concerns with your spine higher up, but I think the most likely cause are postural issues and muscle imbalances causing myofascial trigger points to be placed under pressure. \n\nAlright so back to my thoughts...\nNow in the wake of all of those appointments, I am not sure what to believe. My only other thought is that I may have a disc bulge that does not show on my mri but would show if I was in flexion or extension during the scan. I wonder if my cauda equina is actively being damaged in a seated position by disc material being pushed against it, but since during a typical mri scan I am in a neutral position it is not showing on that. \n\nShould I continue to see more neurologists regardless of her opinion or if she decides after the other MRIs that we can assume my issue is myofascial in nature should I just settle for that diagnosis and follow her suggested course of action from there? Please help. Hey. I am really sorry to hear about your troubles. I have been having similar issues myself (saddle region paresthesia and leg heaviness) for over a year. I have seen three neurologists and six spine surgeons. The only thing they have found is a disc bulge around T6 slightly compressing my cord, but nothing warranting surgery. I am also young (24), and I think this contributes a lot to surgeons apprehension about operating (though I do not fully understand why). In any case, you are not alone, and feel free to message me if you need advice or to vent. You are not alone! It is certainly comforting to hear of someone in a similar boat, however that is unfortunate you are dealing with many of the same grey areas and difficult decision making. I know that the protocol among professionals is generally to try and avoid surgery if possible (obviously an exception to this is full blown cauda equina) as it will very likely mean more surgeries and potentially one or more fusions down the line, because for a very young person having surgery early allows for a lot of years ahead for daily and recreational activities to disrupt the discs above and below the newly unstable operated on disc. I understand that in general there are also significant risks associated with spine surgery by nature, so something I am trying to avoid if I can as well (not that there is currently anything visible to be operated on). Obviously I am not a medical professional or perhaps I would have figured this out by now, but that is essentially what I have come across in my reading about back surgery. How are you getting on? Have you got any closer to finding out what is wrong?  My symptoms are really similar to yours. Went to A&amp;E again today to be cleared again for CES and told to come back if my symptoms get worse. Still about the same, I went to another neuro. They are seeing me again in July after examining me, reviewing my records, and determining there was no obvious issues that they could detect beyond what I state I am experiencing subjectively, but said it is possible that whatever I have going on may simply not be far enough along for them to diagnose yet. I asked once more if it is possible there is some compression going on from something other than a disc (as it is been established I have no issues there) and they echoed all the other docs I have seen in that it would be unlikely. I argued that there is no other logical explanation outside of that. It seems the problem is that we are not far enough along in the timeline of medical advancement to test for these things. I am aware of a test called MR Neurography which is essentially an MRI scan that looks specifically for nerve compression by any cause, however only a small handful of facilities in the US are outfitted for that test and it is not at all common to find access to it. Have you seen an urologist at all?  \n\nThe lack of bowel sensation and constant pressure  might be related to slower bowel function, leading to constipation.  So, it would also be important to evaluate the extent of constipation and any blockage. \n\n  Do you have extended fatigue even when your back is otherwise fine? How is your posture?  Do you have any brain fog or odd heartbeat patterns (fast or slow?) Unfortunately spinal issues can cause postural issues and tight muscles that can create pain and also kind of make you pinch your spinal cord more sometimes.  \n\nYou have a muscle called the psoas muscle that starts midback, wraps around your hip and front thigh which connects your back with your lower body.  Prolonged sitting can cause it to be dysfunctional and transmit back issues to the legs, and also keep back under a constant tension patterns.   If you have real spinal issues where it attaches, it can be difficult.  Think of it as a domino effect, not \"just\" this and that. \n\nObesity can unfortunately increase internal abdominal compression issues too.\n\nThe sciatica muscle can pinch nerves running to the back of your legs when you sit. I had some mild saddle region anesthesia when my sciatica was very bad, but I easily resolved it and have not had either again. \n\nI did have a friend who developed CES months after breaking her back (in part due to another disease.)   It is pretty serious. \n\nPart of why CES is a medical emergency is your blood pressure and heart rate skyrockets when you really cannot feel your bladder being full due to block in spine, it signals through your vagus nerve instead, which descends from the top of your spine, goes through your neck, and with branches through your heart, lungs, bladder, and digestive system and ends around your left lower abdomen. \n\nVagal nerve tone can be modified by exercise (some research on specific  yoga  exercises for this)  meditation, etc.   \n\nHyperactive vagus nerve can cause diarrhea, but impaired vagal nerve tone can cause constipation, slower heart rate, etc.  (No vagus nerve, no life. It is that essential.)   So some of your symptoms (and neck issues) may suggest instead the flip side-- vagal signalling issues. \n\nI have had a weaker version of this issue due to impaired bladder sensation/ pinched nerve when sitting, and my dogs alert me before my heart races and I  get dizzy.  When I get up I can feel my bladder being full and run.  So they taught me to recognize the feeling of my not feeling my bladder.   I have been getting up every 45 to 60 minutes for decades now just to keep my body alert.  So I cannot imagine 1-2 hour straight of sitting anymore. \n\n  I have issues with slow heartbeat that has not been linked to anything endocrine and is definitely postural (and not classic POTS. Sitting is basically it.)  For me regular exercise (gentle) helps manage that symptom. \n\n  Only recently did I have problems \"going\" after being unable to feel my bladder, fortunately that resolved but I am having this investigated because it is new.  \n\nI cannot tell you any more than this, I am not a doctor, but you should ask more about vagal-related symptoms.  Because the vagus nerve needs stimulation, give back exercises a try (since you cannot work back without also working abdomen and stimulating the vagus too.), but not if they worsen your symptoms or cause pain.  Also try and stay in motion more, however gentle and see if it helps. Not OP but what might those symptoms suggest? Many things, but prolonged untreated hypothyroidism could be one of them, leading to pseudo-obstruction of the bowel, poor posture, leading to back pain,  chronic brain fog, slow heartbeat.\n\nOther things could be multiple sclerosis, etc.  \n\nWhen you cannot feel your full bladder, etc. via your spine or pinched nerve going to your spine (not CES level-- I think it is L5... not a spinal expert.), your vagus nerve which innerves your viscera then may keep stimulating without feedback from the brain, raising your heartbeat and blood pressure.  This is why a full bladder is an emergency for paralegics; they cannot feel it, their blood pressure spikes, etc.  It is called reflex dysautonomia. \n\n This is part of why rapid onset CES can be a real emergency.  Slow onset CES is also possible... I might be at risk of this (already had saddle anaesthesia briefly due to sitting on floor, have symptoms of pelvic area compression.)  but I will not know for sure unless I know what is causing it, and hopefully fix it before CES develops.\n\nI wish people luck on finding out what is causing their symptoms.  It is easy to focus on symptoms that fit a diagnosis and overlook the unrelated symptoms, which might tip off to the actual causes.

I am a 28m with history of back pain and I have had this tingling in my perineum/scrotum/anus for the past month and a half or so. Comes and goes, and has been a little worse the past day. While I am writing this it is the worst it is been, with some back pain. I had a laminectomy on my L5 S1 7 years ago for a herniated disc and I am worried this could be a problem. Enough so that I found this subreddit and wanted to get some perspective.\n\nI have been to the ER about 2 weeks ago, but was sent home after 2 hours with instructions to call my old orthopedist. He did not seem worried, and just have the ok for an MRI. I am currently in the process of scheduling one, but it is taking a bit. \n\nWould it be worth going to the ER again? Or is this something I can try and go the slower route?\n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated. Inflammation at l5 s1 possible best see a doc", "Did anyone have extreme thirst before being diagnosed? I have 4 herniated discs and I am getting surgery next week, but I am worried because on top of the shooting pain (often accompanied by numbness in my left foot) down my left leg, and the limping and severe tilting way that I walk, I have been struggling with sexual dysfunction (complete loss of libido that has never happened like this in my adult life, even after having 3 kids and dealing with this injury), and lately extreme thirst and dry mouth. For the past several days I have been drinking a gallon or more of water a day, which is HIGHLY unlike me. When I called the after hours number of my surgeon\u2019s office last night, they told me I am probably just dehydrated and I need to drink Gatorade or something. I know that is not the issue. I lay down all day every day. It is winter so I am not out in the heat even if I did go anywhere, and it is not hot inside. I am completely sedentary, and am drinking a gallon or more a day for several days and the dry mouth will not go away. Even when I was running a marathon, years ago, in 100\u00b0 weather, and super dehydrated, all I had to do was drink water when I got home, and a couple hours later I was fine. But still, I did not want to seem like I was making a big deal and end up being wrong and costing us a lot of money, so I drank two electrolyte drinks at 10 PM and 2 AM (woke up because of the pain and have not been able to go back to sleep, which has happened every night for weeks). Those were 48 oz total, then I drank half a gallon of water by 8 AM. The electrolyte drinks did NOTHING. Now I am also noticing I am leaking small amounts of urine after various movements (like turning over in bed). I do not know what to do. Part of me says I am overreacting and part of me is so upset because I felt like the on call doctor did not take me seriously. There is no way I am dehydrated. I did not have these symptoms because of my CES. I would trust your gut if you know you are not dehydrated. It is possible that it is caused by something completely different. Maybe there are other symptoms that you could look for that would help you understand what is happening to your body. You did not have any of these symptoms? Because sexual dysfunction, incontinence, and the specific type of pain I am feeling are all CES symptoms. Or do you just mean you did not have the dry mouth/drinking excessively symptom? I did not have dry mouth or drinking excessively, sorry I should have been more clear.", "What is Cauda Equina Syndrome? An Introductory Guide | Rick Janetzki ", "Got diagnosed with CES two years ago and man it has been a long journey. Does anyone else experience having to go to the bathroom almost all the time. Not having access to a bathroom when going for a hike or long drives is such a hassle\u2026\u2026 Also has anyone experienced back pain with CES?  I have ces and spinal stenosis and have mostly pain in my legs and hips. I go toilet about 6 times a night despite not drinking before bed. It is annoying but I cannot empty my bladder. I have surgery in September so hopefully this might change. Sorry that you are going through this. It is a tough journey. I was able to undergo surgery and the chances of going back to normal were about 50/50. Never lose hope. Never thought I would be normal but it is a new normal. Keep being positive . Thanks. Same for you. I wish you all the best. I have only just started my journey in April so unsure what to expect daily. Fingers crossed we can overcome x Chances of the damage to the nerves healing is hit or miss and typically gets worse the longer you wait between onset of symptoms and surgery. I am dumbfounded by the amount of people that post here said they went to the ER with symptoms and were refused even an MRI. \n\nIn a Facebook group I was a part of, people had mentioned gaining some sensation back in 18/24mos after surgery so there is always hope. I am very fortunate in that I can walk and I have bladder control\u2026but my left leg is numb and always freezing and if I have to go #2 it comes on very suddenly and is hard to make it to a toilet. That is gotten a bit better though. It is been 11mos since mine. \n\nI have back pain but the excruciating pain I had in my legs is gone.  I am trying to go through the process to get a rhizotomy but my insurance says \u201cI am healed\u201d cause of my surgery and will not even approve the diagnostic procedure for before the rhizotomy (facet block). I am fighting it and it will eventually be approved but omgggg how frustrating!! Maybe your back pain can be helped with injections? Have you spoken with a pain management doctor about it? You are very new out of surgery so it may change! It took me a while to get my bladder functioning normally. I think maybe a pelvic floor therapist may be able to help you. I have never been but I do know, as if everything in this horrible syndrome, the sooner the problems are addressed the greater the chance of recovering!! Good luck\ud83d\udc95 I got surgery to help with CES but my recovery has been ongoing and I believe it still will. Post OP - 1 Year 10 months approx. I heard that bladder Botox may help with issues with retention, try attempting that option. I do not have sensation on half of my leg and often it feels cold. Progress is always ongoing and if possible try to exercise as much as your body lets you!!! Hope that helps !! I would suggest you get advice from a Urologist. I got CES after my second distectomy at L5-S1 roughly 4 years ago.  I have had no improvement or return of sensation, in my case CES is a permanent spinal cord injury. Additional surgery for me will only risk making it worse. My Urologist set me straight from day 1. If you are unable to empty your baldder 100%, then you have no hope of regaining any bladder function at all. The bladder is designed to fill and empty, if your bladder does not empty fully, it stretches and can never recover. Carrying excess urine also has negative health effects and could slowly poison you. The Urologist will measure how much urine you pass naturally, then will insert a catheter (correct size is important)  and measure what comes out of your bladder. The difference may be shocking, it was for me.\nI do self catheterization 5 to 6 times daily dependant on fluid intake. At first it took some getting used to, now it is just a part of every day life and I honestly do not even think about it anymore. Long drives, fishing trips, walking/hiking is part of my life. \nI carry 5 or 6 catheters in a ziploc &amp; a sterilisation liquid (biotaine, in travel spray bottle) in a discreet pencil bag. I keep several. Ie: home, office, car, laptop bag ect. Those allow me to live a normal life without constant bathroom breaks or the discomfort of having a full bladder continously as I cant concentrate with full bladder. It also relives pressure on your intestines which gives a sense of relief on the back end, if you can relate. It is important to sterilise your hands with the liquid everytime before you touch or insert the catheters to avoid bladder infections (Urologist can also prescribe an antibiotic to keep in case of bladder infection) . I use the same liquid (Biotaine) to resterilse the catheters in the same ziploc after I use the last one in the bag.\nI use the clear &amp; firm catheters opposed to the flesh coloured floppy silicone ones. They are easier and quicker to insert and have faster flow. They cost about $1 each and you can find them in most dispensaries.  \nI hope the lesson I learned can be of help to you. \nTake care and wishing you some relief. \nHello!

So based on my condition and the advice from my neurologist he informed me after my surgery that catheterize daily and i did however, i was able to fully empty my bladder after a few months and they did repeated tests. I will say if i over consume sweet drinks or caffeine, i was told that it makes the bladder work harder . I do recommend pelvic floor exercises as that does help strengthen the bladder. Unfortunately a lot goes into what you drink and eat throughout your day.  Thanks for your message, it really gives me another perspective. I had nearly the same results from my surgery. I can walk okay 95% of the time. Some minor pain. But my right leg is numb and always cold. And my bladder is now a \"fine... Fine... Fine... YOU GOT TO PEE\". \n\nGot mine done Feb 19, was good till this month, now it is looking like I am in for round two of CES. Same symptoms, same leg.", "Went to ER today Went to ER today after about a month of constant numbness at inner thigh and groin area. Never had this symptom before but have been dealing with sciatic flare ups for a long time. \n\nI am afraid of possible cuada equina. Nurses and doctor do not believe this is the case. They think my sciatic nerve is severely compressed at my L4/5 bulge or at periformis muscle.\n\nRegardless I still have an appointment on Wednesday with neurosurgeon which they did not believe I need to \u201cseek out yet\u201d.\n\nAbout a week ago I could barely walk. Really not sure what to believe I am just trying to be proactive in this. \n\nAny thoughts?\n\nI should add the doctor did stick her finger up my butt to see if I still have sensation, which I definitely felt. Hey man, sorry to hear about the hard luck. That finger test is good news so hopefully your docs can come up with a solid treatment. \n\nBest of luck! Thanks man. I mean damn can I really have that numbness for a month and it not be CES? They seem to think so I think it all depends on where. Is it possible to get a second opinion? Yeah I am going to see what neurosurgeon thinks on Wednesday To be fair, I had CES and could still feel my butt hole too. :)\n\nGood luck! Can you elaborate more on your CES. How serious, how treated, how are you today? I thought I just threw my back out really badly (while washing my face of all things). It took a day before my legs started to get weak. I thought it was just a bulging disc, so I tried powering through it. A week in, I started having intermittent saddle numbness (it only happened when I walked, and would dissipate after I sat down.)\n\nI started a new job and kept powering through the pain and numbness. About 3 weeks after, the saddle numbness stopped and I was left with just the pain and weakness. I could not use my toes on either foot. I used a cane to help with mobility.\n\nI eventually got a CT scan, then based on the results of those, I got an MRI. Needless to say the MRI showed significant compression of the Cauda Equina. At this point, it was about 1.5 months from the original injury. I saw an orthopedic surgery the day after my MRI.\n\nHim: You need surgery\nMe: Awesome! When?\n\nI got a discetomy and laminectomy on my L4-L5. I am a Canadian and wow, my surgery was day surgery! I was wheeled into the OR around 6pm, in recovery by 9:30pm. I was at home in my own bed by 11pm. The most amazing part? I walked into the hospital with a cane, and walked out without it! (Mostly cause my parents lost in while waiting, lol.)\n\nI was immediately WITHOUT pain! (other than stiffness from the surgery itself). My toes were still useless. It took about 1 month to get strength in my right toes. It took just over 1 year to get strength back in my left yoes. I am almost 2 years post-op, and my left toes are about 95%. I also have \"fuzzy\" sensations in the left calf/foot. They are not bad, but they feel different.\n\nAll this being said, I am on a CES group on FB, and I know that I am one of the exceptions to the rule Yeah definitely sound lucky from what I have heard. \n\nDid you ever have bladder/bowel issues, I know that is a big part of it is Nope, no bowel/bladder problems... Which is one of the reasons I kept trying to \"tough it out\" cause I was like, \"Well I do not have those symptoms, so I must not have ces!\" Same here. I am concerned about the numbness and from all I read is that it is a red flag. So I go to hospital and doctor and nurses both tell me I do not have it. That is why I am going to neurosurgeon for 2nd opinion.", "is this l4 l5?  Definitely in there. anything abnormal in your opinion man?

Last night I noticed that my central to outside regions of my feet and heels (L5/S1) have switched to parasthesia from complete numbness and have some altered sensation. This is approximately 2 years after they lost sensation (1st partial CES) - taking my balance with them. Because of the loss of sensation I have for the last 2 years been unable to walk without footwear/thongs (a minor issue among many - but for someone that loves the feel of sand/grass/carpet - it was significant psychologically). Today however, whilst it will take time for more recovery, I can walk without shoes, without the complete thud of my feet not knowing when they hit the ground. (Now if my ED would like to follow suit I would be happy \ud83e\udd23 (2nd complete CES - operated March 21)). I just thought I would share as I had actually given up on my feet ever being anywhere near normal again.

I had appendicitis back in June and had surgery for it. Ever since then I had dealt with bladder pain, anus pain, urinary frequency/urgency, ED, and other pelvic fooor issues. I treated the problem by seeing a pelvic floor PT and stretching often. It seemed to be getting better slowly but surely.  \n  \nI felt like my penis was less sensitive out of nowhere, now I realize it is only my left side that is les sensitive, I can stroke the right and it feels normal.  \n\nBack in august I had gone for a run. At this point I had been running for 2 weeks regularly and worked up from barely a mile to 5 miles in 45 min. I am 21 years old male, 6'2\" 170lbs. I have been lifting for a few years.  \n  \nAnyways, I got back from this run and then went out with some friends. While in the car, I noticed my scrotum felt wet/cold on my left side and like a weird faint tingling on my back if thigh. I felt around to see if i pissed myself but I had not. Weird, and a little concerning, but hopefully it would go away. The next day, I went for a slower run trying to take it easy. I got back and noticed the numbness around my thigh was still there, and seemed to go down to my calf. I started looking up CES and got very worried and had my dad drive me yo the hospital because I knew quick intervention was key.  \n  \nOn my way to the hospital, my back started hurting like crazy. We got in they ran full spine MRI, everything came back normal. Blood tests, normal. They sent me home and told me it should get better. I feel like stress definitely made it worse, and I could not really pinpoint the symptoms because I think the prednisone made it more of a full body thing for me, tingling everywhere and weird sensations.  \n  \nMy symptoms at this point are :  \n-less sensitivity back/inner thigh (both I thought at the time but maybe just the left)\n-numbness around anus (perineum seemed fine I think, scrotum also unaffected)\n-less urge to pee, weak stream\n-leg weakness\n-back pain\n-left side of penis numb  \n  \nFor the next 2 months I am back at college, everything seems to be getting better. I am back in the gym and almost back to where I was at the beginning of summer and no pain, leg days seemed to help my symptoms. Within the past 2 weeks or so though, calf raises have caused some kind of sciatic pain in my foot/toe every rep, and just bending my toe causes pain sometimes. It is also been tingling faintly starting yesterday. Only in my left side\n  \nAll of the sudden, yesterday I felt like I had diminished urge to pee. I woke up this morning with zero urge despite going and voiding maybe 100-200 ml. I feel like I am retaining still, my penis is still half numb. My anus is numb occasionally, and recently I noticed that my anal sphincter is gaping when I spread my cheeks and look. Abnormal and I do not do anal or stick anything up there so very unusual, especially considering it was overly tight a few months ago. I have some ED, I do not get random erections and no morning wood. This has been on and off and got better for awhile but is now back to nothing. They say every case is unique. I had l4-l5 disc issues for decades. One day something happened in the disc and the best way I can describe it is a sudden pain and what felt like glass shattering inside. Suddenly I was in severe pain at any movement and felt like my ass muscles were weighted down with rocks. I lost bladder, sensation and anus control.\n\nI did not have health insurance so I delayed going in. I became paralyzed from the waist down and the nerve damage was so bad in the first 48 hours it looked as if someone were playing a xylophone on my leg muscles. I held out for 6-7 days before calling the bankruptcy wagon. It took me 3-4 months to learn how to walk without a walker after the surgery and 10 days in a hospital. I rehabbed while homeless and living in a small van. 25 months later and I am about 90% recovered. \n\nI would get multiple opinions but a scan is the only way to know for sure. How accurate are scans in diagnosis? The MRIs I had back in August look normal. It is hard to find mri data on CES, but from the few examples I have compared mine to mine look completely normal, though of course I am not a doc and do not know what I am looking at, but there is not any herniation from what I see or in the report I had. I do not know if it is worth going back in if it is likely not changed.  \n  \nDo you think it is possible to have CES with a normal mri and no back pain? I have no idea. Based on the ER doctor's initial assessment they were going to roll me out without a scan and call it back pain. I think it was fear of a lawsuit that forced his hand in giving an uninsured patient a costly test. The MRI verified the herniated disc so there must be some evidentiary conclusion available by scans in most cases. This seemed pretty standard in most diagnostic situations from what I read at the time. It was an MRI that defined my issue as well. I am not a doctor, but they listened to my symptoms, did an MRI, and then were like \"Oh no. We are going surgery right now.\" If it is caused by a ruptured disc, that should show up on an MRI. I am not aware of other causes, but again, not a doctor. Interesting. Appreciate the help. If I may ask, was there a particular event that you can definitively link to your CES like a fall/crash? Or did it just kind of seemingly happen? Do you recall a specific event that caused your CES if you do not mind me asking? My disc would bulge/slip out 2-3 times a year for over 25 years. I was walking out of a Goodwill carrying a framed Kiss concert poster I was going to flip when the mass hernia occurred affecting the nerve cluster. \n\nTypical degeneration over time amplified by excessive weight, poor posture and a lack of core strengthening. Aye. I would been suffering back pain for a long while. BAD back pain. On again, off again. This was On Again.  Cannot sit in a car and drive my daughter to a place because of back pain. While trying, horrific pain in the front yard, coming back from the car, fell down in the yard. Bobwire in my lower spine. \n\nMade it to the bed with help and hardship. It hurt. \n\nThe next day, working...family brought me my laptop in bed. It was a Sunday. I realized I had zero pain. Holy crap, I went to tell my wife my back was better. I fell on the floor because my legs did not work right. Baby deer legs. \n\nFamily got me back on the bed. Wife insisted we go to the ER. I demured. But then I needed the bathroom, and it was hard to walk there, I walked like a baby deer, and I could not feel my butt. (That is actual horror for all you Halloween folks). Nothing hurt.\n\nWe went to the ER. They did an MRI and had me in surgery in an hour. I got away with a little nerve damage on my left leg. I am still in Physical Therapy. I declined pain meds at the ER. Nothing hurt. Could not feel anything knees to belly button. Zero pain. Your milage may vary. Yes. It does. For me, it was evident on the MRI. Even without knowing what you are looking at, if you look at my MRI it is clear. Idk if it is possible to have a normal MRI, but I thought I would share my experience. My back also hurt so bad and my legs were so weak I could not stand up.\n\n( Oh man yeah. How are you doing now? Dam 2 massive herniations I am okay. My surgery was October last year. I have very little feeling in my feet and legs, and my control over my bowels is not what it used it to be. My back hurts all of the time (but I have had back issues since high school). But I can walk! It is just a new way of life and a new body that I do not fully understand yet.    I am very fortunate, actually.\n\nThanks for asking :)", "Suspect of ces I had been suffering from sciatica pain for about 2-3 years. Pain will be usually on my right leg and it would radiate down to my calf. Sleeping was impossible, i would wake up with worse pain, never was able to find a good position without my sciatica bugging me . \n\nThen on jan 3rd I was going to start getting for work and i just collapse from this unbearable pain. I lost my sensation to urinating, i had to push to be able to get something out. I spent the whole day trying to get better for the next day to go to work. I just got worse could not even balance myself or walk without any help, my both legs felt pins and needles and numb in the saddle area . \n\nI was looking online for when is it time to go the hospital from sciatic pain and that is when i read that if my bladder or bowel get disrupted is urgent . So i went the next day and they took me right in got my MRI done and showed i had a herniated disc. Got my surgery done on the 5th and surgeon said it was worse than he thought in the future there is a 30% chance that i will need a fusion. \n\nNow  almost 3 weeks now, I am able to walk a little bit better, i am using a walker and get PT Still cannot use the bathroom correctly. Surgeon never mentioned to me about ces but in my mri he wrote I am a ces suspect. \n\nHe mentioned Im very lucky i came in just in time before any worse nerve damage or I could have been paralyzed. It sounds like your situation is similar to mine, in that it came on so suddenly that if I had not acted when I did, I would have been paralyzed as well. As for the urination issue, I am going to get real candid right now because I was not prepared, and everything that happened (including the aftermath) fell completely under that \u201cNever in a million years did I think it could happen, let alone to me\u201d umbrella and I do not want that happening to you. You might be risking further issues without realizing it.\n\n16+ hours passed between my initial symptoms and landing in the ER. This meant I had not urinated at all that day, but because I could not feel anything below the waist I did not realize how dire it was. The ER nurse told me my bladder was so full and stretched out I had nearly caused permanent damage, and put me on a catheter to give my body a break. After the surgery, they sent me home with the catheter and set me up with a urologist. They said it was possible I would need it permanently. They tried to see if I, like you, could go on my own, but nothing doing. Fortunately, my body began to heal. I did not need the catheter anymore, and things improved. But I was damn close to not being okay. \n\nTalk to your doctor, whether it be a follow up with your surgeon, a urologist or just your PCP. They can do tests that will let them see if you are fully emptying your bladder. Drink water like it is your job. Do not force yourself to try and go too often - you do not want your bladder to \u2018shrink down\u2019, which can also cause problems. \n\nI do not mean to scare you, but please get ahead if this as soon as you can. Feel free to reach out, and best of luck \ud83d\udc95 Thank you so much for this information. \nToday has been a lot better but since surgery I have been going to get a colonic hydrotherapy to help with my bowel movements. I was so close to leaving the hospital with a catheter but since i was able to push on my own two days after surgery the surgeon was surprised. \n\nI dont talk to him until 3 weeks from now but def will make an app with my primary doc. \n\nIt so scary not being able to do anything but I am been trying to stay positive and motivating myself because it is hard you end up thinking ( am i going to be like this forever) \n\nKeeping my head up", "I had a lamenectomy &amp; discectomy... now what? A couple weeks ago I went into the ER with CES Sx. I had a lamenectomy and discectomy. Since then most of my Sx are gone but I still have parasthesia in my left foot. It ranges from numbness to tingling and pins and needles to burning. I am also currently on Duloxitine and pregabalin. So where do I go from here? I do have a f/I appointment in March with the surgeon, in the experience here will my Sx improve? How anyone have any idea how my future could go? My profession is military. (Not a desk job) \n\nThanks for your help. Every case is different, but you need to allow a long time (think years) for your symptoms to fully improve. I had some numbness in my toes that went away after a few weeks, but some people never fully improve. Your best outcomes can be statistically predicted by the length of time which your nerves were compressed before surgery. Within 48 hours of symptom onset is best. Unfortunately it was longer than 48 hours. I was in the hospital for 72 hours before the surgery and it was about 48 hours or more for the onset of symptoms. I went into emerg 3 times in one week. The first time I was given T3s and discharged because I did not have urinary retention or bowel incontinence.   Just a slew of parasthesia and severe pain. the second time 3 days later I was given hydromorphone and discharged and the finally the third time I had urinary retention issues for about 24 hours when I went in and was admitted That is not awful! Nerves take a really long time to heal. Ask questions at your follow-up and see if they might know more. If numbness is your only symptom right now I am hopeful that it will go away eventually.", "Anyone with CES and surgery continue doing physical work after in the trades? Please share, I need your inspiration. Just wanted to vent- \n\nI recently decided to go into powerline, aka, get all my certifications and sign up for school to become a lineman and several days later went completely numb in the groin, after doing a bunch of driving and moving stuff from my old place to my new spot.\nAfter 10 days of numbness and several chiropractic visits, still numb, so today saw my primary care doctor. As I feared, she thinks I might have cauda equina and I am getting an MRI tomorrow morning. Praying to god all of this will not get in the way of my dream career.\n\nRight now I just feel crushed. I cannot stand desk jobs or working with desktop computers. \n\nIf any of you have had this CES and returned to highly physical work afterwords, I would love to hear about it. The best advice I can give you is do not put the surgery off if it is indeed CES. The longer you go, the more likely you will have lasting disability. My personal experience I had severe pain and saddle area numbness presurgery. Post surgery, took me awhile to walk...my pain is nearly gone, but my left foot is numb and both legs are numb. I am walking again, albeit not great. I had my surgery 9/30/20. I am unsure when it started as I put off going to the hospital but once I was in the hospital, my surgery was less than 12 hours after my MRI. I personally cannot imagine going back to a labor intensive job, but one thing I have noticed is every case is different and physical therapy helps a ton. Good luck! No matter what it is not the end of the world, even if you have to change plans. It is possible I think if treated early enough I think. There is a case study of military soldier who got CES and was treated soon enough that after 18 days of recovery after surgery went back to full military duties. I have no clue how rare or common it is for someone to recover that well after surgery. \n\n I appreciate your advice. If the doctor suggests it, I will reluctantly follow through with the findings and suggestions of the doc. I really do not want surgery, but if it meant the back issues I have been struggling with for ten years could be resolved, it would bring me hope. Received a stark warning of that when my hip gave out twice this morning just walking to the coffee maker. I refuse to give up my dream job- I think if surgery is imminent I will go to a different hospital than my local one, I do not particularly trust the abilities of people in this town tbh. I get my MRI in a few hours... we will see what happens. Trying not to freak out! This was exactly what I needed- I am so so so glad you shared this. I think attitude and hope are huge factors in how procedures can turn out and I want to uphold that to better my chances if I do need surgery. \n\nPart of me hopes I am just wigging myself out and everything will be fine, or in my mother\u2019s words, that I am just being \u201cdramatic\u201d and it is \u201call in my head\u201d\n\nI am so sorry to anyone who has experienced the fear, pain, and interruption such issues have had on their life. My heart goes out to all affected. \n\nThank you again for the inspiration- I will hold onto this ever so tightly today. &lt;3 Do not freak out! Like I said, the earlier it is treated the better. It is good that you are taking the steps you need to to make sure your body remains healthy. Every case of CES is different, but early intervention seems to be what allows most people to retain function. I personally could not go back to a high intensity labor job, but the ones I had were never my dream job and if they were, I probably could. Having CES does not need to mean the end of your life. :) let us know how it goes. Get surgery immediately. I work as a massage therapist and have for several years. It took me about three months to relearn how to walk post-emergency surgery. I returned to work after about four months and have been doing fine . Thank you for being so supportive and sweet. I am awaiting my first MRI right now, and have to come back for a second one later. I will let you all know what happens! Fingers crossed! Please do! That is very motivating to hear, that people are healing and getting better after surgery! And you!!! Helping others feel good while going through recovery- I SO admire that. You must have a beautiful heart my dear. Thank you for sharing your experience, it really helps!", "cauda equina impingmenet Hi. \n\nI went to the dr with severe pain and cramping in my right thigh. I have had an ultrasound that showed nothging, and a ct scan that showed severe degeneration in my lumbar spine particularly L4, L5 and S1, including cauda equina  impingment. \n\nI have since had an MRI and been triaged by a neurosurgeon (private) who will see me in 4 weeks.\n\nI dont know the official diagnosis but have been told what constitutes an emergency by my rheumatologist. \n\nBut my biggest problem is I dont know what I can and cannot do for the next 4 weeks. Can i walk, my rheumatologist was asking me about stairs, should i not climb stairs? My grandbabies, can I lift them? They weigh about 6 kilos each.  Can I lift anything? \n\nComplete rest  and endone  have made the pain bearable. Im am anxious to leave the house. I see my gp next week but she has already told me she has no idea what to do.\n\ncan someone please tell me how to proceed while i wait for the official diagnosis. \n\nFemale, 62 years. This is the same location as my CES.\n\nMy recommendation is to do as little as possible but to do what you find bearable/tolerable.\n\n In my experience,  nobody knows your thresholds quite the way that you will yourself. Be prepared to tell people you love \"No.\" If it is something you cannot do then it is only going to hurt you to try.\n\nI will say that my CES pain crossed the threshold doing something as seemingly simple as bending over and picking the family dog's bowl up to feed him. I would not pick up anything heavier than a gallon of milk, if you can I would try not to do stairs much if at all, see if your doctors can get you in with a physical therapist, Also I find using an ice pack to numb the area if in extreme pain to be very useful, keep in mind I do not know your pain level or know your range of physical limitations so only you can judge but if your in pain I would take things slow and easy till your doctors appointment. Best wishes\nMale 29, 10 years L4-L5 &amp; L5-S1 I would use normal spinal precautions and not Bend, Lift or Twist (BLT). Which is hard because we often do not think about how often we do these things. lol Good Luck. Hope you fell better soon. Thankyou.  I appreciate your thoughts. I do feel as if I could go for a walk. Avoiding stairs and inclines. I also feel like I can hold my grandbabies but only if someone puts them in my lap. Lifting is out because I think packing some boxes to downsize  led to this 'attack'. I am already using a grabber to pick things up. Good to see you are already using preventable measures. When you walk make sure you have a way to contact someone if you get stuck.\n\nGood luck! I have a high tolerance to pain. I have suffered from chronic pain( not back) and myalgia conditions for 10 years. If my right thigh was not cramping I would have no idea what was going on in my back. Thank you for replying. Thank you. I appreciate your input.  I also wonder if this always ends in surgery? I guess I will not know until I see the neurosurgeon. But any thoughts on that? When you say the ultrasound showed nothing, what does that mean? When I was at the ER they asked me to go to the bathroom and after I went, a nurse did an ultra sound on my bladder and said that it was full. I had no sensation that my bladder was full so I tried again and it took me about 10 minutes to empty my bladder completely. After a few days of surgery when my catheter was removed I had ultra sounds done on my bladder every few hours to determine if I needed to go to the bathroom or not. Now that I am back working I have to keep track of how much fluids I have drank and force myself to urinate since that sensation is completely gone now. \n\nAs far as lifting goes, you have a 4 week timeline to meet the surgeon (unless you need to be rushed to an ER) so I would take it easy and avoid lifting anything that requires proper lifting techniques or your core muscles. Also do not expect much help from a GP if you have CES, the ER doctors told me it affects something like 1 in 50,000 people so in a city of 1 million people maybe 20 other people have it so chances are you are the first CES patient that your GP has. They will learn about CES through your experiences since they probably glanced over that page or were too hung over to remember it during medical school.  Hope this helped, I am a 29 year old guy btw. Hi. The ultrasound was for pain in my thigh. After two weeks and me complaining my gp sent me for a CT scan. That came back and yes my GP said she had no idea and sent me to my rheumatologist. Who was a little bit shocked that I did not realise what was happening. Found some numb spots on my legs and sent me  for a MRI and sent a referral to a neurosurgeon. He triaged me from ct and MRI.  I have not actually got a diagnosis yet. Everyone seems to have seen cauda equina impingement and  escalated the tests.  But no one told me what to do or not to do. I was warned to go to the ER if I lost control of my bowel or bladder. Or felt I was losing sensation. But it is all a bit confusing. When my lower back and ached my thigh feels a little better when my thigh is very bad my back pain is negligible. If a qualified neurosurgeon, who knows what CES is!, says a month wait is ok then do not worry too much. Avoid strain or twisting your back and try to rest.\nAn acute case \u2018should\u2019 be operable within 24hrs to minimise further damage. \n\nGood luck I had something very similar happen to me recently. I developed a pain above left butt cheek that felt like a knife was piercing me, my  leg knee down got super tight/squeezed, and lastly whole leg got numb including foot. I am fused L1-L4 due to a tumor removed 7 years ago at L3 L4. They thought possible CES as I could not go number 2 either for 7 days and even had 2 peeing accidents where I could not get to the toilet in time but bladder showed I was emptying okay. MRI showed arachnoiditis at caude equina. Any mention of that? Btw I am 57 years old.  Thank you for replying. No mention of that. But I will re read the CT scan. I feel like I am in a holding pattern and it is hard not to just pick something up or bend over. I have had no bowel or bladder issues. I have noticed my bum go numb a couple if times but I do think it is because I am sitting heavily and weirdly to try to relive the pain in my thigh. I am sorry. Sure hope they figure out for sure what is going on! CES is major and the ER has a complete protocol to diagnose it. Worst case I would go to the ER to determine if that is for sure what is is. They did bloodwork, urine test, ultrasound to see if bladder was empty, and emergency MRI. Turned out I also had a UTI besides arachnoiditis. Just a thought if u want one thorough exam to rule it out ( or in). Also my GP would not have a clue either. I am meeting with a neurosurgeon in a few weeks to see what my options are and unfortunately your neurologist that you are going to see is who will be the only one to help with your questions depending on what is going on. Good luck!!! This sounds like a herniated disc pressing on that area (which can cause CES). Def do not do anything that causes pain. Just play it safe and sit a lot til u see neurologist. Thank you for replying. It is always good to know you are not alone. I am starting a list of questions for the neurosurgeon. I am in Australia so I will have to transfer to the public system sooner or later. But in an emergency situation the public hospital will see me straight away. I am paying to see a private neurosurgeon to figure out my next steps. I would recommend doing a search for cauda equina syndrome, read up on it.    has some fabulous people and can be enormous help.  \n\nBest of luck! If your symptoms change, be sure to notify your drs.", "Guys can a small penile urethral stricture cause ces A week after my stricture, I had an erection and I had this pain in my scrotum area, and the area between the genitals and anus for about 40 Mins, but then I cannot feel my urine within my penis, and my pee flow has got worse, that is it, is it ces? No", "Any ideas? I am asking about this again because I am not sure what else to do.  I should preface this by saying I work 8-10 hours a day at a desk, am in my late 20s, average but slightly slender build, 160lb weight and just under 6 ft tall. Summer of 2019 I went to a PT for some knee issues, I had never had any back issues leading up to this point but they were not making progress on my knee pain I got from doing a lot of stupid things so they said oh maybe it is your back causing your knee pain. I assured them it was not as I knew how I hurt them but they insisted on having me do McKenzie push-ups. They pressed down on my lower back as I did these and I have basically had lower back pain ever since. It started very mild and was on and off but stable until February of 2020 when I bought a new car and something about the seats did not agree with whatever was going with my lower back because that purchase marked the beginning of a long slow decline in my neurological health. My symptoms almost immediately went from on and off mild pain, to moderate back pain (spiking to moderate/severe pain after 30mins in that particular car), bladder spasms, urgency, frequent urination, a feeling of heaviness in my feet, tightness in my calves, etc. Overtime some of these issues started out very bothersome and improved, others were mild at first and are now my chief complaints. Currently, what progressed to an almost complete inability to tell when I need to urinate (coming to a head in the last 3 weeks I would say) and heaviness in my feet with some reduced sensation which is most noticeable when driving, are the most bothersome symptoms. I am essentially going off a feeling of pressure in my abdomen to know when I need to urinate at this point. I do not have any issue initiating urination once I get to the toilet for whatever reason, I have not yet had any episodes of incontinence although it seems to be progressing to that inevitable point very slowly but surely. I also can feel when I am urinating and can stop and start the stream if I want. I have similar issues with not being able to tell when I need to have a bowel movement but this is either less problematic for me or that process has simply not been as severely damaged for whatever reason. My back pain is manageable and I can sit for 7-8 hours for work although I am sore by the end. If work a full day then go for a drive the reduced sensation in my feet is markedly worse than on a weekend when I am not sitting so much. I cannot drive for more than an hour at a time without my feet becoming too distant feeling to trust my input to the pedals and the low back pain also ramps up a bit usually. I cannot wear a belt, or wash a car without breaks due to all the bending over. I cannot wear most shoes as the shock seems to piss off my lower back, I cannot wear many jeans and elastic waisted shorts as the waist band is often not loose enough and causes my calves to start contracting and the back pain to ramp up if I wear them for more than 10 minutes. I have seen many GPs, 2 orthos, 2 neurologists and a neurosurgeon. I have had an EMG, a full spine and brain MRI (w/o contrast), $7k worth of bloodwork ordered by the neurologists. All of these tests were completely clear, per the last full spine MRI I had a few months ago I have no disc herniations or even bulges. I have a couple tiny ones in my cervical spine that the neurologist was surprised the neurosurgeon even noticed as they were barely visible on the scan but all clear besides that. There is no stenosis, I do not have diabetes or any chronic condition. MS was all but ruled out, they said the only extra thing they could do was do another scan with contrast but that my symptoms overall did not even match well with MS anyway. My personal opinion is that I have nerve compression in my lower back as a result of sitting all day. I used to work 14+ hours a day at a computer and stopped once my symptoms really started ramping up in early 2020. I believe either my severe anterior pelvic tilt and terrible posture and weak pelvic floor may be setting the stage for muscles and ligaments to be pulling my nerves there out of alignment or otherwise stretching them and damaging them, or the act of sitting in a chair so many hours caused enough direct compression of the nerves in the area of the cauda equina over time that that was about to damage them without a disc herniation being the culprit. No one seems to be taking this seriously and I have a strong feeling that will remain unchanged unless I become incontinent at which point my bathroom faculties will likely be too late to save. If this were presenting with a disc herniation it would be considered a medical emergency, but because that is absent no doctor I have seen seems to care at all and they basically shrug their shoulders and tell me to go PT, for what I do not know considering PT was actually the catalyst for this whole mess. Any thoughts or ideas are extremely welcome as I have a feeling the next 1-2 months are going to be critical in saving what I have left for urinary continence. Some kind of arachnoiditis as a complete guess? Good luck with finding an answer.", "My story So about a month or so ago\u2026. Oct 21st I woke up to extreme pain down both legs and numbness in my growing area. (Backstory: I had had a fall in 2014 and have had leg numbness on my left side on and off for years doctors chalked it up to sciatica and gave me pills or shots or pt) anyways , I went to my local er and went in waited in the lobby for 12 hours and finally got a room. They called my new neurologist (which I had just seen about a month ago and had been monitoring me and had me get a new set of tests and pt before we went under the knife) she told me that we were going to have emergency surgery to decompress the spine. She told me the symptoms were consistent with cauda equina syndrome and I had made the right decision in going to the er that day. Now 4 weeks plus post op I have had my ups and downs\u2026. The downs were the leg weakness and mental\u2026. Also my numbness is still a thing but it is getting better. The good news: my bladder after being on a catheter for 4 weeks had come back and I am monitoring the input and output. Also my bowel control has returned recently. The numbness is going away slowly which is to be expected but I can feel pins and needles on my toes. My crotch and butt are still numb but with things getting better my hope is good that they too will come back. I hope to not have to walk with a walker for too long \u2026 but I dodged a bullet\u2026.. I could have eventually been paralyzed\u2026. So I like to give some on here some hope and tell them to fight on. Thanks for reading this\u2026", "Hospital unable to treat me, very frustrated. ...My primary doctor is basically not seeing people in person because of COVID and I cannot get an in person appointment for a month and a half.   \n\nI go to the walk in because my back pain is pretty significant. I went to the chiropractor and he said I have a herniated disc a couple weeks ago. \n\nFor the past week and a half I have become incontinent of the bladder. I am peeing myself almost every morning. I am only 30 this is a new thing for me. I also have a lot of weakness and often have to hold on to a counter or wall to steady myself. My legs shake. \n\nThe walk in was concerned it is CES so they sent me to the hospital. This hospital was supposed to have a bariatric (overweight accommodating) MRI machine. I was there for 7 hours. For them to finally tell me that they do not have an open MRI and I cannot use the one they have.   \n\nThey offered to keep me to do some other special imagine but that it is \u201cnot that good\u201d and I would of had to stayed till Monday. They said \u201cor go to your primary and get a referral for an MRI.\u201d \n\nI am so mad. I do not have a lot of the other symptoms that you present with this syndrome and I have read some posts with people explaining their pain being astronomical so I think there is a good chance it is not CES but I am still very annoyed. Would also like to stop peeing myself every morning. They said it appears I could have a mild uti so they gave me antibiotics and that could be why I am inc. You should escalate it further. Try going to another facility that has an open mri machine. \n\nThe same thing happened to me, albeit more sudden and severe. I was admitted into an emergency room at my local hospital on a Saturday. They waited until Monday before attempting the MRI and I did not fit. So I had to wait until early Wednesday morning before I was transferred and by then I was dead from the waist down.\n\nHad surgery to correct it, but the surgeon informed me that with this injury, it is IMPERATIVE that they operate asap to try and prevent last nerve damage.\n\nGo to another er, Google the facilities to see which ones have open MRI machines if need be. If it is causa equina, time is of the essence to prevent lasting damage. Urinary incontinence and saddle numbness are the big indicators. But any numbness should be enough of a red flag to push for an MRI. \n\nI will very likely never walk again, so do not let them do to you what they did to me. If you are losing bladder control that is a very emergent finding. Regardless of pain or if you think others might have more pain\u2026 this needs to be addressed now or you may never have function of your bladder again and could become paralyzed. Do not let them tell you they cannot help you. Go to the hospital. Girl. You need to get treatment, ASAP. Once you lose bladder retention, I have heard it is very difficult to come back from. It is serious and could very well paralyze you. If the hospital for some reason does not seem alarmed, you need to demand they do something. Seriously. I went to hospital the minute I noticed I could not pee and I attribute that and the swift action of the emergency room and surgeon for the fact that I can walk and I have mostly normal functioning bladder and bowel now. \n\nYour situation is an emergency and you very likely need surgery as soon as possible They told me no hospital in the state has an open MRI that they \u201ccalled around\u201d \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \nI will go back Monday. I emailed my PCP and gave her a verification run down as well. \nI could not find much on it but I was wondering if you can have this condition on a lesser serious level and it get progressively worse?   \nOr with CES is it usually a very quick thing that happens? \n...if you know Thank you for your advice! We are you having the opposite issue of not being able to go?   \nThat was one test they did do \u201cpost void ultrasound\u201d but said I seemed to be emptying well From what I have heard it starts as retention, but then moves onto incontinence. I could be wrong but regardless, bladder or bowel issues of any kind should be investigated...especially if CES was suspected. I am not trying to scare you...I just know I am totally miserable right now and cannot imagine how miserable I would be if I waited any longer. Thank you. I am sorry to hear you in pain. I am planning on going back for imaging on Monday. I appreciate your advice. Wishing you the best! It is not pain...it is the numbness and circulation issues. My feet are ALWAYS cold and I am numb from the waist down on my left side. I am very fortunate though, I am not paralyzed...I am not inconinent..and I have my sexual function. I honestly advise you to not wait until Monday\n\n\nEdit: for context, I went into the ER and 10 hours later was in surgery. They wanted to operate THAT NIGHT but for whatever reason did not. The timeline for CES really can be very short. \n\nGood luck to you, dear. I would like to know how you make out. Good luck !! Wishing you well!! It can absolutely happen gradually. I do not know if you have Facebook, but there are two groups I am a part of that are wonderful resources. Cauda equina syndrome and cauda equina syndrome survivors. Get in there, even if it means creating a Facebook profile. Hundreds of people from around the world with similar stories to ours.\n\nNow then saying they do not have an open mri? Plausible, but they certainly have bariatric accommodations. Start taking notes of the people you interact with. If it is CES and they are denying you health care, it can a pretty serious situation. Start getting names of people you are being treated by. Start having them put down in your health records that you asked and they were the ones that denied you treatment. That will light a fire under their assew as now they are named and documented refusing you service.\n\nBladder incontinence, numbness in the legs and saddle/ass/groin area is a serious red flag.\n\nDo not be an asshole, but be firm and document who /where /when because if they deny you and it goes bad, you will at least have options down the line if things do get worse.", "Should I go get an MRI ASAP? Frequent urination. Frequent urination? Could it be my back?\n\n26 year old male. I herniated disc in my lower back on the right side 5 years ago from lifting. Overtime it got better and then starting 3 years ago it would flare up every so often. I have had on and off pain ever since.\n\nStarting 3 years ago when I do sit ups my left core does not burn or engage. This past year when I do body squats or light dead lifts my whole left side of my back caves in. I have now pain radiating into my shoulder blade. I have had ligament popping and clicking in my back last 2 years only on my left side/hip area. My hips seem very out of line and it hurts when I do light jogging. I almost have a limp when I walk. \n\nThe last 6 months I have been having weird urination pain that is on and off and now the past 3 weeks it is getting out of hand with frequent urination. I have seen my doctor, 2 urgent care doctors, a general surgeon and a urologist who ran urine tests and did an ultra sound on my abdomen/bladder in the last couple of months. All my blood and urine tests from all doctors and ultra sound came back fine.\n\nCould my frequent urination could be nerve related? Is it possible after years of not getting my back checked and I run and lift 5-6 times a week still pushing through the pain, could I have really damaged my nerves and spine? \n\nShould I go see a back doctor ASAP? I mean, im surprised noone has scanned your spine yet. Go get it checked bro.", "UTI - Male - 2 + since Cauda Equina (UK) I was operated on for laminectomy and discectomy in march 2020. I have always had to push to pee and poo since then and been in contact with my GP about it. I can pee relaxed but it takes time and I have to push out the last bit, always. \n\nMore recently in the past several months I have been feeling the needs to pee every 30 mins or so. I put this down to UTI as if I do not drink caffeine and drink water for the next couple of days it returns to normal. But this pattern has got worse recenelty. \n\nWhat are other experiences with UTI post op. Is caffeine an issue for you? Would be good to hear. \n\nThanks", "Is this CES? The physiological problem I have is with my lumbar spine. I have two discs protruding from their initial position between the vertebrae of the spine at L3-L4 and L4-L5 and a military neck. The L3 through L5 press onto the CNS slightly or more accurately the cauda equina, an extension of the CNS, which is a bundle of nerves that branch off of the spinal cord and attach to the bladder, intestine and the reproductive system. I have sciatica in my left leg and problems with erections and urine retention. Since the injury happened I have observed some symptoms especially with my erections since they are not hard enough.. But everyone tells me it is psychophysiological rather than physiological.. I believe I have chronic CES and slowly everything is worsening... My left knee became numb. I searched around a bit and found out that an extension of the sciatic nerve, which goes down through your whole leg thus the sciatica, called the peroneal nerve passed through there. But in the electromyography (EMG) it showed that it was not diseased and it was in the normal range of functionality. However the caveat is that whilst the nerve might be fine and dandy these are the extensions of the nerves that are connected with the nerves that are being compressed along with the SC... So I do not know if the functionality of those nerves has decreased and even worse will be decreasing. Should I worry if the MRI showed little to no disc protrusion? FFS get to a surgeon. Get help before you get seriously fucked up. Is it really CES??? No one listens to me and with COVID-19 I cannot do anything.. I want to die.... Take yourself to an emergency room as quickly as possible.\n\nTell them that you need an MRI immediately for potential cauda equina syndrome. I did an MRI in December and it showed no pressure on the CNS.. How long were you like that? I did an urodynamics test and it showed that I did not have a neurogenic bladder.. Unfortunately you might need to visit a hospital. \nRisks either way. My surgeon explains it so: pain is ok; shattering new pain is not, any loss of feeling especially not. He gives 24hrs as optimal time to operate. After that, who knows? \nI was 1 day lying with paralysed leg before my op( medical fuck up \ud83d\ude22) and I am now 50% disabled. And 13 yrs in...\n\nGet help. I have neither of the above should I worry? I am sorry for your disability..", "Positivity I know our condition sucks but we all have to think it could be worst. My first 2 years were super hard and now I am 4 years in and im doing a lot better mentally. 6 months after completing chemo and radiation for a brain tumor I started getting bad sciatica pain 6 months later and waiting too long to get checked out. I ended up being paralyzed from the waist down because of 4 brain tumors that leaked down my spine compressing L5-S2. I am incontinent, have a shunt in my brain, on hormone replacement and in a wheelchar with nerve pain but it could have been worst. I could be blind from the brain tumor by my optic nerve. I could be mentally challenged from the spinal fluid being blocked by my tumor. I could have no support system. My mind set has helped me a lot so lets all try to be positive. It\"s amazing to hear of someone who has been though so much have such an otimistic view and immense gratitude for what you do have, knowing and accepting it could be worse. Your positive mindset will help you overcome many life obstacles. I know my own situation could be much worse, at first I was battling depression over it (also 4 years in), now I am just gratefull that my CES is limited to what it is. Also blessed to have the support of my wife and kids.  Just know your post has made me even more grateful for what I do have in my life. It is good to have a reminder always. \n\nWishing you all the best. I needed this reminder today, thank you. Thank you, needed to hear this today, being positive makes the pain a little more bearable. Have today's free award, do not know what they mean but they look nice and at least I can acknowledge your message, thanks again from a fellow sufferer :) Likewise! You are very welcome You are welcome. I am happy to hear that. I fell twice this week. I pulled a muscle in my right leg and sprained my ankle in my right (my right is my bad side, I am numb so I often turn my ankle over). I read your post right after I texted my boyfriend about how I am a pos and worthless because I am disabled and cannot even go get myself water without hurting myself. \n\nMy surgery was 10/1/20 so it is been nearly a year. There is still time but I need to tell myself how fortunate I am that I can walk, even if I injure myself sometimes. It is super important to count your blessings. Yes there will be set backs you are definitely not a pos for that. Just keep a positive mind set and work hard in physical therapy", "Looking for general resources on recovery and treatment. Hi all, glad to see there is a group for this. There was not when I checked a few months back.\n\nAnyways, I am a 29 year old male that was diagnosed and undergone surgery in Nov 2019. The onset was sudden and intense. I did not undergo surgery until nearly four days after which is clearly affecting my recovery. \n\nNow I am ten months into my recovery and it is not going all too well.\n\nI am still doing physical therapy, acupuncture and trying to be as productive as possible, but it is tough as I am sure we all know. So I am just trying to reach out about what treatments have helped others. Hi!\n\nI have not really had a lot of success with any individual therapies. It is all been about working and improving in my own space. I have a sports background and know a few sports doctors for pro teams so have a leg up on most and their advice has helped more than anything, to be honest.\n\nWhat are the primary issues that you are still being afflicted by? Well in ten months I have regained I would say about 70% of strength from waist to knee. My bowels comply about 95% of the time. Urinating is still an issue I rely on catheterization. Saddle numbness is strong. As is numbness running down my legs. The outside and slightly back side of my legs are completely numb. And my feet are pretty much useless and completely numb still.\n\nMy main curiosity now is trying to find any info on stem cell therapy and ces. My new neurologist suggested I look into clinical trials, but I am doing research into the stem cell stuff and have not been able to find any one that has gone that route and has info to share on it.\n\nI would love to be able to get some use back in my feet so I could stand and walk a bit.\n\nBeing in a wheelchair sucks, especially when it comes to hygiene when you do not have great control over your bodily functions. It does not sound like I am doing anything you have not already, but different physiotherapists can make a huge difference. The physio my surgeon referred me to was sub-optimal. \n\nDuring my first 4 visits, she did not do any tests to see where I was at physically. My appointments would be in 3 stages: \n\n1. Learn to do a suuuuuuuuuper basic core exercise (e.g. Week 1 was me laying on my back, tightening my abs.)\n2. Then she would do ultrasound therapy on my back for 10 minutes (aka, roll a wand around with some goo on it).\n3. Then I would go lay under a tens machine for 15 minutes with a heating pad on my back.\n\nI am sure this was the level of care some people need, but I was already too strong for these exercises. I ended up going to a different physio, one who has no equipment (e.g. the tens machines, ultrasound machines, etc.) in their office. They gave me a full neurological workout, and came up with a whole regime that is helping me.\n\nWhat I am getting at is, maybe it is worth seeing a different physio. \n\n(I am also doing electrostim acupuncture - I personally do not feel like it is helping, but the chiropractor doing it claims it is helping to keep the nerves viable. I am getting stronger, so maybe he is right. I dunno.)", "mri symtpoms hey guys, i have some symptoms of siatica and back pain in last month. in the last 2 days urine leakage has added. i have today mri and my question is if the guy who doing the test can tell me if i have cauda eqjina syndrome before the full result is coming? (2 weeks for the result, and i get a disc today) In Canada, the MRI technician would not be allowed to tell you.\n\nThat being said, CES can be a slow onset, so sudden bladder problems could be a sign."]
