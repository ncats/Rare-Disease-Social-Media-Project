["Could it be dermatographia? Hi all! The internet has finally led me to the term \"Dermatographia\" after constant googling trying to figure out what has been happening to me this week. It started 5 days ago and now I am taking prednisone and multiple antihistamines a day trying to control it. The full body itching, the raised welts where I have hardly scratched. It almost perfectly fits into the dermatographia description except for one thing... I get hives. If I scratch a large area, instead of just one thin line, like my entire thigh for example, I npt only experience redness and swelling but also lots and lots of little hivey welts! Yes, I can write the word \"Test\" all over my body and see the words become angrier and redder over time before inevitably fading, and after scratching my back my boyfriend commented that it looks like I have been whipped. But I am not seeing anyone else describing the hives... Can anyone chime in? Does your dermatographia include hives? Yes, when I am having a really bad case I will get hives pretty frequently. Yours sounds like a classic case to me, welcome to the club! Not only is this a miserable experience but now I also have to kiss my exfoliating scrubs and loofah goodbye. I am big sad. Hopefully you are one of the cases that gets 'flare-ups' and you will have windows of opportunity to resume your normal life! It could have been triggered by dry winter air, stress, you name it. Yep, when I scratch I get hives. Angry ones with a thousand raised bumps. \nWhat helped me: cutting alcohol, ice (I got ice rollers from target to roll over my skin instead of scratching and it feels soooo nice), morning showers with skin soothing body wash from Target, and applying eczema lotion with colloidal oatmeal morning and night. \nI also bought soft silk jammies so my skin does not get scratchy at night and I use a product called Dermaplast on my itchy spots before bed so I will not scratch at night. Sounds like a lot but really it is not bad haha. I really want to avoid taking Zyrtec as much as I can because you can \u201caddicted\u201d to them, in that when you stop your symptoms could worsen ( Same thing happened to me about a week ago. On day 5 of prednisone, I went back to the doctor and they diagnosed me with dermatographia. They prescribed an anti-itch pill and Zyrtec. Get some anti itch cream, like calamine. It will help a lot! As someone who has had hives and now 10 years of dermatographism, it can look and feel exactly like hives. When my allergist first diagnosed me, he gently moved a pen with the cap on it over a part of my arm that was not already inflamed. It left a red welty trail, which was the tell tail sign that it was dermatographism and not normal hives. I would recommend trying that in an area that is not already inflamed to see if it is dermatographism. What happened  5-10 days ago that could possibly  bring this on?  I call where I scratched hives when it blows up.  U r also referring to the red inflamed discoloration all over, correct, not related to touch   Only time I got those was an allergy to oral antibiotics.... 10+ yrs prior to Dermatographia.  On new meds recently?  Anything else new u consumed?  \n\nWhat did doctor  say?", "Ffs we need a cure soon This shit is getting more and more common and if we dont get a cure for this soon i will cut of my skin. I have had this since late december and i hate it. Some flare ups are terrible, but it can get better! Wishing you the best, and hopefully you will find something to get relief! My boyfriend has it and we used to really enjoy drawing dicks on his arm but he took a lot of vit C this winter and now his skin does not raise any more AT ALL. I am sure you have probably tried everything though, I hope something can work for you oh i can try that thx :) btw for how long did he take it? Thank you \ud83d\ude00. Just wish i never got this \ud83d\ude14. he is been taking it since the beginning of the Aussie autumn so beginning of March. About 3 months. He is taking it for immune support and general health but it seems the dermatographia has calmed down everywhere except his back - if I give it a good scrape it will still raise and itch. Alright, Thanks again \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d Hi again. I started taking vitamin C now for 2 weeks and it has helped a bit actually. Was just wondering how long it took for your bf skin to not raise again. \n\nThx :)", "Joining the club I have been getting recurrent hives on my legs and arms over the past several weeks and had no idea what was causing it.  I came to the realization today that itching it just added more hives!  I had heard of dermatographia before and decided to try some artwork on my arms with a light touch of my nail.  I was surprised to see hives form in those shapes within a few minutes!  My inner science nerd is super excited, until I remember I now have itchy hives in random shapes/names covering my body.... Is there a way I cancel my membership to this club? Sure, sacrifice your first born child to Cthulu and let me know when it is done. Ah of course, why did not I think of this", "My 10+ years of Hiving Journey Hey guys, I just want to document down here my version of hives+dermatographia. Hopefully, someone here with the same situation could shed some light on how to make my life better. \n\nI categorized my hives/rashes under these 3 types,\n\nAntihistamine I am taking: bilaxten / cetirizine\n\n1) 10+ years of Normal hives(red raised welts) --&gt; This can be easily contained by antihistamine\n\n2) 3 to 4 years of Non-Itchy Dermatographia  --&gt; This can be easily contained by antihistamine\n\n3) 3 to 4 years of &amp;%\\*#&amp;\\*&amp;\\*#% fking itchy Dermatographia --&gt; no amount of antihistamine can contain this. Took steroids before and does not help either. \n\nI will skip 1 and 2 since they came on very randomly but well contained with my antihistamine. \n\nThe killer #3 itch will come on 90% of the time just before it started raining even though I can be in an enclosed area such as my air-con office. My whole body from my face to my head scalp to my legs can be itchy like hell. There was once my colleague was asking me what happened to my forehead as it is covered in scratches/handwriting in the middle of the meeting. \n\nI can be in an enclosed area such as my aircon office but still, I will be itching like mad. No amount of antihistamine helps( i took like 6 x cetirizine and 1 x steroid at one shot). The only temporary \"cure\" is Suu balm, which in a way can help to reduce around 30% of the itch, but still not enough. \n\nMy face can be covered in red patches after i shower, and i assume its caused by my towel when i wipe my face. \n\nI would describe the itch as pricky, very sudden pricky type of itch, those type that you just cannot ignore it and you need to scratch it immediately. \n\nDid anyone encounter this strange trigger before? most people's triggers are when they are in contact with rain, but for me, it is just before it started to rain(where u see dark clouds, gloomy sky). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy life sucks Do you hydrate frequently? I have had flares like that, not related to rain tho, and moisturizing and drinking water have helped Ever get tested for allergies or thyroid issues? yes i do :( easily 1.5 litres in the daytime. not tested for any allergies. For thyroid yes and its ok. \n\nBut the thing here is the strange trigger --&gt; just before it rains. That sucks. Not sure how to handle the reaction to incoming rain. You may have to come about it a different way, meaning look for a food allergy or other reaction and try to lower your inflammation levels which should also help the dermatographia", "Itchy again :( Ok so I recently wrote a post last week about my Dermatographia acting up. I changed allergy meds, and that seems to help\u2013for the most part. It is not as good as what I was taking before, but it is fine. But now all of the sudden I have this rash that is covering my stomach, chest, and possibly my back (hard to tell but it is really itchy). The bumps are really small so they are not hives. I do not know if this is related to Dermatographia, but it flared up right after taking the new allergy pills. I also have around 8 red bumps that each consist of tiny clustered bumps all over my body. They itch and will not go away. I actually had that same exact thing on my forearms. It went away after a week but itched like crazy.", "When you are distracted by work and accidentally scratch the random itch on your arm \ud83d\ude10  this is so annoying!", "Who diagnosed you? For those with a diagnosis what specialist did it come from? Dermatologist, Autoimmune, rheumatologist, primary care?\n\nI have got a myriad of things going on and feel like it is going to be a laundry list of order by elimination.\n\nJust before lockdown I got a referral from my PCP for rheumatology, gastroenterology and an AI.\n\nI have ALWAYS, since a child had the \"drawing\" ability. Intense, hateful itchiness started sporadically back in my early 20s. Saw an allergist and all they could (wanted to do) is allergy prick tests and offer serum injections (but my barely reactive dog allergy was moot, I did not have/contact with dogs). So I started taking cetrizine 10mg daily as the itch progressed to a daily issue. Literally need to take cetrizine on the 24th hour or *else*.\n\nWith things being tenuous I want to try and limit going to more doctor's than necessary. I saw a great Immunologist after a referral from a GP doctor who found out I needed antihistamines daily. Good luck! My primary care physician I was diagnosed by my allergist. They did various allergy testing on me as well, but once she saw my drawing ability she diagnosed me right away. My dermatologist primary care physician said she thinks i have it but sent me to allergist to confirm Dermatologists. Got referred because of the intense, unexplained itching. Asked me to take my top off to check my skin..took one look and said he knew what it was before touching me (I assume from bra strap marks?), but confirmed by dragging a wooden stick (like a lolly stick) across my skin. Prescribed a barrier moisturiser and antihistamines. \nBest of luck with everything!! Hope you get some sense soon. Had it since I was a child, my mum dismissed it claiming it was \u201cjust sensitive skin\u201d. Somehow I came across an image of someone else who had Dermatographia so I started googling on last year (22yrs old now) I had been experiencing other illnesses that took me to the hospital &amp; I said Oh BTW I think I have dermatographia. They sent me to a dermatologist to confirm. She said yes. Heres an allergy test (lots patches on my back) all negative except extreme reaction to nickel. Was told to avoid nickel and take antihistamines daily... (which I do not. I try manage it with self restraint and patience \ud83d\ude02) My allergist did and I also have cold urticaria, so that is great \ud83d\ude11 My allergist mentioned it. I also had a ton of tests because she/others cannot diagnose my anaphylaxis trigger. If I do not take my med regimen it gets worse. Also heat/exercise/summer is exacerbates the condition. Exactly my story (except the shirt removal :)) first thing he did when I got in the room was the tongue depresser on my arm, then chatted with me for like 3 minutes before checking my arm again. He was going on about what a classic case this was, saying it is pretty uncommon and wishing his intern was there to see it. \n\nThis was after too many doctors insisting I had developed allergies and telling me to try a new clothing detergent again. I showed my family doctor a picture of the designs I had \"drawn\" on my arm and told him I thought I had dermatographia,  and he said I was \"Absolutely correct\" lol.  Does that count as a diagnosis? An allergist. I went because I have chronic sinus infections found out I have dermatographic urticaria when he asked me to scratch my arm before doing a patch test. He sent my blood work off no allergies ( \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) yet sinus infections every time the seasons change and constant sinus pressure and headaches. But he wants to keep seeing me for the dermographism.", "Red marks and lines everyday I wake up, is this Dermographia? I think for 2 weeks now everyday I wake up there is always red marks and lines on my arms and upper chest. It goes away after 40 mins. or something. When I am itching even though I only scratch it lightly It still become red, like very red. I think I have dermographia. Do you guys have any treatment or prevention? Same with me (and a bunch of other skin issues). The lines in the morning do not really bother me though, they are just there. The weird thing is they are only there sometimes, so who knows. I hope you find some relief! Yes, you have symptoms of dermatographia. But please consult with a dermatologist to be sure. He/she will suggest a suitable anti-histamine for you(if it is dermatographia). But be prepared, if it is dermatographia, there is no permanent cure. You might have to take lifelong medication. There is usually no pain only a slight itch but it is manageable the strange thing is that it only happens every morning after that I feel perfectly normal no itch and no red marks. Thank you, If I have time I would consult with a dermatologist but I can manage it for now. It only shows up in the morning and goes away after. A picture would have", "A little bit scared about my dermatographia So basically, lately I have been dealing with dermatographia for no apparent reason at all. Not only do I worry that it is been caused by something like HIV (I am a very paranoid and anxious person), but recently I got some road rash on my elbow, and have been wearing a large bandaid on it, and when I ripped it off (it was really badly stuck to my skin), I had fluid filled blisters, from what I can only assume to be the act of ripping off the bandaid. Can anyone talk me through both things and help me better understand it all, and confirm whether my fears are unfounded, as well as tell me if the blisters could be caused by something else (like HIV or something) Get tested, there is only one way to find out. There are many causes of dermatographia from allergic reactions, infections, hormones, and others. I highly doubt the blister is HIV, but get tested if you think you have been exposed. I would also suggest getting your thyroid checked out HIV causes dermatographia? Not necessarily but I am a paranoid hypochondriac Find a good doctor then.", "Damn, I wish I had found this sun sooner!  My visit to the allergist provided me with little hope and $80 worth of meds.  How effective is the cetirizine, famotidine, montelukast combo? I have been taking one 10mg OTC cetirizine every day for nearly 10yrs. It keeps the constant itching at bay but my skin still gets irritated and red if I accidentally scratch myself. I tried an allergist and dermatologist early on but they pretty much said this is one of those things that shows up one day and can stick around or just go away  without explanation. Just consider it your lame mutant power :P I wish we all did not need this sub haha I was told at the hospital the meds for dermatographia do not really work and to just live with it x Sun I use cetitizine once a day, and every so often use another OTC antihistime since they can lose effectiveness after awhile. It is also well maintained with keeping your body esp the areas that are the most affected moisturized with lotion. I sometimes use a topical cream to stop itches if I end up with some extreme itchiness on any given day. Most of the time I am basically under control with just the cetitizine and trying to remember to avoid itching or having too much contact with my skin that is unnecessary and when I start to feel more itching than usual I switch to something like Allegra (or the off brand) for a month or so before returning to cetitizine which I have the best results from. Some people say changing your diet to have less processed foods or less sugars it can help reduce symptoms but I have not tested it really. You can always try all the meds but if something does not work you can always change it up and test what works best for you. I hope you can manage the itch! Mine is not really that sensitive so I cannot draw with it but mine is also painful and itchy so if I tried I would just hate myself. Three years and counting (had them since I was 11), just started seeing an allergist for different issues cause I was supposed to get skin tested back when it started but i never did. I self-diagnosed it but I could be wrong, I do not think so though.", "Does anyone else get swollen fingers? I just developed dermatographia 5 days ago and I cannot find any information on this on any of the web m.d. pages. If I make a tight fist, my fingers end up swollen. I clap my hands and my palms are red and tender and slightly itchy as well as getting swelling in my fingers. Lifting something heavy or even tightening a screw does it as well. Is getting sausage digits a normal part of dermatographia? Thank you in advance.", "Good case of Derma? Hello all!\nFirst time posting here, and I was just wondering how many of you have a fairy \u2018good case\u2019 of derma? \n\nI feel as though I have a relatively decent type of dermatographia, I have never been officially diagnosed, but my mum used to work in a doctors surgery and she is pretty certain this is it. \n\nI only really get reactions on what I call \u2018soft skin\u2019, like the under side of my arms and legs, my neck, and sometimes my stomach and back. I get very clear welts which last about 20 minutes. \n\nRecently, with having to wear a mask I get an outline on my face too. \n\nAbout twice a week I will have a bad case of \u2018night itches\u2019 as soon as I get in bed. Like my whole body is on fire. It usually only lasts about half an hour and then subsides. \n\nReading this sub I feel like I have a seemingly mild case, just with very obvious visuals ( if that makes sense lol), I cannot imagine how bad it must be to have the constant itch all the time :(\n\nI will try and add a photo in a comment :) \n\nAnyone else have \u2018conditions\u2019 like mine? my condition is very similar! i mainly \u201creact\u201d on the undersides of my arms, neck, thighs and face. occasionally i get the night itching sensation as well. this makes me wonder if there is something in our laundry detergents we could be reacting to? I thought that too when mine first started. I changed it a few times but nothing stopped it. It happens when I am away on holiday too, in different bedding etc, so I think I am pretty lucky that nothing specific triggers it and do not have to avoid anything lol", "Antiallergy prescription for dermatographia Hi Everyone!\nWhat antiallergy meds you have been prescribed for dermatographia? Nothing... just plain old antihistamines", "Found a topical product that actually brought me some relief!!! Disclosure: I am new to this sub so maybe the product is well known already.\n\nI have been sleeping HORRIBLY the past week. I take 2 Zyrtec per day, and lather up with the Vaseline Eczema Calming cream with the colloidal oatmeal. It is does pretty good but I get through the day mostly on willpower to not scratch. \n\nAt night it is SO much harder. The itch gets worse and I am just laying there trying to fall asleep in the itchiness. When I do fall asleep, I wake up with hives from the scratching so I get up twice a night to ice my hives bc it is the only thing that works. UNTIL LAST NIGHT. \n\nI got up about midnight and was rummaging though all my cabinets and drawers looking for ANYTHING that might help. I found this stuff called Dermaplast that the hospital sent me home with after I had my son. I sprayed it all over my claves and ahhhhhhh instant relief!!! I slept 7 hours!\n\nIt is a spray made of lidocaine, menthol, and lanolin. I think the lanolin acts as a barrier, because I woke up and my legs felt like apples in the store covered in wax lol. But I think it saved them getting irritated from my blanket.\n\nI was afraid only hospitals can get it, but you can buy it anywhere! ( Thanks..this is definitely new to me. I will try and see if I can get it in my place. I absolutely second this- the one I have has lidocaine in it as well and it is  THE BEST! And to take up the magic factor even further, try keeping it the refrigerator when it is hot out... so nice If u cannot find that Dermoplast (walmart), Solarcaine has a lot of similar  ingredients.", "Dermographia differential diagnosis? Hi, \n\nI am suspected to suffer from MCAS and my skin condition has been labeled as \"dermographia\", but the exam was really succinct and I am not so sure about the diagnosis as I do not meet all the criteria. \n\nWhen scratched my skin gets really red within 30 seconds-1 min, I get a burning sensation and the marks usually disappear within 2-3 minutes without any wheal (thus an incomplete response of Lewis). Could it be something else than dermographia?", "Skin removal? Hello, I am not sure if anyone else has this issue or if there is any actual procedures to fix it.  \nI have a diagnosis for dermatographia which I received in January 2019.  Lately I have been working on myself and have started to lose a bit of weight which I was happy with until my skin of my abdomen and hips lost it is damn mind.  It is gotten so bad I have bruises from scratching; I cannot look at my body anymore because it is disgusting and I am ashamed of how it all looks.  \nI suspect that it has to do with my stretch marks getting inflamed because the places it is the worst are the places with the most stretch marks. \nI am going back to my dermatologist in September so I want to research my options now and honestly, I think skin removal is going to be my best option.  I cannot find anything on Google that even relates to this so I do not know where to start.\nThe funniest part is that I actually work surgery admissions at a hospital but I do not know any of the doctors so I can ask them about it.\nIt hurts, it is gross and I want it gone.  Thankies in advance.", "Alcohol and dermatographia Can we still enjoy alcohol or a smoke occasionally if we have dermatographia? I do not use alcohol so Idk :/ Alcohol tends to make mine a lot worse. Sometimes I do it anyways, but usually I pay for it. Not sure about smoking although i smoke occasionally and do not know that there is a correlation. sure its not great for us.  That kind of sucks :/ My dermatographia is a symptom of mast cell activation syndrome. I have a lot of food allergies from the MCAS. I can drink moderate amounts as long as it is something safe for my food allergies. I cannot be around smoke at all, or even around someone vaping.", "What happened to your face? \u201cOh nothing, I just accidentally touched it.\u201d\n\nAnyone else have this conversation way too often? The weird thing is I never get it on my face, it is mainly my body that reacts. Or \"oh nothing I just popped a few blackheads/pimples\" Definitely! I scratched my throat once because it was itchy and my Dad was like \"oh my gosh. What happened?\" Lol\n\nSo glad I am not alone! Pretty much every day at work. I was lucky, never the face or feet.   Searched for your cause yet? I had no idea what it was called or that I could possibly prevent it until I stumbled upon this subreddit a few days ago.  Going To do some more research here and try some things out. An allergist/immunologist told me I had to spend the rest of my life on Zyrtec because I could spend hundreds and thousands of dollars doing tests to determine the cause of my hives/itching but we would never figure it out. Then when I pushed back and asked him again with the cause of my hives was, he said well it could be your thyroid but that would also be a waste of money getting that tested. I walked out of his office and never returned again, then went home and booked an appointment with an endocrinologist because my mom previously had thyroid cancer and I wanted to be checked out. After bloodwork turns out I no longer take allergy medication, my thyroid is being treated, and my hives are totally gone as long as I keep up with thyroid meds. I can rely on my doc... I hope u find a good one soon. I am thankful for my mask. My neck and chest is what people notice and comment on. Real awesome. oh my gosh. this happened to me the other day, i was scratching an itch on my neck and my teachers thought someone tried to choke me out lmao Ey.. can I pm you?", "MY SKIN IS KILLING ME. ITS SO ITCHY!! I just traveled to a different state and as soon as I got there, my skin has been SO itchy. As you know, as soon as you scratch your skin, the bumpier it gets, and the itchier it gets. I have been staying up all night scratching myself for hours, unable to stop this cycle.\n\nThis new climate is a bit more humid than I am used to. Perhaps it is triggering my Dermatographic Urticaria?\n\nHow do you guys deal with the continuous itching/night itching? \ud83d\ude2d I am sick of scratching myself all the time. Did your doctor ever tell you about antihistamines or have you tried them? Do you have allergies?  information missing here. Omg my back had rashes and was so itchy too \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude14 I really dislike this My doctor has not given me any remedies other than itching cream. I have not tried any oral antihistamines for this particular problem; I usually steer away from oral medicine because it is not very good for your internal organs. It also usually makes me sleepy (i.e. benadryl knocks me out). \n\nI am not allergic to anything else, from what I know of. I am so sorry! \u2639\ufe0f That was me last night. May I pls recommend  Zyrtec... generic available.  Not make u drowsy and works in 1 hour.  Try just for a few days.  Helped, I promise. I will try that! Thank you. Eat a bunch of Benadryl and go to bed, it is the only thing that is stops what I call the \u201ccrazy itchies\u201d. Also, I am sorry. That shit sucks. Zyrtec &amp; benedryl...maybe.\n\nI still broke out so I was tired from the meds and fkg itchy.  In desperation I did a food allergy diet.  Two hellish weeks later I was free of the dermatographia &amp; acne.  Turns out I was allergic to dairy (whey, I think, because I can eat ghee).  Previous to the dermatographia I was also super stressed out.  I think my body broke out to slow me down.  Dunno.  \n\nI do not have skin issues anymore unless I devour a bag of Dove chocolates, or sneaky dairy foods like steakhouse ribeyes that are cooked in butter (and subsequently delicious), or processed food containing whey.  Thanks to  the popularity of the vegan diet, I have no problem finding dairy alternatives.\n\nGood luck!  I found out after my elimination diet that you can get a blood test that screens for food allergies (my allergist never mentioned it, grrrr).  Go for it!  See if there is something you can do outside forever medicating.  **Although not all dermatographia is caused by food allergies!  It was just that way in my case.  You may also be stressed, allergic to dust mites or something that has not been figured out yet.** It could also just be that your new location has new pollen you are allergic to. Keep windows closed and run an air purifier. Do not avoid antihistamines just because it feels better to avoid oral drugs. Its important to compare pros and cons and you are not doing yourself any favours tolerating this kind of itching without any help. Benadryl is an older type of antihistamine that causes drowsiness but newer kinds are safe to take daily with no drowsiness. Look up second generation antihistamines (I prefer certirizine which is Zyrtec in the states and Reactine in Canada) Thank you! I appreciate it. I will try that... It is driving me crazy I saw that you are not taking any oral meds during the day. Personally I take Zyrtec in the morning, it usually lasts all day but sometimes I start getting itchy in the evening. When that happens I take 25mg of Benadryl and if I get the crazy itchies I take 75mg and go to bed. This is the only thing that I found manages my symptoms Have you had an issue with Zyrtec dependence? No dependence or withdrawal issues at all. I also only used it for a few months before I was diagnosed with a thyroid issue and the thyroid medication cured my Dermatophagia. Benadryl has spray cream. It has 2% lidocaine, so it numbs after 30 seconds or so. Totally stops the itching. Also, start the day with a benadryl, have one for lunch, and have 2 before bed. \n\nThe benadryl spray is easy to find. Walmart sells an off brand, equate, continuous spray anti itch cream.. its $3.88 I have cans in every bathroom, car, purse etc. Woah! I will definitely try that out. Thank you so much. Step one is definitely Zyrtec. Then I make sure I hydrate well, that means water not \u2018hydration packets\u2019 you need liquid not salt. I use spray on moisturizing lotion for large parts of my body and that helps most flares. Long term it is doctor time, you need to rule out allergies and thyroid issues. Sublingual Claritin! \nUsed to take 2 Claritin every night. Found that a sublingual Claritin helps just as much. And really starts working fast. \n\nAnd When it gets really bad I drink a few sips of alcohol. Does not matter what Wine, Whiskey, Porto. It is Incredible! Instant relief! But it does not last as long as Claritin.\n\nEveryone is chemistry is different. You got to go through all the possibilities till you find what helps you.\n\nGood Luck!", "Was supposed to say hello ,,, I have lived with dermatographia for 18 years and today I just put the effort in to finding out what it was. Let us just say I have it pretty bad.  Hell is pretty close, tbh. :)  I take daily antihistimines, which gets rid of the raised welts if nothing else. Miss one day, and poof, back to square one. constant welts and Itchiness on my sides, back and neck. I am too lazy to take allergy medicine lmao I was doing okay, but this last year, the itchy-skratchies drove me more mad than usual. You are stronger than I am!", "Anti histamines Anyone who uses anti histamines to try and reduce the affects of dermatographia, do you find they work and to what extent? Cetirizine at 20mg is decent for me. I take that much in the morning and then diphenhydramine at night and I basically never worry about it. Note that alcohol, cough syrup, and seemingly sugar worsen it I take Zyrtec (cetirizine) 10mg every day and it helps. Have not had it for 48 hours to prep for allergist appointment and am currently in itchy hell I take 1 antihistamine pill every 3 days almost on the dot, when I feel that itch coming along. But try to stave it off until I cannot stop scratching before I take the pill.\n\nWho knows the long term effects of frequent Antihistamine use :/ I used to take zyrtec and it worked wonders for the itch but couldnt deal with the brain fog and drowsiness that came with it, (im one of those weirdos who get drowsy with even a quarter of zyrtec \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) \n\nSo started loratidine 10mg. It works, not as good as zyrtec but at least got rid of the drowsiness. Surprisingly the brand I ordered from amazon didnt work though. Only the walmart brand worked \ud83e\udd14\n\nThen I discovered curcumin. So started taking turmeric/curcumin supplement (1500mg) 30 minutes before or after food. And I have noticed that I dont need to take allergy meds everyday. So its a blessing. AND i have noticed that the duration of the itch has decresed. Redness still stays, but the itchiness goes away a lot more quickly I am on Allegra 180mg and Xyzal 5mg both twice a day. They help keep the horrible itching away but I still get red and have welts when I do scratch/any pressure. My case is pretty severe though. I tried a low dose of  doxepin but it would make me sleepy on weekends when I did not take my adderall.

Taking an antihistamine before shaving should help! Yeah I shave and put up with the itch for the next half hour. Maybe just go once a week if you can get away with it. This happens to my legs too.

Got the vaccine in April and it caused dermatographia pretty bad in my case, I waited to see if it would go away on its own but it never did. I saw a dermatologist and was told to take 2 Zyrtec a day for a month, and if 2 was not working, take 4 a day. 2 a day is not helping much, has anyone else taken 4 a day? The bottle says do not exceed 1 a day so I was just curious what worked for everyone else. The allergist I saw has had me doing the same thing but with Xyzal. For me, Xyzal worked a lot better than Zyrtec, I still get marks but not really very itchy and the marks are not as raised or intense. You can get it over the counter, Costco has a great price! My Dr has me cycling through different allergy meds every few weeks because my body gets used to them and they stop working as well. Was it just for a month to check back in or is there supposed improvement from consistently taking zrytec?\nPretty much the same story for me, but Ive started to take meds only when I cannot sleep I take 4 zyrtec a day for MCAS. I also take hydroxyzine, montelukast, and xolair.\n\nSometimes taking pepcid with zyrtec will help skin allergy issues. Ok I do have a Costco membership good to know thank you!

Dry mouth and eyes at first, then I got used to it. I have been taking that dose for 4 years. Xyzal, Claritin, and Zyrtec do not help my dermatographia. Allegra is the only one that does. Xyzal and Allegra twice a day for me plus doxepin once day. It has not gotten rid of it but I am not itchy 24 hrs a day. I tried Xolair shots for 6 months but they did not help. For Me: Its 2 Claritin every day. When it gets really bad I will employ one or all of these methods:\n\nTake a Hot Shower (So lucky my Uticaria is not heat-induced).\n\nWith a little bit of alcohol, just a couple sips,  I get 1-2 hours of instant relief.

I am a girl and shaving with this beautiful skin disorder is well.... Not pleasant... \nAny tips? I trim with an electric trimmer and the smallest available plastic guard on my armpits and pubes. I do shave below the knee with a safety razor, but only after a long shower to soften the hairs. I use cera ve moisturizing body wash as my shaving cream. I slather myself with coconut oil as soon as I am dry and that seems to kill any itching. I cannot shave my armpits to the skin as the friction caused my normal movements later will have me in absolute misery. Following. Shaving season just started and I forgot the feeling of my legs being constantly itchy. If yours dermatographia does not get a little better with loads of antihistamines... The electric razor is likely going to be the best route. I am using a Brauns Series 7.  Though I am on a ton of H1's and H2 antihistamines with Xolair (due to having a mast cell disorder) so my skin is less sensitive now to where shaving is tolerable most days. Coochie Cream. Made for the cooter, good on everywhere. I get my arms and legs waxed. And my skin becomes like bubble wrap, very closely wrapped one kind of.

H1 are the kind of meds people take for seasonal allergies, zyrtec, claritin, benadryl, hydroxyzine, Allegra, xyzal. \n\nH2 block histamine receptors in the gut. Pepcid is one. \n\nSo for example, zyrtec and pepcid or Allegra and pepcid. Most of us end up needing it twice a day. While taking it, you can still take benadryl if you have a reaction that needs something more. I think hydroxyzine works better for itching than benadryl, but it is not otc. I take Allegra and famotidine. Zyrtec and Zantac for years until the whole ranitidine thing. Luckily, I seem to be ok without the Zantac for the most part. I have MCAS, and before I started pepcid, everything I ate was passing through undigested. I had to take it for six months before that completely went away, but it felt like a miracle pill for my stomach. Honestly, I am not sure it makes a difference for my skin symptoms, but those seem minor compared to the other symptoms I get. Thanks for all your responses. I guess I will combine two and see if that works. I notice basically no difference when I take an Allegra so I am wanting to combine something else\u2026\nSo itchy :(\nIs anyone worried about long term effects of anti histamine use?

For context, I got a half-dose of Moderna on 12/24, and got my first hives on 1/3. Previous doses were both Moderna as well, and I never had this side effect. Have been getting hives and rash everyday since 1/3, albeit fairly minor. I have been taking Benadryl to help with the hives and itchiness, which has been working, but this subreddit has definitely inspired me to start with the Allegra/Zyrtec + Pepcid combo this weekend. \n\nI am really just posting this because I desperately need some positivity. I am pretty bummed out about this for a lot of reasons obviously haha, but I also was in the process of booking a tattoo appointment with an artist that I love and now I am unsure if I can get it because, ya know, my skin hates me and friction right now. Moreover, I have pretty severe psychosomatic symptom disorder (or \u201chypochondria\u201d) and although this subreddit confirmed to me that my hives and itchiness are most definitely a reaction to the booster, it is really hard for me not to spiral and start prodding at my body for lumps and bruises and anything that my brain can use to convince me that I am terminally ill. It is a fucked up anxiety disorder to have. I got it as the result of seeing too many of my family members get really sick, and many pass away. I really do not want to let myself get to rock bottom again - so, those of you who are on the mend/have improving symptoms, could you possibly tell me your story/timeline so I can see a light at the end of the tunnel? :-) \n\nTLDR: I have an anxiety disorder that makes me freak out about health-related issues (\u201chypochondria\u201d).

I have had dermatographia since I was about 12 and I have always struggled with body hair removal, particularly shaving. Every time I shave, even with a sensitive shaving cream or gel, I am left with razor burn and intense itching where I have shaved. Underarms are usually not so bad, but legs and sensitive bits are near impossible. I take Loratadine, but the only thing that helps is Benadryl gel applied directly to the afflicted area. Even aloe only does so much. Does anyone else have this problem, and what makes it easier for you? I do not know why, but I seem to suffer less if I use men's razors instead of womens'. Also if I just use normal shower gel rather than shaving foam/cream. Could be I am just weird though lol. I use men\u2019s razors as well and while it is a little better, I still have issues. I will definitely have to experiment with the shower gel though. Try waxing. My skin still gets irritated because of the pressure but I seem to itch A LOT less and no razor burn. After half an hour the swelling has decreased and I am good to go for a week or so. I have the same issue. I do not use shower gel even the sensitive one broke me out. I have actually recently been using the Billie razors and I have to say I love them. I do not get any sort of reaction plus they are a really good price. I have seen ads for them, I will have to check it out!! Do you wax at home or go somewhere to get it done professionally? I have always been a little afraid of waxing so if you have a specific brand you could recommend, that would be great. I use anti-itching lotion right after I dry off and it helps. But every time I exfoliate... the most intense itching I have experienced. I exfoliated today and it was way worse than normal, guess I will not do that again haha I have the same issue on my legs, one thing that has definitely helped is lightly exfoliating my legs before shaving and using coconut oil before shaving. It helps get rid of dead skin around hair follicles and minimise razor burn. May be give that a shot? It worked for me very well but can be a long time consuming task so i suck it up and do it only on the weekends. Just saw your comment about it being worse after exfoliating lol. Try something non abrasive may be and then moisturise.. Shaving foam works for me I have always had a problem with shaving and being super itchy after. I have also been using Billie razors and they have been really awesome with reducing the horrible itch and razor burn. I also use the Dove sensitive skin body wash to help shave and then use coconut oil or Burts bees Shea butter lotion and those are the only things I have found to help minimize the itch and razor burn.

My mouth will get swollen when I eat My dermatographia is due to MCAS and most of my MCAS symptoms are gastrointestinal. Have you been to the doctor? You need some high strength anti histamines on hand, it could be really serious if it causes your throat to swell.\n\nGood luck OP, This really is a question for a medical professional. Please schedule an appointment for proper diagnosis and treatment because not everything is related to dermotographia. You should definitely look into mast cell activation syndrome. (MCAS).   You have to find a specialist who is familiar with it because it is kind of a \u201cnewer\u201c diagnosis.  My daughter is just finally being diagnosed with it.  If you need help in the meantime you can try taking over the counter anti-histamines like Xyzal and Pepcid.  (These are histamine one and histamine two blockers that are the typical treatment for MCAS).  But definitely seek out a specialist.\n\nI just wanted to add that, if you are having reactions in your mouth, this could be a sign of anaphylaxis and this is a situation that is pretty much an emergency and you should see somebody right away because you do not want to experience anaphylaxis without having the right rescue medications like an EpiPen. Thank you, that is great advice. I did not know MCAS existed but the more I look at it, the more it seems likely. I have not seen a specialist in a while but I was having reactions in my mouth in the past which is concerning. I do not remember ever telling my specialist about the mouth reactions but I will definitely go see one soon and bring up my concerns.  Thanks again, I will also look into getting an Epipen! That is really interesting; I just learned MCAS existed, the more I look it up, the more I think I should go in and get my symptoms checked out. I will reach out to a specialist and see what they think. Thanks for the info! I was diagnosed years ago and was told to take 4 Zyrtec a day when it flares up.

Thing is, I now get skin flushing *all* the time and have certified dermatographia.\n\nI have been trying to get to the bottom of this. Multiple allergists/immunologist have done numerous tests for mast cell disorders of all kinds, and...nothing, negative. I am stumbling around in the dark, gaining about one more food allergy per month. And yes, these are tested/confirmed via skin and/or blood tests.\n\nThe only \"cause\" I have been able to tease out is that, both times before developing food allergies -- wheat a couple years ago, and then this whole bunch in February -- I took a week-long round of methylprednisolone for Sudden Hearing Loss. After the week was up, I was left with one (or many more) food allergies.\n\nAll but one of my doctors have dismissed this connection, and the one who did not made it sound like it was the most normal thing in the world to develop food allergies after taking steroids.

Seems like you are on the right path. I hope you find the answers you are looking for. Yes. I think corticosteroids could cause dermatographia because when I was first diagnosed with dermatographia, I had just started a lot of new meds. Also, years before that I took corticosteroids to clear up a recurring, full-body case of hives that the dermatologist said was caused by a pharmaceutical ingredient. My immune system is a lot worse now and I doubt I  \ncould take those same roids now without a major problem.   \nHere is how I figured out which meds are a problem for me:  \n1) Keep a detailed log of my reactions to meds, etc.Struck out with allergists that focus on IgE allergies\n\n2) Did a DNA analysis that indicates my risks for certain medications and certain chemical structures in medications\n\n3) Had a pharmacogenetic test done (covered by insurance) that indicates my risks for pharmaceuticals &amp; supplements (confirmed my DNA analysis)\n\n4) Found a specialist that tests for IgA, IgG, IgM, and T-cell reactions to specific pharmaceuticals and ingredients in them.

Then you can avoid them! Wow so even when you were not in direct contact with your allergy trigger you were experiencing skin swelling?\nBecause I have not noticed a trigger. The swelling comes when from pressure or scratching no matter the environment Skin contact allergies can take days to show after exposure - it is why a patch test is necessary since they do it across 5 days!

Definitely  Zyrtec.   Have you gone through allergy testing or gotten a full panel applied work to look at your thyroid? My doctor said that i had to stay away from salicylates, (not sure if that was specific for me though or for dermatographia in general.) My dermatographia is much more manageable if I take Allegra, versus Claritin, Zyrtec or Xyzal. So you might want to try different meds if missing one dose is enough to cause a flare up. \n\nIt is also much better if I avoid foods I am allergic to. I am allergic to nickel and salicylates. Nickel allergy is diagnosed by a dermatologist with patch testing, and salicylate allergy is obvious because you will have an anaphylactic reaction to aspirin and NSAIDs. Also, things like spices, wintergreen, mint, chamomile and camellia sinensis tea will give you digestive upset and rashes (and worsened dermatographia, for those of us that have it). Im assuming the meds you guys are talking about are the generic names? im assuming theyre antihistamines. But the tratment is a second generation H1 antihistamine at its recommended dose, if that doesnt help then x4 the dose, if that doesnt help then add on Xolair. Any antihistamines in the piperazine family. \n\nCetirizine, Levocetirizine, Hydroxyzine\n\n\nOmalizumab is also a good treatment option too. My doctor has me add Pepcid to the allergy meds when I am having a major flair up. i have not. \n\ni dont seem to get a flare up from taking nsaids, but i have noticed the mint in the past has caused flare ups (one time i ate mint ice cream and it DESTROYED my stomach, also mint dental floss messed up my fingers and my gums). \n\nso, allergy testing seems like a good idea. \n\nwhat would we be looking for in the thyroid? would you reccomend using tylenol then instead of nsaids if i am showing signs of salicyclate sensitivity with things like mint? \n\nwhat kinds of things is nickel found in? TSH, T4s, T3s, 2 different  antibodies  too.  Doc should know and want to test these. It is my thyroid that caused my Dermatographia so once I was properly medicated  foir thyroid condition,  in just a few weeks it disappeared and has not returned as long as I take my daily medication. For over 11 years now. wow. did you have other throid related symptoms? Yep, but not really.  LOL. Never thought so, but I have  always been freezing  and never knew it was related until diagnosis.   Talk to your doc about testing for both allergies  and thyroid Yes, definitely. \n\nNickel is very high in seeds, tree nuts, legumes (including soy), whole grains,  sprouts, avocado, canned foods, shellfish, chocolate, carob, camellia sinensis tea, and some greens like spinach and endive. jesus. what am i going to eat!??? I eat most meats, white rice (including pastas and things made with white rice flour), corn (including things made with cornmeal), starches, salt, some herbs, squashes, some greens, a little cheese, canola oil, flax oil, vinegar\u2026\n\nBut I have confirmed nickel and salicylate allergies, severe GERD and hypersensitive celiac disease (meaning I can only have foods that were grown in gluten-free fields, processed on gluten-free equipment in gluten-free facilities, cooked in gluten-free kitchens, etc.). So I am more limited than almost anyone else I know. \n\nDo you have a nickel allergy? \n\nAlso, the severity of nickel allergy and salicylate allergy varies widely. Some people can tolerate much more nickel in their diet than I can. And some people can tolerate less. As I understand it, each person has kind of a budget for several days, and you will only get a rash or diarrhea or whatever if you go over your nickel budget. i am not sure if i have the nickel allergy. i definitely have the salicyclic (mint ice cream DESTROYED my intestines for a week) but when i take zyrtec it doesnt affect me at all (i wonder if that means its ok for me to have it while on zyrtec as long as it doesnt cause a flare up?). what are the nickel-rich foods that impact you more than others? if you handle coins does that impact your allergy? Coins, keys and some banisters and doorhandles burn my hands. I will get a rash if I do not wash them right away. I cannot wear clothes that have metal touching my skin.\n\nThe things that make me the sickest because of nickel are seeds, tree nuts, legumes (beans, lentils, peanuts, even a tiny bit of soy), whole grains,  sprouts, avocado, canned foods, shellfish, chocolate, carob, camellia sinensis tea, and some greens like spinach and endive. The greens are always a risk, because the nickel level is highly dependent on the soil, soil moisture, and other growing conditions. thanks for being willing to share so much of your experience with me.\n\none last question i was wondering: do you avoid these foods even when you are taking antihistimines, or do you find that you can tolerate them when you are on proper medication? I definitely I can tolerate more of it in my diet when I am taking Allegra. But I take Allegra every day. When I am not taking antihistamines I am just completely miserable. I have a rash all over my body anywhere I have had the slightest touch on my skin. It is got to the point where I cannot have allergy testing because my dermatographia is so bad by the time I have been off of antihistamines for five days. i feel discouraged and scared :( I am sorry. I am feeling pretty accepting of the whole thing right now, but I definitely go through rough patches. It is not easy.", "I have had this for as long as I can remember Recently something has caused rashes to come and go on my skin and during the process of researching what could cause that I read about dermatographia. I have always had this although right now it is worse, I assume because of whatever has caused my rash. It is cool to have a name for it. I am 30 now and I have had it since I was a kid so I doubt it will ever go away. I did not realize that it is relatively uncommon since it is been normal for me. Ever gotten your thyroid tested or tested for allergies? Things to consider TSH/T4 are normal. I have never been tested for allergies but after reading up on it I have been thinking about doing that. I have always had dry skin so I always just assumed that was the cause and it never really bothered me. Lately I have had to take some supplements due to a few deficiencies and my skin is going crazy so it is definitely bothering me enough to look into it more.", "Wound care Any advice on wound care? I cannot use bandaids or any type of adhesive because it leaves a worse scar (dark outline) than the wound itself. You can see every outline of every bandaid I have ever used. Has anyone found anything that will not leave a mark? The liquid sealers dry and cause severe itching which of course then travels all over and starts the horrible chain reaction. \n\nThanks in advance.", "After a few weeks of hives everywhere, I just got diagnosed with dermatographia. Did not even know scratching was the trigger but I am having quite a bit of fun with it!  More info: I am 20/F, I have hashimotos disease and I have been on 100mcg synthroid + t4 since I was 14. This did not start up until a few weeks ago, so I am assuming it is just a recent symptom of the hashimotos. Allergist told me it was dermatographia, and I am following up with them and my Endo for some blood tests soon. Cheers! Allergy meds might help! \n\nCute bee, btw! I am going to go double down on some zyrtec. Thanks on both parts! I have been taking zyrtec 2x a day, but might switch to claritin because it has not done much. Cheers! Interesting... Dermatographia was my main symptom that got me diagnosed with Hashimoto's and once I was put on Synthroid in a matter of weeks my dermatophagia went into remission. If I skip my meds for 3 days then it starts to return otherwise it never has. Sorry to hear your Synthroid is not keeping it at Bay for you.  Prior to my diagnosis is Zyrtec was a godsend. I am taking fexofenadine as cetirizine was not doing the trick for me after a year or so. Sorry, I do not know the US names for the meds! ( wait, nvm - double checked, fexo is Allegra, cetirizine is Zyrtec.  Medications all sound like OC elves or dwarves from Tolkein, why.) Dude- I always thought that Abilify and Lamictal would be silly pet names, totally agree there. Thanks for the tip! I will try some allegra :)", "Hey everyone! I just figured out what this was. I had no idea this kind of thing was not common in others. I have not had any formal diagnosis. I feel like I know the answer but just to be sure, I only did this with chopsticks. Is it *really* dermatographia?  Yup. And I tend to use chopsticks for writing as well. Welcome to the club! (nice flourish on that y, btw) Definitely dermatographia! Welcome to the super sensitive skin club haha. It can be fun but also really crappy at times -\\_- Lol welcome to the club where the smallest scratches can set our skin off and we are walking blackboards \ud83e\udd23 It sure is. ...I write on my legs in the shower when I am bored. Haha.", "If it works, this would be awesome. ", "My 3 year old son has sensitive skin and has seasonal eczema triggered by allergies (or so his pediatrician says). Not sure what triggers it, but lately when he scratches or rubs these bumps appear. Is it possibly dermatographia?  That looks like the rash I get when I ingest too much of one of my allergens (nickel and salicylates, they are impossible to avoid 100%). Has he been scratch tested for food allergies? Not yet but I think it is about time. It is something we have looked into but have been steered away from because of his age, but I think 3 is old enough. I agree. Scratch testing is nbd for me. I feel like it would be way less frightening than drawing blood for a little one. I second this. This looks like the rash my son would get after ingesting his allergens (eggs and some other things). We had him tested at 2 and he did fine. Just make sure you bring plenty of things to entertain him because it can take a while! I have eczema and pretty bad \u201cpressure induced urticaria\u201d. My 18 months old son has it as well. Any type of pressure, stumuli, we scratch our skin and get hives, but they do go away eventually. Thanks for the input, I will say he was scratching this area first. He had on a long sleeve shirt and I noticed him scratching and found that. Dunno if that makes a difference. It does not look like dermographia mainly because that shows up as whatever is literally touched will be raised. So scratches from the hand from itches will be raised in lines not bumps. This is most likely a rash due to a bug bites or allergen ingested or that touched his skin.", "can I take antihistamines for undiagnosed dermatographia? Hi everyone! I have been following this subreddit for awhile ever since I started showing symptoms of dermatographia (lines that swell up from scratches, itchiness, redness, etc.) although I have not been officially diagnosed but I am pretty positive I have it. The itching has been driving me crazy but I am not sure if I should get diagnosed for sure or if it is ok to take them for the symptoms. I have not been able to go get it checked with switching insurance and reluctant to go to the doctors bc of Covid.\n\ntldr; I am undiagnosed but the itching is driving me mad. Should I officially get diagnosed or can I take antihistamines for my symptoms? If so, any recommendations that worked for you all? For me, Zyrtec is the only thing that helps with the symptoms you are describing. Ya they will not hurt you. I use reactin as I need it and it generally helps. Take over the counter antihistamines and reduce sugar and alcohol, you will feel a lot better. Thanks so much I will definitely check it out It seems lots of people find is effective. If you do not mind, do you know the differences between them (antihistamines)? I have seen a bunch of different brands recommended on the sub but am not sure what is the difference. Thanks so much! Have you used other antihistamines? How is reactin different or is it just from personal experience? It does not have side effects like fatigue and weight gain, which I like. Everyone will react differently to different meds though, so you just have to find what works for you. Generally from my understanding though reactin is pretty gentle so it should be okay to use until you can get in to see a doctor. I did not know sugar affected the symptoms but looks like a great plan thank you! That sounds amazing and I will definitely have to try it out! I figured it would be more case by case and keep a look out for other brands too. Really appreciate the help thanks! It is also an antihistamine. But my understanding is that Zyrtec gets into the skin better than say Claritin and Benadryl. I mean you can take antihistamines any time, they are over the counter. You dont really need to get diagnosed by a doctor, they dont really know shit about it anyway so. If you scratch your skin with your nail right now and it turns red and/or hives then you have dermatographia. I recommend Zrytec. You can look at a low histamine diet (removing a lot of fermented products), I have not actually looked at the research though, but it has been recommended to me before reactin is the same as zrytec Always best to get diagnosed by a doctor/dermatologist first. They may/may not root out all other causes by variuos tests by seeing your symptoms. In some rare cases, serious issues like thyroid problems, gall bladder issues and gi tract issues also induce symptoms similar to dermatographia. These issues if left untreated will make your health deteriorate rapidly.  Just to be sure, you do not have these, it is best to get yourself diagnosed. Does not hurt to get a professional opinion as soon as possible. I saw a doctor last year about itching without rash (I was not symptomatic for dermotagrpahia at the time, although I am now), some other things he suggested was moisturise your skin daily (twice daily if you can) with gentle non irritating no scent added products (like sorbolene, although for me I find moisturizing every few days enough), use a no soap wash to prevent drying out skin, take antihistamines (I use loratidine/claryntyne, but sometimes the ones you use can stop working so if one does not work, try another), wear natural fibres if you can (to reduce skin irritation), loose fitting clothing (some itch symptoms can be the result of pressure), keep cool, avoid things that can cause a flush to the skin (like chilli / spices, as a flush is an increased blood flow to the skin and increased sensitivity) &gt;reactin\n\nReactin is a NSIAD, its like Motrin, not at all the same as Zyrtec. My dermatologist recommended a combination of Allegra in the morning and Zyrtec at night for me. You are welcome. That is what worked for me! I went to an allergist and it was a complete waste of time.  FIRST, try Zyrtec, prilosec &amp; benedryl and change your diet.  Try this:  ( Ahhhh, I see, I think I meant reactine instead I tried asking a doctor about mine a while back and all they said was to try taking zyrtec and it ended up working. So zyrtec or the off brand of zrytec are my go to. Used to work for me, but after 10 years uts effectiveness is gone. Nsaids are also bad to take regularly", "Is it dermatographia if I get it on and off? About 8 months ago I looked into dermatographia. I was getting very itchy when i scratched my skin it would get all red with white marks standing out where I scratched myself. Then it went away for a while. I noticed it came back last week, though. Is this normal? Could be a change in diet. If I eat a lot of dairy it tends to be more noticeable. Yes, it can come and go depending on inflammation changes in your diet, vitamins, meds, and even stuff in the air you breathe. \n\n**The Inflammation Free Diet Plan** book helped me a lot. With this plan I can eat whatever inflammatory food I want as long as I balance it with enough anti-inflammatory foods and spices. That has stopped the flares from whatever scratches my skin for years. There are causes of this.  Check with doctor and see if you all can figure it out.  Your body is trying to tell u something.   For me it was my thyroid, for some allergies.  Could be due to reduced inflammation due to change in diet or could be a possible link with seasonal allergies.", "Left image is without Xados pill, the second is with Xados fill #dermatographia ", "Ever since Dermatographia started I get sick more frequently I first noticed being extra itchy a few years ago. Then the swelling made me see a dermatologist. The doctor recommended I use Zyrtec and the symptoms would go away in a couple of weeks. Sure the itching subsided, but the swelling remained. Whatever, not a big inconvenience. However since that time I have started to catch colds at a much higher rate, like 5-6 times a year. This is double what I experienced before I saw any Dermatographia symptoms. Since we have overachiever immune systems, a theory I have is my system is reacting similarly to pathogens, causing me to get sick all the time. Have any of you experienced anything similar? Nothing really to contribute but I have gotten sick a lot more frequently last year also Sung the same time this has happened to me. None so far this year (knock on wood)\nBut I also do not know if it is because I started working in clinics this past year Yes. Thankfully getting sick often went away after a few years. The allergist said it is definitely the over active immune system coupled with the drying out effect of my allergy medicine. He was right in saying that after my body finds a new normal AND I stay super hydrated I would be sick a lot less. Maybe drink more water? More than you expect you need. I think it was similar for me in the first year of Dermatographia but ive rarely gotten sick after that", "Anyone get itchy palms/fingers right before a flare up? If I have been off my antihistimines for a couple days, I can usually tell when the Dermatographia is going to come back because my palms start to get super itchy. It usually starts in one place on my palm for a few days and then gradually both of my entire palms burn/itch. This is around the time my chronic hives come back and the dermatographia starts.  \n\n\nanyone else? Yes!! It is horrid! Lost many nights of sleep from it :( yes my fingers and back of my hand will itch so bad \ud83e\udd7a Before every flare up! Sometimes if I catch it early enough and take s zyrtec quickly it will stop Yes, this was me.  Gone to docs yet to see about allergies  or thyroid  issues as your cause? Yup. So it seems like this is common!\n\nI have itchiness in my fingers and on my toes so I did a \u201cstick test\u201d and sure enough it puffed up a little! :( Two weeks ago I did a TSH test (hi/lo/hashimotos) and a full allergy panel. Negative for all allergies and normal thyroid. \n\nI started to get this after I had to take antibiotics for two weeks in January and it never went away. A daily Claritin is how I have been keeping it tolerable. I get hives too. \n\nJust sucks to have to take meds every day. yes me too Itchy palms and sole of feet, for me at least, are rebound/withdrawal symptoms of antihistamines. I have slowly weaned off antihistamines over the last few months, and while I do still get itchy without them, it is not on the same level. Can you explain more? I first got the itchy hands and feet after I first went to the ER for my hives. They gave me Benadryl and a steroid but I did not take any more after I got home. Could that be why I get itchy after I stop taking the antihistamines for a few days?\n\nI take generic Claritin, which is supposedly the \u201csafest.\u201d Zyrtec has shown up in recent years to cause this rebound effect even in people who were not itchy to start with. I am unfortunate to have the side effects from any antihistamine I have tried, but that may be because I was on them for over decade without knowing this was a thing. It does not help if you have an itch or an allergic reaction that you need to take for in the first place, and for years every doctor would say(not just to me) oh you need to keep taking it, it is your allergy flaring up. \n\nI slowly weaned over over a few months, first cutting tablets, then switched to a liquid one and finally stopped altogether last week. I am still itchy, though it might improve further over time, and I do not get my hands and feet burning with the urge to scratch. \n\nIf you have an allergy be careful about stopping, under the guidance of a doctor might be better, but if it is just the itching and scratching it might be worth a shot. There are a few articles on the internet about zyrtec withdrawal, and it was marked in the list of side effects in the leaflet of the box I had, but I had not seen it before until I went looking. \n\n\nAll of this is not to say you do not have a skin issue, something started all of this for me, but I do not know what, I did not start taking antihistamines with any regularity until nearly 14 years ago. In my case I can find the date when it started, but it could have been a reaction to the bedsheets of the hotel, or something similar. In any case I am sorry you are struggling with this, and some people are happier just taking the antihistamine everyday and not dealing with withdrawal, so I am just trying to give you all the info, your choice is what works best for you. Is this just Zyrtec? I take once a day loratadine (Claritin) and have never heard of this. I wonder if this is what is also happening with me, since within a week of whenever I stop Claritin, my hives and itchiness come back. \n\nOf course, without the Claritin I just have hives/dermatographism anyway so it sucks. The literature/research does not have it for claritin, but I have it myself for Claritin, though I agree that it was not as bad as zyrtec. That said, it did take years of campaigning to get the FDA to agree it was a side effect. I suspect Zyrtec is a very strong antihistamine so the rebound is stronger and therefore easier to prove. I would had rebound from a different antihistamine when I first started, so I knew I could have it, but zyrtec was significantly worse, so much that I did not realise it was rebound. \n\nI switched around trying a few different ones this year until I started tapering. If it takes a few days for it come back, I would say it is worth dropping doses to see if it helps, as the half life of Claritin (or its active metabolite) is 27 hours. That means every day or so you have half the dose in your system you did 27 hours before. \n\nOf course if I am wrong, you just take your full dose no worries. But I found it worth dropping slowly and pursuing through side effects, better and easier than skipping days though probably longer overall - at least I could see when I was down to a fraction of a dose that it was not enough antihistamine to be effective so dropping further meant that it was very likely to mostly or solely be a withdrawal effect. \n\nDepending on where you are, Claritin liquid should be available over the counter, probably marketed to kids. I dropped to 1/4 tablet before switching to liquid, but your call. Oh another idea, you might be able to work out a dose that works for you that is lower than standard, as an alternative to taking breaks or coming off altogether I just experienced this! Was off antihistamines for about 5 days and my palm started to itch on one spot. Had a shower and had red patches on chest and arm...had to take a citerizine and that has helped. But yeah soles of feet and palms...sometimes my face or forehead just feels itchy. I try not to take antihistamines every day but it has not fully gone away. This all started after penicillin for 2 weeks in July. My allergist said it may go away all of a sudden there is no telling when. I have done well cutting out inflammatory foods and wine. Hey, me too! Mine started after 2 week penicillin. I hope one day it goes away completely!", "How long have u guys had dermatographia? I had mine since Sep 2017. I have dermatographia since Sep 2017, its been years now and I wonder if others' conditions also last long like mine. I take an antihistamine every day at least from January 2018 up until now to feel better because my body feels itchy and uncomfortable. and I am wondering when will this actually go away? Have any of you have been experiencing the same for years or it just appears once in a while? Do you also take medications every single day? I have consulted multiple dermatologists and one of them diagnosed this as dermatographia and made me try the phototherapy, it is expensive and it gave no difference so I decided to just stop. It is been months now since the last time I went to see a dermatologist. I even went to a faith healer but she said it appeared when I saw a frog, but I never happened to see one. It never worked out and here I am. Mine started in 2017 too. Ive seen doctors and they basically just tell me to take an antihistamine everyday. I am prescribed 10mg cetirizine. If I forget to take it even one day I get super itchy and even a little pressure causes my skin to react. It is really frustrating to try putting on makeup just to have a red inflamed face. Sometime in 2017 aswell, cant really remember.\n\ncoincidence? /s\n\noh and i take a mikro silver lotion every time the itch gets too strong, worked perfectly for me. never been to a doctor since that is all i need, the constant light itching doesnt bother me much Sorry to say, but I have been dealing with this condition for like 15 years... First time I remember getting an outbreak was around age 18. I also take an antihistamine every day. Usually about 5mg cetirizine is enough (I just bite a 10mg tablet in half). It got way better when I was pregnant, but now it is pretty much back in full force. I was told there was a chance I could \"grow out of it\" someday, I am losing hope of that now though. \ud83d\ude16 Very uncomfortable, but at least my symptoms are effectively managed by the medication (I have read stories of some who are not so lucky). Good luck with your process. \ud83d\ude0a I have had dermatographia for as long as I can remember, and I never really saw it as a disadvantage. As a kid nobody knew what it was but I remember drawing on myself with the aglet from my shoestring and watching it raise up when I got bored. It has not gotten better with age but I do not mind it much these days. There are sometimes nights that I cannot sleep because I cannot stop itching, though. I have always enjoyed people\u2019s reaction to it, and my friends like to draw dumb stuff on my arms. The main downside is the itching, and also trying to hide a breakout is impossible! I have had it for literally ever never knew what it was till a few years ago. Since then it is progressively gotten worse it seems. I would have itching spells at least maybe twice a day? And last year it started with the burning,, my dog scratched the back of my leg because I just gotten home as she usually does and it got itchy I scratched a little then tried to stop because I felt my leg welping up. Then while putting up groceries I nearly collapsed because the area I had scratched was burning so bad and sent shocks through my leg it was insane. I could not hold that leg straight for the rest of the day or it wud have shocking pain. To this day I will have an episode like that maybe once a month or so. I use to take Benadryl but I felt it was not really helping much it just put me to sleep, but I should probably try and find something else similar to start taking again. Mine started about 4 months ago, I am pretty sure it is due to gut problems getting worse over time as the itching usually flares up while/after eating. It is pretty mild, I cannot do the skin writing which is a classic symptom of it but still rather annoying; the skin is super sensitive and will itch when exposed to a lot of pressure or extreme temps, and sometimes randomly as well. Ive had it since birth and im 18 now.. Its not as extreme as most ppl ive seen here.. Just that when i itch it becomes bumpy and red. Consulted doctors as a child to no avail. 2013!! I hope it goes away soon cause I am sooooo over it lol\nI also do not take medications everyday I just roll with it unless it gets really bad I take an antihistamine and that usually helps it for two days I was on a light dosage of doxepin and that helped a lot but It made me really drowsy on days I was not on my adderall. \n\nI also tried Xolair shots for a few months but I did not notice a significant difference. \n\nI am back to antihistamines and the combo of Xyzal and Allegra twice a day is helping with the extreme itchiness.\n\nI see an allergy/infectious diseases doctor and he is wonderful. I am the first he is seen with the extreme dermatographism so I am his challenge and will go above and beyond to help me. Oh wow I never even looked in Xyzal or Allegra for just \"itching\" before now I think I am going to try those out! Ty. that is the same thing for me as well! but I do not have any problems with make up. that is a long timeeee. good luck too with yours. I am also waiting for the time I could grow out of this because it is very hot in our country and it is making it worse. that is true! I also brag about it to my friends. It is kind of fun but it is very hot in our country so that makes it worst. And even slight squeeze or touch, the skin will have marks. Do you also take medications? do not u think it is from what you eat? like are u allergic to seafood or something else? do u also take medications? maybe it is starting to grow out of you? hopefully. iI cannot really last a day without taking an antihistamine See... When u consulted as a child they gave this aloe vera gel which calms the skin but... I did not use it for along. I dont use any medication rn. It maaay have something to do with ethnicity?? Cos ive been exposed to harsh sunlight for most of my life but i never got irritated skin ya kno? that is good for you. bc I cant relate :( I really need an antihistamine every day, even with soothing gel or moisturizers, its still itchy and dry too. I want to try these but I am not sure if it is available here in the philippines not sure if i was lucky or if people in this sub just never tried this specific lotion before. no other gels or moisturizers have ever worked for me but this one magically did.\n\neither way im sorry for you.. sounds like it got you pretty bad Omg good for u but It is very hot and sunny here in the Philippines and it adds to the irritation. it makes it worse. I literally just want to live in a snowy mountain I feel bad fr u and hope it becomes alright.\nI feel like i have to clarify again\nI dont have irritated skin anymore than everyone around me.. Its just that when i itch it leaves a mark.. Ive gotten used to it and draw stuff on my hands and all do u mind telling me what the lotion is? but the thing is, i noticed ever since i was a kid, i have dry skin. then dermatographia appeared. \ud83e\udd27\ud83e\udd27\ud83e\udd27 oh nice, it is like you only have the fun part now hahaha i would not mind having this, just minus the itch part \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02 How itchy r v talkin dood? Im from Germany so i cant recommend you any product in the US but it is called \"micro silver creme\". Commonly used against neurodermatitis.\n\n( I first remember it when I was kid back in 1995. Here we are in 2020 and I still have it. It has not gotten better. It is actually worse. I doubt it is a specific food as it happens inconsistently and after eating/drinking pretty much anything, even just water I know for sure Allegra has a generic brand you can purchase online but not Xyzal. Doxepin is an antidepressant that can be prescribed by a doctor Mine started November 2019 in just my arms and is spreading each month and worsinginf the doc has me on 20mgs of cetrine and I use vasoline aloe moysterizer but nothing stops it. My palms started reacting this month so I cannot hold things when reacting anymore I have had it all my life. It is worse when we had smoke in the air from the bushfires in Australia or when I am stressed. Had it for 20 years. Unfortunately I have seen it get better or worse but it does not seem to ever go away completely. Diet and stress are my two biggest triggers. what.. oh my gosh i feel like i got mine bc of stress too and my parents will not believe it hope it gets better! that is such  a long time already it must have been severe. hope u get better soon hella itchyyyy i feel like my skin is burning and i begin to sneeze and cry if i do not take medicines because the inside of my nose, mouth and eyes are itchy too I have had it for about 7 years, at one point I was taking antihistamines but they got really expensive. Mine tends to get severely itchy too but I have kind of just accepted that this is my life lol :( I live in Texas and it gets super hot here too, I do not take any medication for it. I have never met another person with Dermatographia in real life and I am always explaining why my skin looks all red and inflamed. I sometimes get asked if it is contagious! But taking Benadryl makes me really tired and other antihistamines I have tried do not have a noticeable impact on my skin anyway so I do not take anything anymore. Sadly I have had this condition since birth. My family physician has nothing to treat me with it but I may go to see a dermatologist in a last chance hope that they can help in anyway. Woah... Im defo not like that I have had it for 12 years now I have had it since I was about 13 in the 7th grade. Now I am 19 and I still have it. Sometimes I can go a little while with no break outs and other times (like now) every little scratch welts up and causes crazy itching which turns into a terrible cycle of itching and scratching. I have had this since 2007 and it has not gone away yet. Doctors basically only recommend an antihistamine and the only thing that has been working for me all of these years has been Zyrtec (buy the off brand from Amazon. You get almost 300 pills for like 12$) I take this every night before bed. I have had mine since i was 12 (i am 16 now) and it does not really bother me, at times i even played tiktaktoe on my skin! Ehhhh probaly will not I keep just getten worse xD", "Can Dermatographia be caused by birth control?  possibly ? dermatographia can be caused by, an allergic reaction to medication (and you might need to try other birth controls then?), alot of stress in life, or something that caused alot of trauma to your skin/cells (like mine was caused by living in a house with a chainsmoker that smoked inside the smoke caused trauma to my ski), also its genetic for some ppl too\n\nJust to be sure you should see a dermatologist to ask what they think too :) I really wish there was more definitive information around the causes. From what I have gathered, it definitely seems to be an autoimmune response but the triggers are all over the place - from medicine, thyroid, sun, food,  etc. I have had it for several years and still do not know the cause after several allergy panels.

I recently tried finding solutions for alcohol flush because I wanted to drink at a pool without turning into a tomato, and tried Pepcid AC (famotidine) an hour before drinking. Not only did I not have any alcohol flush, bloating, or heartburn, I also noticed my skin was less reactive in regards to my dermatographia. If I stepped out of a shower I would be red all over, and I was not nearly as red. Even the marks were finer and less red.\n\nI decided to dive into some public medical studies and journals and found it is a H2 antihistamine and allergy meds are typically classified as H1 antihistamines. I typically take Zyrtec (cetirizine hydrochloride) for allergies but even when trying 4 a day, I never noticed a difference with the flush or dermatographia, so I stopped taking them outside of allergy season. \n\nI found a study that mentioned the use of lexocetirizine dihydrochloride or Xyril, and it is improvements with some patients and it is higher efficacy compared to Zyrtec. Naturally, I ordered some because I have dived into a rabbit hole hoping for even better results with my dermatographia.\n\nLong story short, I am going to try famotidine and the lexocetirizine dihydrochloride together, see if I notice differences and update later if I do. \n\nHas anyone else tried Xyril or the generic lexocetirizine dihydrochloride and noticed any improvements? Or has anyone else tried that combination of Pepcid AC and Xyril?

Has this happened to anyone? Or maybe she just got less sensitive? Because when it first started for me every little thing triggered it, but now it is not as sensitive.\n\nAnyways, thanks!

Mine started in my mid-40s, so it is just a hit and miss thing. Two full years of it, and it is still going strong. Allergy meds mean that at least the lines are not raised, just show up vividly. I am also allergic and avoid any metals with nickel, but was unaware of dietary things to avoid. What foods are high in nickel? AND HOW AM I JUST LEARNING THIS AT 32?!! Tell me about it. I just found out at 38. I highly recommend the nickel navigator app. It has actual measurements of nickel levels  in foods, though because nickel naturally varies due to soil composition, growing conditions and which part of the plant you are ingesting they are always just going to be rough estimates. Some measurements vary widely, which is frustrating. Buckwheat, wild rice, soy, oats, beans, coconut, tree nuts, peanuts, shellfish, seeds and chocolate are all high enough in nickel that they make me sick every time I have more than a tiny amount.", "Update to my Moderna dermatographia journey- there is hope I was boosted at the end of October.

I have not been on a very strict diet. \nAlthough I feel the carnivore diet does influence your gut health, I do not think it is the right diet to heal your gut.\nGAPS, the diet that OP has been on, might be more suitable.

I have no idea why? Does anyone know what triggers it? Should I go to the doctors?

I am going to keep thinking over the next couple days and figure out what else i have changed. Did you change your dietary habits? Nah, diet is exactly the same, I eat the exact same things every week/fortnight. Is it with hives symptoms, or just skin is turning to red? Also, is it itchy? Just turning red, not itchy. But also the whole red mark is raised sometimes. I dont think it is something that doctor could help with. Because noone knows , why people are suffering from dermatographia. Doctors will give you antihistaminics but, if its not itchy, you dont need that. Unfortunately doctors do nor cure the cause, but the symptoms.\n\nI read somewhere on the internet, that it might be from some bacteria in the body.\n\nDo you have asthma? Or overall if you are alergic to something. If yes you might have predisposition to suffer from dermatographia. \n\nI suffer from this for like two months. Still cant find out why is this happening. It came in one day like nothing. Hmm yeh, it is not a problem for me, but it is annoying when people bring it up and ask why i am red. I do not have asthma but I have a nickel allergy and get a rash when I wear jewellery with nickel in it, and just generally do have sensitive skin. \n\nHave you had surgery lately?

I will most likely switch to pfizer for my 4th dose.\n\n1) I would personally avoid the oral steroids, unless you have a severe case and your doctor is seriously pushing it for you. The side effects can be nasty, and if they do not resolve the reaction, symptoms can come back in an even worse manner.\n\n2) If you are very itchy, take antihistamines. My doc recommended two 180 mg pills of allegra a day (one in the morning and one at night). This will not resolve redness but will help itchiness in my experience. You can use zyrtec, Claritin, etc. If using benadryl, only use it at night because it will make you drowsy (also fyi avoid alcohol with benadryl).\n\nCurrently, I am trying to go without antihistamines for 1-2 months.

Disclaimer: not a dermatologist, just do transcription for a derm lab.\n\nAs far as I understand: medications, infections, severe stress, or other 'not-normal' things introduced to your system have a chance of triggering the dermatographia hive-response. (Or teaching your body to have those responses at the wrong time, I guess?) There are not a lot of long-term or large group studies of skin responses to COVID vaccine, but rashes and urticaria are documented responses.  \n\n\n\nTo answer your question about fading: Mine started after I began a new daily med 3 years ago. 8 months after that, I started taking antihistamines 2x daily to deal with the symptoms but also to take a shot at de-programming the response itself (per my dermatologist's recommendation/explanation.) He was careful to make sure I knew that there is a chance it will never go away, but that for some people it does fade over time. I still take those daily meds that triggered it, but it is significantly less these days.\n\n\nI am not a doctor, and I am definitely not your doctor.

I have never had any issues with allergies or skin sensitivity prior. A couple weeks after, I began experiencing the typical symptoms of dermatographia (intense redness and welts after scratching, typically fading away in about an hour). My skin became very red and streaky where it was in contact with my clothing (well fitting clothing, not overly tight or small), and after applying even light pressure. I cannot exactly say it was caused by the vaccine of course, but that is the only new variable for me as well. \n\nI am happy to report that my symptoms were always mild and are increasingly rare these days. It probably peaked around the time of my diagnosis (early June) and at this point I am not even taking allergy medication.

I am still on Prozac as the doctors said that if the dermatographia was because of a Prozac allergy, that it would have started months before it did. My dermatographia disappeared slowly in a month so I have not checked this sub in a while. How are you getting on now? In my case, it was probably because of the anxiety caused by my OCD. Though I am not entirely sure... Hope you are better", "Does it ever go away? First symptoms of dermographism around 30th of August and its gotten worse now after taking  Levocetirizine bidaily for the past 3 weeks, cant even sleep, work out or have sex anymore. My lips burn every time i eat, i cant live like this anymore, when the fuck does this stupid disease go away? Going to the emergency room today to see a derm again. You can see an allergist too.\n\nAlso, taking pepcid with your levocetirizine can help.  Singulair is another med to try, and Xolair as a last resort, but I think you have to have symptoms for 6 months before getting diagnosed with CIU to get xolair prescribed.  It can take up to a year to start working.  It took that long for me, but I used to feel like I had a fire ant hill under my skin waiting to erupt and now it just feels like a few random ants.\n\nI have had dermatographia as a symptom of mast cell activation syndrome for 5 or 6 years.  I do not expect it to go away, but it would be nice if it did. Ever been tested for allergies or thyroid conditions. Those are the way to go in my opinion.  Loved Zyrtec... very popular  for dermatographia  based on myself, a friend, my doctor, and lots of posts here You get used to it. Antihistamine is there for when it gets a bit too much. Had it since 2016.\n\nDo not let it stop you from enjoying life. It did get better for me. After about 4 months, zyrtec gets rid of all itching. I used to take 3 a day and would still itch. Mine was cause from an antibotic reaction, so it is slowly fading away. Gets better everyday. But the first month I thought my life was over. It depends.  For some people it does and for others it does not.  Ive had it for at least 15 years (I remember noticing when I was a young kid).  For me it acts like a thermometer for allergens. If it is really bad, I know that the pollen count for my allergies are up there that day.  You get used to it. Biggest advice is do not itch. I know that it is hard sometimes but really try not to. If it is bad, get a towel with cold water and put it on the spots. That always helped with the burning and itchiness. \n\nDefinetly go see a doctor though. Good allergy meds will tone it down.  I had allergy shots for a long time. I honestly do not remember if they helped with the dermatographia specifically but it gave relief for a lot of my allergy symptoms over time.  \n\nAnyway, good luck. Sorry it is bad right now. I have had it for over 30 years, you get used to it eventually. That does not mean it sucks any less, you just get to the point of not caring... I just recently developed dermatographia end of September, I have come to loooove 1 zyrtec in the day and half a benadryl at night.. I have done a loooot of reading about it and it sounds like people respond differently to various antihistamines, maybe it would be a good idea to try some other ones? I am sorry you are miserable my friend, I was definitely that way for the first 2 weeks or so before my meds really kicked in. Now that my body is used to the the medication combo I have been using I hardly notice I have it anymore which is a huge relief (red marks only, no hives no itches). It will get better, you are not alone! Its been over 10 years and mine has gotten better slowly. I do not burn but still get red welts. \nIt is been about 2 years of trying different things. \n\nI recommend cold showers and a lot of lotion. If you can, try to pinpoint triggers. Mine is stress and dairy. Turns out as much as I hate the cycle of scratching, pure bliss then burning I subconsciously scratch when I get anxious. See an allergist as others have recommended. My allergist recently recommended swimming as a possible way to soothe. I have not tried t yet. \n\nI have always had dermatographia, but mine got worse at the end of September randomly. It was after a recent round of antibiotics for UTI, but honestly we are not sure what is up. Waiting on allergy tests. I take Zyrtec mornings, singular and Benadryl at night. I went a little crazy before I was diagnosed I had itchy palms and soles and I just could not concentrate on anything. But I have started on zyrtec and it is been helping a lot. Hydroxyzine for really bad days and sometimes tumeric pills help with inflammation when my welts last longer than they should. Try to limit high histamine stuff like I had to cut out coffee and find another caffeine alternative which helped a lot with flare ups. Hang in there bud, it will get better with time and treatment !", "found out recently i have dermatographia, i always thought this was normal til my family pointed out it was not lol ", "This is what I get for not putting a shirt on after my shower and rubbing up against the back of my mesh computer chair. So itchy! This started about a year ago for me and almost went away a few weeks ago. It just came back full force again, no clue why.  I was recently put on xyzal and montelukast and it has been working wonders for me! I was on zrytec and it never really did anything. Check with your doc, you made need a script change!", "Having a 2 month old pup with Dermatographia. Also, I only realised it today that this is a skin condition. I always thought it was just something weird about my skin.  Wait, you found out your diagnosis because of your dog? Am I reading this correctly? That is amazing! Yes! That is exact what happened.", "Mourning normal life but trying to get used to this Hi all, \n\n      Recently self-diagnosed with dermatographia after finishing macrobid for UTI 2 weeks ago. My itching and hives started five days ago--anywhere where clothing rubs or I randomly scratch and itch.. I work in Healthcare and donning and doffing gloves is a nuisance and a half; my hands look diseased for 30 minutes after each time.. \n     I have so many questions! I have a friend who developed this condition and told me hers went away after taking zyrtec and using unscented body wash for a few weeks. But the internet and this sub seem to conclude that this experience is different for everyone and could last for a month for some and years for others. \n     I wonder, for those people who were lucky enough for this to just go away eventually, what the commonality is? Any thoughts? I know it is technically still a mystery but just curious. \n    I have never had any skin issues aside from a wicked allergy to poison oak so this is wreaking havoc on my mental health. 1 zyrtec makes the itching manageable during the day but usually wears off by night so I need to probably adjust my antihistamine regimen. I have a doctor's appointment coming up too so I will be discussing this with her.\n     Thank you all for existing here on reddit and giving your experience and advice, it gives hope to those of us new to the club!!! Your dermatographia should subside eventually. Antibiotics are known to cause dermatographia, but for how long depends on the person. Going to the doc is the right route, but I think it will disappear on it is own hopefully soon! In my case I had dermatographia ranging from severe to light hives for about a year. I do not know what triggered it but it transitioned into eczema. I never had eczema before. Now I have to use steroid cream to manage that. I use retin-a on my face with no problem, though the dermatographia never exhibited there. Very interesting that it changed into eczema after a year! It really sucks that it can be so arbitrary like that. I hope it will eventually go away for you entirely! I really really hope you are right, it is reasonably manageable right now but the thought of having this for years is pretty daunting. Plus the dependence on medication definitely makes me uncomfortable. Thank you for the hopeful comment! If your doc decides to just write you off, see an allergist or immunologist. They could probably provide you with some answers or maybe find an underlying cause I will do that! The weird thing is I started experiencing terrible heartburn every time I eat on the same day that my dermatographia showed up. I wonder if my skin symptoms are related and if they would go away if I could get rid of my stomach issues.\nI do not have super high hopes with my primary care doctor but we will see. I AM NOT A DOCTOR: I apparently have a pretty bad case. I have found some relief by taking 4 Allegra a day and using Voltaren Gel. It is an NSAID gel. I only use it on my arms because I have the most accidental contact there. But the last few days have been a little better. I have never seen Voltaren mentioned in this sub, I just picked it up on a whim and of course, finding the antihistamine that works for you can take a while. Most seem to recommend Zyrtec or Xyzal. Allegra just seems to be the only one that works for me. Do not want to scare you but I got this condition plus chronic hives after I took a two week long prescription of penicillin in January. I still have it. I just take Claritin every day and it seems to help but it sucks this happened.  \n\n\nI do not really understand how even when you are off the antibiotics, this condition stays. Does it just activate? It is weird. Seriously it is so weird. I had a flare up of chronic gastritis the same day too so I wonder if it was the perfect storm of my body just being pissed off \ud83d\ude05\nOne zyrtec a day has worked wonders for my quality of life \ud83e\udd70 it definitely sucks to have to explain it to people all the time tho. Aw man I am really sorry you have a case like that, I do not wish that on anyone. After taking zyrtec every day for a week I finally feel pretty much normal but just have red marks all over me. Anything to help with that horrible itching!! And getting used to not scratching an itch is so difficult!! Amen. Dermoplast spray helps. Have had mine for a year and 3 months. \n\nIt cane on after a double round if antibiotics. \n\nIt is miserable and I wish I would have never taken them back then. Um, so, I was on Macrobid in early September for a UTI. Literally had a flare up of this two weeks after my last dose of Macrobid. Holy F\u2026.\n\nI take Zyrtec in the morning, singulair and Benadryl at night. Exercise is fine for me as long as I do not do anything with contact. My allergist suggested I try swimming which I have not yet. She said it sometimes helps. Damn macrobid!! I have taken it so many times in my life so I have no clue why it hit me just this time!! \n\nZyrtec has been a GODSEND I almost feel normal if I take it every day.", "Does anyone know how/why you get Dermatographia? I am 28 years old and just recently developed this condition out of nowhere about 10 months ago and I cannot for the life of me figure out how I got it. There is nothing in my life or daily routine that has changed in the last couple of years. I have no other chronic ailments, and have been told by my pharmacist my medication would not ignite this condition. \n\nIt started by noticing I was constantly itchy during the winter months, but I thought the culprit was dry skin or an allergy to fabric softener. I started moisturizing and stopped using the fabric softener, and even switched to free and gentle detergent. It helped a little bit, but then I started to notice I was getting hives, swelling and redness when I scratched. Did the \"drawing on my skin\" test and yep, it is for sure dermatographia.\n\nMy pharmacist recommended Allegra which has caused the itchiness and swelling to go away completely, which I am super stoked about. I still get redness and my skin gets hot but it is way better than how it was before. \n\nI am still perplexed though. Can this skin condition just appear out of nowhere? Has anyone figured out how they got their condition? I developed mine in my 40s. Usually, it seems, it is more of a teen thing.  \n\n\nAs best as I can figure out, it is auto-immune fail related. (I also now have vitiligo patches on my hands, also an auto-immune issue)  It might just be that we catch something at just the wrong moment and it triggers something. It could be worth asking your doctor for a test, however there is not really a cure for it besides waiting for it to pass. Some say it will go.  Allergy meds do seem to ease off the worst of the hives, though I can still write rude words on my arms and have it last for half an hour. Entertainment for all your friends, right? It is an autoimmune disease. Mine is much worse when I consume alcohol or sugar. I had an existing autoimmune disease before I got dermatographia. I first got psoriasis in 2012. Relatively mild. I got dermatographia in 2017. So I am thinking it is some sort of domino effect. I was a heavy smoker up to the point when I got psoriasis. I changed to vaping in 2013. Not sure if vaping has anything to do with my dermatographia. Mine and a few other cases I have seen seem to be hormone triggered. Mine was when I got pregnant and got worse after I gave birth. A friends developed after she started hormonal birth control. Ah ok I did not realize it was an autoimmune disease, that is good to know. I will talk to my doctor about it. It is definitely a cool party trick! I was so amused by it when I first got it haha. Thanks for the info! It definitely could be a domino effect. It seems like a lot of people have had some other skin issue prior to getting it. The only issue I have had in the past is really itchy mosquito bites, and I seem to have thinner skin so I would end up with big scabs anytime I scratched one. Thanks for sharing! That would make sense! I do not have any children but plan to in the next few years. I am interested to see how my dermatographia will be affected by it when I do. It is all fun and games until people think you are into heavy bondage after taking off your watch. I was born with mine this is late but mine happened after a giant stressor/illness. my dermatologist called it too, i had told him about how i was trying different detergents, lotions, body washes, etc and nothing was working. he asked when it started and when i told him january he asked if i was sick and i was like \u2018yep, flu\u2019 and he mentioned if i was stressed out and i was like \u2018absolutely, dad went into the hospital\u2019 apparently it *can* lay dormant and then when a stress or illness happens, BOOM. it is better with an allergy pill every day, and i have learned to scratch with a boar bristle brush instead of my nails to minimize the hives. My allergist said it is autoimmune, but probably triggered by an infection. Mine started the day I got back from my first ever trip to Europe (I am from the U.S.), and he said it is plausible that I got an infection over there that I had never been exposed to, and it triggered it. Mine showed up after having took Amoxicillin. This is my experience leading up to the condition and how I was able to cure it, entirely (after almost a year of no reoccurrence):\n\n1. I had a UTI, and I was prescribed Macrobid.\nIt was not immediate, but I noticed a few weeks after completing my prescription that symptoms appeared full-force. \nI thought that I was bitten by spiders in the night because in the morning there were large circular hives all up my forearms. I took some benedryl during the day and then took an oatmeal bath that evening but over the next couple weeks it only got worse \u2014 it was all over my body this time, and was full-fledged dermatographia: I could not wear my watch anymore, any turtleneck sweater I put on over my face would make it swell, I was waking up in the middle of the night, itching to the point of bruising and bleeding... (I will spare you further details as you all know how bad it can get).\nAt the time, I still thought it was an allergy so I was doping myself with anti-histamines on the daily and I bought special oatmeal soap bars and lotions and bath soaks, none of which cured the issue (but soothed my skin). \n\n2. Anyways, when I noticed symptoms were not clearing up, I went to two different doctors in the span of a month, both of which told me there was \u201cno way\u201d the antibiotic caused this reaction, simply because symptoms would not last this long if it were an allergic reaction to a pill I was not taking anymore. And I agree, this reasoning make sense, only I was not convinced it was an allergic reaction. The doctors said it was either allergies or some kind of hormonal imbalance, and they sent me to specialty doctors that both had several-month waiting lists.  \n\n3. A few more months pass and I am convinced it is the Macrobid \u2014 I was researching the condition and came upon this website, and it is great there is such a community around this because hearing about real-life experiences makes your worries/suspicions valid in the way that doctors do not. \n\n&gt;CURE: \nAnyways, I was visiting a friend around the holidays whose roommate is a Naturopath. \nAlso: ** this post is not meant to welcome personal opinions on whether you agree or disagree with the practices of naturopaths but rather, my personal experience ** \nI was explaining the condition to my friend and his roommate and immediately he asked me \u201cAre you waking up in the middle of the night, itching?\u201d To which I reply Yes...; \u201cAnd, before you had this condition did you take any antibiotics?\u201d ... YES ... and then he says: \u201cYou have parasites.\u201d\n\nI immediately wanted to cry because usually having parasites means you are dying. Only, he explained to me that when you take antibiotics, they do not just eliminate the bad culture, but it also eats away at the good culture, making your body susceptible to... parasites? I want to speak with authority on the subject, but the truth is, I am not the naturopath, he is, and his reasoning seemed as good as any. I was desperate to try anything. \n\nI was a student at the time and was not eating properly, not looking after my diet the way I should have, and this specific type of skin parasite feeds exclusively off sugar \u2014 not just added sugar, either, but sugar in breads, fruit, yogurt, pasta... etc. \nHe told me to cut out ALL sugar for 3 weeks to a month, and take a daily probiotic with my breakfast (the thing is, because there is sugar in yogurt, you should not replace that as a probiotic substitute, you need to cut out sugar completely for a short span of time). \n\nBelieve me, this was difficult. I felt starved but, it is a fast that is entirely worth it \u2014 I noticed an almost immediate difference, and within a week the condition was mostly cleared up (but, stick with it for the 3-4 weeks). \nThis was in January, and I have since taken antibiotics for the same type of infection, and I always watched what I ate while on these antibiotics, and I have not had a reoccurring instance of dermatographia.\n\nI am very lucky because I only suffered for about 4 months before I was able to find my solution, though I know this probably will not work for everyone. Luckily, it worked for me. And to this day I feel like if I had not been at the right place at the right time, meeting a friend-of-a-friend who HAPPENED to be a naturopath, I would still be suffering. In my experience, doctors were useless and misinformed. \n\nPlease try this and tell me how it goes, I want to know who else this works for and maybe who it did not work for, but I hope it works for at least one of you. Omg so it is true!!! I got dermatographia in 2017 after an UTI and Macrobid. All the doctors are like nah, that did not cause it. But it could be either the UTI or Macrobid, right? I had the worst itches that winter and now it is coming back again. I never had dermatographia before that (so got it age 28) but my brother did. I think Accutane gave me mine... I think mine came from Accutane treatment - has yours since gone away? For the most part it has done a 180.  Only when I am really hot, I get red marks but they are not always bothersome. I have not been able to wear my watch. I do not know if it will have flare ups or my system has calmed down. Parasites and tapeworms etc are definitely a possibility as a cause of chronic urticaria (including dermatographia), but this would most likely show up in a routine blood test as elevated eosinophils. Plus, parasites usually travel and are not just confined to your gut, HOWEVER- one thing that does feed off of sugar is H.Pylori- and there are clinical trials linking CU to this bacteria.\n\nThe only 100% effective way to diagnose this is with an upper endoscopy- but the study revealed that after triple therapy for h.pylori, over 70% of the study patients cleared the urticaria. \nAnother possible cause is a virus called CMV- cytomegalovirus; this is a special blood test and most people do not know they have it, or had it, because it hardly causes symptoms. But it lays dormant in your body for life and seldom reactivates. The autoimmune link is less of a link for a specific autoimmune condition (like lupus or Hashimoto\u2019s) but more of a general term for your immune system going haywire as a response to a virus or bacteria, such as the above.", "Zrytec or Xyzal? I guess I have a mild case of derma, but recently it is been really annoying. I just have the redness after I itch, no welts. Is there a cure to this shit? Which do you guys prefer? Of course I would have to try myself, but I want to hear what you guys have to say. Also heard Pepcid is a game changer. i have used both but i stick to generic zyrtec once a day to keep my allergies at bay Success with zyrtec here How fast did you see results? 2-3 days, then consistently  every 24 hrs kept it at bay.  Although my Dermatographia was actually due to a thyroid condition and I no longer take Zyrtec but thyroid medication. No problems for five years now.  Were u actually  diagnosed  by doctor? I use Xyzal and Allegra + a TCA (doxepin) twice a day. Zyrtec did not work for me. I do have an extreme case though. The three medications work to bring me down to your level (red and no welts) otherwise I would itch and burn all day That is really interesting\u2026 I think I am having thyroid issues as well. Super low in vitamin D and other stuff. Got another appointment with my endo on Wednesday? What were you diagnosed with? Hashimoto's.   Antibodies, slightly  elevated TSH, but everything else thyroid normal.  Yes, low D too, and ferritin. Mine might not be then. I did thyroperoxidase anti which was a 1. Thyroglobulin was less than 1. T4 free was 1.4 and TSH was a 2.5\u2026 is it possible to have almost no antibodies and still have hashimotos? It seems like a have a lot of vitamin issues tho. I have used both in the past, both work well but I am more used to zyrtec so that is generally my go-to antihistamine and I only use xyzal when I run out of it. How did you discover you had a thyroid issue? I have suspected I had one for months after taking antihistamines for years. What did you say to your doctor to help diagnose? The allergist-immunologist I was seeing for dermotographia  ran the bloodwork without even my asking.  That and the zyrtec were the only good things he did for me.  He told me that we could spend thousands  on running tests and would never figure out the cause so I had to live on Zyrtec  for the rest of my life.  I pushed him three times what the cause could be and he finally got frustrated and said well it could be your thyroid,  but that would be a waste of time.  I left his office and never returned... becuase  he totally ignored the fact that  my mom had THYROID CANCER.  Called endocrinologist  that afternoon  and went in for new blood work.  Confirmed thyroid issue, but she did not  want to get me on thyroid meds yet since it was \"so mild \".  I pushed back and said since I was going to stay on zyrtec for dermotographia anyway, could not we do a trial of thyroid meds to see if it got rid of dermotographia?   She agreed, started thyroid meds, stooped zyrtec, and the rest is history.   Now thyroid meds only, no antihistamines,  no dermotographia,  and feeling fine.  Best of luck in your search.  If I can help with other questions, let me know. Hiii. So it takes 2 to 3 days of taking the meds for it to help? I always only took them one day and saw no results so figured it didnt work for me. Should I give it another go? Feeling hopeful... I always give medication a bit of time to work especially because my Dermatographia was going on like 4+ months before I was diagnosed. So yes you may want to give it up to a week in my opinion.    Best of luck and please go see a doctor if you have not already Thanks! I went to a dermatologist years ago who just told me to take Benadryl. You think I should go see another doctor / they could give me new information? Oh, God, YES!  My case was that I decided to go to an allergist who happen to be an immunologist and I was lucky in that he ran the right blood work and came up with my thyroid condition called Hashimoto's. That was the only thing good about that man because when I asked him three different times what could be the cause for Dermatographia he told me that you could run hundreds and thousands of dollars of blood tests and never determine what it is and I would have to live the rest of my life on antihistamines so he put me on Zyrtec. So I kept pushing and out of frustration he said well it could be thyroid related but again you would be wasting your time. That is when I left his office and never returned because he did not take my mother's thyroid cancer into consideration. That is how I was cured because we treated my thyroid. An endocrinologist may be in your future as well as an allergist to see if there is something going on in your body but you have to go out and advocate for yourself. I would never take a Benadryl because of how tired it makes people. Zyrtec never made me tired and like I said only took two to three days. Are you on any other new medication? Years ago I had an allergy reaction to an antibiotic and the hives were horrible so perhaps this is an option for you? In summary please go ask your doctor or doctors for help. You do not want to keep living like this.", "Anyone ever try cyclosporine? Has it helped? Any treatments that do get rid of it or make it less severe? Also do you notice almost a constant pinkness to your skin due to it? ", "Do I have dermatographia? So I have been able to write on my skin and get reactions that look like scars for as long as I can remember. I looked it up years ago and kind of self-diagnosed myself with dermatographia. \n\nThe only thing is that I have recently discovered this subreddit and notice many posts about serious itching and burning sensations however I have never had this sort of feeling even once. I am not too fussed about getting it checked at the doctors because the scratches just raise up and disappear without any discomfort.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has heard of this or maybe it is just a mild case, I am not sure. Sounds like a mild case to me. There is a crazy range in severity for our condition, but the precision of rashes that cause the 'skin writing' is kind of the determining symptom. I am not a doctor / have only mentioned it to one in passing, but I never really had any itching or burning until my most recent flare up. I wondered the same thing when I first noticed the reactions and I just kind of forgot about it and considered it a mild case. I think it is different from person to person with different levels of severity at different times. Obviously I cannot definitively answer yes because the look and timing of the reaction itself is important, but it seems possible based on my experience. Hopefully this makes sense. Not a doctor.  Pls go get checked out as your body seems to have a mild case. But it is screaming for help.  Allergist, dermatologist... someone.", "Anyone had any luck getting taken seriously in the UK? So it is basically the title. Any time that I bring up my dermatographia with any GPs or any other healthcare professional within the NHS, they basically handwave it away and say 'just keep on taking anti-histamines, there is not anything we can do', but I have been dealing with this for over a decade now and was just wondering if anyone has had any success in getting the NHS to take this seriously and maybe getting access to different services? I am based within Scotland if that makes any differences and I am more just wondering than anything right now. My GP pushes the anti-histamines as well, but does keep track of it as yet another auto-immune disaster my body has. Mostly he is just gawps at whatever I have drawn on my arm as proof of \"no really, this is not going away.\" I did get a whacking great tub of skin creme from him as well after a particularly bad summer. I am in Wilthire, btw. I am in the USA so I cannot be any help with the NHS issue you are having... Really wish we had NHS here but I digress. My allergist here told me basically the only thing I can do is keep the antihistamines in my system to keep the welps and itching down. I have been dealing with this for almost 2 And half decades but was just recently diagnosed. None of my other doctors ever once noticed it. In all the research I have done I have not found any other treatment other than the antihistamines. I am currently on 3 different ones daily. I wonder if xolair would help.  I take it for MCAS and it helps with itching and reducing the severity of reactions. I at least got a referral to the dermatologist and have antihistamines from them and it is been 6 years. I asked my GP for another referral because my triggers keep changing and now seem very food related. I asked to be referred to the dermatologist this time. Not saying you have not but my view is that I need to see a specialist, and you... GP are not a specialist. \n\nThat being said the dermatologist did once say I could be allergic to anything and they are not going to investigate what it is. I have friends who are also NHS doctors who encouraged me to go back and explain that that is not good enough. I never did... or well I am now. Have you tried a allergist to test you for allergies? Mine did a blood test after he realized I had the dermographism. I had never heard of this condition but darn it if I could not check off over half of those symptoms when I looked it up. I have asked for one and am going to assertive this time. I am sure they will try and fob me off with \u201cwrite a food diary for 6months and the come back\u201d no, I know what happens when I eat this, you do the test and give me a plan.... well... that is my plan anyway. That really should be all that matters. Assertive can be key! Good luck! Somewhat of the same thing happened to me. When I went into my dermatologist she just said its nothing serious and its \" common\" now. But it just left me thinking I would have to take antihistamines all my life. She made me get some blood work done and when the results came it showed I was allergic to 90% of my diet ( like corn, wheat, eggs, yeast, chocolate, coffee). Even though I was not having any realllll allergic reaction to it.  However, she just kind of shrugged it all off and did not give me much info on what to do from here on out.\n\nI then made an appointment when my doctor to try to get more answers. He was trying to help as much as he can but then he remembered how in the same building theres an allergist. He went to the allergist and talked to him and then the doctor came back and told me that the allergist will see you to see what is going on.\n\nThe Allergist asked me few questions and quickly was saying that it was because the increase of stress caused the lining of my mast cells to go weak. He made get one more blood work done to check my Ige levels. But he prescribed me antidepressants/anxiety med and explained how when you take that certain medicine it will cause the lining of my cell to be stronger so it does not break. So he recommended to take that pill for a week to see if the problem was my mast cells. I took the pill for 3 days and my skin has not felt uncomfortable since. Also have not had any flare ups since then. Im going back this week to do a few more allergy tests. ( Best part was he said that I can still eat those food in moderation just until my mast cells are stronger and my levels go back to normal.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for a long message but Just trying to convince you on why you should maybe go to someone else to get answers.

Hi all, so glad I found this r/.  GF has had crazy itchiness &amp; dermatographic hives since 10 days after Moderna booster.  I do not have hives or bad itch but skin-writing started appearing 14 days after Moderna booster.\n\nWe both had Moderna for all 3 shots, and it seems like most folks here had that, too (with a couple 3-time Pfizers as well).\n\nI am curious \u2014 did anyone here who developed dermatographia post-boostwr get a different booster than their first two shots?  Or did you get the same for all 3?\n\n(", "Itchiness without the visible urticaria? I still do not know if dermatographia is the right word for my sensitive skin problem, but whenever I get scratched on the skin it releases a lot of what I think is white dandruff/dead skin and gets super itchy. It will make a red mark in that spot, but it goes away quickly; if scratched hard/long enough a couple bumps will appear in the spot but not in the shape of the scratch like with the \"skin-writing\". The itchiness persists for a while after the brief visible reaction disappears as well. Is this still considered dermatographia, if not is it closer to eczema/psoriasis? Moisturizing the skin with cetaphil daily seems to help with it a little bit, antihistamines (claritin/benadryl) do not.", "Is this Dermatographia?  No, that is a star and a heart :) Looks like it", "Dermatographia as an engineer Hi guys! I am somewhat of a new member of this sub but I was just curious if this condition will make my career choice somewhat of a harder thing to do or not. \n\nTLDR: I am kind of afraid of continuing my aircraft engineering course because of this condition.\n\nAny tips would help! Thanks guys! We can get over this condition soon enough. Can you explain what parts of the job you are worried about? I am not too familiar with that career. \n\nI can say it affects each person differently and the intensity can vary a lot. As do triggers, how often and how long it comes about, just about everything. I am mainly worried about the physical stuff like lifting objects, handling the tools, and other physical demands of the job. I do not know how severe it is mate but to be honest I reckon you will be fine. It is just one of those things you will get used to, it is never really restricted me from doing anything day to day Appreciate it, buddy! Words of assurance mean a lot!

Question about symptoms About 2 days ago I noticed itchy rashes that looked like scratches, that would pop up, and then go away after about 20-30 minutes, then popping up again somewhere new. It is mostly been on my hands and arms, but have had it all over at least once. \n\nThe only thing I can think it might be is I received my Moderna booster 14 days prior, and I see multiple others in this group report it popped up after they got theirs. I also recently had a lot of blood work done and my thyroid levels were fine. I have made no major changes that I can think would trigger this. \n\nYesterday was the first full day with symptoms, and beyond the red rashes and itchiness, I also had a headache, felt quite light headed/dizzy, fatigued, very warm, and had some stomach pain. It got better throughout the day, and then I felt it again this afternoon before it is gotten a bit better again. Anyone else have these type of symptoms with their dermatographia? Is this possibly a delayed immune response from the booster? I have not heard of symptoms like that with dermatographia. I would prob see a doctor Please go see a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment. I am not a medical professional but it does not sound like dermatographia to me.  Did you do a Google search to see what dermatographia actually looks like? That could be helpful Thank you. I plan on going to the doctor, just trying to figure out if I should go to my general practitioner, an allergist or a dermatologist\u2026 If this was me I would start with my general practitioner first Yeah that is what I was thinking.

It feels like they are legitimately ruining my day, every day, at this point and I would be unimaginably grateful for any pointers!  I am in the same boat, although my issues may just be my shape. My only solution has been to wear wirefree. You might get more helpful suggestions at r/abrathatfits, they know their stuff and can suggest bras with softer wires. Thank you so much! I have been on the hunt for a good wirefree option I have switched to a padded camisole or a sports bra because at least they do not have bloody lace to drive me into a frenzy. Oh my godddd, the lace. The absolute worst. I have been using sports bras too but had not thought about trying a camisole- I will definitely give this a shot! Thank you!

I noticed that when I excessively wash my hands, with soap, my skin gets really tight, irritated, and scratches easily. The scratches also puff up which I have seen with pics associated with dermatographia. When I do not wash my hands excessively, I do not have this. Anything that triggers an MCAS flare triggers my dermatographia. That can be anything that I have an allergic or pseudoallergic reaction to, anything from walking past someone who is used perfumed hair care products or eating or drinking something that has too much nickel in it. Certainly using scented hand soap in a public bathroom would cause a flareup. &gt;MCAS flare \n\nI just thought it was strange, because if I wash my hands like 3-4 times a day nothing happens, but if I am washing my hands like 5+ I get it.

It started with crazy itching in the palms of my hands, and quickly it affected rest of body. Zyrtec helps the itching, but at the lightest touch, my skin still turns red for 20 mins and I can feel heat (especially on the face). Extremely frustrating. Went to allergist, dermatologist....none of them have been able to help. Had several bloodwork done to exclude serious stuff like  blood disorders, cancers etc... everything came out clean. This thing is driving me crazy. Anyone else having first episode in their 30s like me?  I do not get how this thing popped up like that out of the blue. I am 29 and mine came out of nowhere. I went to see a dermatologist and took all sorts of tests but everything seems normal. It is super frustrating as I lead a healthy lifestyle and I cannot link it to anything specific. I can also get super flushed and hot around my face (the ears are bad).\n\nScratching my skin = instant red blotches, but lots of other things trigger it and sometimes I do not even notice until I look in a mirror. I am lucky in that its not too itchy and does not affect my sleep. I have been on 10mg of Rupall a day for about a month but was told I can go up to 40mg if its a bad day.

I have tried Benadryl, Zyrtec, Benadryl cream etc and nothings worked. Any ideas? Allegra works pretty well for mine Just in case you did not do this: if you take something like zyrtec you have to do it everyday for like a week or so to get full effect! I would stay away from the Benadryl and do the Zyrtec only because of possible reactions, but I hope you are giving them more than one or two days each. Also to my knowledge dermatography is an overall body reaction. I did tend to break out more on my arms back and chest more so than the legs, but it was always an overall body experience. Are you saying that you are only getting it on your legs when you scratch or touch that area?\n\nIs there something that is touching only your leg region versus the rest of your body that it would just be that one item touching your legs? Also have you been tested yet for allergies or thyroid conditions? That is a good question I am not sure.

Trying to make the best of it.  :) HI Do you think dermatographia will go away on its own? I have suddenly developed mild itchiness all over my body as well as dermatographia a few days ago, exactly 14 days after my booster. It makes me concerned because I saw someone else say on here that their doctor told them it could last for years, but I sure hope not. Have you told your doctor? Mine disappeared completely after around 3 months, in case that gives you hope. After ANY shot, I put collodial clay to draw out whatever they put in.  If you are near a health food store, see if you can find some clay to make a paste and put on it. the stats I have seen is, around 30% it goes in a year, 50% it goes within 10 years I am not sure! I really hope it heals on its own. I read similar stories and people suggested taking one Pepcid AC and one Zyrtec daily to help with the symptoms. I started that today and so far, so good honestly. Just mildly itchy but no hives in the past few hours which is great! I am hoping it does not last too long but I have read other stories of it lasting for months. Oooh! Thank you for this idea! Wait.. I am also about two weeks post-Moderna booster and on day four of extremely itchy, all-day dermatographia symptoms.. is there some connection here? Because I am so freaked out I also have taken Zyrtec a few times. I have found that after taking it, my symptoms completely subside for at least 24 hours before it slowly starts to come back. I really hope that this goes away soon though. I do not want to keep having to take medication, if I can help it. :/ There seems to be a connection between the two unfortunately. Start taking one Zyrtec and Pepcid a day and honestly since i started that (i saw so many people suggest it on here so thought I would give it a shot) and it has helped tremendously. I am so sorry you are experiencing it as well! Hi!  My daughter is 15 and she has had dermatographia since age 9.  Doctors do not know exactly what causes it but hers came as one symptom (of many) after taking amoxicillin for strep.  Unbeknownst to us she also had underlying Lyme disease and multiple coinfections.  (she had already been having migratory joint pain and fatigue for a few months before that).  She also had swollen joints, itching, Flushing, rashes, hives, headaches, stomach aches, and Neuropsychiatric symptoms just to name a few.  She ultimately got a diagnosis of Lyme disease and PANDAS and treating that helped most of her symptoms after four years But she still has the skin, asthma, and Allergy \u2013 like issues.  She was finally diagnosed this year with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).  The specialist told us that it is a spectrum and luckily my daughter right now is on the mild end.  (some people have anaphylactic reactions daily).  Anyhow, I just think it is important for us to know this in case you start having other symptoms as well.  MCAS can cause problems with all body systems because the mast cells are all over our bodies and part of the immune response.  And people are correct in saying that, to address the symptoms, you do have to take a histamine one blocker as well as a histamine two blocker.  This is part of the treatment for MCAS and, in fact, part of the criteria for diagnosing it.  (if you respond well to the treatment and it works for you then that is a sign that you have MCAS).  \nSo it is definitely a good thing to research.  \nCurrently in the medical literature researchers have found that MCAS is often part of a triad of diagnoses to include dysautonomia (specifically POTS as well as connective tissue diseases like EDS).  (My daughter has also experienced mild symptoms of dysautonomia).  \nSorry, not trying to scare anybody here, but I have done so much research and just searching for specialists for my daughter so I have learned a lot and most doctors are not even familiar with MCAS.  I am not sure if it can get worse or not but we are being really proactive for my daughter.  \nAnd, while I think severe MCAS is not very common,  I think that it is some thing we should all be educated about just in case.  Otherwise, you could go years and years without understanding what is going on with your body and how to help yourself.  If anybody is interested in researching more you could also look up Dr. Afrin who is A hematologist and one of the first doctors to recognize MCAS.  He has also written articles about The current pandemic virus, \u201clong haulers\u201d and how this might also be related to mast cells going out of control.  It is interesting that several people on here have mentioned dermatographia starting after the shot.", "Developed this issue after Moderna booster. Hello all, just wanted to share my experience after finding out about this sub.\n\n\nI received my Moderna booster shot (3rd dose) on November 13. \n\nAround November 23, I could not fall asleep because I was itching EVERYWHERE. I was really confused as to why I was itching so much, I thought I had bug bites all over, but no, I was really just itching everywhere. I showered and fell asleep after a few hours, then in the morning I noticed I had hives in random spots: The back of my neck, behind my ears, my chest, my arms, under my stomach, etc. Definitely felt like it was allergies, so I ended up taking Allegra, which helped for a couple days. \n\n\nCome after Thanksgiving, I had an insane flare up on the skin around my jaw and also below my stomach. I took more Allegra and it calmed down. The next day the Allegra stopped working. I kept flaring up throughout the day for no apparent reason. I decided to go to urgent care and they tell me the same thing, allergies. So they put me on steroids (Prednisone, which made me flare up for the first 3 days) and a stronger antihistamine (Vistaril). I took the Vistaril every 8 hours for a week, but to no avail I was still flaring up. At this point I was for sure it was the booster's effect on my immune system. I have never had allergies in my entire life. That, or I have some parasitic infection, which also does not make sense because I do not eat raw food.\n\n\nI finally got to see my general practitioner and still, they believe it to be some seasonal allergy. Now I started taking Zyrtec, but even then I was still flaring up. On top of this, my sinuses started acting up and I got a terrible cough + runny nose. \n\nFast forward to today, I came across this subreddit and tried scratching my skin--I have this skin issue!! I do not know how it took me so long to notice. \n\nThis shot has made me unable to work for the last two weeks because I was either itching everywhere or tranquilized by the Vistaril. And now here I was thinking I had COVID because of the cough and runny nose. I am off the Zyrtec right now and have been careful with my skin and seem to have no flare ups... but I cannot help but think that my skin is hypersensitive right now to everything I touch. I still keep finding random raised spots every once in a while.\n\nThanks for reading.", "why is my skin itching, and when I scratch it I get red lines Did I get a bite cause I am always outside sitting?

I also started taking something called \"Astra c\" from the same supplier, but based on my own observances, the other product is working much better.  \n\n\nI am not related to the company at all and have no investment in this, but i really recommend giving it a shot if you are out of luck with other remedies/treatments.  \n\n\nHope it works for you! &lt;3 This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot.

I completed the course of antibiotics but then not long after I developed a strong need to itch my legs and it got bad. Over the span of a week or so it started going up my body, affecting my arms then then finally affecting my face.\n\nI contacted the GP who was not helpful. At the time I did not know it was Dermatographia or that was even a condition, I described it as a hypersensitivity to touch that caused the skin to go red and flare up. I got the typical, it is an allergy, try changing things etc bit.\n\nEventually through enough searching I found out about Dermatographia and then mentioned it to the GP. At this point I would just been offered *Fexofenadine* which did not do a lot and I would been using typical off the shelf antihistamine with little effect.\n\nNow I saw the dermatologist, he agree it was Dermatographia and that there is no known reason for it. Then told me it had become more common because of covid and that is likely what had happened, despite the fact I have not had covid as far as I am aware and had no unexpected reaction to the vaccines after 3 doses of pfizer. I mentioned I would see a lot of people mention modern was causing this in people but he seemed to ignore that. He equally seemed to dismiss the the antibiotics being the cause but I have seen that antibiotic come up a fair bit with Dermatographia.\n\nWas curious anyone one's thoughts? Personally I do not think covid did it to me, I am fairly sure for me it was the antibiotics triggered it still but does not really matter, I hope it goes.

She is had this since she was in middle school and at first we thought it was just an allergy to pen ink because she was a prolific writer on herself. \n\nHowever now over the last months she is having constant itching and red welting all of that from seemingly nothing. Her Dr finally told us about dermatographia but basically told us there is as nothing to be done, suck it up and take some Benadryl. \n\nWell the Benadryl is not working and some times her skin is so irritated she does not even want to come out of her room. \n\nWhat can I do? I am so desperate to help my girl. Will an allergist be able to do anything? Are there any other treatment? Lotions? Meds?? \n\nWe have tried Zyrtec too one pill in the AM and it does not seem to help much Go to a dermatologist and ask about xolair Immunologist or allergist. Maybe see a rheumatologist as well Allergist can help more. I take 2 Zyrtec in the morning instead of one. Maybe that could help instead of just one. However I am an adult male and my doc specifically told me to take 2. Dermatographia is linked with vitamin D &amp; vitamin B deficiency (especially b12). I have found that if I stay on top of my vitamins every morning, my symptoms are lessened, or not present at all. Sometimes I have to take more before bed if my skin gets irritated again that evening. \n\nDef have her get bloodwork done , with a focus in vitamin deficiency. While you wait on results, order a good multivitamin, and a separate b12 &amp; D supplement.  If nothing else, b12 is good for energy &amp; D helps the immune system. Cannot hurt to try. Good luck mama! Zyrtec 1/day really helped me. Zyrtec, xyzal and benadryl do nothing for my dermatographia. Allegra and Claritin help. I definitely recommend you experiment to find which drugs work best for you. Everyone is different.\n\nI take allegra every day and a claritin if it gets bad. I also take famotidine, quercitin, D3 and B12. They all help a bit. \n\nThe biggest thing for me was finding out what I am allergic to in food and on my skin and avoiding it. It is funny because Zyrtec works great for me, and claritin did not do squat. Weird how bodies work. Zyrtec!  Please do go see an allergist or endocrinologist as allergies and thyroid conditions tend to be the cause.  Give Zyrtec a few days not just one. I went to see an allergist and he ran several types of blood work. Come to find out I have a thyroid condition and have been cured for many years now.  I have to tell you that my allergist told us that there was nothing to be done I had to live on antihistamines for the rest of my life. When I pushed the doctor and ask multiple questions about the cause of these hives he kept blowing me off. I guess he got frustrated when I would not stop and said well it could be your thyroid but you could spend hundreds and thousands of dollars doing testing and never find the cause. That is what I walked out of his office and never returned because he did not take my mother's thyroid cancer into consideration. Sometimes you just have to advocate for your child. The only good thing that allergist did was run the proper blood work. Does consuming antihistamines lead to lethargy? With Zyrtec, not for me. With Benadryl, yes.", "numb? not sure if it is something else but does anyone else fele they are scratching themselves when they do? its been like this for a while now almost like a numb feeling Can you rephrase your question?

I woke up this past week and noticed a few times when my hand left a dark red imprint on my forearm. I really thought all of this was related to a heart condition, so I went in for an ultrasound of my veins and and EKG. There was not anything overly abnormal, so I made another visit to my PCP and pushed the issue, and showed him pictures of my skin after night. He looked at the pictures and said it is dermatographia. I did not know what he was talking about, so he took a tongue depressor and wrote an A on my forearm; he then did the same to himself. My A stayed and his went away. In fact, the thing he wrote on me stayed on my arm for like five hours.\n\nAnyway, I know nothing about this issue; the doctor said it was benign and an allergic reaction. Everything I try to look up provided minimal information. Anyway, just venting because this is such a weird issue to have. Yeah for me I can control it a bit by taking Zyrtec every couple days. Of the allergy drugs it is my understanding that it is the best for skin allergies. Also avoiding some fabrics that irritate my skin, e.g. wool. My skins marks SUUUPPPEEERR easily. At first i thought it was probably a serious heart issue, but turns out i have anxiety and dermatographia,  and deep, long lasting imprints on my skin are just something i have to live with. I am glad someone has the same symptoms as me tho :) Many folks here with Dermatographia (including myself) got it after taking an antibiotic, while others have mentioned thyroid issues, certain allergic reactions, or nothing at all triggered theirs. There is really not enough information on this condition unfortunately, but finding the right antihistamine does wonders for itchiness and burning. I myself take cetirizine daily. Eating a healthy diet while minimizing alcohol and sugar consumption also seems to minimize symptoms. Look up mast cell activation syndrome. Sounds like you have it if dermatographia is not the only weird issue you have been having. It sounds like you have it from your description. It often first manifests during periods of stress. I am sorry the doctor did not take it more seriously. It can be severely uncomfortable and often medical professionals do not take it seriously enough. Zirtec works for a lot of people. Also, once it is itching, try not to itch it or it will get much more inflamed. Good luck! Also, finding  the right doctors  is important.", "Does it ever go away? Or is there a treatment option for it that prevents it other than anti histamines helping some? ", "Worth mentioning as a medical condition? Hey all. I have a fairly mild case, and luckily it only flares up a few months out of the year. I saw a post today about putting medical info in your phone so it can be accessed in an emergency, and that got me thinking. Is such a mild case worth mentioning in the 'medical conditions' field? It is not really more than an inconvenience to me. Just seems too trivial to be mentioned in an emergency. For most people I would say no Yes, include it because EMTs are mandated reporters of abuse.\n\nI personally know of a case where family members of a patient where charged with abuse because mandated reporters thought the patient's welts were caused by abuse. It took my friends a long, uncomfortable time to prove the welts were unintentional because dermatographia was not already written in the patient's record. Go for it, in the event of an emergency, medical or otherwise, any additional information that is available to responders is useful. I would also add anything you might be taking aisle side or otc for it (e.g. Claratin or benadryl) along with dosage and how often as that might interact with any drugs admistered.\n\nThis is more of a hypothetical but if you were to wind up in a hospital for something, the staff knowing you have it might save some precious time wondering why you are seemingly breaking out to something in your treatment. That is an excellent point! I had not even thought of that.", "New poster, I take 2 Zyrtec every single day to try to make it better, it only helps half the time.

Also developed dermatographia after Moderna booster. Im going on my third week. I just reported it to VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systems). Hoping that helps researchers figure out what is up. I think maybe we should all report it, since it seems like it might be a weird rare thing. I am super curious if it will subside with time or if it might get worse whenever we are due for next booster.", "Probiotics Has anyone noticed an improvement of the urticaria after taking probiotics and rebuilding the good bacteria in the intestines? Seems like quite a few cases of dermatographia are caused by bacterial imbalance. I would be interested to hear about results too. I would need to drop a few of the supplements I take to take probiotics and I am not sure if it will be worth the switch Yeah I seem to have less inflammation when on probiotics. Flora plays a big role in inflammation and histamine. I am convinced there must be a major connection between this condition and gut bacteria, especially since many cite antibiotics as the cause. Mine came on after drinking alchohol for the first time, with existing IBS/general indigestion. I have read conflicting info for how alcohol can both kill good bacteria or allow bad ones to populate so I am unsure which one is the case for me...but it is definitely caused by a bacterial imbalance I think yeah personally I have never seen alcohol having any effect on my dermatographia. I am thinking certain gi issues, Especially indigestion and heartburn, could be partially due to histamine excess. Histamine plays a big role in creating stomach acid so perhaps there is a connection there. Hence why h2 blockers help the redness of dermatographia and are prescribed for heartburn and stomach issues.", "Is this dermatographia?

I am seeing an allergist soon but I am not sure that is the right person to see. Should I see a dermatologist instead? I love seeing your posts and feeling less alone Yes it looks like it. Welcome to the club! I think the first step would be to see a doctor/dermatologist if you can and then do investigations by checking for any intolerances/allergies/doing blood tests etc. Try to reduce your exposure to foods that produce an inflammatory response and take anti-histamines if it is bothering you. I would stick with the allergist. They can run comprehensive blood panels (like for autoimmune disorders) and test for nickel sensitivity, which seems to be a common denominator in a lot of us. The dermatologist can help too, but I think since it is mostly assumed to be an allergic response starting with trying to find a trigger would be your best bet. Good luck! A number of us have hypothyroidism. Does seem to have a link. Best of luck from me, who also has both! Agreed... Stick with the allergist and they may very well not only run allergy tests but like my doctor did thyroid tests. I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis, once treated with proper medication my Dermatographia has never returned. probably, that is what mine looks like on zyrtec I definitely agree with staying the allergist, in my experience my allergist was actually the one who diagnosed me! And if the allergist does not listen to you then i would move on to the dermatologist Yep That is exactly what my son has.. Gets very itchy for him.. .. Started 3 months ago when he was playing cricket on a wet day.. But I suspect it is the scratch he got from his classmate when playing with little steel wire they got at the daycare. have not seen any specialist yet, we are waiting for the referral still.. He is on zyrtec at the moment.. And happens every day around 6 in the evening.. Anyone got cured of this Did you every get exposed to nickel.. Asking because my son was scratched at this day care with small steel wire they gave to form shapes with.. I am wondering if that triggered it.. Not that I can recall. The nickel thing started before I was six, though. I had to wear gold earrings as a child because my ears would scab up with anything else. I thought I outgrew the allergy because I was less sensitive in my teens and as a young adult. I still do not have the severe reactions I used to with earrings, but I also did not make a habit of wearing them longer than necessary if they were not nickel free. I am more careful since the dermagraphia showed up. Mine started later than normal. I was in my 30\u2019s before my first episode.

Only ways I know how is to\n\n\n1 - do not use dryer sheets, it makes the itching worse\n\n2 - do not scratch hard just scratch it a little bit harder than as if you would be tickling it\n\n3 - stay positive and think of it at a cool superpower ^_^  I am glad that I have mine :D\n\n4 - just in general try not to get scratched or and rough friction  Great answers hahaha. I see you did not answer take antihistamines, why? Also for number 2, one of the subscribers of this sub say they put something cold to lessen the itch and swelling. Number 3 \" The Skin Writers\". Well i have not been perscribed histamines or anything \n\nand 2 that is kind of a hassle because that means to always carry something cold with you\n\nAnd 3 \"the fantastic dermagraphic\" Well you have a point. I always carry antihistamines though.\n\nAnd 3 \"Attack on Histamines\". Seriously- Zyrtec 20mg/day is life changing and simple. Takes away the itch completely for me.

I do not pop pimples anymore but when I do it looks like the spot gets a huge bump. For example I did it on time on my chin and it stoos out like 2 cm Yup.

Just as the title says. I am always itchy but on days where I am particularly itchy, getting little hives, I am terrified that my dermatographism will progress into anaphylaxis. Am I alone in this fear? Can anyone set my mind at ease? Medical anxiety is relatively common, so while I do not share your concern, I am sure you are not alone. Because dermatographia is not from an underlying allergen-trigger (other than....y'know, friction or a shower or my shirt hem or seatbelt), it is pretty straightforward - no other systems are going to get involved.\n\n I will not tell you not to worry because anxiety-brain will not always listen to that, but if there was cause to worry, Google would have some results for 'dermatogtaphia + anaphylaxis' that are not lists of allergic reactions. I hope this helps! True, at the end of the day, dermatographia is only a skin issue.\n\nHowever, I would like to point out that there are certain types of disorders associated/correlates with dermatographia that could bring about anaphylaxis. \n\nMast cell disorders come to mind... \n\nTypically my dermatographia is exacerbated when I have a flare/reaction. I should have said if you are *only* suffering from dermatographia, you should not be concerned. Diving into hypothetical underlying conditions seemed counterproductive to alleviate anxiety, so I did not go too deep.  I have not read anything about dermatographism causing an increase in cases of anaphylaxis. Dermatographism is too much histamine in mast cells and I have read that it does not generally correlate to a specific allergen exposure while of course anaphylaxis is caused by a specific allergen exposure. When my dermatographism popped up about 10 years ago, the allergy specialist said that it can be activated by stress or even an immune response to something like the flu for those genetically inclined to dermatographism and then it can potentially last your whole life or potentially disappear eventually. \n\nI understand your fear because I had a horrible experience of anaphylaxis as a teen and have had to carry an epipen since. I developed dermatographism years later (which was not related at all to exposure to the allergen, lidocaine, which caused my anaphylaxis), but can sometimes get scared when the welts are extra bad that it could be the start of a severe reaction. If I am worried, I immediately take antihistamine and make sure my epipen is nearby and let my spouse know to keep an eye in case I have anaphylaxis since when I had it I could barely talk or breathe. I would recommend talking to your doctor and if there are specific anaphylaxis risks, they may prescribe an epipen. If you have some bad allergies, I reccomend advocating for yourself because it can be hard for people to get epipens these days due to the shortage. I hope you feel better.

Because I sometimes get itch attacks in the middle of class and look like a psychopath rubbing my back on the seat and trying (and failing) to discreetly scratch myself. Thank you for any help! Above any other drugs you must learn to resist scratching your hives. I know it sucks but if you improve your tolerance for itching life does get easier since scratching only will make things worse. Other than that reducing foods that increase levels of inflammation and taking a lower dose antihistamine are the only other effective solutions. Get an ice pack from the nurse if you can when this happens at school. I do that to keep from skinning myself before my antihistamines kick it. Or they just are not working. If you get frequent attacks your doctor can prescribed an antihistamine you can take daily. Another thing is Aloe. Keep that on hand at school. Make sure not to take super hot showers as that will just make things worst, use fragrance free soap if you can, and keep your skin from getting dried out.

I am strongly leaning towards getting the Covid-19 vaccine soon. I was wondering if any of you with dermatographia have been vaccinated and if so, how was the experience for you?

Thank you so much to everyone in advance! moderna 23 yom I have had dermatographia for six years no reaction greater than the normal reported symptoms.  Ok, good to know. Thanks! Had no reaction whatsoever from my skin but had normal symptoms overall. I got Pfizer.  That is awesome to hear. My main concern was that the vaccine would make my dermatographia worse. It is good to hear that was not the case for you. Thank you! Dermatographia stayed as normal but I grew an extra dick. Weird right! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Twice the fun now! Thanks for the info! 2 inches of doom my dude \ud83e\udd19 I got Pfizer and the extreme itchiness went away for a few days. Lol! I thought I was cured but of course it came back. I just got the pfizer vaccine and was worried about having a flare up, but I am happy to report it did not cause me any issues in regards to my dermatographia.\n\nThe only side-effect I had was a midly sore arm. But nothing more than any other vaccine.\n\nEdit: also, I mentioned my dermatographia to the nurse who gave me my shot, and she said she had helped a few other folks with the same condition and they did not have any issues. They still had to monitor me for extra time after getting the vaccine (30 mins instead of 15) because of my allergies. But I was all gooood! False hope sucks lol. Glad to hear you are doing well though. Thanks! Ok, this is incredibly satisfying news to hear. Glad everything went well. Thank you! I had the pfizer vaccine. I had a sore arm and spent a half day feeling like I was mildly hungover after shot #2. No issues with my skin or anything else. I would do it again in a heartbeat! That is great to hear, thank you! Dermographism stayed as is. I had the usual symptoms that most women do. Felt like I had the flu and had been ran over by a truck for about a day. Worst part for me was that I got a migraine within 1 hour of my second shot. We got the Moderna. Sucks that you got a migraine. I am glad you are feeling better. Thank you for the information! It did suck but I will take it over the possibility of getting my 3 year old or my grandma sick of I can help it. It is worth it in the end. \ud83d\ude0a I had my first Pfizer vaccine back in April, and had nothing but a sore arm immediately afterwards.\nAround 3 weeks after the vaccine however, I had a flare up of dermatographia, and exceptionally bad hayfever-like symptoms. Sore throat, sinus blockage, migraine, chest tightness and wheezing. \nI visited my doctor, who said that it was likely that the vaccine had exacerbated my seasonal allergies triggered by an overload of histamine in the body.\nPresumably I created a ton of histamine in response to the vaccine. \nAnyway, he prescribed me the usual, and advised me that I should get the second dose, as that was probably the worst it would get.\nWell, he was wrong. I had the second dose 5 days ago, and sore arm aside, my dermatographia is now at a point where even my loose clothes are causing it to flare up, anything that touches me really. \nLuckily, the seasonal allergies still seem to be under control though.\nBare in mind that at the time of having the second dose I had already been taking regular H1 and H2 antagonists, plus a antihistamine /decongestant combo for my chest and sinuses for 3 weeks.\nMy face is pretty much a red blotch at this point, and applying any sort of cream just seems to anger it, so I leave it alone. The rest of the body seems to benefit from a cool shower. If it continues at this level I will have to go back for cortisone or steroid treatment, which I am really trying to avoid.\nAll of that said - it is still preferable to having covid, so I do not regret it.", "Fellow moderna-caused dermatographia sufferer here \u2026 Pretty much echoing what everyone else has said.

I am SO GLAD I found this group because I thought I was going out of my mind!! I have been taking Wal-D (generic Claritin D basically) and that seems to tame the itchiness for a good chunk of the day. I would been using benedryl anti itch cream but in hindsight rubbing something into my skin was just making it worse. I went to urgent care a couple days ago before I realized what was going on and the dr barely looked at me and just prescribed me 5 days of prednisone. I am currently on day 3 and so far the Wal-d is the only thing that makes any difference. I have a dermatologist appointment set for the 20th so hopefully I can get a diagnosis and more advice as to how to manage this. It is a bummer that it was triggered but I am definitely 100% pro vax and will continue to get boosters if necessary (just maybe Pfizer next time)", "So miserable I was diagnosed with dermatographia shortly after giving birth to my daughter. The doctors think it was set off after I suffered an extreme allergic reaction to an antibiotic I was put on. I have been dealing with this for almost 3 years now and I am sick and tired of always feeling like ripping my skin off. I have been prescribed multiple antihistamines but I feel nothing works. I currently use Shea moistures African black soap for excema  and sarna cream for sensitive skin and when I get a really bad flare up i take hydroxizine. Although these things help take the edge off a bit I am still so miserable everyday. I read about an experimental treat where they use light therapy as temporary cure, it is really expensive so most insurance will not cover it but also most doctors will not prescribe it. How does everyone in here get through the day and deal with the constant suffering? You are not alone! I have found that besides anti-histamines the best remedy is will power. For me my itches are a bit like nicotine cravings. If i can ignore the need to itch for 10 minutes or so, the worst of it will pass. If stress is one of your triggers it can be a viscous cycle. You get stressed, it will trigger a reaction, you get more stressed from the itching, and then before you know it you are itching your entire body like a mad man. I have found it helpful to sit down and take deep breaths when i start to feel an itch coming on. Also, stay hydrated, moisturize, try experimenting with different detergents and body soaps, and ALWAYS keep anti-histamines on you. For me the Kirkland brand (Costco) anti-histamine gets rid of almost all of my symptoms in 30 minutes or less. Mine peaked in high-school and early college and it is now much better 5 years later. Hang in there, it will get better with time. Anti-histamines and a good sense of humour. Not only will there always be someone excited to write rude words on you, but keeping a big container of lotion by my desk makes me feel like all those \"We got you sexy on webcam, give all ur Moni3s\" emails have a legit target.   \n\n\nMore seriously though, swapping to soft padded camisoles/t-shirt bras and a bit of work on cuffs and shirt seams helps. Experiment with your laundry detergent, you might find one less irritating for you than others.   \n\n\nToday's being a rough day for me, and I suspect it is the fact that we have finally turned on the heat in the house.

Any small scratch would set it off including rubbing up against my bed sheets at night which would make it difficult to get to sleep. I tried a bunch of options including oral antihistamines, topical creams, alocane spray but nothing really helped. \n\nIt only recently occurred to me to search for a relevant subreddit to find a solution. I saw a few posts about diet so I considered the problem might be diet related. I completely cut meat (mostly red meat) and dairy out of my diet for a few days and noticed significant improvement. This was not very feasible for the long term so I tried to find a more permanent solution.\n\nI have tried oral antihistamines like benadryl and Claritin but noticed no significant improvement.

Taking a single xyzal almost completely cured my dermatographia. I noticed immediate improvement that night and the following nights.

If you have seasonal allergies, you may notice that when your seasonal allergies are acting up, your dermatographia becomes more of an issue. It will not mean that meds are not working, just that some times of year are rougher, allergy wise. Congratulations! I am glad you were able to find something that helped you. But I have to ask if you have gotten tested for allergies or your thyroid? Things to consider Oh my doctor, not op, said people with thyroid issues get it more often. Yep, that was me.... dermatographia  was my only symptom  which led to my Hashimoto's.   Dermatographia  in remission  now thank God I just found out I am allergic to garlic, I think that is what is causing mine cause it flares up when I accidentally have something with garlic.  But since I have no thyroid the doc mentioned it to me.  I am just happy to hear you at least found out about your Hashimotos. This was more of a sudden increase in symptoms for me around May. I have had dermatographia for several years and have not noticed increases during particular times of the year. I do not have seasonal allergies. I have not. I went to my PCP who prescribed me antihistamines but for some reason my insurance did not cover it and it cost an exorbitant amount so I just stuck with benadryl until I discovered xyzal.\n\nDo you think there is a connection between thyroid issues and diet? Since I noticed an improvement after adjusting my diet I assumed the primary cause was inflammatory foods. Consider getting 2nd opinion for food allergies or thyroid.  My D was thyroid and is controlled thanks to thyroid meds.  I know others control D with diet.

We can get you help.\"\n\nThat last one is more for the single scratches on the hand/wrist/forearm and is both annoying and good to hear because it means that the person asking cares about humans Personal favorite Persorite.\n\n***\n\n^(Bleep-bloop, I am a bot. This )^( ^( was created from the phrase 'Personal favorite' | )^( ^(|) ^( ^(|) ^(", "Beginning and cause I am interested when did you guys started having dermatographia symptoms and if you know what caused it?\n\nI have had it for 4 years and have no idea what caused it. My thoughts go to gastrointestinal problems since my intestines act like I have a mild version of IBS. So I am thinking maybe some tears, leakage and therefore some kind of autoimmune response that manifested itself on skin? From what my dermatologist told me, any major change can throw your body into overreacting-mode. For me, I started new daily meds a week before it started - and it was very mild at first so I did not even really make the connection for a while. (Got bad enough over the last 4 months, though that I sought out said dermatologist and we put it together.) He specifically listed major illness and new meds. Mine started soon after I ended a course of antibiotics for H Pylori. I think you are on the right track. I suffered with a daily swollen and irritated stomach before being diagnosed with H Pylori. My allergist believes the swelling and irritation moved from the stomach lining to the skin. Mine started approximately after I had strep throat and took the antibiotics...I am assuming. I really have no idea and it is extremely frustrating how I have not seen any positive changes or an end as I have had it for almost 3 years. Ugh Mine as well, I had strep rash (scarlet fever) Has yours went away yet? Actually, I am thinking stomach issues are caused by (maybe) the excess histamine from dermatographia. histamine plays a big role in the creation of stomach acid, so I am curious if it could cause an excess. Or, you could have MCAS, in which mast cells can activate in mainly any area of the body. This can occur in the stomach. Recently I had some gi/stomach issues and my dermatographia got worse, so Idk Nope, had mine for probably 7 years I, too, think food matters.  I noticed that cutting out dairy (including butter, whey protein powder &amp; bars, cheese powder etc) really helps a lot.  I also take a Zyrtec every day. I started noticing 5 months ago that my clothes were marking my skin much more than usual. Socks, sleeves, any kind of fabric texture, pant stitches, etc. and I freaked out because i thought I had some kind of heart condition causing water retention. But my doctor told me it was not water retention, and i probably had a mild case of dermatographia. That is when i started noticing the other symptoms, and the ones I have had forever. It is probably caused by chronic anxiety. I do not have panic attacks, but I always think I have a serious decease or that I am going to die of some kind of cancer. It is great. Mine started when I was about 11-12 (over 20 years ago) so I am guessing it had something to do with hitting puberty (as if that was not enough to deal with!). Mine started about 5 years ago during a period of high stress. I also started having problems with Raynaud's disease around that same time. Not sure if there is an auto-immune connection or if that is just bad luck. I have no idea if it is connected but I also struggle with gastrointestinal problems when I eat too much meat, or drink alcohol (especially highly acidic drinks) shortly before bed. Definitely had the itchiness. I am just throwing all that out there in case other people have noticed connections between these issues, themselves. ahhhh yeah a hypochondriac, I am one too Is not it just great? I have not had a chance to see my doctor due to covid, but I am like 99% sure I developed IBS this year and I notice that when I have flareups because my gut is not working properly my itching/rashes get way worse. I definitely think for some ppl it could be stomach/histamine/digestion related. Mine started around five years old when I would randomly get hives all over my body. Mom too me to a derm who did an allergy test but could not find any reasons for my reaction and just stuck me on Claritin and Zyrtec.  The hives soon morphed into welts whenever I would get scratched and have now morphed so that I get itchy for absolutely no reason at all. I have seen dermatologist and allergists and have not been able to find anyone that can help.  My mom actually thinks it a way my anxiety manifests itself.", "What is helped you, OTHER than antihistamines? I straight-up had to take sick time from work this week due to being barely functional from losing sleep every night due to itching for the past week and a half. There has not been a single night I have not awoken in the middle of the night itching. Only one of those nights, I have managed not to scratch. The others have been a blur of scratching &amp; trying to remember to try things in my half-awake miserable state (thank you to someone on here who recommended keeping aloe on hand--that has helped some nights).\n\nHere are some things I have been trying.\n\n-Homemade colloidal oatmeal bath. I do not think I ground it up finely enough. Not sure it helped. Going to try it again properly soon.\n-Heavy lotions. Usually I avoid these because they break out my face (inevitably migrating there from wherever they start on my body), but I do not even care anymore. I will take acne over sleeplessness from itching.\n-Aloe has helped when I have put it on the itching spots at night sometimes, but other times, it has not made any difference.\n-Steroid cream prescribed by my dermatologist. I have also hesitated about this because it will likely lead to my perioral dermatitis coming back (if it migrates to my face). Also cannot worry too much about that right now when the dermatographia itching is so much more pressing.\n-Stress reduction. Easier said than done in 2020. I read that progressive muscle relaxation exercises have shown promising results for nighttime itching. Trying to do that every night.\n-Gratitude. Telling my skin thanks for holding my body together. I have been mad at my skin, but that certainly is not going to help anything and the stress piling on just might make it worse.\n\nMy dermatologist has put in a referral to an allergist but I probably will not hear from them for a few weeks (and who knows how long after that till I will get an appointment).\n\nWhat have you all found helps with itching, specifically, and  sleeping at night when itchy? Some other things that have helped me is Cur\u00e9l itch defense lotion applied morning and night (it is a bit of a lighter lotion than the really heavy ones), synthetic fragrance/dye-free laundry detergent and wearing loose fitting clothes while sleeping. Antihistamines have helped the most, but these are added boosters to me. Unfortunately nothing helps other than antihistamines. I have been suffering for more than 6 years now and I tried everything in the early years to reduce dependance on anti-histamines- but nothing worked. Bath in ice cold water, bath in warm water, bathing 3 times a day, applying Indian nettle extract all over the body, neem oil, aloe gel, ingesting a ton of turmeric,  you name it- I have tried it. \nAnti histamine is the only thing which provides proper relief. The only things I have not done are exercising and and active lifestyle. An ice roller. Stays frozen all night (or at least for a couple hours, then it is cool) On really bad night I have to shake off all my sheets, vacuum the mattress and make sure there is not a single crease in my bedsheet since even the slightest speck of dirt/hair/crease will irritate and make something itch. Start by eleminating foods items one by one.Start of by reducing meat intake because you may be allergic to red meat and meat consumption produces a lot of heat which can cause itching.If it does not work then try eliminating gluten foods and avoid fruits such as mango and vegetables such as potato because they produce lots of heat.And consume fruits such as  papaya because they are good for skin.Make sure you wear clothes one size bigger then yours.Try avoiding silk and nylon clothes.Wear cotton clothes since they dont trap lots of heat.Andchoose colours such as white,light blue and yellow which are light in colour and are good reflectors of light.And use baby powder on your armpits groin and neck region in order to reduce sweat and powder reduces friction between your skin and clothes .You cna consume aloe vera juice .Make sure you exercise daily i?order to exhaust your body which helps in achieving good sleep and make sure you exhauat yourself mentally by reading or learning from a book.When there is a rash on your skin dont scratch it never and make sure you yoga atleast 10min daily.And dont expose yourself to pollen grains dirt pets this may cajse allergic reactions.Thanks for reading. I agree with antihistimes being the most helpful. I completely second the laundry detergent as well. I use a moisturizing body wash and I seem to be doing pretty well with that added to my routine. I think I will have to try out the lotion you recommended! I second this! I was so exhausted that I willingly did the grueling food allergy diet and discovered that I am sensitive to dairy - specifically cow's milk. Just doing the diet for 24 hrs provided relief, so I knew food was a culprit. \n\nGood luck to you! A lot of time dermatographia is brought on my stress/anxiety. If you can, get a prescription from a doctor for a benzodiazepine. If your mainly having trouble at night while trying to sleep maybe look into a sleep aid like melatonin or see if you can also get a prescription for Lunesta/Ambien. Calamine is the best anti itch lotion and it is not corticosteroid. Zyrtec is the best antihistamine for me and many others, try taking it close to bedtime for sleep. I notice brand name specifically works better, atleast than the equate version. Quercetin can be good, it works like an antihistamine, seems the effects only last for maybe a couple hours per dose though. For me I do notice that actually itchiness is often caused by food, try avoiding additives like msg, sulfates, and other preservatives. Eat a pinch of cream of tarter, before I knew what this condition was my mom told me that my grandfathers skin did the same thing and he would eat cream of tarter to relieve it. Surprisingly it helps more than you would think for quick relief. Benzodiazepines are soooo dangerous! Please take great caution before doing this after exhausting all natural relaxation techniques please please pkease research benzo withdrawal before taking Spray on aquaphor! It does not smell the best, but it works amazingly. Spray it on right out of the shower in your most problematic areas, in thin coats, and either rub it in or let it soak in.\n\nI do not suggest putting it on your face, just does not feel good.\n\nYou can also spray it directly on an itchy flair up!\n\n\nThe spray on stuff is easier for me as an adult who hates the feeling of regular aquaphor. Haha wow! That seems so random! Did you figure out why it helps? No idea lol, but apparently the tip came from my great grandmother who was an herbalist. We do not know why most of her remedies work anymore, but the ones that we remember do. Zyrtec and thyroid meds after diagnosis for me.  Someone  mentioned  lidocaine  spray like Dermoplast, maybe Solarcaine?", "Hyperthyroidism and Dermatographia Hi everyone I was doing some research on dermatographia. I have recently sufferer 2 miscarriages and of course until I go to the doctor wont completely know the cause but im wondering if its due to problems with my thyroid  or other issues with my body. However I researched that many people with dermatographia have problems with their thyroid. Very sad to hear about your experience. Me too have done extensive research on the internet regarding dermatographia. And in a particular page there was an article relating hashimoto's thyroid disease and dermatographia. It was a website dedicated entirely to dermatographia. A person called Arianna page Russel runs it. She has been living with this disease for several years and have helped a lot of people like me to find answers. Hope you can find more information there. \n\nAnd you can aslo try the askdoc subreddit. Several medical professionals are answering there. I had thyroid cancer 9 years ago and now got told I have dermagraphia.  I am unsure if I have ever miscarried, because if I had it would have been the timing of my period.  I wish you luck on your journey for answers! I have Hashimoto's Disease and Dermatographia but I am pretty convinced my Dermatographia was triggered after taking an antibiotic. I have had a hypothyroid now for about 13 years but the Dermatographia only appeared about 2 years ago after taking the antibiotic. Who knows though if I didnt take the antibiotic perhaps I would have still developed  Dermatographia anyway. I kind of assumed since my immune system is likely attacking my thyroid it makes sense that it may be overactive with my skin too. \n\nThere is still so many questions associated with this disease, unfortunately with not many answers. I would go see your doctor and express your concerns.\n\nBest of luck! I am having the worse outbreak today. Itching so badly and it leaves long scratch like welts all over my body. I know it is because of my thyroid, it just sucks to live like this I am not a doctor, but was diagnosed  by one endocrinologist.  My dermotographia  is gone now, am on thyroid meds, and have Hashimoto's.  Go see someone soon... have u asked your obgyn for help?  Gotten bloodwork  from them?  Not unreasonable  to ask them about your thyroid  or for bloodwork  since u have miscarried twice.", "Do you guys get flare ups in the palm of your hands and the sole of your feet? Mine hurt. I often get flare ups in the palm of my hand and the sole of my feet and it feels completely different than when I have it in the rest of my body. \nIt both itches and hurts, kind of like if a mosquito and a bee stung me at the same time so I actually have to get ice to help ease the pain.\nDoes anyone also find it painful? The only time I got a flare up on the palm of my hand was when I was scratching at a graze that was healing. It was uncomfortable but not painful. Are you sure the flare ups on your palms and soles of your feet is not dishydrotic eczema? Little fluid filled blisters that dry up over time? Only asking because I have heard that is very painful. Oh I did not know that was a thing. I am going to mention it to my dermatologist next time I see her, thanks :) My palms would itch and hurt constantly before I started taking Zyrtec for it I find when my antihistamine starts to wear off the itchiness starts in my extremities and moves inward to my body. I am assuming it has to do with the fact that your hands and feet are furthest away from your core so the antihistamine wears off there first. Im no doctor though, just a thought. SO much. starts in my palms and then my wrist will start to hive. I usually just wait for it to pass \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Totally agree with you! I didnt comment on the different feeling you get but I totally know what you mean. Its like a burning sensation.", "What Is your experience like with mosquito bites? Are they larger and itchier than usual because of dermatographia?  Yes, mine are always so much worse than everyone around me. They swell up and are painfully itchy. My husband even thinks I have an allergic reaction that causes adjacent hives. I just think mosquitoes also love me and feast like crazy. But yea, the dermatographia makes it worse it seems. Yeah I have given up at this point to stop itching them due to the overwhelming itchiness. I just expect to have scabby ankles during the summers. I try to use spray repellent during summer days and nights but never fool proof. I used to get where they would swell to the size of a dollar coin. Now that i take a antihistamine they are the size of a dime, but much more red Great description and same! They swell up to the size of dollar coin. If I keep scratching.. bigger! I do not take anything. Are the antihistamines you take over the counter? For my dermatographia I take xyzal every night and for my environmental allergies I use Nasacort nasal spray. Also i had to change my diet (according to my allergist) to help with the dermatographia as well They are horrific. Even taking a daily antihistamine they get huge and inflamed and if i have more than one i run a fever. I never scratch but they still always leave a scar. I got one on my upper thigh recently where i could reach it to scratch whist asleep and that one has left a giant blood blister mark the size and shape of an apple leaf.", "Getting itchy from the wind or air swooshing pass your legs? I am pretty sure i just have a mild cause because i cannot draw on my skin like others here. Whenever i go outside to walk, my skin becomes itchy. When i scratch, it becomes more like welts and a couple of lines.\n\nDoes your dermatographia flair up when you walk in the wind? Or just outside normally? With me it is the pressure of things, so i do not have any trouble of wind but i do got hives when i do pushups in a grassfield or when a bush scrapes against my body when i bike pass it. But the worst is my razor, instant terrible allergy which burns. Hmm okay, i think my skin might be sensitive to some things. I looked what irritates dermatographia and it is mostly certain fabrics. \n\nDunno this is my speculation, but i had takeout last night with was salty and heavy (i usually eat at homemade healthy meals). That might have been the cause. Oh well. The wind makes the hair on my arms move, that tickles my arm and causes me to scratch that then snowballs into scratching for an hour I am not fully tested too but had skin writing two years ago with icu visit. Now after two years i still have it but like 70% less. \n\nCould very well be that food triggers it, i do not know anything about that, maybe another Reddittor can jump in to clear that up for you. That could be it, cause my thighs were more itchy compare to my calve area. I usually on shave up a little pass my knee I do not know if it is because of my dermatographia or just because I am allergic to life, but all my exposed skin becomes red and itchy in the wind.", "Hi! New and looking for consensus Hi! I just found this subreddit and idk why I did not look it up sooner.\nI was diagnosed before covid hit and have been dealing with itchy hives for the last year (probably longer honestly) but I never knew I had it due to undiagnosed celiac. \nI am curious tho if anyone else has issues with perfumes or scented anything (shampoo, lotion, bodywash detergent). I have had to change EVERYTHING I use to \"sensitive skin\" and I miss using scented products but everytime I have tried I break out into hives.\nJust curious if it is just me or every else has this issue too. Thank you!", "Started out of nowhere about 3 weeks after my 2nd Moderna shot Hives and itchiness all over. Went to an immunologist who suggested I wait 6 weeks and take Zyrtec. I am in my 6th week and it does not look like it is getting any better. Has anyone had any luck with this? Does it ever go away or are you stuck tweaking for antihistamines for a while? So I will give you my semi-educated opinion as I am in dental school studying immunology rn. It seems like the people who get this have a genetic predisposition for it, but it does not always come out to take effect right away or I imagine ever for some people. The personal experience stories I read on this sub to me shows that most people have the onset soon after some type of allergic reaction or after taking major drugs like antibiotics or steroids. So if it is comforting at all I think that even if you did not get the shot you would eventually have gotten dermatographia anyway. I will also say unfortunately that there is no reliable source saying how long it lasts so I presume it to be a lifelong thing until proven otherwise.\n\nNow when I went to my allergist he said the same thing and to do antihistamine. Obviously this works since histamine is what promotes swelling. But my counter is that I would rather not rely on the drugs and by taking pills every day you are running the risk of building up a tolerance or dependency on them to reduce symptoms. \n\nSo I have elected not to take them everyday but rather only when my symptoms flare from stress,shitty diet, or even just randomly. When I first got it flare ups happened often but five years in and I barely notice it. When I do need it I literally only need half a zyrtec and I am good for at least a day but your results may vary. I found especially at first taking something before bed was helpful since you can itch while you sleep. The Moderna vaccine contains acetic acid, which is in vinegar and pickled foods. \n\nAre you sensitive to these or any other foods, medications, or skin creams? Acetic acid sensitivity goes hand in hand with sulfite, histamine, and salicylate intolerance. It is also more prevalent in people with asthma. \n\nIf you do not itch after consuming wine/beer other alcoholic beverages and your skin does not flare up after eating pickles, it is probably not the Moderna vaccine and the timing is incidental. \n\nThe good news is, the Pfizer vaccine does not have this ingredient. It is simply, mRNA, fats, salt, and sugar. \n\n\nIf you ARE sensitive to these foods,\n\nAsk yourself:\n\nAre you keeping a food diary to see if there is any correlation between what you are eating/putting on your skin and your body\u2019s responses? If not, start now so you can have 30 days worth to present to your doctor at your next visit. \n\nWhile keeping your log this consider the following.\n\nDo you itch more after eating prepackaged meats, hard cheeses, and/or non-organic canned foods on some days but on others seem to be ok?\n\nAre you sensitive to food dyes?\n\nAre you using any items with fragrances/dyes like soaps, laundry detergent, shampoo/conditioner? Try switching to fragrance and dye free. \n\nHas your doctor done an allergy panel on you yet?  If not, ask for one. \n\nIt does not take that long for Zyrtec (cetirizine) to take effect. As hives often resolve on their own, doctors give a medication in an allotted time frame to see if they go away. \n\nAt this point you should test other antihistamines. Zyrtec being ineffective for you is a good indication that levocetirizine (Xyzal) will also NOT provide relief. \n\nTry loratadine (Claritin) for a week. It is not as strong as cetirizine, but everyone is body differs and it should not be dismissed if you have not already tried it. \n\nIf that does not help, move on to Allegra (fexofenadine) for a week.\n\nIf this still does not work, contact your doctor and ask if they can provide you with a prescription for hydroxyzine, brand name Vistaril. \n\nIf that does not provide complete relief, ask your doctor about biologics. \n\nHope this helps. Thanks a lot of this! The immunologist does not think it is food related because it happens after I wake up, when I have not consumed anything for 9 hours, plus I have never had an allergy ive know of in my life (I am 32 now!) so it is really bugging me. Zyrtec works fine I am just wary of being too reliant on it and developing withdrawal itches! Right now a 10mg pill gives me about 36-48 hour relief. The doc said he does not recommend any immunological tests until I have had the hives for 6 weeks, so I am due a visit next week and hopefully find out! Thanks so much again, I will try to stop alcohol/vinegar for the next week and see if it helps Thanks a lot! I am going to try and wean myself off with half Zyrtec tabs. I hate being reliant on them! I am due a test with the immunologist next week and we will see how that goes! Mine unfortunately started right after my first dose and I made a post in this sub where many people came forward stating theirs was also triggered by the vaccine. I am now 6 months in after getting the vaccine and my symptoms are managed by 2 Pepcid and 1 Zyrtec a day. Unfortunately, unlike mentioned above, if I do not take the medication I actually have a breakout wherever there is pressure applied on my body.  No matter what I eat or how much stress I have. I got the Moderna also and never had any allergies or sensitivities to the ingredients mentioned above. Do not get me wrong, I do not regret getting the vaccine at all and would do it again if I had a chance to start over but I genuinely do believe that this was caused by the vaccine, not only for me but for many others on this sub. I encourage you to fill out an adverse reaction report because if enough people fill it out, it will prompt a study and investigation and you could at least help people who might be struggling with this in the future. In the meantime, it seems our only option is to live with it and manage symptoms. i posted about this too a few weeks back. i strongly believe i got dermatographia after my 2nd moderna shot. no history of food or skin allergies.\n\nmy hives and rashes were extremely bad the few weeks after my 2nd shot and i was taking 1 benadryl/day for about 3 weeks. i have stopped since the itchiness has lessen but it is not 100% gone. I have had many episodes over the years, so I know the Moderna shot did not cause mine, but I did flair after. I have had to take Pepcid and Zyrtec every day for 5 months, which is not my normal pattern at all. I think I may have suddenly developed this condition, but it was months after I had my Moderna shot. Not sure if it is related, but thst would seriously suck. A week after my first shot this started, it is been over a month now. Well I am sorry anybody has to deal with this, I am happy to see that I am not the only one. \n\nI seem to get hives mostly, with the raised skin writing only happening sometimes. Waiting for a call from an allergist before I go for my second shot. I am really concerned about this though and it has not been pleasant in the least. Any improvements now, 2 months since you posted this comment? Hi! Unfortunately, no improvements no:/ I went to an immunologist who told me to slowly stop taking the pills to see if it is gotten better and as soon as I stopped all the symptoms came back! She said it should go away within 6 months but it is been well over 6 for me already so who knows", "Spreading some love to this subreddit \ud83d\udc9c ", "Do you itch for no reason and where? I have pretty bad dermatographia and after a few stress induced episodes in college I started taking over the counter antihistamines every day. Nothing like writhering around your bed in pain reduced to tears from itchiness coming out of nowhere caused by literally nothing. \n\nI grew up with dermatographia and never had an issue with itchiness until college. Now with a daily antihistamine, the skin writing reaction is moderately subdued and the itch is gone. I switch brands every once and a while but usually get the CVS brand.\n\nAnyway, now if I do not take an antihistamine I can slowly feel the itch come back and it always starts in my palms and the bottoms of my feet. It is what reminds me to take my meds if I have forgotten!\n\nI have not found anything online on whether this is a generalized thing or just me. Everything just says that in extreme cases the reaction is accompanied by extreme itchiness but not much more detail. \n\nDoes anyone else have such unbearable itchiness that they need to take antihistamines everyday? Do you have any places that get itchy first? Have you ever had a full body reaction (not induced by a scratch)? Same locations for me, and I take daily antihistamines as well. (Otherwise, my dermatographia goes from amusing red lines to raised welts that look like BDSM taken to interesting levels.)  \n\n\nMy GP said the worst on my palms was probably stress related. It could be that university alone changed things up for you. Otherwise, might be a change in humidity? I have to take antihistamine everyday. The itch starts with the palms also. Then it spreads to the chest, shoulders, or outer thighs. I did not always have dermatographia, but it started happening in 2017. I have been taking antihistamines everyday ever since. I go through phases where I need daily antihistamines. The soles of my feet are usually most persistant, though it probably has to do with my thick callouses. \n\nIn college, before I was diagnosed or knew that allergy meds could help, I would spend nights in tears, tossing and turning in bed for hours and getting up at 3am to take cold showers. I still get it mostly on my feet, scalp, and weirdly enough, my thighs. Yes. I took Cetirizine (generic of Zyrtec) almost daily for about 6 years. Started taking it for seasonal allergies and then kept it up because I could not bare the itchiness when I stopped. I tried quitting many times over the years, but was not successful until 2 years ago. There were times when it was absolute torture. An itch could start anywhere, from anything or nothing at all. Then it would spread until I could not take it anymore. Cetirizine seemed to be the only thing that really helped.\n\nI eventually weened myself off it VERY gradually. I started by taking half a pill each day. Then every other day. Then I was taking a small nibble off each pill every other day. By the end I was biting off the tiniest sliver of a pill, and only taking that every few days. This went on for quite a while until I made the commitment to cut it out entirely. There were MANY times when I thought I could not bear it, but I did. Sometimes I would take a small bite off a Benadryl and that would help a little. \n\nIt was probably 8 weeks until I had full days without itching. It is been 2 years now. I still have random itches, but they do not drive me insane and I can gently scratch them without exacerbating it. Staying well hydrated always helps too. Wow this made me almost come to tears for being understood. I have never had anyone understand the pure agony I would be in Oh heck yes. People always dismissed it. \"I mean, itching is annoying but are not you being a little overdramatic?\" Ha. \n\nI do not stress about it anymore. If I had a recurrence without any meds on hand, I would 100% call off work without any guilt. It is straight up debilitating when it is persistent like dermographia is. i take the kirkland brand second generation antihistamine (non-drowsy). i will go through phases where i need them every day for months and then it seemingly goes away for a week. And it almost always starts on the back of my ribs, my lower back, my thighs, or the top of my ass. Stress is a big trigger for me, or if i wrestle somebody when i am drunk my entire torso and legs will flare up bright red. This whole thread. I relate and empathize with everyone. Have had this condition for four years now out of nowhere. My whole body would freak out on me and itch like mad if my skin is exposed for too long, or during seasonal fluxes. I usually carry aloe gel, Cortisone and/or some non drowsy antihistamines. In fact, a dermatographic fit that encompassed both inner arms, my chest, and sides, has just subsided as I write this. This is me exactly. I would always get itchy after wrestling my siblings when I was younger. Yup i think what caused mine was me being o.n alergy meds for 1p year my body didnt know the normal amount  of histamine anymore  and released extra to compensate for the meds eventually  the 1 oull of zrytec wasnt enough and i had to have more so i took benedryl  but i got depression and never had any energy  so i quit  and i have noticed it getting more bearable", "Hair loss and dermotographia? Lifestyle change suggestions? Has anyone experienced increase hair shedding in relation with dermotographia? The hair shedding and dermotographia appeared around the same time for me.\n\nSince the hives appeared, I have started taking Zyrtec everyday which helps with the welts and itchiness. I have also tried to eat more whole foods and cut down on the alcohol. My gynecologist suggested it could be an autoimmune thing although my blood tests all turned out fine except a slight deficiency in vitamin D. My allergist said it is \u201cstress related\u201d and not to go digging for answers. I have not seen any other doctors for it yet. \n\nCurious is anyone has had similar experiences with the hair shedding and what they found to help", "So itchy! And then i welt up and almost cut my skin open. Newly discovered this. In the last 3months my skin is soooo itchy. When I itch at all, I welt up. That Is how I realized I have dermatographia. \n\nThe problem is I can not stop the itching. I use benadryl stop itch cream on it, I take benadryl. And ill still itch for 15 to 20 minutes. I cut my skin the itching is so intense. Happens multiple times a day. \n\n\nUsually, back. Shoulders, arms and legs and sometimes my face are itch spots.\n\n\nWhat can I do? If you are at home or just relaxing, put an ice pack  on it. You want it to be really cold, like the kind of cold where it hurts. For me, it really helps soothe the itch, and placing something over the welts keep me from itching them. If you keep it on long enough, it will get numb, which is a bonus\n\nEdit - I also take an allergy pill (zertec, Claritin, etc) every night as a habit. Try to take the allergy pill before the itching starts See a dermatologist! People here can give suggestions but a professional is the only person that can actually know the best option to treat it. Until you get get to one, heating pads or ice packs work for me, wearing long clothes to cover where it itches and/or gloves to stop yourself. Make sure you properly treat where you cut yourself to avoid infections. Good luck!!", "Chiming in on Moderna booster-caused itchy welts Got my booster around Dec 17, symptoms manifested yesterday. At first I thought it might have been an odd reaction to caffeine withdrawal as I have not drank coffee in about 2 days after consistently doing so, and I have heard itchiness can be caused by stimulant withdrawal, but this has never happened to me before. \n\nLong story short I was researching the symptoms I was experiencing (itchy welts forming after mild skin irritation, as well as itchy palms) and learned about dermatographia and decided to look on reddit too which is where I saw all the reports on the Moderna booster. \n\nIt is wild that this seems to be a pretty common reaction to the shot and all I can say is that I hope it does not last too long. Take it easy yall.", "Dermatographia story Hi,\n\nI have developed dermatographia in May (during the winter, I was working in a big audit firm which caused \u00e0 lot of stress, my mom was selling our house which left me heartbroken and my boyfriend and I broke up). It has been very hard to live with and has got me very depressed. At first, I refused to take anti-histamine because I felt as if my body was telling me something....however I started to take them in August...when I was on cetirizine, I had no welts but my body would get red marks......&amp; I gained weight (no ich) Last week, I wanted to see if it had gotten better without medication and it has been hell. My whole body is on fire and the welts are worst than ever. Btw I was taking cetirizine....any opinions on why this is happening to me or the withdrawal feeling is hell......has anyone been able to cure thjs horrible skin condition\n\nThanks No cure (yet?) but was already taking anti-histamines when I was first diagnosed.

I was just going to ask this. I still have yet to find clothes that do not drive my skin nuts. I am tired of being miserable. Even loose clothes bother me if they rub my legs when I walk. It drives me fucking nuts. Can someone offer sound advice? My only advice is that I noticed when I take only lukewarm showers it reduces the itching from clothes a bit.", "can i drink while im on antihistamines? ", "Had scabies about a month ago, ever since treatment I have had severe dermatographia. I looked it up and it said it can come after certain infections. It is showing no signs of going away. I take antihistamines twice daily. I wonder is it stress related as I have also been pretty stressed because I gave up weed and started a stressful job. It is quite severe, I read that there seems to be no treatment and it goes away on its own most of the time? how long does it usually take? I am sorry you have dermatographia. It definitely makes life worse. And yes, stress does make it worse and certain foods and alcohol, lack of sleep etc. So, take some time and try to identify your triggers and note down what makes it worse. Note down every meal that you have and your sleep hours and any new habits or places that you visit(some allergens are place specific) and note down the severity of your  itching and flares on that particular day. This way you can reduce the dosage of your antihistamines and helps reduce your itching to some extent. And, Im sorry to say this but I  have yet to come across a person who said that said that their dermatographia went away on its own. (me too read on the internet but not heard  from anyone in particular saying that their dermatographia went away on its own.

For the past few months I have been dealing with this weird dizziness where, if I turn my head too fast, I get an electric jolt down my body and a split second of vertigo. \n\nI just talked to my doctor about it, and he checked my ears and commented that one seemed a little swollen. He prescribed an antihistamine for when it is bad, and made an off hand comment about allergies sometimes causing vertigo. \n\nIt clicked right then and there, that is probably what is going on. I had it worst on the day I moved into our new home, and it was really hot that day on top of us working hard. Heat is my biggest trigger. \n\nSo maybe I had a flare-up in my ear? Has anyone else experienced something similar? I get vertigo fairly often (I cannot turn around too fast or I will get it, definitely cannot spin in a circle, that sort of thing) but I have never connected it to dermatographia!  I have not either until my doctor mentioned the swelling. It makes total sense to me, and I am going to choose to believe it so I do not freak myself out with other possibilities :) I get vertigo but mine seems to be associated with sodium consumption. If I do not drink enough water, I get it until I drink enough and pee out the sodium. It does not happen the way yours does with the jolt but hydration is always important. ", "Anyone else having exceptionally bad dermographism this summer? I have had dermographism for the last 20+ years.  It used to be really bad in my teens and then somewhat subsided in my late 20s and early 30s.\n\nIn the last month or two, my dermographism has REALLY flaired up over the last month or two.  Not sure if it is the gypsy moths, the COVID vaccine, extra sun, construction on my house, or just something random.\n\nThought I would check to see how others are doing. Sun for me. It is 3am here in the UK, and I forgot to wear a UV protection hoodie yesterday. Bit of sun, and my arms are covered in bumps. So. Itchy. It is always worse in summer. Mine is worse when I eat too much nickel, and dry weather means plants have higher nickel concentrations. Plus hot weather and sweat irritates my skin. Interesting.  I have not needed meds in about 15 years and lately it has been a daily requirement. Mine has flared up in the last two months. I am getting pressure hives just laying on wrinkled sheets. I always get smaller hives on my neck and chest, but the full blown miserable dermagraphia has not been this severe in a couple of years. Same boat.   Can you attribute it to anything? Mine started this year, maybe March. I know what it is now, regularly take antihistamines and am generally careful about physical contact. But man has it been bad the last few days! Because I am still very new to this I dunno if it is because of summer or scratching myself unconsciously due to stress or some other trigger. My back looked like it had been whipped at one point today. My doctor's going to refer me to an allergy clinic, maybe a stronger dose of antihistamines will help. I honestly wonder if the Covid vaccine did not start the flair. I got fever blisters a couple days after each dose, and I am pretty sure those were a direct result. So maybe it threw my whole immune system out of whack? Or it is possible since I spent more than a year hiding from germs now that things are getting more normal my system is going crazy. The timing coincided both with my second dose and my state re-opening.\n\nI never knew what caused my first flair, and I was in my early thirties. It is come and gone a handful of times. I got the wonderful diagnosis of \u201cidiopathic chronic urticaria\u201d and some steroids. It is vaccine shedding that is taking place, it is affecting people with sensitive skin, because that is what Dermatographia is, western medicine always wants to create disorders or diseases and this is just \u201cSensitive Skin\u201d. Drink a gallon of water a day and flush out your system. I suddenly developed dermatographia after the second dose of Pfizer\u2019s covid vaccine. I have never had this before. I am also allergic to nickel, but it is never caused any problems in daily living. Trying to figure out how to get rid of this constant itching! The vaccine had to have been the trigger. Antihistaminics are the solution to the itchy part hi, how are you doing now? I recently also developed dermatographia after the vaccine. Wondering if others like me saw their symptoms fade over time. It will fade away, but it will take time.  My symptoms are more mild but I took the 1st Pfizer back in April, it is been over 4 months now.  The first month was hell, crying, desperate, scared I did not know what was going on with me body, I went to the allergist, PCP, hematologist trying to figure it out .   The allergist was who helped me prescribing a cocktail of antihistamines.  \nit will get better!:) just hang in there The antihistamine also help with the acid reflux.  The acid reflux is part of the allergic reaction.  Zyrtec and Pepcid together block the 2 different types of histamine on our bodies.  That helped me . Hi that is good to hear! I have also heard that vaccine related cases of dermatographia will fade within a couple months. It has something to do with the immune system having panicked from the injection, but the reaction is not permanent. Mast cells, the immune cells connected to our skin tissue have a lifespan of 12 weeks. So if you got a bad batch of maat cells releasing histamines whenever the hell they want, you have to live with it for a minimum of 3 months O.O. Unfortunately, MCAS is possible for many people, which is a permanent disorder of improper production of mast cells.\n\nHave you managed to suppress the redness? For me, medication takes all my itching away, but the red marks will remain after scratching. If that was gone, I would not even be able to tell I had dermatographia!

It can be almost everything! For me, if i am feeling overly stress, extreme emotions like i am too excited or happy or too mad, the itch is all over my body and my neck and forearms are full of stress hives Mines stress too for sure I was put on a steroid for a week and it went away.  I think mine was triggered by stress I used to have them form around my face after eating specifically in n out burger but it doesnt happen anymore. I figured it couldve been from the grease or from opening my mouth widely Sugar and alcohol are triggers for me. Any light grazing of my skin. Changing my clothes always triggers it. My ponytail.

I have searched it up and got mixed answers, some posts like this:( say that they have cured it, while other posts:( say that it depends on the person, but theirs hasnt been cured. Other posts:( say that it cant be cured if it helps, i think the primary reason for it is antibiotics i was prescribed when i had a cold, im also suspecting stress My understanding from a visit with an allergist is that the actual trigger is not well understood. Generally speaking it is treated somewhat like an autoimmune disease. My allergist told me in extreme cases, where symptoms cannot be managed by antihistamines alone, steroids or biologic medications could be used.  Although, the side effects of those medications often outweigh the benefits. She also told me the disease will fluctuate over time. I could go years without symptoms and than have a \"flare up\" and begin experiencing symptoms again for an indeterminate amount of time. My dad also has it, but his symptoms have been very mild or non existent for the past several decades. As far as I know there is no cure per say. You may just one day find your symptoms dissappear, and hopefully never return. Oh, ok, thank you, i was wondering because i am still in denial and cant see myself living with it for my whole life, I hope one day my symptoms disappear and so do yours. You too! It is a struggle. I have had symptoms for about 8 years now without much relief \ud83d\ude05 although I was told I have a pretty bad case of it. I have learned what works for me in terms of symptom management so most days I forget I have it. Good luck on your journey! good luck on your journey too! I had it 13 years ago for about a year and a half. I had patch testing done, and it seems I was not allergic to ANYTHING at that time. I do not believe they did any food sensitivity testing in 2008 for it. I now have it again since December. It is awful, especially at night. The first time, it went away with prednisone, but came back immediately when I titrated off. I was eventually put on  salicylate-free diet, and it cleared up in about 2 weeks - I would have minor flare-ups after that, but Zyrtec usually kept it under control. Now, it is back to the allergist/dermatologist ( will update once I see them). Good luck! It is a most annoying condition!!

Wanting to get a massage but feeling a bit apprehensive as i am not sure how my skin will react. I would say it is your skin and you know it best. My skin will react to some things and not others. I will say that the skin on my back is very sensitive to friction so I cannot imagine getting a massage will be very pleasant. I do not think anyone here can tell you how your skin will react. ask someone to press your back for a little while OR use a foam roller if you have one available and see how your skin reacts. You will get a better idea of how your skin will react to a proper long massage. I personally experienced a reaction from my partner pressing on my sore back, so for me I know for sure that a back massage is a big no no. Not for me, unless they do not use enough oil (though I will be itchy and possibly get a rash if the oil used is not plain coconut oil).", "Hello fellow skin disorder people!  Hey! We love to see it Been tested for allergies  or thyroid issues? Nope, I will test later tho", "Is this Dermatographia? For the past few months I have been so itchy!  It happens after I am done showering and I towel off or when I am in my bed. For the past two weekends after I take yoga I immediately start getting itchy. And it travels all over my body. I just switched jobs and have different health insurance so it is taking a while to her an appointment with my doctor so I am turning to Reddit to help. Here is a picture I took the other night. I get raised bumps and then lines develop when I itch. Do we think this is Dermatographia? I may start an antihistamine regimen until I can get an appointment. Also if anyone has any lotion recommendations that would be helpful as well. I never had spots as a symptom of \"skin writing\". The scratch marks' embossed looks more like dermatographia. Have they grown? If so, it could be an insect bite. tbh it does not look like dermatographia to me, it just looks like you have been scratching  yourself. I think you might be having an allergic reaction? check if you are allergic to something in your clothing", "Dermatographia after having COVID So my story is a little different I am actually not vaccinated but I got dermatographia after having COVID in July 2020. I was pregnant when I got COVID, had my baby august 2020. My baby and I BOTH have dermatographia now.. I thought maybe my body went wacky after this baby but after seeing all these posts of people getting it after being vaccinated makes me wonder if COVID caused mine. Seems very likely. Anyone else get it after having COVID ? I seen another post about antibodies .. my symptoms have decreased as time passes .. still here but not as intense as they first were \u2026 very interesting", "Flagyl antibiotics I have had dermatographia for almost a year now...it came on in January this year after drinking alcohol (vodka) for the first time. I had mild but noticeable GI issues for a few months before this so i think the vodka somehow caused some type of gut bacterial imbalance leading to the skin issue. It was pretty bad at first for a few months or so (could not even put my hands inside my pant pockets without getting itchy) but has improved over time. I also got a number of other issues around this time when I would eat that I think were histamine-related (mouth ulcers/swelling, runny nose when eating, GERD), all are pretty much gone at this point but the random itching/redness on the skin when it is scratched is still persistent, as well as prickly heat symptoms. After reading up on SIBO and how bacterial overgrowth can cause external issues as well, I got a test for it. Came back negative but I did have increased methane levels, based on that the GI doctor prescribed a 1 week course of Flagyl. I am a bit skeptical to take it as I have heard that antibiotic usage can sometimes cause/aggravate dermatographia and other immune system issues as it kills off good bacteria as well, and the fact that the negative test means I might not even have overgrowth to start with. Is it a good idea to give it a try anyways? Has anyone taken antibiotics while already having dermatographia and not experienced worsening of symptoms? For methane producing SIBO, Xifaxan with neomycin is the preferred treatment. \n\nI took flagyl and by day 4 I was completely delirious and could not walk or sit upright. Idk why the doctor prescribed this and not xifaxan...I did bring that up but he said flagyl would be the best treatment in my case Does he know you have dermatographia? I do not know about the medicine but your symptoms are just like mine, even down to the putting hands in pockets thing and the prickly heat. I hope you get some relief. Nope, I actually have not mentioned the non-abdominal symptoms. Just because doctors like to prescribe pills to only block the symptoms once they know what the symptoms are, without looking for a root cause. The root cause is likely whatever is causing the IBS and that is what needs to be treated \\*Disclaimer that this post is not medical advice and you should always talk with your doctor for medical advice.\\*\n\nI am sorry your experience with doctors has been that they only care about the symptoms and not the root cause. I can assure you that the vast majority of us care greatly about finding the root cause and, in fact, a huge part of our training is learning how to do that. I hope you are able to find doctors who are willing to listen and who care about the whole picture going forward. Sometimes it takes time to find the right doctor for you. \n\nNow about your post -- first, if you do not mention the dermatographism to your doctor, they cannot take that into account when prescribing a medication. Regardless, I do think the Flagyl is an interesting choice, and agree that Xifaxan is typically what is prescribed for SIBO.", "I have been getting crazy itchy and I find it hard to resist scratching. This is what is happened to my back. I tried researching and Im thinking it could be dermatographia. Im not sure why I randomly get so itchy and its my ENTIRE body. But worst is my back. This is really bothering me.. what can I do?  It is definitely Dermatographia, same thing happened to me when i first got it. I am one of the people who does not take anything for it because mine's gotten a bit milder now but my best advice for you is to get on some antihistamines, i believe some over the counter ones work but i hear a lot of people here use shots. \n\nUntil then use some anti itch cream and try not to scratch sith your fingernails just try to kind of rub it? But not too much friction or that will trigger it too, i can kind of lightly scratch but with how bad yours looks idk if it will trigger it too Mine probably looks so bad because this was after scratching vigorously and my nails are a bit sharp. Ill try to stop scratching but its hard because ill unconsciously scratch an itch and then it turns into a full blown scratching fit. Would gold bond powder help? Or should I use like a cortizone cream? Never heard of using baby powder to stop an itch but i used cortizone cream myself, but yeah at first it will be really hard to resist full-on scratching but eventually it will become second nature to you. I have had it for like 3 years and i totally forgot what it is like to scratch normally hahaha Theres gold bond meditated powder that helps relieve itch and skin irritation. But Im glad I figured out what is going on. I hope it doesnt last so long for me \ud83d\ude05 Second this. I take a daily antihistamine. When I do not take it my whole body goes back to extremely itchy. I found ice packs on the itchiest spots help. Scratching will make it worse. Even tight clothing makes it worse for me. I have heard of people having flair ups from stress or something but it could be a long thing \ud83d\ude2c Zyrtec works great for me; OP, you might have to try a few and find your poison. I take cold/cool showers during flare-ups because heat is a bad trigger, and even my glasses nosepiece can cause a rash. Summer sun can make my scalp really itchy too, under my hair, I think because the heat is getting trapped there. \n\nOver time you will learn what does and does not trigger it for you, and you learn how to cope. Welcome to the club, sorry it kind of sucks Try blunting your nails with a file Im actually letting them grow \ud83d\ude05 but um Im going to try not to scratch \ud83d\ude29 You can blunt the ends without actually trimming them, do not have to file them all the way. I do that sometimes, and I find it helps the temptation a little. Also I have a couple of anti-itch creams with menthol in them, might be worth trying(but test patch first). 100% dematographism. I have it fairly severely but if I take a cetirizine (that is the generic medication we buy in the UK) twice a day then it keeps it just about under control.\n\nThis is more than the advised dose of one daily but it was recommended by my doctor and it is been 10 years for me now with no signs of letting up. Probably worth checking with your doctor though or just trying one daily as I think that works for the majority of cases.\n\nBest of luck and I hope you find something that works quickly, the first few months whilst I was trying different meds were hell! Along with antihistamine, do not discount the benefits of staying hydrated! Drink water and get a good moisturizing lotion ( I really like the Cetaphil in the tub, it goes on like Crisco!) Yup 110%. I had this exactly happen randomly in February. My doc gave me an rx of hydroxyzine and now it is gone! I find that cetaphil triggers mine, so if you are like me, OP,and Cetaphil does not work, try vanicream. It has helped a ton. Yep!  You may want to go to the doctor to see if you can find the cause, which can be newly developed allergies or thyroid condition, which was my case. Zyrtec was a godsend at the beginning I have the same thing with my back :/ I know I have Dermatographia! I also noticed that some specific fabrics make my back VERY itchy, some necklaces metals do the same thing for my neck. Use good creams. Wear fabrics that do not make your back feel so itchy! This is my advice! I just practiced enduring the itch for about three years. Now I do not really have any problems with my dermatographia except when I climb trees because of the rough bark.", "Skin Sensitivity Question Hi! So, I am 99% sure that I have dermatographia based off of the welts that I get from touch. I am going to go ahead and put a TLDR here, but I will also include some background just in case. \n\nTLDR; Going through a flare-up that is so sensitive that my face can break out and burn simply from movement. Does anyone else experience this or have any advice to help calm it down? \n\nBackground:\nI first noticed it last fall but it was never severe enough to cause any problems. I have absolutely no idea what caused it, I had not changed diet, I was not on any medications, the only thing that had changed was moving to a different state for college. I was never extremely or even moderately stressed and it was about 1-2 months in that it became apparent. The symptoms I had were mild and not enough to get in the way, just entertaining and a little annoying. I had the usual clear redness to touch (hives, swelling, lasting around 20 minutes with pressure) and itchiness or burning but a fairly light amount. \n\nI kind of forgot about it for a while. It was there but it cycled and even when it was worse, it was not that bothersome, just more sensitive. \n\nNow:\nI want to say that maybe 1-2 months ago, I noticed my neck turning bright red every single time I changed my shirt with minimal touch, pretty much right away and lasting for longer times in relation to the amount of pressure. It happened all over to varying degrees and was more apparent than the usual \"worse\" cycle. Still not enough to be bothered too much by, just the insecurity of having bright red scratches on my neck. *The only thing that has changed starting around this time period is adding the medication Adderall and I have no allergy to it.\n\nNote: For the next part, nothing has changed from the previous months. Diet, soaps and detergents, location, water, medications, or even stress (it is actually decreased since then).\n\nThree days ago, it started to really flare-up. Welts started appearing harsher, it started to burn more, and the itching was a little worse. I went through and sorta tested it by applying different pressures (curious person) and even the lightest pressures had some sort of reaction (like running a finger on my arm turns red for a little). The heavier lines have super crisp raised lines and sometimes will not fully go away until over 24 hours (I have heard of people having a delayed reaction, might reacts, slightly reduces, and then turns bright again). Thankfully these more isolated points are not too itchy or painful, just sort of exist there. I have had break outs happen down my outer arm if  my t-shirt moves a little on the top part, patches that form from a small area of contact, etc. Most of the hives that I get burn a lot more than they itch. My main problem have been the flare-ups on my face. \n\nHighest sensitivity issue: \nMy face has been primarily burning and breaking out into slighty itchy hives without any physical touch. Like, if I move my face around or get up to walk across the room, this movement alone causes it to flare up. My room is not warm, there is no draft, I am not winded or experiencing physical exertion, no strong emotion, no fever or sickness, not wearing a mask, nothing that I can think of that would cause that. There is no clear touchpoint, just a spread of redness usually around my forehead, middle part of nose, and under my eyes / upper cheeks close to it. The only thing that comes in contact with my face is air. If I sit still for a while, it will mostly cool down and just stay right under my eyes (thankfully I am a student so much of my time is spent at my desk) but if I start to scrunch my face or again walk around, it starts to worsen. It seems so weird but I have not found any other thing that it could be to explain it.\n\nI mostly use cool rags and ice to help but I have also tried lotions, showers, creams, and I will start an allergy medication once I can. The only thing that gets rid of it is time. \n\nSorry for how long this is, but has anyone ever experienced anything like this? Any advice on how to make it less annoying? 24 jours for the welts to go down? That is unusual. Kindly check with a Doctor. Usually the welts go down in 20-40 min. And about the face, do you keep your hair clean and dandruff free? Grease/dandruff falling tobthe face may also cause itching and welts without touch for those with extra sensitivity. So sorry for the late reply, but the redness (not the swelling) can last for that long. When pressure is applied, the welts will appear and last around the 20-40 minute time frame and then it almost goes away. Then, it comes back in a crisp red line that lasts awhile. As far as the face goes, I do but I will definitely note that going forward, I have never heard anything like that. Thankfully that reaction has become more manageable since posting (but has not gone away). I am definitely checking in with a doctor as soon as I can. Thanks! I am not sure about the redness though. Myabe since I have a  brownish complexion, the redness is not visible. Hopefully you find answers and relief from your dermatologist.    Unfortunately there is not musch research about dermatographia out there. So, it helps us a lot to  come together and search for answers together.  I am not sure if anyone out there trying to find a permanent cure for this. The lack of information makes it tough, but it is great to have places to discuss this. I can also sorta see why it might not be studied as much because of the lack of severity and how it may not last for someone is whole life. Also with the lack of clear causes and how the effects differ from person to person, I feel like it would be difficult to cure (though that would be amazing). But hey, we have ice packs, allergy meds, and lotion!", "What works for me. I have noticed when I take my biotin vitamin (hair skin and nails) it keeps my dermatographia  at bay.

I then had anaphylactic shock for the first time in my life. None of my allergies prior had been severe enough to be concerned.  \nAfter that had happened that is when i was diagnosed with dermagraphism by reacting to a placebo allergy test. The doctor had told me to get kirkland brand antihistamines and take them daily. in the past i had noticed i would get itchy after being intimate or get a little more irritated than usual to some scratches, but never thought anything of it. the antihistamines seemed to subdue those reactions and i went on with my life. \n\nfast forward to this week i had been at work and a coworker had stupidly mixed some chemicals and i wasnt aware and cleaned the whole restaurant with what i thought was sanitizer until i noticed it was streaking differently. i had felt tightness in my lungs after and the next morning i woke up with rashes in sweat zones (underboob, lower back, forearm pits, toes, stomach fold) i tried multiple antihistamines, cortizone creams and even oatmeal baths. the rashes instead migrated to my entire stomach, my elbows, behind my knees, my inner thighs. i cant help but to think this triggered my dermagraphism as well, i seem to be able to trigger areas with friction no problem. but it is not going away, and nothing is working. unsure if it was related to the chemical, or if a different allergy triggered it.\n\nhas anyone here gotten rashes from other allergies which then made their dermagraphism not respond to their meds?   \nand does any one have any suggestions on how to make my rash go away, its been about 6 days and i was fine leading up to it.   \nits pretty common for me to gain new allergies to things. \n\nattaching a picture to see if anyone can relate to this rash, doesnt quite looks like dermagraphism but my inner thigh rash is. Looks to me like a classic allergic reaction to something, either to something you ingested or physically came into contact with. It looks like a form of hives to me. Which antihistamine are you taking? There are a few types of antihistamines: ones like Benadryl, h2 blockers, or Allegra. Benadryl can cause drowsiness. Newer generations of antihistamines, such as Allegra, do not cause drowsiness. I find Allegra (fexofenadine) to be the \u201cstrongest\u201d antihistamine, aka the best for itchy skin or hives. In extreme cases of hives or itch, doctors will sometimes also prescribe an H2 blocker, which are OTC medicines usually used for decreasing stomach acid. However, the combo of an H1 blocker (such as Allegra) and H2 blocker seems to have a good reducing effect for hives.

I am trying to figure what might have caused it to kick in. It usually just appears like that. Allergies and autoimmune stuff can develop at any time. \n\nMine is due to nickel allergy (in food) and/or MCAS. You might want to have a tryptase screening for mastocytosis, as it can also be that. I was told there is no way to reliably test for MCAS. Thanks for that.

My question is about how to take zyrtec,I try to take it maybe once a week even though after 3 days it is effectiveness wears off,but I have also heard it is good to take it every day but I am scared if I do my body will build up a tolerance for it and then I will have to take 2 pills a day I am prescribed 10 Mg/day. If I miss a day its super obvious. Ive been on this dose for over a year and have not had to increase my dose. GL! I have had to take one a day everyday for 4 years now. Like the other person said it is super obvious if I miss a day. And on the rare occasion that I am just extra itchy I will take a second one.\n\nSo I would not worry about building up a tolerance thank you thank you Yeah you do not really build tolerance to it, but after a long period of time it can stop working for *some* people. I would Recommend taking brand name Zyrtec at least as compared to equate (Walmart generic version) as It works much better. Yea I have been on daily antihistamines for 3-4 years now and if I feel they are becoming less affective, I switch between brands. I switch between the CVS brand and Zertec mostly. I take Zyrtec daily before bed (due to the drowsiness). When I develop a tolerance to Zyrtec, I switch to another antihistime for a few weeks to a month (this only happens a few times a year and my pharmacist mentioned switching when I become tolerant). You can usually feel when it is wearing off so you can make the switch. While Zyrtec works the best for me the others are far more helpful than the option of taking multiple antihistimes a day.

He said I could test and spend hundreds and thousands of dollars and never come to any conclusions to find out what was causing it. When I explained to him that I am the kind of person who wants to know what the  cause is and not just treat symptoms I wanted to know what was causing this. He pushed back and said there are hundreds of things that could be causing this so I just had to live the rest of my life on Zyrtec. I was not happy with it answer and pushed back again saying I want to know what the cause is what could it possibly be. He said well it could be your thyroid but again it would be a waste of time and money. That is when I thanked him walked out of his office and never returned. My mom had thyroid cancer for crying out loud and that meant nothing to him. I scheduled an endochronologist appointment got my blood retested and discovered a thyroid issue. When that doctor did not want to put me on any thyroid medication and just wait it out I told her that I did not want to live the rest of my life on Zyrtec treating the symptoms I wanted a test run of thyroid medication to see if that would stop the dermatophagia and guess what it is been working for over 11 years now. That allergist said that I could live my life Zyrtec with no issues, so I hope that helps you. I (21) have been taking daily antihistamines for the majority of my life (I will guess ~16 years at least) and have not had any problems that I am aware of (although with being on them so long a direct comparison is difficult).\n\nI am on them for a combination of issues. I often think about trying to come off them to see if I still need them; I have tried a few times but get symptoms so I go back on them.

Anti allergies does not really care because it solves the immediate treats like difficulty in breathing. So for me I only take it when I cant breathe or sleep properly. Hope this helps. Honestly, Zyrtec was strong enough for me even at my worst times. That one worked wonders because benedryl and loratidine both made me sleepy. \n\nHope you find something that helps!  I have had this for a few years and getting close to a full year of suppressing it with antihistamine. Still wake up with skin on fire. No luck for me with claratyne as that gave me the shakes.

Drugs like antihistamines are not as effective as changing your clothing, diet, and reducing stress. What is your diet like? Stress is definitely a big factor for me! What foods have you found to be irritants? My doctor mentioned processed foods could be.  Yes I have found foods like processed foods including bread and sugar to be pretty bad. The best my dermatographia has ever been has when I went on a diet that was mostly water, fruits, and veggies. Try that for 2-3 weeks and see what happens. Okay. I have not yet started to take any drugs, so thank you for your suggestion. I eat all types of foods, I am really inconsistent so I just eat absolutely everything. But it is been starting to happen more frequently again, and I think it has to do with the drier weather or stress now. Hey man, I have this condition too and it fucking sucks big time. Have you tried a couple tablets of  Fexofenadine daily? That is the only thing which has helped me recently. I still get flare ups sometimes but it makes them more manageable.

I have been super itchy the past few days now and I do not know what to do about it. You are the first person I have seen that seems to know how to possibly control this and id love to hear what you have to say about what I can do to help. I have had dermographism for as long as I remember, some years are better than other but recently it has been bad. My hives/welts do not improve much with medications but the itching does. My dermatologist has me on Zyrtec, and Pepcid daily. Sometimes Claritin if it is been bad. Benadryl as needed and Atarax is an absolute God send for intense episodes.  I have written a ton on my website (free stuff of course), so definitely check it out. I found that until you really understand WHY dermatographia gets worse or better, and start listening to your body, it is incredibly frustrating.

I actually have one scheduled for tomorrow. It is for chatting about the antidepressants I started a month ago but I will definitely mention it.

I think I messed up the angle of the picture, it only says \"hi guys\"", "New here, lots of questions! Hi everyone. I want to give a quick background before getting into my questions.. \n\nBack at the very beginning of December, I was diagnosed with strep throat (positive swab). I was prescribed penicillin, 2x a day for 10 days. After the 3rd dose, my lips and tongue swelled. ER treated me for an anaphylactic reaction to penicillin, was given prednisone for 4 days and Benedryl. A few days later, I was given Biaxin (clarithromycin) to help get rid of the strep. The day I stopped the prednisone, I took my Biaxin in the morning and my arms/hands felt swollen and my skin hurt; later that day my lips had minor swelling. I was back on Benedryl and at the ER they gave me a PPI for gastritis. They suspected I was also allergic to the Biaxin, \n\nI stopped taking all medication around December 10 until we could sort out the allergies. Interestingly, the strep was gone (another swab came back negative). \n\nLast week I went to an allergist for testing for penicillin. I tested negative for the skin prick and oral allergy testing. No swelling, etc. \n\nThe allergist says I have Dermatographia - especially while we were talking I scratched my chest and he saw the red mark that was left. I have noticed that during periods of high stress I will get hives, etc after a hot shower or if I scratch my arm sometimes it will welt, etc. so this was really interesting to me! He did tell me that the Dermatographia caused my body to react to the strep infection, not to the penicillin (as I had a negative reaction to their testing). He said when I get a bacterial infection in the future, to take reactin or Benedryl with the medication.\n\nI went down the google rabbit hole and found MCAS. Does anyone with Dermatographia have MCAS?\n\nSooo.. my questions:\n\n- has anyone ever reacted to a bacterial infection with swelling of the lips/tongue? Mostly I am just amazed that suddenly my body would start reacting to an infection like that, and it seemed to only occur when I was taking antibiotics to fight it. \n- are there any blood tests I need to ask my doctor for to get more info on MCAS? \n- I notice my skin reactions are worse the week before my period. Does this happen to anyone else? \n\nAny help or experience is appreciated! Yes. Dermatographia is very common in mast cell disorders. It is very common in MCAS and sometimes can be seen in mastocytosis.\n\nI would see about looking for an allergist or immunologist who knows about MCAS especially if you have already experienced anaphylaxis ... because experiencing anaphylaxis will be VERY common throughout the course of the disease. This means that your reaction to penicillin can turn into a one time reaction of any type of food, aerosols, bug bites...the sky is the limit with this in mast cell disorders. Yes, even if you have had allergy testing to specific possible triggers, you still have a high chance of reacting to something that was negative one day and cause a positive anaphylactic response the second day. \n\nPretty scary stuff. \n\nJoin us over /r/mastcelldisease and /r/mastcelldiseases. \n\nWe are in the process of moving our sub to the latter because of a rogue moderator changing the rules. So if you post in the first sub and it gets deleted, then that is why. The second sub is much more friendlier to new posters.\n\nEdit: Here is a site that is passed around us mast cell folks. ( Thank you! \n\nCoincidentally, having an anaphylactic reaction to a random thing is the cause of my panic disorder. About 15 years ago, I reacted to shellfish on three separate occasions; my only reaction however was digestive issues (diarrhea). Skin prick tests came back inconclusive (as I reacted to EVERYTHING they tested me for) and at the time, the allergist suggested I may be allergic to the carrier in the drops for the skin test, so I had a blood test done. The blood test came back negative for shellfish allergies. I had shellfish after receiving the results and I had no reaction. Mind you, I have not had shellfish purposely since. \n\nThe allergist said I did not react (in December) to the penicillin, but it was my body reacting to the infection. I am having a really hard time wrapping my head around it, because I also reacted to the second antibiotic (which when I told him my symptoms he said, \u201cthey are two different categories of antibiotics, you were reacting to the infection.\u201d) So, am I reacting to the infection or the antibiotics or both... or I will never know? \n\nThank you for the resources! I will check out the site and head on over to the other subs. I am also going to ask my primary care doctor for a referral to an immunologist who knows about MCAS. There is got to be a better explanation than what the allergist I saw last week gave me, and I would really like to know if it is more than dermographia.

Maybe look into it and give it a try Are not xolair shots stupid expensive? My allergist suggested it but said insurance was unlikely to cover it. Not yet.  Like you, antihistamines really help with my welts and itching, but the redness stays. I am sure they are but mine were mostly covered I believe I paid $100 a shot. Before starting the pills I am on now I was willing to pay anything to get some sort of relief from the itch. Fair point! Yes! Nickel and salicylates in my diet were causing the hives and most of the rashes. Salicylates and p-phenylenediamine related compounds in my cleanser, shampoo and conditioner were causing a lot of my facial redness. I switched to Allegra as well, which is better for reducing my reactions to environmental allergens than Zyrtec was. Thanks for responding! I have been thinking of swapping in Allegra to see how that goes. How did you discover such specific allergies?? Patch testing diagnosed the nickel and p-phenylenediamine allergies, which was done by a dermatologist. I would been seeing an allergist for years and for some reason it took him 20 years to suggest patch testing\u2026 yeah. The salicylate allergy was finally figured out after multiple rounds of anaphylaxis to both drugs and methyl salicylate, which is a minty wintergreen flavoring found in things like toothpaste, mouthwash, and root beer.", "Taking a break from antihistamines I have begun to take a break from taking antihistamines. I have been taking them every day for the last 4 years. If anyone here has taken a break from them before, have you experienced any issues either quitting them or going back on them later? I recently stopped taking Cetirizine as I found I was getting a rebound effect from it. I am still getting discontinuing effects from it, so I switched to Fexofenadine, as it helps the side effects while I get over the worst of it, but I am going to try cut back in while, at least long enough to get patch testing done. On a break too. 5 years on and so far 6 months off. They did not really do that much anyway. They completely got rid of my skin writing (I was on citrezine). I just want to see if I feel any different off of them... Aside from being itchier lol Recently stopped taking all allergy meds because I am having additional allergy testing next week. \n3 of the 4 allergy meds caused little to no issues. But the last one had some crazy withdrawal symptoms. So, just pay attention to your body and it will be okay! Most things leave you system after 2 weeks, so any bad side effects will not be forever. I stopped because I thought the AHs were negatively effecting my immune system. I was getting sick a lot more when taking them, and they work by suppressing immune responses. I am ill around 6-10 times a year (before covid). That will be something interesting to pay attention to \ud83e\udd14 That sounds like a lot. Think back, do you remember falling sick that often before taking them? I literally have not gotten sick since I stopped It is complicated but as I understand it antihistamines do not actually affect immunity. In our case our bodies are having an exaggerated response to an allergen and produce the excess histamine response, as far as I understand though, this response and excess inflammation is worse and makes us more prone to illness due to inflamed tissues and bacteria/viruses able to penetrate more easily? There may be a correlation also with the immune system playing up and antihistamines being used more in the same time period which makes it look like there is a correlation whereas the actual correlation might just be immune system getting out of whack because of allergen = more vulnerable to illness, if that makes any sense? lol sorry I could be talking crap but maybe someone else can chime in with a better explanation? It was something similar. I think it might just be a diet issue. Specifically a lack of protein is my latest hypothesis", "Botox?

Daily antihistamine can help flare ups and drink lots of water and stay hydrated. Sometimes it goes away randomly sometimes it stays forever it is a super random skin condition.

I am not aware of anything connecting dermatographia to constipation.   The antihistamines that I take for the dermatographia cause the constipation. The dermatographia itself does not cause the constipation.  Good to know; thank you.  Which antihistamine do you take which causes this? Antihistamines can make you a little dehydrated.

So I went to the doctors today to get this checked out and she was talking about histamine and prescribed Cetirizine but did not mention anything about dermatographia. Is there a line between the condition and just an allergy?  The rashes come when I scratch an itch and become inflamed and burn and itch, so I think it is dermatographia but idk The main difference is that dermographia is not a reaction to an outside allergen, it is an overactive histimine response that occurs despite what outside force triggered it. Technically, I think it is autoimmune.\n\nScratching the skin will usually result in very defined welts, and sometimes you get hives from ongoing pressure (e.g. where a necklace or glasses nosepiece is constantly resting). Many people find that there are triggers that make it worse (like extreme temps or stress). \n\nAn allergy test would do nothing for dermographia, in fact it would probably give confusing results because the pressure of needles might cause a flare up for all allergens, even though it would not be about the allergen at all. \n\nIn my experience, most doctors are not familiar with dermographia so yours might not even be aware that it exists. I spent 2 years being dismissed by doctors and told to eliminate allergens (different detergents, bedsheets, diet, etc) before going to a dermatologist who recognized it right away. \n\nYour pics look like dermographia to me, although it is not much to go on. If it is, Cetirizine is hopefully all you need! Thank you so much for your information! \nI tried changing so many things, like my detergent and my diet but nothing helped. Actually, some things I ate made it worse and as you mentioned, stress also made my flare ups worse, too. \n\nI will mention dermatographia to my doctor during my next visit.", "My exercise treatment for dermatographia urticaria, itchy skin, and painful hives  amen brotha. exercise really helps everything. along with dermatographia i have GI issues. Getting active makes me feel better physically and mentally about any symptoms that im having. But check this, so for GI issues i started taking probiotics (dr. oshiddas professional formula) they have worked wonders. Somehow my dermatographia has not been as bad as well ive noticed. i feel my stomach is linked to my skin issues and what i consume is a huge cause of symptoms. Our food nowadays is full of shit, being cognizant of what we consume helps for sure. i havent had to take daily 40 mg of zyrtec since ive started the probiotics.

It came on suddenly after several very stressful situations (sick family members, and an unrelated move across the country to name a few).  Took me forever to figure out that the scratch came first and CAUSED the itch, not the other way around.  2 minutes of googling later and I finally knew what had been plaguing me.  I visited the doctor and received a formal diagnosis.  I was sent to an allergist who agreed with the diagnosis but said there was not much I could do beyond anti histamines.  I took Zyrtec every third day and, while the itching was mostly under control, I would still have red marks and welts popping up all over my body.  18 months after it began, it went away.  At first I noticed that my skin felt \u201cdifferent.\u201d  I am not sure how to describe it...oily, maybe?  That is resolved, too.  I will occasionally get itchy skin, like the other day when I carried heavy cardboard boxes that dug into my arms, but it is nowhere near what it once was.

Used to be horrible welts that were terrible to live with, but I do not always get raised welts unless I go off of antihistamines for multiple days or I am super stressed.

Hey guys, so for the past few weeks I have noticed that if I scratch myself even the slightest bit, it just gets more and more itchy. Not only that, it leaves red/white raised marks on my skin. After reading a bunch of the posts here as well as articles by Mayo Clinic, Health Line, etc., I think I might have dermatographia. However, I have been using the same soaps for months and have not been any more stressed out than I usually am. I do not think my family has any history of skin condition, either. Is there anything else that could be causing it? For me it was due to adhd meds. I now doubt between skinwriting and SJS. I am going through the same thing, I have no idea ://  That Is fhe question of the last 3 months for me.\n\nI have always had sensitive skin. And reactive skin (allergic to cheap metals in jewelry, sensitive if poked would instantly turn red) but i assumed sort of like eczema. Sensitive etc \n\n\nThen, I had a lump in my breast. Turns out it is an infection, no big deal. Take 2 super powerful antibiotics that were prescribed to me for 10 days. After 10 days my face chest and shoulder had the worst acne I have ever had my whole life. Embarrassing, so bad. Bright red bumps, white heads the works. \n\nGet my skin cleared up over 2 weeks or so and BAM now I have this. \n\nSo, I read on this sub last week to up my gut health, that maybe the antibiotics flushed out my good bacteria. Someone else had mentioned it. So that is what I have been doing for a week. So far, no change. But its atleast a pinpoint in time for when this started for me. After those crazy strong antibiotics. Really? That is a new one Just sharing my experience. Have you taken antibiotics recently? It seems around 75 percent of people w this condition think it is antibiotic caused. There is definitely something related to gut health and dermatographia. Also, likely something involving a disorder of mast cells. Perhaps try taking probiotics. I wish there was more research on it. I think certain flora cause inflammation and certain flora reduce it. Flora is also heavily involved in histamine production and control. So, if we can figure that out.... Yep, I have a feeling mine started after taking a triple round antibiotic for scarlet fever back in middle school. That condition is a skin rash too, and I have heard some sort of strep and skin condition connection I was going to get tested but corona happened. I do not ordinarily have dermatographia, but  I do when taking antibiotics.  They give me hives at different times throughout the day. I have had dermatographia for 4 years now and I still have no idea what caused it. You should probably dig into in while it is still new before you forget about what might have caused it. No, I have not taken any. I honestly do not think I have done anything in the past few weeks that was any different compared to the rest of the year. I am thinking it might have something to do with my razor because last time I shaved, I was in a rush so I did it super quickly (ps, i know what i am seeing is not razor bumps). I have been putting on a lot of lotion and that seems to be helping, though. I do not think it is the kind of condition that can be caused by a bad shaving job. It is a whole-body auto-immune response. \n\nMine appeared seemingly out of nowhere too, but it was during my sophomore year of college, fall midterms. For me, stress levels combined with my age just seemed to set it off. Now I see it worst when I am really stressed and subjected to heat. I always flare up during the summer months, especially my scalp with heat trapped under my dark hair.\n\nEdit: covid has been stressful enough for all of us, perhaps it was just the ongoing stressors that triggered yours?

The usual, red marks from bedsheets, red marks appearing in response to any sort of pressure or scratching to the point where I can write etc. I think my immune system perhaps just got overloaded and freaked out a little bit? I am not sure. I do not know if this is permanent or if it will go away in a few weeks or months. It is been about three weeks now. Same! Exactly my story. Still have it after \\~6 weeks. Immunologist on Tuesday. MD just prescribed prednisone and said \"it may work\". I take 1 Zyrtec every other day. After that I need to take another.  There are others on this forum and other forums that report it as well so you are certainly NOT alone! Thank you. This is honestly miserable. Did you happen to have a weird reaction immediately? I am not sure if it was only a panic attack, but immediately after the third dose I felt cold, light-headed, panicky, for a brief few minutes while the first two I hardly even noticed. I had my usual reaction of flu-like symptoms, then a week later BAM!  I will say over-time it seems to very gradually fade, I expect this could take a looooooong time but I do believe it will clear up (right in time for my 4th shot-lol!). I think I will switch to Pfizer :-) I will likely switch to Pfizer as well down the road. Moderna clearly offers better protection, but, at what cost? Lol. I am pretty sure it is not from an *allergy* since I have not shown any reactions to polyethylene glycol in other medications or from vaping. For me, symptoms first emerged 13 days after I got my booster How are you doing? Been taking 2 Zyrtec every morning and the itching is pretty much all gone. I will still get red patches and lines here and there if I scratch or rub against something hard enough. Now that the itching is gone it has not affected my day to day life really at all Did you see an immunologist or do steroids at all? I only saw a general practitioner. I was already taking budesonide steroids for something separate, so that could have had an effect. Started 3 days after my first shot :/ this was back April Mine started after getting my third moderna!!! I got a moderna booster and ~9 days later developed urticaria. These have settle down now, thankfully, but am stuck with dermatographism! I do not mind looking a little pink as long as the hives are gone but still annoying. I am a physician and have a new-found empathy for patients suffering from hives... My story is that I got my second shot end of May. A week later, I caught the common cold so I took pseudoephedrine for it. I started itching like crazy so not sure if the vaccine or the drug did it. I did get prescribed prednisone, but that did nothing. But now it is pretty much gone 4 months later. Really do not want to get a 3rd booster if it is going to flare up again. I got mine right after a heft dose of antibiotics a year and 3 months ago. \n\nIt is has never went away. The itching is insane. I love with benadryl everywhere and lidocaine anti itch sprays. Really sucks i got dermatographia after getting my HPV vaccine I have it now, and I am so grateful that you all posted about it, because I felt like I was the only one. I got my Pfizer booster Wednesday evening, and the dermatographia/urticaria started on Saturday. I am moderately itchy, but even with short nails, I am raising bright red welts. I take Zyrtec anyways for seasonal allergies. I have had dermatographia occasionally before, but not for a long time. I had \u201cCovid arm\u201d 8 days after my first Moderna shot, aches and fatigue after both the second and third, and recently, 9 days after the third Moderna shot, I have also begun getting hives wherever there is pressure or rubbing/stretching of skin, as well as dermatographia. Last night my lower lip randomly swelled up so I freaked out and called the doc. I am now on a Zyrtec in the morning and 2 Benedryl before bed. Fingers crossed that this resolves after a couple weeks on the antihistamines. I have never had a single hive or allergic reaction in my first 40 years of life, and nothing new has been introduced lately, so I would be shocked if this turns out to be anything other than a reaction to the shot. Doc seemed doubtful, but not completely dismissive\u2026 Did it end up going away or symptoms gradually deteriorating/getting better? When I got the HPV vaccine in 2018, it gave me a minor case of allopecia (this does not even run in the family and I never had it before getting the vaccine). nope,still have dermatographia. symptoms have got a little better but it started in 2019 so idk This happened to me! 20 minutes after Moderna booster felt lightheaded, heart rate rapid, faint, panicky. Did not happen after first two shots. Now I have had hives since 10 days after.  Nothing seems to help. I am going crazy. I had the exact same reaction. Felt like I was going to faint even though the first two were fine. Felt like my blood pressure shot down to the ground and my body was ice cold for 5-10 min. It is been a couple of months and the dermatographia has not gone away but Zyrtec seems to control it fairly well along with colloidal oatmeal eczema lotion When I saw this reply I actually was like, why did it notify me of my own comment? because it was basically the same thing that happened verbatim I am in the same boat. My GP acted like I was crazy. But I had hives and was given a steroid shot and it flared. Redness and itching ever since. If I take Zyrtec daily I am fine but if I skip a day I get so itchy on my chest/neck/palms. And my skin reddens anytime I touch anything too hard. It is annoying. \n\nGot my last dose in April and now I am worried my booster will make it worse. \ud83d\ude1e I got really sick from the 2nd moderna shot like have an extreme flu for about 20 hours. I am hearing most ppl have the same problem with the 3rd shot. I am currently on day 7 of dealing with this and I got the Moderna booster November 1. On the night of November 13th just as I was falling asleep I got a full body itch and hives. It is not been nearly as bad as the first night and on day 3 I decided to take my allergy med of choice which is Allegra (fexofenadine). I have been taking 1 a day and that seems to curb all itching for about 24hrs even though it is labeled effective period is 12hrs. Yesterday was the first day that I got a few wheals and itchy spots before the 12hr period ended. I do have a scheduled appt with an allergist in about 3 weeks so I am interested to see what they think but after reading so many first hand accounts and finding a case study about this I am pretty convinced it is been triggered by a delayed immune response to either the Moderna shot or my flu vaccine, both of which I received on the same day. The person who set up my appointment advised me to stop taking my antihistamine at least 72hrs before my appointment. I just went about 32hrs between doses to see how long I could endure and what would happen but I succumbed to the itch.

For extra info, this is the reaction after about 6 seconds from running nails lightly across arm. I have been having this reaction for a few months now and only just discovered Dermatographia. I would say so, It looks similar to mine. Running your nail like that makes the nail bounce/skip causing the individual bumps to form along the line of contact. Thanks so much for your reply. It was not quite looking the same as other images but it seemed to fit what was happening. I also suffer from polymorphic light eruption (sunlight sensitivity/allergy). The prospect of a second condition making me crazy itchy has me dreading the up coming Australian summer. Back to the dermatologist I guess Yup. If that is just from scratching yourself with your nail it is dermatographia. I am sorry you have found yourself joining our itchy ranks. Thank you for your reply. Since finding myself here and reading a few posts I started taking a telfast daily which thankfully seems to be helping quite a bit. I am very relieved to get some relief from the itch when nothing else was working", "Is it dermatographia if I am itchier than before? Does having dermatographia make you itchier than when you did not have it?

But scratching does make me way itchier than before I scratched m I have had it all my life though Yes definitely, I am itchy all the time but Zyrtec helps", "Moderna booster and antihistamines Like many people new to this subreddit, I developed urticaria and dermatographia (on 11/27) after my booster dose (on 11/16). I recently increased my meds to 2 zyrtec + 1 Pepcid, AM and then again at PM - so a total of 4 Zyrtec and 2 Pepcid a day. It was working extremely well for a couple of days, but now seems to be getting less effective - the itchiness has gotten progressively worse and now feels similar to how it did when the condition started. Does anyone have insights regarding this? Specifically, I am wondering if I should continue the same dosage for another 3-4 weeks, start weaning off now, or quit all meds cold turkey. I am not interested in starting steroids. Any other insights would be very much appreciated as well. Thank you!!", "Does it get better? I have been experiencing this for about a month. Did you go to general practitioner or dermatologist for help?  Is this from scratching? Seeing a immunologist might be better. Take some antihistamines for now Mine looked like this when I first got it. It got better with time, Zyrtec, and a season change. I would highly recommend a dermatologist, my GP had never heard of dermographia before. This looks like a rough case, good luck! Mine was like this in the early days when I had no idea what was going on. After I realized scratching makes it worse I unconsciously began resisting the urge to scratch. It is a process. A dermatologist would probably prescribe Zyrtec, always keep some handy. I take Zyrtec twice a day and it keeps it in check unless I forget to take it. Does it hurt? My husband\u2019s back looks like that any time he scratches an itch but it does not hurt. It is just a convenient way for me to draw a dick onto his shoulder when we go swimming. I can say that if you ignore scratching as much as you can each time you feel it coming, that will lower it is power for the urge to take action. I noticed this has its effect on me. Ice packs control the itch and the reaction. I do not know, maybe. I have tried only ignoring and it works. Maybe another factor might be because of the seasons changing. Ignoring does not work when you whatever you are sitting in or wearing is what is scratching your skin because you still get the dermal reaction. That is when ice works. Well, in my experience it works that way also. You likely got this from the covid vaccine.. both my wife and I got it on our second dose And when you forget\u2026 you know Is this a thing? Got my third shot and 10 days later the itching started, no reaction from the other 2 doses. I have only ever seen pictures of dermatographia so imagine my surprise when I drew a perfect heart on my thigh with a fingernail! Did you and your wife\u2019s symptoms resolve or stick around?", "Jewelry Triggers My skin hates any kind of jewelry. If I wear an earring the lower half of my ear turns red.  Anything around my neck causes splotches of red all over. Watches and rings are not as bad but still cause problems. \n\nAnyone else have this problem? Yes. I am allergic to nickel, which is present in many alloys including sterling silver and stainless steel, and I am extremely allergic to gold. I also suspect that I am allergic to platinum, because I had a platinum ring and I reacted to that more than I do even to gold.\n\nToo much nickel in my diet is actually my biggest dermatographia trigger. My daughter had to give up on pierced earrings because she always reacts to them. She can wear rings and necklaces as long as they are not too tight or, for necklaces, scratchy. She wears magnetic earrings and takes them off when they start to hurt. We stick to stainless steel or sterling silver jewelry. Never thought about metal allergies. Thanks for that info! If allergies are the cause, try titanium jewelry. That is what most professional piercers use, and it literally cannot cause allergies, or in very rare cases, at least I have never heard about allergic reactions to titanium Good idea! Also try the \u201ccomfort back\u201d earrings. Instead of having a post that pokes out, they have ball or rounded screw on fasteners. I found the posts irritated me by constantly rubbing my neck. I got some stainless earrings about 6 weeks ago and have not taken them out yet. I am glad I found them! Thanks,  Going To check those out! I get splotches of red all over my neck all day anyway, let alone when I wear jewelry that is not sterling silver.", "Dermatographia and antibiotics I (26F) recently and currently am having episodes of dermatographia which was at its absolute worst a few days ago and is now getting much better. I had it 24hrs a day to now only a few hours, mostly at night.\n\nIt was the worst feeling, burning stinging itch followed by mosquito-like welts from scratching. I noticed on my skin it would start off as a warm red patch varying in size with a little tiny hive and if I scratched it, I would get the dermatographia scratch mark pattens. I mostly got it on my legs, arms, and back but it moved to my hands/fingers and feet/toes. It would appear and disappear in random places throughout my body. The only things that made it feel better were hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl.\n\nI also have eczema. When looking up ways to improve my eczema I looked into a lot of articles suggesting that eczema may be a symptom of gut inflammation. This was interesting as there is a lot of speculation on gut micro flora and our overall physical health, immune system, and even our psychological health. While I was desperately trying to figure out where the dermatographia came from, I noticed many people suggesting that it began after finishing antibiotics. I recently had 3 UTIs in a span of 2 months after giving birth to my son. In this short amount of time, I took a lot of antibiotics and after my third round I immediately began having dermatographia! \n\nAfter reading a lot of anecdotes and medical websites on the prognoses, I was worried that I was going to have to suck it up for the long haul. Somehow it is slowly improving without having to do anything, such as diet change or anything dramatic. My theory is my gut bacteria is steadily returning to normal. I was going to try probiotics, raw fruits/veggies, and eating fermented foods to restore gut bacteria and see if it will get rid of the rash. This was just a thought on the possible correlation, I think gut health is still misunderstood, but it is an interesting start. I have also seen other people try a diet change to improve symptoms. Anyone got any good outcomes? I will try to update to see if it keeps getting better. My symptoms started after taking antibiotics with corticosteroids. Now it has been one year since Im having dermatographia. I believe, my derm. Is caused by antiboitics... I too think my dermatographia was caused by an antibiotic but I also have hypothyroidism so I am not completely sure. I tried getting my gut bacteria in check too by only eating fruits, veggies and meats for two months. Unfortunately it didnt work out for me and I still have it, but it could for you! Definitely worth giving it a try, and bonus you will become much healthier and feel great :) Mine is also triggered by stress and thinking about it. Thanks for the support. :) My dermatographia started after 2 courses of strong antibiotics to get rid of H Pylori. An endoscopy said I was clear of the pylori but I had to constantly eat to neutralize the acid in my stomach. \n\nWhen I started my antihistamine treatment for the itching my stomach issues started to disappear. No more bloating or acid. The doctor cannot explain it. So I got a UTI in Feb this year took antibiotics, and then again it happened in March and I took antibiotics again. I then suddenly developed it a couple of weeks after the antibiotic treatment ended and now i am taking antihistamine daily. Its only been a month but yeah this sucks, just glad that its not as bad as others. Mine slowly got better. I started eating more fermented food, but I did not do anything dramatic.  You can try probiotics and yogurt maybe. I do not have it anymore, it lasted 2 weeks and went away on its own somehow. I have had exactly same thing I went for surgery and was put a week antibiotics course mine started the day I am on antibiotics histamines waiting to see allergy clinic it really is unbearable I never made an update since not many people really replied to this post, but it went away a few days after I stopped taking my antibiotics. I had UTIs and several rounds of antibiotics again and sure enough the dermatographia returned. It also went away when I stopped talking antibiotics. I am almost certain there is a correlation, at least in my situation. Mine has been going on 7 weeks now started taking primrose out not much different as yet x", "Dermatographia and dry skin ", "Shaving Does anyone else with Dermatographia constantly shave legs, armpits, bikini area etc. I find that if I do not, the friction from clothes and hair cause itch and I end up scratching without realizing I am doing it and my entire legs, or area I did not shave are a giant welt of hives before I go to bed and then I scratch in my sleep and end up bleeding from scratching so much.  I have been dealing with dermatographia on and off for almost a decade now. And shaving every days is just not an option. Help! Hi, interesting thing you noticed. I never made that connection before but it seems plausible. So, I tend to avoid shaving my legs since it is just work and I am lazy and I do think I scratch them more when there is hair than when they have been shaved. I feel that may be the case due to the extra friction and stuff, also I believe hair growing in tend to make people in general itch so that probably does not help. I think it is very much so possible. I will have to pay more attention from now on, but I think you are onto something that may help with some itching I have. Thanks! I know what you mean. I actually have had two issues with shaving. First, if my facial hair gets too long (I am a man) then rubbing my face will irritate my skin because the hairs act like a tiny brush. Second, if I shave when I have not been good on my diet, it is such an incredibly painful experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI often shave my face in the shower because my skin is softer and it causes less irritation. My advice would that if you are having flare ups or a really bad day with your dermatographia, not to focus so much on shaving but on finding ways to improve your symptoms in general. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent years trying to find the right razors, shaving cream, etc. but in the end what worked best was eliminating inflammation causing foods from my diet, and finding time to shave when my skin was not so red and irritated. Hopefully that helps, and for what it is worth I know that pain all too well! I take Loratadine to stop feeling the reaction then when I shave I do not get the irritation afterwards I use shaving balm (I am a man) Om the total opposite and shaving really seems to cause a ton of issues and i cannot stop the huge ingrown hairs and boils. Any advice is appreciated! have you tried straight or safety razors? i bought a sefety razor a few months back, and not only it saves me a lot of money, i found that a single blade tool is way less irritating then a normal one. Some of the sprays and gels designed to reduce irritation like bikini zone, or skin therapy (through pure romance) helped reduce ingrown hairs and bumps for me. Also using really good razors and shave creams designed to minimize friction and irritation.", "Can I get a tattoo? ", "So relieved Honestly? I am just glad it turned out to be Dermatographia. Got the Moderna booster on either Dec 16 or 17, and ~10 days later I started noticing itchiness and some bumpiness. Since I was at a beach with mosquitoes and whatnot, so I chalked it up to bug bites and the itchy AirBnB sheets irritating my skin.\n\nFlash-forward to a few hours ago, and I suddenly noticed a massive scratch-mark looking rash I would created all along the side of my body! Some very panicked googling led me here.\n\nI was convinced for a second that I had bed bugs and needed to burn my whole mattress down! Now I can lather up in lotion and sleep peacefully :'))\n\n(Btw, any lotion recommendations? Not sure my current options will cut it for this Sahara desert.)", "My dermatographia went away for a while I have had dermatographia since late 2014. I was so worried before joining basic training in an academy that it will ruin my training and force me to bail out. I have snuck in some anti-histamines to prevent hives from breaking out. But after 5 days or so of continuous stress and sweating, I noticed that the symptoms were gone. I am thinking it is because the food we eat there that they were gone. We only eat rice and viand 3 times a day. It might also be due to the rigidness of the training.\n\nI noticed that it came back when I got back to civilian life. I am back to taking anti histamines every other day now.  I live in a country where we always eat rice(what you said). And mine did not went away, but maybe for you it is a better diet, tell me if you tried doing it again and if it would work again, maybe it is a good discovery for here. Also do not drink too much anti histamine, as I recall it may weaken your immune system(I also take it everyday before, but now I only take it when I really need it, but maybe talk to your doctor to make sure).", "It has to go away... right? It is actually so strange. No one knows the exact reason WHY it happens and there are no actual treatments. How does this disease even manifest to begin with. I am convinced there has to be a cure. It is just that no one is actually looking for one I feel like. I am only 16 but I have been dealing with it for a long time now. I play high contact sports too so it gets pretty overwhelming sometimes. \n\nSo I have started provoking my skin daily on different levels to try and get it used to damage and not overreact every time a little scratch or Inconvenience happens. I have been doing it for a year and it seems like it is been getting better but I guess that could just be placebo effect. I do not really know \n\nDoes anyone else have any other ideas? I eat healthy, I exercise daily, I do not vape, smoke drugs, I am not allergic to anything. Like It is actually pissing me off. I am hoping to go into boxing into the near future and the condition is literally going to make me look like I have giant scars by the end of the fight. Hey, maybe I will be the first pro boxer ever with this condition and I will go down with a cool name like \u201cScar\u201d or something lol. \n\nAnyways; here is to hoping for a treatment. \n- sorry if this seems really out of order and like a mind dump (it basically is). I am extremely stressed and worried about this stupid ass condition and just wanted to express it I guess. The only thing that I have heard from my doctor is that the condition is similar to hives, and so over the counter basic allergy medication can help diminish the effects like swelling and itchiness. Maybe try taking that before any kind of events you think might irritate it? yes, he is right. I take Zyrtec for it. It does not completely stop it, but without it, my skin is a red, bumpy, and painful mess. I first got it around 15-16 y/o, then it went away for about 10 years and then came back again. No rhyme or reason to it. When it first came back it was super bad, now it seems to have calmed down a bit again (I still get them but not as easily or often). I have always had it since I cannot remember. I cannot remember not having it. I always thought it was normal for my skin to swell after getting  scratch but then a year ago or so my friend said noticed my skin and said it was not normal. She said my skin looked like a caterpillar bite. So I first noticed my symptoms October 2016 and after a lot of run around and allergy tests and what not i just ended up doing Zyrtec year round instead of just for spring allergies. That was the only thing that helped.\n\n\nBuuut I missed a few days of zyrtec on a trip last month and realized I do not have symptoms! It seems like most of it has gone away but I still occasionally get a scratch and the hot skin that comes with it. It seems like it is for more intense contact.\n\nMy allergist did say that it can go away unexplained and on it is own just like it came.\n\nVery small light at the end of the tunnel for you.\n\n My tunnel has flames at the end of it because I am afraid of it coming back lol I first noticed it after I would been on antibiotics for a month. I have previously had various reactions to antibiotics that do not quite rise to the level of a specific allergy. It is more like my system gets sort of overwhelmed and I become more sensitive to things that do not usually bother me. I sometimes develop new allergies during one of these periods, which do not usually go away unfortunately. I am trying to get my doctor to give me steroids like she would for any other allergy to see if it will go away, but so far she is just prescribing me stronger antihistamines. Did it ever come back? Were you doing anything while on the Zyrtec like change diet or lotion? Thanks! It is not completely gone, just more manageable when I make sure I take these. \n\nWhen it first started I tried everything- changed my laundry detergent, my lotions and body washes and shampoos, not drinking alcohol/wine, went on a 2 week histamine free diet (biggest pain in the ass- I was weak from basically not eating and then depressed from being weak and itchy) got off of my antidepressant and birth control, nothing helped!\n\nI have heard it is different for everyone, this has just been my experience. \n\nThe dandelion is supposed to be a liver detox and I have read in a lot of places that dermatographia can come from antibiotic use that causes store up in the liver. \n\nOh one other thing - red wine was my biggest irritant! In case you drink. Oh okay thank you so much for the feedback! I too changed detergent and everything and still the same.. I have only gotten a bit better I believe to use of steriod pills and Zyrtec. I never was one for antibiotics or anything. But I was on depoprovera shot and I did just get my time of month for the first time in almost a year.. I May try depo shot again or birth control to see if it regulates me in some way. I have abused of my liver in my short time of being able to drink lol so I may have done damage that way but have not drank since this all happened. Thank you so much.", "Do you have any mental health issue along with your dermatographia? I am wondering if it is related\n\n(", "Things I have Learned from a PCP, Hematologist, Dermatologist, &amp; Allergist. I developed body-wide hives 10 days after my third dose of Moderna which evolved into Dermatographia by the end of the first week. It is now been 10 weeks with no improvement in the hives. After visiting a primary care physician, hematologist, dermatologist, and allergist, this is what I have learned. \n\n\u2022Dermatographia is often triggered by an overstimulation of the immune system. This usually occurs from fungal, bacterial, or viral infections. \n\n\u2022If you have a history of eczema, dermatitis, H. Pylori, penicillin use, or Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, you may have a higher likelihood of developing Dermatographism. \n\n\u2022It is most common in people in their 20s and 30s.\n\n\u2022Wheals form whenever mechanical trauma (rubbing, grazing, stoking, or pressure) is applied to skin. The wheals can take up to 5 minutes to appear and up to 30 minutes to disappear. \n\n\u2022Treatment includes second-generation H1 antihistamines (Zyrtec, Claritin, Allegra). Start with 1/day, but you can titrate up to 4/day if necessary. \n\n\u2022If second-generation antihistamines alone are not effective, pair 2 pills of a second generation H1 antihistamine (Zyrtec, Claritin, Allegra) with 2 pills of an H2 antihistamine (Pepcid). \n\n\u2022First generation H1 antihistamines (Benadryl) are not recommended due to their sedating effects. \n\n\u2022Studies have shown that Zyrtec seems to be the most effective second generation H1 antihistamine in terms of hive prevention and management.  \n\nWell, that is all I have learned thus far! I have had Dermatographia for 10 weeks now. My itching is under control, but I still get wheals from the simplest of things (clothing tag rubbing against my skin, drying my hands, changing my clothes, etc). One thing that has helped is keeping my fingernails cut short so that I do not unintentionally scratch myself, especially while sleeping. I wish you all the best in this crazy thing we have developed! My hope is that it will gradually go away with time.", "Symptoms match but only when my skin is wet? Hello! \n\nJust found this community and did not know this was a real thing. Just wanted to check in to see if anyone has the same circumstances as me.

Does this still qualify me for this diagnosis? Anybody else have a similar thing???", "i have a question when I barley press on my skin it takes a minute then it turns white in the area, I am able to draw stuff like this but after it goes away my skin gets itchy is this a form of dermatographia? I am only asking because from what I have researched everyone with it has a severe reaction and their skin raises but mine is not that severe and it is concerning me, is this something else and if so is it serious? &gt;when I barley press on my skin it takes a minute then it turns white in the area, I am able to draw stuff like this but after it goes away my skin gets itchy is this a form of dermatographia\n\nThis would sound like dermatographia although most seem to experience it where the skin gets redder and often will raise a little bit higher. I do not know what your skin type is so I do not want to presume as I am a white guy.\n\nThat redness after would then typically itch though yes.\n\nThe reaction as far as I know can be very different. I have only recently started having it badly enough to know it was even a thing shortly after finishing a course of antibiotics. Originally I would get a similar feeling from going for a walk in tight jeans or coming out of a mildly hot shower. You might just be experiencing a milder version of it. Sounds like it to me but you should go see a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment. Ah thanks Alright I will be sure to bring it up next time I go!", "Fluctuating or constant symptoms? So I have been recently diagnosed by my doctor, but I am still a bit confused as to what is normal in terms of severity??\n\nLike, waaay back in 2012 was when I first heard about it, pre diagnosis and pre symptoms (only got them in the past few years). I am not going to lie, I thought it was a wacky photoshop job and an internet medical troll...... oh how the tables have turned! But importantly, I was under the impression that symptoms were constant like, 24/7, nonstop.\n\nI get symptoms a lot, but they vary. On rare days I will not get any, then on some days I will get a couple marks from harder scratches/touches, and then some days a feather can make me look like I have been attacked. I have noticed it cycles when it is strongest and weakest very regularly (coughcough as if pms was not bad enough coughcough) but it is definitely not at the extreme worst 24/7.\n\nI feel like I have rambled but I am really curious, does anyone here get extreme marks/itchy terribleness 24/7? Or does it cycle out? I think it is fascinating that people's triggers can be different! Mine definitely varies. I was diagnosed, well really I diagnosed myself and had a dermatologist confirm, about 11 years ago. It started after gaining a ton of weight, about 40-50 pounds. At that time it was a daily battle, the slightest brush and I would break out. A slight scratch to relive it would further the breakout and eventually my whole body was covered. Benedryl was the only thing that provided any relief. When I started to lose weight, the severity went down with it. Then I lost all my weight about a year ago, and you would thing I never even had a skin issue. I would forgotten all about it. A few months ago we had to start heavily budgeting because I lost my job, so eating super healthy is no longer an option. Adding potatoes and other carbs back into my diet has caused a resurgence of symptoms. The longer I eat unhealthy and have any type of weight gain, the worse it gets. Days that I am able to eat mostly veggies and meat, I hardly notice anything.

I have never had any allergies or any skin conditions before. No food, drug, or skin allergies of any kind. Dermatographia onset 10 days post moderna booster. No allergies here!! Aside from occasional seasonal allergies. Mine was post 10 day round of antibiotics. exact same experience with penicillin as a child! i am allergic to it and had strep twice a year as a child and several times doctors accidentally prescribed it / amoxicillin to me. i have a distinct memory at about 6 of me rolling around on the carpet scratching my legs trying to get my moms attention.\nmy dermatographia is not serious but noticeable enough that an allergist confirmed it during a skin allergy panel i had. my flare ups are usually on my chest and legs. I developed pressure urticaria and dermatographia about 9 days after my booster, with no prior history of allergies. I did get \u201cCovid arm\u201d about 8 days after my first vaccine shot. My daughter\u2019s dermatographia, hives, flushing, etc all started after taking amoxicillin for strep at age 9.  Unfortunately, she also had underlying Lyme disease that it took a while to figure out  (she also had joint pain, swelling, and lots of other symptoms).  She also had neuropsychiatric symptoms and was later diagnosed with PANDAS.  After 4 years of treatment she went into remission but her dermatographia, etc has continued.  She was just diagnosed with MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome).  It causes allergy-like reactions and Dermatographia is one of the symptoms.\nThe only sign she had of anything before age 9 was reactive airway disease. Now she has reactions to lots of things -including the large bug bites- and she also has pretty bad asthma especially if it is not regulated by medication. thanks for the info! i have had a lot of respiratory problems over the years - i wonder if there is any connection There definitely could be.  Mast cells are located all over our bodies and can affect multiple systems when they go out of control. I am going to try to link a website that has a lot of great information.

I would not be surprised to be honest? We know jack shit about the immunological system. Plus it is exceedingly difficult to test for all the antigens you are exposed to just due to time alone. Most likely urticaria is caused by a virus, bacteria h.pylori, or an autoimmune reaction. None of these things have to cause any other symptoms. If you are an adult and you developed it out of the blue, it is probably one of the first two. There is a strong link between h.pylori and hives/dermatographia. Breath and blood tests are not that reliable for HP, the only true diagnostic is an upper endoscopy. If you are looking for the viral culprit- ask your doctor to check for cytomegalovirus and/or Epstein-barr. These do not cause noticeable symptoms in people who are not immunocompromised (maybe 2-3 weeks of fatigue or mild loss of appetite, mild fever when the virus is active at best, but nothing too noticeable), but it can still set off a histamine reaction. There is also an NIH study of people with urticaria and h.pylori, and after eradication/triple therapy for the bacteria, the chronic urticaria subsided in over 70% of the study participants. Thx for the reply. One question, if its caused by a virus, can i then take antibiotic to cure it? Well you cannot cure viruses with antibiotics -there are some antivirals for CMV, but they are usually intravenous and it is doubtful a dr would give them to you unless you are really sick (which is unlikely for most people unless you are immunocompromised) -if the dermatographia (CU) is caused by h.pylori -which is often asymptomatic in most people- then yes there is typically a triple treatment which consists of two different hard antibiotics and a ppi; in which case if this actually clears the bacteria then according to this study it would clear the CU in 7 out of 10 patients. Here is a link: ", "Is this it? - 1 year old with a mom who definitely has it  As it cleared, it reminded me of my face when I scratch. Anyone with Little\u2019s experience this?

I developed hives+rashes+dermatographia after my 2nd dose of Moderna back in May 2021. Like so many folks with booster reactions, my symptoms started 10 days post shot. I would never had hives or anything like that before so I was very concerned. An Urgent Care visit was useless, they just told me it could be a million things triggering it and to take Claritin daily until symptoms subsided. They also recommended a topical cortisone cream for the awful itch. \n\nThose first 7-10 days were terrible. My skin was so reactive - to touch, to clothing, and to lukewarm water. The hives would also flair up unprovoked and, interestingly, would come and go, cycling through different areas of my body equally like both feet, both thighs, both shoulders at the same time. Only through research did I happen upon dermatographia and concluded this must be what I have. Two weeks after the onset of these symptoms, thankfully I no longer had hives or rashes (I was taking 1 Claritin and 1 Pepcid daily), but the dermatographia remained. \n\nSix weeks later I finally got in to see a reputable allergist/immunologist. He confirmed the dermatographia and ran a bunch of bloodwork. Those test revealed early signs of hypothyroidism. (It is not uncommon for thyroid disease to present as dermatographia.) He feels the vaccine simply provided an immune stimulus. So potentially I have this underlying condition and the vaccine gave my immune system a big jolt. He recommended I take one Allegra/day and monitor my thyroid quarterly. Side notes: I prefer Allegra (or the generic fexofenadine) over Claritin because Claritin makes me cranky. I added Vit C to my daily routine too. \n\nThe last several months have been maintenance mode. I have experimented with skipping the Allegra for a day or two to see what happens. My skin is definitely more reactive without it. My TSH numbers are still in the normal range - so there is no 100% certainty that all this is due to thyroid issues. Of note for the ladies: My skin is more reactive during the first few days of my period. (I am 47 for context.) \n\nAs for the booster, well, I was very scared to get it. Afraid the hives and rashes would come back! My doc recommended I take two Allegra for three days before getting the booster and for 14 days after. I did so, and ended up with the Pfizer booster (that is what the pharmacy had on hand that day). It is been 19 days since I got the booster shot and I have had no adverse reactions. I definitely experienced heightened skin sensitivity with a few minor, unprovoked hives starting at day 8 post-booster, but that tapered off within 10-11 days. I believe the 2/day Allegra plan prevented a bigger reaction and I am back to my 1/day maintenance mode. \n\nLong story loooong, I am still dealing with dermatographia eight months later, but it is manageable. I cannot overtly scratch an itch or do a bunch of exfoliating without a distinct reaction, but most reactions I do get are milder and do not itch as much. I prefer not to be on Allegra long term so I\u2018ll remain diligent in addressing the root cause. I hope this info is helpful.", "The best backscratch I ever did have Developed dermatographia 2 weeks after Moderna booster (no hard feelings, Moderna).

THANK YOU GUYS, I just enjoyed a scritchin from my husband for the first time in almost 2 months.", "Medication Hi, I have had this quite severely all my life and I am turning to you guys for some help with medication. Loratadine and other antihistamines do not work a lot of the time so I am just asking for suggestions. Maybe some gel or something to relieve the flare-ups as it sometimes feels like my skin is burning, and when I am out of the house it is not very pleasant looking either. Loratidine does not work for a lot of people, so you might try one of the others like zyrtec. You might also need it twice a day instead of once a day. Montelukast can also be helpful.\n\nMy dermatographia is a symptom of MCAS. I take a lot of meds for it and still get hives and flushing fairly often, so I am not sure there is anything that can completely prevent it. thanks for the help Allegra works for me, Zyrtec kind of works and Claritin and Xyzal do nothing. Adding Famotidine has helped a bit. For me, dermatographia is a symptom of MCAS, and is worst when I am ingesting too much of my unavoidable allergens, nickel and salicylates. Personally Zyrtec was a godsend. However I am now in remission thanks to a diagnosed thyroid condition and thyroid medication. I also know that people have this due to other allergies such as Foods so I have to ask have you been tested for allergies, thyroid difficulties, and vitamin deficiencies? I am slowly figuring out that I might have a Mast Cell disorder of some sort. Still figuring it out. \n\nI have looked into the meds I might be out on, and man, some of the side effects do not seem worth it. \n\nIs there any harm that comes from just\u2026saying \u201cfuck it\u201d and letting your skin flush a few times a day? Like will it lead to scarring or something like that? You can end up with broken capillaries from constant flushing, but I am in my 40's and have been flushing all my life and my face is still ok.\n\nThe only med that really gives me side effects is xolair. It helps enough with my other symptoms that it is worth it. Yeah, I have actually ended up with a few broken capillaries already. Was wondering if that was related, good to know.\n\nWhat sort of side effects are you getting from Xolair, and what does it help with?\n\nThanks in advance, just trying to get as much testimonial as possible before jumping into anything...doctors are a bit steely when I ask these questions. I get fatigue and joint pain for two days after I get xolair. One time I woke up having an anaphylactic reaction the night after my injection. There were a couple other things that could have contributed to it. I have also had joint instability in my ankle a couple times from xolair. It will feel sprained and I have to use a cane until it improves, which has been after two days.\n\nBefore xolair, I was having airborne reactions that caused diarrhea almost every time I left the house. I was also having anaphylaxis after exercise or sex. I had more reactions that did not improve with benadryl and albuterol than I do now.\n\nMy daughter also takes xolair for MCAS. Her side effects are milder, mainly fatigue. She was not able to shower or brush her teeth without getting hives, and now she can. She still gets hives from drinking water, though.\n\nThe thing about MCAS is that the improvement from meds can be gradual and hard to notice. It is more about feeling less bad than it is about feeling better. Man, I am so sorry. That sounds horrible.\n\nThe severity of so many cases relative to mine is one reason why it is unclear as to whether it is mast cell that is actually driving my symptoms, which are basically just an abnormally high amount of food allergies, skin flushing, a bit of itchiness. Sometimes I get hives but they are rare, gastrointestinal symptoms are even more rare, and I have never had anaphylaxis. Basically the big thing is that I am becoming allergic to roughly one food per month. It is pretty alarming.\n\nTryptase and 24 hour urine tests so far have been negative, but my doctors still think it is mast cell related. Dunno. It is weird. I can deal with the symptoms, I just want to stop losing foods. no allergies although not sure about the other 2. will check it out. thanks! thanks for the suggestions Same. ratio wtf are these guys waffling about", "Play fighting with my cat, he carved \"41\" into my hand!

Sorry if this is a well known product I have been completely oblivious to my whole life! That looks amazing!! Unfortunately I also have ( Oh I had not thought of this. Are you affected by both heat and cold? Not heat, except for hot showers make my legs and feet itch. I am buying this immediately. A heavy gust of wind makes my skin react lol this looks awesome! This looks like a godsend!! Heat is my worst trigger. It is really satisfying, and I think better than an ice pack which is too cold sitting in one position for any length of time.", "Has anyone else with Dermatographia ever had ringworm at the same time? My husband and I adopted a kitten who we later found out had ringworm from the shelter.... \n\nMy question is, how do you know whether an itch is ringworm or derma? \nEither way I am not scratching but it is making me anxious thinking I will be riddled with ringworm in a week or two after I have felt an itch.  So now I am noticing EVERY itch which, considering I have had derma for 14 years, I am assuming I was largely desensitised to the constant itching before, but now I am noticing EVERY itch because I am thinking it is ringworm and it feels like it did when I was 11 and would curl up and cry because antihistamines would not work! \n\nAny advice? Ringworm should be visible, usually a red dot with a red ring around it. Google will provide many pictures. \n\nI had it once and thought it was some kind of bug bite until having a doctor look at it after 2 weeks. He told me to get some OTC athletes foot cream, and that cleared it up. Yes. I got it from the gym a couple of years ago and it was awful trying to get rid of it. Even prescription meds did not work. Finally took care of it with a massive dose of tea tree oil. I suggest using a natural tea tree oil body wash when showering. Tea tree oil is known for its anti-fungal properties and will make it difficult to for the fungus to take hold. Keep it covered under a bandage with antifungal cream and it should go away. Reapply 2x a day. \n\n Same thing happened to me when we adopted 2 of our kitties. I had 2 ringworms  and they went away after a week with the band-aid and cream. Thank you!", "Benadryl I have been using benadryl more as a sleeping aid rather then allergy medicine. \n\nI would take up to 20 a night at times.

Every time I take off my clothes or put on new clothes my back itches for at least 15 minutes and lotion and creams do not help.  yup it is def the worst on my back:// solidarity top of my feet when i take my work boots off. sometimes i scratch till it bleeds a bit. Take antihistamines every day (morning and night). my back is starting to itch now just looking at this haha the back\u2019s a bitch, especially with the straps. Yes! My back itches the worst when changing tops (most especially if trying on brand new clothes) but my legs come in a close second when i change pants, especially skinny jeans! I am guessing it is the friction of the fabrics against our sensitive skin that trigger the reaction? Is it okay to do that? I thought we were only supposed to take them once every 24 hours. I feel like the Zyrtec has not been as effective recently for me \ud83d\ude29 I take a Zyrtec every 12 hours. Yeah, the doctor told me the max they would want me to take was 2x 180mg of their antihistamine which is the equivalent of 32 a day!!! yep, exactly the same for me! that makes sense, it is just so irritating lol Yes. When I change my clothes, every single time.  \n\nBuy benadryl anti itch continuous spray. It works so well and has lidocaine, so it numbs your itching zine in 30 seconds I actually have a solution for this one, since I too have lots of back itches especially at night. What I do is a simple exercise that goes like this - stand with your arms at your sides. Lift just your shoulders and rotate them forward. Then reverse the movement, rotating your shoulders backward. And then after, stand with your arms behind your back. Clasp your hands together. Press down until you feel a stretch in your back. I do not know if it may help you, but it does help me.", "Does anyone else have issues wearing jewelry? I have always been sensitive to metals, so I have only ever worn 14k gold, Sterling silver, and surgical stainless. I developed dermographia over 10 years ago, possibly due to an antibiotic (not sure). In the past 5 years I have found that I cannot wear any kind of jewelry, not even the ones I used to. \n\nNecklaces make sense, because the band sitting on the back of my neck would create welts from the constant pressure. But the earrings are the ones that I do not understand. It does not matter what I wear, give it a half an hour and my ears are red and painful, and they will stay that way even after I have taken the earrings out. \n\nI know it sounds much more like an allergy issue than dermagraphia, which is why I am curious if anyone else has ever had this.

Noticed it a couple of years back. So used to it now that it does not even bother me anymore Mine is always worse when it is hot. But the hot showers that I take in winter do cause problems. \n\nOh! One exception. Fall/winter spices make my dermatographia much worse. I am allergic and avoid them as much as possible but sometimes slip up. It is truly bizarre the things that they add cloves, nutmeg and turmeric to.) Yeah that is kind of how I am too. Except for sometimes it gets worse. Yeah I have noticed that hot water does not do good things for my Dermatographia either. It can get really problematic too because I love hot showers and after I take them I get itchy. Benadryl does not seem to work for me. \n\nHuh that is interesting. I think that would be really hard to avoid fall/winter spices. Does that mean Pumpkin Spice drinks are out for you? Yes, cloves, nutmeg, mace, allspice and ginger are totally out. \u2639\ufe0f A tiny bit of cinnamon seems to be okay. That is all I use when I make a pie. That stinks :( \n\nHave you been able to find other spices you love? No, I just use really tasty salt and the herbs I can tolerate. It is what it is. Yes, usually because my skin gets more dry from the weather. Lots of baby oil and lotion helps. Yeah I have definitely noticed that correlation of dry skin and worse itching too. \n\nI have used baby oil before for my hands. They used to get really dry so I would put some on at night and then put socks on my hands and it would really help. \n\nDo you use baby oil in a different way? I actually think the body naturally increases inflammation in the winter. That could be why I use it on my entire body (except face) right before I get out of the shower and give it a few minutes to soak into my skin before I towel dry myself. Huh. I am going to try that.

I have my first appointment with an allergist on Monday. The appointment scheduler told me to stop all medication (AKA my Zyrtec and Pepcid I have been taking daily to avoid being miserable) 5 days prior to the appointment. I have never been to an allergist before \u2014 is this normal? While I understand why this is needed, this is a big ask because my symptoms are borderline unbearable without meds. I was hoping something like two days would be sufficient \ud83d\ude06\n\nI am also sort of struggling to find the point of visiting an allergist, seeing as the most common treatment are over the counter meds. What does a typical initial appt look like with an allergist?\n\nAnyway, I would love any insight! Thanks! That is what they tell all new patients. Call back and ask if they are going to be doing skin tests. If not, ask if you still need to stop meds. Thank you for your response! I called and talked to the nurse. She said doing a skin allergy test is unlikely and to just keep taking my meds. Yay!\u2026. I guess. \ud83d\ude05 It is good, dermatographia gives false positives on skin tests because our skin does not like being poked. The first time I saw an allergist, I stopped meds like they said, had a terrible migraine, could not sleep because of the itching, then when I went to my appointment, I reacted to the saline control and they could not even do the test.\n\nThe allergist I see now never did skin tests on me, just ordered blood tests. I told her office I was not comfortable stopping meds for an appointment, and they said that was ok.

Hi,  \n\n\nI just wanted to hop in here and possibly save a life! If you have dermatopgraphia and are taking bupropion/wellbutrin, that is probably the cause! I am posting this to help you, as I wish someone did for me!   \n\n\nWith this medication, its a delayed reaction. For me, the medication (an antidepressant) was working great, 6 weeks in.. I got Dermatographia. I had no idea what was causing it, but I assumed it was covid. I got my symptoms when I was covid positive.   \n\n\nI went to a dermatologist who prescribed me steroids and antihistamines (he never put 2 + 2 together, that it could be my meds) and I also called my psych freaking out, who did not mention it could be my meds.   \n\n\nAnyways, after a ton of research - I am almost positive it was the welbutrin. Today is day  1 without taking it ( I have been tapering off, with DRs orders) and I am excited / hopeful this Dermatographia will get better  \n\n\nI will come back and update you all if the hives go away... and if you have this skin disorder all of a sudden, I encourage you to continue to eliminate things from you life to see what is causing it (carefully of course)   \n\n\nIf anyone else got this from this medication, LMK in the comments !! Interesting. I have been on Wellbutrin for years and years but just now got dermatographia about 6 weeks ago. I am thinking my trigger was something else, but regardless, thanks for posting! hm interesting!! yeah, its definitely something to look into. I am sad, that it happened as I really enjoyed the way welbutrin made me feel. It is common for the onset to be delayed, I would def talk to your dr about it. I want more people to be aware, since it was very hard for me to pinpoint with the delayed onset MCAS runs in my family, but my oldest has mild symptoms, not really enough for a diagnosis. When she was on wellbutrin, she started having allergic reactions to food, when she would never had that happen before. She stopped the wellbutrin and quit reacting to those foods. So I am not surprised that it would also cause or aggravate dermatographia. Uuhh so I was prescribed this and am supposed to be taking it, but the glorious American insurance does not cover and I would have to pay the full $80 per bottle so I skipped out. (Poor gang, amirite?) I know you are your own person and it is unlikely for anyone else to have the exact same reaction, but I wonder if it would have made things worse for me Wellbutrin did the exact same thing to me. Covered me in hives all over my legs after 6 successful weeks on it. Do you have any more info or resources regarding why and how this reaction develops with us? Thanks OP! Did the hives go away?", "where/when do you all get flare ups? with the temp dropping and flare ups happening several times a day/night for me now, I am curious if there is any common areas/triggers people tend to break out. sorry if there is already been a post like this!\n\nfor me, 80% of the time it is on my back (anywhere from my shoulder blades to lower back). I also frequently get it on my chest &amp; waist area, but weirdly never on my arms and legs\n\nmy triggers: drops/changes in temperature, exercising, alcohol, trying to fall asleep Weirdly I have discovered what I think is a possible correlation between being hydrated and less redness/hives. I have noticed on the days that I have been drinking a lot of water I have noticed less marks on my skin, especially from light scratches. This is based on nothing so do not treat it as fact but see if it does anything for you! Interesting, my main trigger is hot weather. And stress. \n\nI can get flare-ups anywhere, but I think they are most common on my back and my forearms. Although my neck/chest area can get bad too. Exercising, especially hiking, shaving my legs, high stress, and anything else heat related. I have gone on hikes that have taken me an hour to get to a summit, and ran down in 10 minutes because I was covered in hives and panicked (this was before my diagnosis). I used to get blood blisters where I scratched. It is usually my legs, mostly my thighs, but there are random times it has been on my arms. I usually get itchy on my back and shoulders at night while laying in bed! I do often get it on my legs and arms, but a little less frequently than my back. i am not sure exactly what my triggers are but i was diagnosed with it less than a year ago, so i will probably figure it out eventually. today though, i drank some coffee which is very unusual for me because it usually gives me anxiety and a stomachache, but i needed that extra boost this morning to stay up a few more hours (rotating my sleep schedule); here i am hours later after sleeping and my arm is ITCHY (way itchier than normal), so maybe caffeine could be a trigger for me. It going to make a post asking about caffeine as a trigger for people to see if anyone else is sensitive to it or if maybe it is just coincidence. oh interesting! nah I drink like a fish haha sadly it happens regardless yuppp why is it always the hardest to reach places when I am tryna sleep lol\n\nand that is interesting, I have caffeine a few days a week but I never notice a difference. but my other triggers (alcohol, exercise, cold weather) seem to be related to changes in blood flow/ heart rate? so caffeine could make sense Hahahaha my hypothesis ruined!!!

What do you think the chances of the allergy going away are and has it gone away for you? Ive had dermatographia for almost 2 years now. Its completely random when it starts and stops so no one can know when that will happen to you. But typically it will last for several years before spontaneously stopping. But it can also spontaneously start again also. Less than 6 years for me. I have been on antihistamines for 4 years up untill 2 months ago. My dermatographia still has not returned. Although it was extremely annoying I do miss it a little Zero chance of it going away if it morphs into CM, a mast cell thing, because it will keep coming back. What is CM? 14 years and counting\u2026 ( Uhhh did not go away for me, did not get worse. I alternate between certirizine and loratidine throughout the year since your body can become accustomed to one drug it is best to cycle. You can try to take quercitin and see if that is beneficial to you since it is a natural mast cell stabilizer. Keep your skin moisturized. I would see an allergist if you have not yet (or in many years) Do you have any idea why it started and ended? No idea, I am afraid. Having sort of browsed this sub Reddit it might be something to do with your thyroid maybe I saw ppl saying if you get better gut health it will stop. Which I guess makes sense since bad gut causes inflammation. If it was that simple hardly anyone would have it. The solution would be widely known. Years ago when I went to the doctor, all she said was basically it happens and maybe anti histamines will help. I would guess it probably varies from person to person. I seriously doubt it is something as simple as a better diet. It might also be an underlying condition that presents it is self as dermatographia. My advice is, do some research, consult a doctor and try and stay healthy or get healthier. Medical knowledge is nowhere near complete yet lol and that is by far the best thing we have to work of off. P.S. not all professionals even know what they are talking about sometimes", "Has anyone had any experience using the medication Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) as a treatment for more severe dermatographia? Hi all, \n\nI have not seen this mentioned previously here and I am curious to know if anyone has tried it because I was recently prescribed it by my allergist. \n\nBackground: I have severe dermatographia and have not consistently responded to any form of standard treatment. I have tried a singular H2 antihistamine (Zyrtec), a combination of two H2 antihistamines (Zyrtec and Allegra), and a combination of H1 and H2 antihistamines (Pepcid and Xyzal respectively) which for all I took double the standard dose. Highly recommend the last one because it has been the most effective treatment I have tried (brands are not exclusive, they could easily be swapped with any in the same class). Please note though, I am not a doctor or any type of medical professional, just an economics major who has spent a lot of time reading studies about the condition. \n\nAfter doing all of this and still having unpleasant symptoms, I met with an allergist. She confirmed that what I tried is exactly what she would have originally had me do and then presented the two options I have beyond that, Plaquenil and Zolair. The latter has been previously mentioned here. For those who do not know, it is a monthly shot that can be really expensive if insurance does not cover it. Being a broke college student, Plaquenil was the ideal option because it is a twice daily medication that does not cost me much at all.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I have tried a lot of treatments and have recently started Plaquenil, but have not met anyone who has taken it before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Also, final note: I am 100% not saying that antihistamines do not work, they have helped me tremendously. I still take them now (the final H1 + H2 combo) and will continue to do so until the new med has time to build up. Antihistamines + some lifestyle changes have made the symptoms much more bearable)\n\nIf you have made it this far, thanks! My mom takes it for arthritis, it does not help with her skin rashes and flushing. She still has to take montelukast and hydroxyzine for the rashes. She pays more for plaquenil than I pay for xolair.\n\nI have MCAS and dermatographia is one of my symptoms but definitely not the worst one. My daughter has MCAS too and we are both on xolair. We have got insurance. The copay for xolair was going to be $260 each per month, plus the copay for getting the injection. Xolair has copay assistance and injection copay assistance that lowered it to $10/month for each of us. Xolair also has a charitable foundation that helps uninsured folks get their xolair. My allergist said cost should not be a consideration when deciding to start xolair, because their programs make it affordable for just about everyone.\n\nSo I have been on xolair two years. I still get dermatographia symptoms and delayed pressure urticaria. What is changed for me is that I am not having airborne reactions every time I go outside. My skin reactions clear up more quickly. It used to be that I would have hives from my bra band for at least 24 hours, now they clear up in about 6 hours. I still get flushing and hives on my face, but there is less swelling and the flushing does not last as long. My daughter was getting hives from showering, and now she is not. Her MCAS is not as severe as mine, so it is not surprising xolair helps her more.\n\nFor me the downside to xolair is that I feel horrible for two days after getting the injection. I get fatigue and bone pain. Sometimes I have to walk with a cane.  Sometimes I have to sleep for two days. I have had a mild reaction to it at the doctor's office and a more severe one at home. Thank you so much for all of the information! I really appreciate it. \n\nI 100% relate to your symptoms, bra bands are a struggle. I have not noticed any changes with the medication (it is only been a few weeks though and my allergist said it would be 1-3 months or longer until the effects are apparent if it works). How long did it take for Xolair to help your symptoms? Like was it within the first few days after the first shot or was it after the following ones? \n\nMy allergist's biggest concern with the cost of Xolair was insurance accepting it as a treatment for dermatographia specifically since it is newer. I do not usually have super large copays on standard medications (Plaquenil only costs me \\~$12), but newer ones tend to run higher. I will have to look into the assistance program though, like that is great that it lowered your cost by so much, it makes me a lot less hesitant about looking more into it. Thank you so much again, definitely plan on mentioning Xolair in my next appointment. It took a year for me to really notice xolair was working. MCAS affects me in so many different ways that it can be hard to tell when I am getting better. I have not had to go to the ER for a reaction since I started xolair, which is an improvement. My daughter has only been on xolair since the beginning of 2021 and she is already seeing a decrease in symptoms.\n\nMy allergist had to prescribe xolair for chronic idiopathic urticaria so insurance would cover it.", "Hey! Has anyone had problems with hair removal? I have very typical dematographia that I manage with Xyzal.  I am considering trying sugaring, but I have never gotten waxed before, so I do not know if the skin irritation will inhibit the process or make it excruciatingly painful. Any experience or tips? I have had hair removal and it was not an issue. I have been waxed with the wax beads and had no issues with pain or itchiness just that the skin was a bit redder than what the esthetician was used to but I had warned her ahead of time so she was careful. You should be fine. If you are worried maybe you can take an antihistime. Yeah, but if you take an antihistamine 15 minutes before the procedure. And if you are not allergic to aloevera, ask the esthetician to use aloe on your skin right away. I have to plan my hair removal sessions around bedtime usually, or when i know i will be alone for a while. Because the area would get red and swollen for up to an hour.

Finally an answer to the uncontrollable itching! I was diagnosed with allergies to Dust mites, cockroaches, and shrimp in 2015 with a skin test. So I always got itchy cause dust mites are always around! But in Nov 2019 I started to get hive-like lines on my skin when I scratched and skin-writing. I have had this before but never lasted this long, it would go away with in a week. So, I saw an Allergist the start of Dec 2019. I was prescribed to take 4 10mg Cetirizine (Zyrtec) a day, 2 in the morning 2 at night. Fluticasone once a day and then Hydroxyzine, that I only take at night cause it make you super sleepy. I had to change my detergent to, All free&amp;clear. And I have always used Fragrance free and dye free lotion. \n\nThe itching has stopped, yay! As well as the hive-like raised lines. However, the red marks still appear when my skin gets scratched or rubbed on. But do not go beyond the red line, I suppose this will always happen now?? I have a follow up with the Dr. in February 12 202. I will continue with the medication and go to my appointment.\n\nOH! I am also going to ask about a Thyroid disorder... I was reading that most people that are diagnosed with Dermatographia actually have a Thyroid problem. This would make sense for me as I always feel tired and weight is all over the place and I have other symptoms that could result with a Thyroid disorder. But when I read that there is a link with dermatographia, I need further information on this.\n Anyone else hear about this?? Yes the red lines probably wont go away (mine didnt) after going on antihistamines but at least the main issues of itchiness and swelling are gone. \n\nI havent heard of it being connected to thyroid disorders but that is interesting. I used to have a hypothyroid when I was a teenager but havent had any symptoms since then. I never thought about a possible connection with the thyroid.\n\nIf you need more relief from your symptoms cutting out processed sugar helps a lot with itchiness if the antihistamines stop helping it. It likely wont cure the condition completely though.\n\nGood luck with your dermatographia! Yes! The itching and swelling are gone... that was the worst thin ever.

I began by taking a nice shower and using some wonderful smelling soap left in my childhood bathroom, as I am currently staying at home during my college's winter break. \n\nThe next morning I was itchy all over with hives that worsened as I scratched. I later found that said soap had caused my dad to have allergic contact dermatitis which he saw a dermatologist for and, luckily for him, cleared after a week of not using the soap. Unluckily for me, he also decided to move this said soap into *my* bathroom (does he secretly hate me? does he not want me to return to school?) which caused this whole allergic reaction.\n\nThe first week I was taking Benedryl every 4 hours, itching constantly, and very sleepy. Luckily for me, this calmed down substantially and here I am a week later with only dermatographia as my lingering symptom. I do not have to take medication during the day, as only scratching by my nail seems to bother me (not clothing or anything else), but at night it has been pretty bothersome. Tonight I am trying the Zyrtec/Pepcid combo that seems to work for many on this thread and hope that it gets rid of the majority of my relatively mild case so I can sleep. \n\nI plan to update this post if I see any improvement or worsening of symptoms so maybe someone else searching the internet frantically, as I did, can relate to my experience. In the meantime, I will be sending my friends photos of their names written on my skin...very romantic. \n\nOther random info: I am not a doctor, nor have I seen one, so nothing I say is advised or medical advice; my dad's derm told him it could be cedarwood oil that caused the allergy (the soap was a \"natural\" one and loaded with oils); the hives also seem sensitive to temperature i.e. showers; I did receive the Moderna booster a month ago, but I really blame this soap.", "Dermatographia and pole dance? Hi all! Last year I was hospitalized for an extreme allergy outbreak and it looks like Dermatographia. I was getting my allergy test last months but than my country where I currently live in got in an extreme lockdown. \n\nI am really passionate about pole dancing and love doing it. But my skin was burning so badly I cried out of pain during a groups lesson. The teacher switched a different pole without any nickle but my skin was so so red and it was like glass was pushing trough my skin.\nIt went away for 80% when I quit pole last summer but I miss it so much.\n\nI adjusted my showergel, shampoo, laundry detergent to ones without many chemicals in it and that helped so much!\n\nI also wash and spray everything here in my home with eacalyptus oil because the allergy doctor found out I was allergic to dust mites too.\n\nIt has gone away now almost completely after one year, but I cannot shave my vagina without getting an outbreak there and that triggers it to expand to my legs and belly a little, but not unbearable anymore.\n\nI hope to buy a pole in some years and try to see if I can pole again. But I am truly sad and have almost no hope.\n\nAnyway: TLDR: Can anyone tell me their experience with pole dance and tell me that it will get less with the years and I can put extreme pressure on my skin again? I think pole in general is a very painful sport especially when you first start out. You need to condition your skin for certain moves such as climbs and sits which takes a while to do and unfortunately can only be done by repeatedly doing those same moves.\n\nI think the other people in my class complained about the burning at the same level I did so I do not think I experienced more pain than them but I definitely was in more pain afterwards with the swelling and itchiness. Even now after 1.5 years of poling my skin will swell up and turn pink but it no longer burns which is nice (until you meet a new move that requires grip from a different body part!). \n\nI hope this info helps and let me know if there is anything else you wanted to know that I did not touch on :) For me if I know I am going to do something that irritates my skin and I care that people see. I just take a antihistamine and I do not have any problems. Oh absolutely! I did the beginning course in my country for half an year and had no problem with it. Moved countries, started over and within 8months the allergy send me to the icu in the hospital and after that, poling became like burning, red skin while feeling glass that wants to go in my body. I can handle pain quite well but i just collapsed in mid lesson and cried on the floor of the pain, my whole legs were so red and in pain. And after that it went away with the Prednisone pill at home.\n\nMy teacher is allergic to and had the exact same reaction but trust me, this was way worse than being stuck by a wasp but than all over my upper legs. \n\nI do not have the allergy that much anymore, like 20% of that max in daily life so that what makes me get a little hope of buying my own pole and trying on my own pace.\n\nDo you think it is wise to do? I really get where your coming from and appreciate your reaction! I swallowed two hestamine pills before pole and it did not help at all. I think I had to quit pole earlier to rest my body but I just love poling too much. I still am said about it every day. It needs time to kick in. I usually give mine a few hours. Although does your skin  give you physical pain or is it like mine where it is just ugly. So when i poled when the allergy was like really bad, i took two pill around 45min before the class. Pole static/spin during class and my upper legs got bright red and it felt like glass was going trough my skin. I think my skin now hates pressure. I got the same when i wear a bag on my shoulder (without the fabric of clothing). Oh wow. For me it usually itches and gets really swollen. I am in the military so rucking and climbing ropes usually takes a toll on my skin. I would hate for you to stop doing what you love. If it is just your inner legs can you wear something like under armor boy shorts or to protect your legs? I was just researching this as I just recently started noticing red marks from pressure on my legs while gardening (on my knees). I thought it was an allergy to something outdoors. I pole dance as well (used to teach before Corona virus) and today I did some pole and was left with dramatic slightly raised red splotches on my legs wherever there was pole pressure. It did go away with an hour but it was bizarre and something I have never experienced before. I am just hoping it passes soon. I hope you have found some answers! Is not it crazy? I still got this allergy but less severe as it was. and thinking about saving up and trying lasering hair away. I have not poled anymore, still homesick about it. I am going to buy a second hand pole whenever we move to a bigger place and hope that it magically goes away someday in the future. Pole was a perfect way for me to get stronger in ways i could not do in the gym and it felt like empowering to be able to be upside down or spin around in ways i could not ever imagine doing. Please remember to contact me if you find anything that helps and wishing you much strength with this strange allergy. Thank you! I will let you know what happens with me! ...and I definitely recommend getting a pole for home- you should probably stick with stainless steel if your skin is sensitive, chrome can cause issues if you are sensitive to certain metals. There are so many online learning opportunities and Instagram has a large pole community! Aah thank you. i would appreciate it if you update me a bit because we are both in the same boat. Will certainly keep in mind to get a stainless steel one. The teacher at my local class here put me on a special allergy pole too but it did not solve it, it was for me the worst on the inside of my upper legs (sorry not native English) because it had the most pressure. Aah thank you. i would appreciate it if you update me a bit because we are both in the same boat. Will certainly keep in mind to get a stainless steel one.

Hi there! I wanted to give you a little update. I found out my allergy is due to ADHD medication and looks like SJS syndrome. I stopped taking the meds last +/-half year and now I am clear. I took one pill the day before yesterday and next morning the crazy burning itches and red spots came back. I poled yesterday for the first time in a year or 1.5yrs and it all went great and did not got any allergies. I was extremely relieved, happy and now i now, it is not the pole but meds that made me allergic. Hi clear, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 The allergy of the day before yesterday went away after taking one histamine pill, within half an hour Wow! That is crazy! Thank you for following up with me. I will make sure to check medications I am on. I do not seem to be experiencing it at the moment but I have no idea what brought it on or why it is not happening right now so I am paying attention to anything weird. I am so happy that you figured it out!", "my experience after Moderna booster Boosted 11/27/21, developed insanely itchy hives 12/6. Took Benadryl at night and 1 Claritin each day. \nBefore finding this group and realizing what the issue was I made an appointment with my PCP and was told to see an allergist, add Pepcid, continue Benadryl and Claritin. I made and cancelled the allergist appointment after realizing it probably was not worth it. All blood work came back normal.\nStopped the Benadryl about 12/18 and just stuck with Claritin daily.\nAround Christmas, when the hives were starting to subside but I still had skin writing and red marks from pressure, I asked a family friend who is an ER physician about it. He said he had seen a lot of people with the same complaints after the mRNA boosters, and said it should continually get better.\nOn 1/8 I had seen improvement to the point where I decided to go without Claritin. I have been off it for 6 days. However, each day that goes by I have progressively gotten more itch and more hives. They effected spots disappear faster, and the itch is less intense.\n\nAnyone further along feel free to let me know how this is going for you. I am almost 7 weeks from symptoms first developing.", "has anyone tried histamine blend? HI, came across this product and was wondering if anyone has had any experience with it?   \n\n\n (", "Cat allergy correlation? Just had the thought. Is there any correlation to dermatographia and cat allergies? My dermatographia gets super intensified when I am around cats. Is there anyone here who has dermatographia and is not allergic to cats? Any allergic reaction or auto immune reaction makes my dermatographia worse. Yeah, could be. I think I am allergic to dust and pollen (scratch test will never work) which is why I believe my dermatographia is worse than others. What is funny is that the itching starts first then the watery eyes and sneezing. Are you allergic to cats? I am never really around cats so I am not sure but I would not rule it out. They can carry dust and pollen on their coats.", "Sex, and a Skin Condition. The dumbest perk of dermatographia I have experienced. Throughout college I was a frat-fuck boy sex addict. Not even a humble brag-it was awesome (ended up being not awesome, but that would fit a different sub). \n\nAnyways, every hookup my back would typically be clawed up severely like most of you probably have experienced. I have pretty moderate symptoms, but rather it being awkward or something like suggested in some posts I absolutely played it up. \n\nNearly every chick would comment on it, apologize, and then erroneously conclude as if it was just a lack of control on their part. I would always play it off and and let them assume that I must have just given that great of a performance. More than a few would take some Snapchat\u2019s of their damage and send it to their friends. Sometimes I would wander the house so the other guys would see my battle-scars that I was \u201cembarrassed\u201d about before they went away.\n\nHope this makes someone laugh, when I ended up explaining it to my roommates they got a crack out of it. Anybody have similar goofy stories from their symptoms? On the flipside... I itch my back and my S/O thinks I had sex with someone because my back is all scratched up from the raised skin lol.\n\nThanks for sharing your story! I have never felt the need to scratch anyone\u2019s back \ud83d\udc80 I honestly do not know why that is \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc thanks for the tip Just found out what dermatographia is, I have had this experience but never been able to explain it. Kind Of funny now", "Update on Dermatographia/hives/itching after 3rd booster (Moderna) I developed dermatographia with itchieness and hives after 3rd booster within 5 days of shot. Since then I control with daily Zyrtec. Saw MD and allergist. Both told me that it happens and need to wait it out. Could take **years**. So if it isnt a big deal, no treatment other than Zyrtec!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo....that is it I guess. Just wait it out!  As for my 4th shot...well we can just cross that bridge then! I had a mild case of dermatographia after my second shot. I do not qualify to get 3rd booster yet, but I do not think I will if it will make it flare up again. This happened to me!! 1 week after my 3rd dose of Moderna, I developed full-blown body hives. Went to Urgent Care who recommended specialist follow-up. Went to my dermatologist who recommended daily Zyrtec, Claritin, or Allegra with fluocinonide once daily for 2 weeks. Then saw a hematologist who said that it sounded like an adverse reaction to the vaccine, both an allergic reaction with hives and now dermatographism. It is been 15 days since this started and the hives are not itchy anymore but now when my skin rubs against anything, even just changing my clothes or drying my hands with a towel, I get hives. They do not last long, but mentally, it is frustrating :( Same here. Hives and dermatographia (hives pop up wherever there is pressure too, like butt cheeks if I sit on a hard surface) about 9 days after 3rd Moderna. Doc recommended Zyrtec in morning and Benedryl at night. Fingers crossed it is gone in days/weeks, not years. Did this ever get better for you? I had COVID arm after my first dose but not my second. But noticed little hives on arm hands/arms here and there for a few months with no itching. Then had a full blown hives attack. Got a steroid shot (twice) but if I do not take Zyrtec my neck/chest/hands itch to death. I will also get hives on my tummy. I am on a waitlist to see the derm but just curious if you got resolve. It is been like 4 months for me now and they are recommending the general public to get a booster but I am worried it will make the itch worse. I havent had a Zyrtec in a week. Has taken 3 months to get here.", "Single hive? Does anyone just get a single hive or two instead of the lines/scratches? I also get welted lines/scratches etc but I also get tiny little hives often by themselves where there is been pressure or brushed up against .. even sometimes just showering or putting lotion on will cause it\u2026 is this part of dermatographia also? or is this possibly something else I have along with it? I only ask because most the time I only see posts with lines and skin writing but my dr only mentioned dermatographia nothing else.. I am pretty new to all this so I am sorry if it is a dumb question lol! Thank you in advance for any insight. I get these as well. One tiny little hive. And it seems to be itchy in this area so I avoid scratching or else my skin will get all red with lines. I figure it is part of this. Hope it helps \ud83d\ude0a I know this is an old comment but I barely seen it ! Thank you I was starting to wonder if it was really dermatographia you do not see many posts about the little hives just the lines (:", "Why am I so itchy?! Is this really something that may never go away? I have been itchy and covered in scratches every day for 2 years, even with daily antihistamines - surely there is got to be a reason for it? It is driving me fucking mad!!! I wish I knew a definitive answer. I have had this for over 10 years with daily antihistamines as well. I have been meaning to try changing small things at a time like removing sugar or dairy from your diet to help, or maybe adding a scrub or way to moisturize since I have heard that can help people. But every time I want to try something I forget and my skin behaves pretty well for some time. Tumeric can help as well. I hope things get better and if anything changes or gets better let us know! It is so incredibly frustrating, but am glad to have found I am not the only one! I do not even know where to start with changing things up, I will definitely try some tumeric though, thanks! Based on my experience, the best way to deal with it is to make small adaptations to your lifestyle. Your dermatographia might be more severe than mine, I do not know, I have never met anyone else who has it in real life. But I have had it for over a year, and I found that focusing on a few small behavioral changes for a while makes the world of difference. Things like learning to brush your hair without letting the brush touch your scalp, or dabbing yourself with a towel instead of drying the conventional way. It is hard at first, but after a while you hardly notice it, and you cause way fewer flare ups, which in turn leads to less itching. Over the years I have tried lots to try and stop it - I do not even brush my hair (curly hair crew) and I always let myself air dry after a shower, but sometimes just the sensation of having clothes on or just having hair is enough to send me into overdrive! I always feel like I need to peel my skin from my body to stop it because it just shifts from place to place. If I manage to ignore one place and not scratch, it moves to somewhere else like the sole of my foot, or inside my ear, or the palms of my hands! \n\nI am not sure what constitutes a flare up but in my case the itch is pretty much 24/7. I have not actually been to the doctor's about it yet (stupid I know, but when everyone says there is no cure what is the point?) So have been taking cetirizine daily to help curb the worst of it... Just wish I could fill an aloe bath and live in it (or peel my skin off and start again!) \n\nSorry for the rant, but it is nice to find some people who understand what it is like! Likely it will never go away. I have had it for 20 years. I can tell you it does get better! It drove me crazy too, it helps to talk about it. Here are a few people's stories that might help you:\n\n(\n\n(", "Found the cause of my dermatographia Alpha-gal syndrome caused from a tick bite. It makes you allergic to mammal meat.  Bad news is that I cannot eat bacon. Good news is my dermatographia is gone.  I was one of the lucky ones, dermatographism was my only symptom of Alpha-gal. Some people have much worse symptoms, including anaphylaxis.  So if you have not found YOUR exact cause for dermatographia and you eat red meat, you might consider getting tested. Or just not eat red meat for a week and see if you get better. I was skeptical about having alpha-gal syndrome because the Allergist tested me for beef allergies and I was negative.  They have to do a different type of test to find Alpha-gal.   I do not eat red meat and I still have it. good news, u can still eat bacon! veggie bacon exists. \ud83d\ude01its been some years since ive eaten meat, but i think it taste the same!

They have been very itchy once I begin to itch it and it is not harmful more annoying. Can this condition go away on its own or will I need special treatment? Also would I experience this sensation everyday? Also is there anyway I can prevent this from happening again? Thanks well it might not be dermatographia\u2026 did the hives appeared after you scratched your back ? Yes sorry I did not clarify that. Do you know to how stop the itching though? I developed this all over my body about 2 months ago. I took 4 courses of antibiotics in the past 5 months for a chronic infection, so the doctors think my body is just angry. If it is only on your back, you might have something else. Try running a finger down your arm and see if anything comes up. My hives/mark go away within 30 minutes but new ones appear whenever I scratch my skin on something. I take 2-3 zyrtec and 1 alergra every day, per my dermatologis. This has helped sooooooo much. I used to get hives on my hand from just holding my phone. Take an antihistamines and talk to your doctor.

I have MCAS and run a fever sometimes during reactions.", "Does anyone else have trouble with tanning? For some reason whenever I go out in the sun for too long, even with sunscreen I end up turning red. Sometimes it slightly hurts and is itchy and sometimes it is not and feels perfectly fine. After a few days to a week that bright lobster redness then turns into a dark normal tan. I have never heard of such a thing so I was wondering if that might be my skin having a reaction to heat. Anyone else experience anything similar with tanning/being out in the sun? Some people just do not tan, I do not think it is necessarily connected. It is probably more to do with your colouring &amp; genetics. I have never been able to tan in my life and also burn really easily, but that is because I am very pale &amp; ginger. Sun burn is always itchy, maybe try using a higher SPF (I use 50 and reapply regularly throughout the day). Nah I am part black so I do not really need to or care to tan. I do not ever feel sunlight affecting me although I have this condition. You are using SPF 50? Sounds like you are actually getting sunburned at first, then your skin starts healing (the itch) and tans as a response and then you are fine for the rest of summer I would guess?\n\nI tan the same way you describe.

Only thing that helps is Allegra allergy medicine for me. I take one every single day, I have been doing this for almost 2 years...a little worried about the long term side effects of taking this tho ugh. Yes the only solution for me has been taking daily allergy meds. Before I knew about that it was cold showers and sleep For me it is anti-histamines and cooling cream~ aveena does one and it is the only thing that distracts the itch for me! Which one specifically? The good news is that it is more common in younger adults, so you might yet grow out of it! \nProbably will not struggle with it in old age at least, since it is a function of the immune system and the immune system weakens as you grow older I am 37 so hopefully that does not mean I am stuck with it. I spoke with an allergist yesterday and he said that most times it resolves itself within a few months. I hope so I am 17 now but I think I was about 15 when I first had it and it was pretty extreme back then, pretty sure It mellowed out for me since. I never took any medication, I just tried to learn to deal with it by not scratching hard and trying to be less clumsy lol I am 23. I have had it since I was probably 12, on and off. But the past 6 months or so, it is been every single day. Update: took claritin today for the first time and I have not had a breakout of scratches! Yippiiiieee.

I have read about other people experiencing this but I was wondering if anyone here has experienced it, and if it can be connected to dermatographia. \n\nThe withdrawals include feeling itchy all over, from head to toe. I almost never feel itchy with my dermatograhpia, so I do not even want to continue taking the allergy medication because it seems like my body becomes super dependent on it and it just makes everything worse. Has anyone else experienced this? I have decided to start taking Allegra to see if the withdrawals continue, and coming off of Allegra I still feel itchiness, but not as terrible as Zyrtec I take one 10mg of zyrtec a day and if I stop it is usually around the second day that I start becoming incredibly itchy, like how you have just described. I have learned that sticking to 10mgs a day is what helps so I do not stop taking them and hardly ever skip a day. There is a group that talks about Zyrtec withdrawal. I was not sure if I was having that when I went off Zyrtec for a week or if my dermotographia was just going into hyperdrive without antihistamines. I have switched to generic Claritin now and it is not quite as effective as Zyrtec was but gets the job done. Here is hoping it goes away one day. Also if you are trying to stop taking antihistamines, do it slowly. Try every three day for a while, and if you can deal with that then try once every three days. I was taking the 10mg as well but I am just so scared to continue taking it all the time :/ especially because I had never experienced itching so bad until I took it Thanks! I am definitely going to try to stop taking them, and I will check out the group to see what they recommend I have been taking it every day for 4 years since my doctor said it was safe. You should speak to your doctor about it I have to take 4 zyrtec a day for MCAS. I have tried to taper to a lower dose, but I get a migraine and my throat swells up every time I eat. My allergist said what I experience is not withdrawal, it is that I need the antihistamines and have a lot of symptoms if I do not take them. She says it is safe for me to continue taking zyrtec and that I will probably have to take it for the rest of my life. I feel your pain. I am dealing the same scenario... if I stop taking cetrizine then I feel annoying itching all over head to toe itching... disturbing my mind. I do not want to take this medicine life long but could not stop it. May be, I think if we continually take allergy medicine for 1 month course, does it stop triggering itching? Sense I learned I had deematographia Taking Zyrtec has greatly helped the itching and welts, I take it every other day to everyday depending on the severity, and if I skip taking the Zyrtec by the end of the second day or the third day I itch terribly bad all over worse than before I ever started taking Zyrtec I had the same itching experience with Zyrtec and wrote about it ( (There are two different posts on the Zyrtec itch.) It took about a month to finally get over my Zyrtec withdrawal, and months later I still have issues with itching. Thank you so much for this! I am definitely getting off Zyrtec for good. Hopefully I just have a couple weeks of bad itching and then I will be past it Thank you for the post! It gave me confidence to withdraw cetrizine. I will follow it and slowly stop the allergy medicine. I had the same issue, so I switched to claritin. It is not as effective at stopping the reactions at first, but I adapted to it. Also, I can miss a dose or two of claritin without getting super itchy the next day. ugh sameee! the other day, i was fasting and forgot to take it and i scratched myself so bad that i left some sort of permanent marks on my skin :(", "Medicine switch up So I have been taking Claritin once a day for about a year. It helps. Lately its seeming to do nothing though. Does anybody have any treatment suggestions? Zyrtec is the only thing that works for me. This happens to me every so often. What I do is switch to another type of antihistime (generic Zyrtec tends to work best for me) but I usually would switch to Claritin for example for like a month. I have spoken to pharmacists and they say after repeat use for as long as we tend to have we just need to change it up for a short period to make our preferred ones work again. Works for me each time. Sadly the Claritin does not work the best for me so I get a bit itchy still. Hope this helps! Thank you for your response. I like Claritin because it does not make me drowsy. And for a while it worked awesome! I will try zyrtec for a while and see if that will do the trick. Thanks again! My doctor switched me from Claritin to Clarinex. Yes, I rotate between zertec, claritin and the cvs generic I have never heard of Clarinex. It is newer than Claritin. Probably need a prescription.", " Example of Mild Dermatographism  Youtube's auto-flag system flagged the video for removal.

At work last night i pressed a smiley face onto my hand using a locking nut lol. Its fun to mess about with but during work i end up with lines everywhere.

Decided to test if I have this condition after little bit of Google. I wrote what you can see in this pic. Recently I got my blood checked and I had severe deficiencies of Vit B12 and D, started taking supplemental Multi Vits, did not help one bit with itch. Also, I had higher than normal TSH levels ( ~ 5.3) , which I did not have earlier. Anxiety is something like breathing to me, always there no matter the cause or environment.\n\n\nI diagnosed myself of this condition barely a couple of hours before and I do not know what is the outlook. Cursory glance at this sub tells me only thing I can do is cope. Since there is no cure. AT ALL.\n\n\nFrom everyone is posts here I believe the prime causes have been stress and genetics. For a long time I thought I had psoriasis/eczema but I am glad this is not it atleast.\n\n\nFor the record, I have been under stress for some time. I smoke mj, cigs, I drink since past 7 years but started getting this only since like past 1 or 2 years, heck I do not even remember when it became a problem, but now that I know it has a name, no cure, no known cause, I am fucking stressed if I will have to be dependent on meds like Cetrizine for rest of my life. \n\n\nI ignored it all this time because I thought it may have to do with something like dry skin/ less than daily showers. Whatever.\n\n\nWhat should I do now?\n\n\nI am 25, Male, btw. If it is not too bad, I can get temporary relief from Benadryl. Have you tried that? Only two things that have helped me:\n\nZyrtrc (costco brand is sooo much cheaper and just as effective) I take one every 24 hours. It takes a few days to be effective but afterwards i notice it if I miss the 24 hour dose!\n\nDandelion supplements/ tea also make a noticeable difference for me when I regularly take them - I can go longer between zyrtec doses if I have got dandelion built up in my system Welcome to the club, lol...  this is something I have lived with for most of my life.  \nIn my experience, anxiety definitely makes it worse.  I use all sensitive skin and unscented products in my skin care routine and even for cleaning and laundry.  I take 20mg of loratadine twice a day, generic Claritin.  It is cheaper if you get a prescription and pay for it at the pharmacy, even if insurance does not cover it, it is about 1/10th the price of name brand Claritin.    The same for cetirizine, or Zyrtec.  I also get prescription hydroxyzine, although that one makes me sleepier..  the antihistamines do not make it go away completely for me, but they take the edge off and let me sleep without itching at least... Yeah had it for quite a few years now. I use polaramine to take the edge off it. Cope. Draw things.

But I also pro-lets-spread-knowledge-and-awareness. I received my first covid shot of the Moderna dose on Feb 12, 2021, then my second dose of Moderna on March 12, 2021. Recently, on November 20th, I received the Moderna booster shot. With each, I had normal, predictable symptoms within 24 hours - sore arm, body aches, head ache, and fatigue. Then, on November 28th, 2021 (8 days after my Moderna booster) my skin on my back began welting and becoming very itchy when I was receiving a lovely back scratch from my fianc\u00e9. \n\nThe next morning, I was extremely itchy and had hives everywhere and realized the hives were triggered by more scratching or other forms of pressure. I stayed home from work, took Benadryl all day with no relief\u2026 just sleepiness and more hives and itchiness. I went to urgent care on Friday December 3rd and was prescribed an oral steroid. Which did indeed help my symptoms - but obviously this is not a long term treatment. It was a 6 day treatment and two days after I completed this medication (~Friday December 10th) my hives and itchiness returned. \n\nIt is now Wednesday December 15th. I saw a dermatologist today who told me I have dermatographism. I figured this is what it was, but knew if it was this then it could last for years and may have no cause. I have spent today with feelings of hopelessness and dread that I may continue to battle this for years to come.\n\nAfter work today I decided to hop on Reddit and find people who are currently managing this condition. All to find that MANY people are struggling with this miserable and irritating skin condition days after receiving either the Moderna vaccine 1-2nd dose, and noteably - the booster shot. \n\nI am going to be starting Zyrtec tomorrow morning and gradually increase the dose (per doctor recommendation).\n\nTo those also experiencing this shortly after one of the Moderna doses - how are you managing this? Have you contacted anyone to report this to? How can we spread awareness? Let us do our research and continue to share our experiences with one another. I feel hopeful there may be an obvious answer, and that it can go away.", "Does a standard dose of antihistamines help to manage your condition?  1 Zyrtec a day works fine for me. Claritin was not strong enough and Allegra made me weirdly loopy. That is just my personal experience.. Loratidine no, cetrizine (Zyrtec) mostly yes. Unfortunately it does not for me. I take Xyzal and Allegra twice a day Aerius worked for me, only needed to take it every 2 or 3 days.  Unfortunately I cannot take it while breastfeeding so I have to suffer. It does. Taking pill with bilastine. One pill every third day. After third day without the pill Im itching as hell I have needed prescription hydroxyzine to control mine. Used to need it every day, now I am down to every third day. It is great to see above someone else also on an every third day regimen\u2014I have second guessed it and thought it was in my head and tried to stop a couple times. But the itching returns every time.

All 3 worked very well together for the short time I took them. I have been only taking singluair for the past few months and it is not taking care of everything.

I have been exposed to COVID multiple times and have not tested positive. I got the rash about 2 weeks after my booster and it lasted about 4.5 weeks. I was wondering if anyone know whether the dermatographia response from the booster may show increased immunity against COVID or not", "Found out I am allergic to quite a few foods but still getting dermatographia So I got dermatographia at the beginning of this year ( 1st week of January) and I recently did some blood tests and found out I have a food allergy to quite a few foods. The more serious were: wheat, corn, yeast, casein ( which is a protein found in milk and cheese), egg whites. The slightly less serious were tomato, coffee, and chocolate.\n\nI was shocked because legit 85-95% of my diet contained at least one of those things and now all of the sudden I have an allergy to it.\n\nSince then I have been on a gluten-free, corn-free, egg-free, yeast-free, and diary-free diet. (also have not been eating/drinking tomatoes, chocolate, coffee) Its been exactly a week and I feel like its worse and hasnt improved since I have stopped eating those things. Has this happened to anyone else? I thought if I stop eating those foods then im not going to get the hives anymore ( or have it be minimal) but since then it feels like I been more itchy than before.\n\nIm in my early 20's btw. The blood tests are considered unreliable by most doctors. I requested them or asked about them to seven different doctors of various specialties like allergists, gastroenterologists and dermatologists, and they all said that they would not recommend them because the results are inconsistent. The same person can get completely different results from one week to the next, and they are not a reliable predictor of an actual allergy. Scratch testing or subdermal testing (as well as patch testing which is done by a dermatologist) are much more reliable ways to diagnose allergies. For me, most of my dermatographia flares are caused by my nickel allergy. It is almost impossible to eliminate nickel completely from your diet, so I am always ingesting it. Allergy tests are unreliable.\n\nIt is worth considering the test results but if the results are not improving your quality of life after adapting your diet for a month or so then ignoring them is the move imo Nickel is in foods? I have been trying to pinpoint my food allergies and I have figured out a few. But nickel? That would explain a lot. It is kind of the worst. Almost as bad as my celiac disease. Nickel allergy diagnosis is done by a dermatologist, with patch testing. Like others have said here, I just got a blood allergy test and my doctor warned me that the results are not always reliable. I am interested what my results will be but also know I have to take them with a grain of salt.\n\nFrig I wish it was a simple answer. I bet you are frustrated and I feel your pain. I hope one day you find some relief! Try thinking about medicines you take and maybe if possible, you could be allergic to antibiotics or other medicine. (With me it was adhd meds) My mom is very allergic to nickel, maybe I should get tested for that one Yes this happened to me, I adapted my diet for a full month and to be honest I feel that it was making me more stressed trying to radically adapt, at some point I started to reintroduce the bad foods after being strict for a month which gave me some mental relief and I eventually resumed eating as I normally did. Just by doing that my dermatographia did get better, but it really did not feel like it until I started to relax things and take my mind off of being obsessed on the food and the dermatographia. I got blood tests done soon after and the inflammatory marker that was high before had dramatically reduced to normal levels. It could be the fact that I was careful with my diet and it took some time for my body's inflammation level to get back to normal. It could be because my stress levels reduced when I stopped letting it consume my life. IDK. Either way as other people have said here, I am not convinced these results are particularly reliable but naturally reducing foods that lead to inflammation will probably help. I thought it was a come-in-contact-with-it kind of allergy. My brother was allergic when we were kids (grew out of it) and could not wear jeans or any buttoning kind of pants because of it. Might be Histamine Intolerance", "My treatment to Skin writing ", "So, is this just how it is now? (Onset after antibiotics) I will be honest. I had a rough 2020. I am sure everyone did, but without saying too much, I was not sure if I would make it out alive. I suffered from severe depression and mental health issues during lockdown. But, I did survive. Things got really serious the last few weeks in terms of my own personal progress/goals and it seemed like everything was going to fall into place by 2021. I told myself, no more getting down. You are going to fix yourself.  \n\n\nThe first and most important thing I decided to do in 2021 was as soon as my dental insurance activated (I was married in 2020 but had to wait until January for it to work)  I was going to fix my teeth. I had not seen a dentist in nearly a decade and my teeth were badly infected. I was in pain for a very long time. The lower left molar was abscessed so greatly that the dentist would not even pull it until I cleared the infection with antibiotics. So I took amoxicillin 500mg 3x a day and had two dental procedures done last week. My dentist told me he wanted me to continue taking the amoxicillin for another week just to be safe. That was two weeks of antibiotics.  \n\n\nOn Saturday, after taking amoxicillin for ten days, I woke up with hives/welts everywhere. They would get worse if I scratched. I panicked and went to the ER, worried about a delayed allergic reaction. I have seen my husband go into anaphylaxis before and I know how serious it is. The ER was not too concerned. They gave me a steroid and benedryl and sent me home and told me not to take the antibiotic anymore. I noticed I would still get hives appearing, but only if I scratched. Hm.  \n\n\nWell, here it is, four days later and I still get burning welts if I scratch my skin. I am also super sensitive to heat/sweat. Sometimes I get itching/burning in my hands and feet except they do not get a rash? I do not know what having this condition means for me. A week ago, I was a very active person and would frequently work out. Now I cannot because I get welts from the sweat. I also loved taking hot baths. I tried the other day to bathe and was so badly irritated after I could barely sleep and I had to lay on ice packs. I do not understand how this happened. Do I have to put all that behind me now? Is this what I get for taking responsibility for my health after so long? After 2020, I really feel like I am being punished even more. I tried to do the right thing and somehow the antibiotics caused this? My google search led me here and I just feel so unbelievably upset.\n\nI heard that this condition is permanent in some cases. How can this be? What caused this? I am really hoping it is not. I just wanted to try to fix my teeth and take responsibility for my health. I do not want to have to deal with skin issues. I feel like my depression will come back in full swing if I do not get better.  \n\n\nSorry for being an attention wh(re. I did not know where else to go and I feel distressed. Hi,\n\nI am basically you one year in the future, I started getting the reaction in the beginning of 2020.  First of all I am sorry, I know it sucks.  Second, even though this can be permanent, it does get a lot better and there are things you can do to help.  \n  \nFirst of all, see a specialist.  I went to a dermatologist and an allergist.  I was put on daily antihistimines which helps A LOT.  You can take more than the over the counter dosage amount (only under advisement of a doctor, I am not a doctor) so go see a doctor and get a prescription.    \n  \nAs for the bath are you sure the bath irritated your skin?  If I had to guess its the abrasion from your towel when drying off.  When I towel off after a shower my skin gets really bad.  Try to be really gentle.  Make sure your nails are clipped, for me I touch my face a lot I guess and end up brushing the skin on my face with my nails and cause a reaction so try to avoid scratching yourself at all.  \n  \nIn terms of cause, it seems to be pretty unknown, I have read some evidence that it can be a mast cell issue or an immune issue who knows.  A lot of people seem to get it after a course of antibiotics.  Theres no known cure, but a few things can really help the symptoms: avoid stress, do not drink alcohol, keep your skin mosturized throughout the day and do not wear cloths that can irritate the skin.  \n  \nIn terms of the mental aspect, I am right there with you, you can pm me and I will share more but basically I went through a really hard time as I delt with this.  Only thing to do is acknowledge that it sucks, take steps to improve it and move on.  Do not throw away progress you have made on yourself over a roadbump.  It will become easier to handle I promise.  Antihistimines were truely a lifesaver for me.  \n  \npm me if you need Basically all I am hearing from this is I am screwed. It is permanent. Kiss my old life goodbye for what? I am angry at my husband for encouraging me to keep taking the antibiotics. Though, what choice did I have? I could not fix my teeth while they were infected.  \n\n\nI made an appointment to see an allergist but they are only doing video appointments and are not doing any allergy testing because of covid. How is that supposed to help me? Makes no sense.  \n\n\nI am not going to live like this for another year. There is no way. I also do not want to take a bunch of prescription meds. I have issues with medication that stems from family problems. They gave me steroids and benadryl to take home. I did not take them. Steroids are bad news. I had withdrawal symptoms after the first dose in the ER. No thanks.  \n\n\nThanks for your response but honestly it just has me in tears. I am inconsolable. We are about to close on a house so having no stress is out of the question. I like having long nails. And my fashion sense is anything but comfortable. Guess I have to throw my whole wardrobe out.   \n\n\nAll because I wanted to fix my teeth. I cannot believe this. I literally had the exact same reaction as you when I first looked at this sub and I was freaking out. The good news is, I am only about 3 weeks in and it is really not taken over my life anymore. I may get a little redness or slight itch here or there but it is not totally occupying my mind. I have started running and cycling again with no problem. It can get better! I feel you- mine started in 2018 &amp; I became really miserable about my new and random skin condition (dermatographia) that seemed to have started after medicine for strep throat. Dealing with this physically and mentally it did take a toll on me......It gets worse before it gets better in my opinion. I was taking an allergy pill every 12 hours for about 1.5 years before I finally tried to detox myself of the allergy pill that I had become so reliant on. Fast forward a few months and dozens and dozens of sleepless nights of scratching myself to death, and I finally can survive without the allergy pills. It is been a few months now without taking allergy pills and it feels so much better to know that I can deal without. And that being said it seems like my body has adjusted to the hives and itchyness as it is not being hidden or covered anymore up by the constant allergy pills. I hope this helps Nobody knows how long this is going to last. I have had it for 4 years now. I take an antihistamine every morning. You get used to it after a while. Quality of life is not significantly worse. I know it sucks and it gets super frustrating, I have been there, but taking antihistamines can help you forget that you have it some days. I think you need to try taking some and see if you have any reactions, otherwise you will continue to be this miserable. I havent heard of many people having reactions to antihistamine, I really think you should give them a chance. Your skin will thank you for it.\n\nThey help relieve itchiness and big welts, and I bet if you find one that really helps you you will be able to take baths again. ive had derm. For 2 years now and I still take baths, but theres no way I could if I wasnt taking antihistamine.\n\nI take Cetirizine every morning and my itchiness is hardly there. Give yourself some relief my friend! So I am just supposed to accept that I tried to do the right thing by taking care of my health and in return I got an incurable skin condition? I do not want to take any medication. medication is what got me into this mess.  \n\n\nLike. A lot of people on here are really casual about \"I have had it for years!\" and meanwhile I have just...cried my eyes out for days. I did not want this. I have had to deal with too much already. Well.... Theres no cure for it, so you dont really have a choice other than accept it lol. Just trying to help. Enjoy your symptoms then. Be glad you dont have a life-threatening illness. People get cancer every day that may be even healthier than you. Life sucks, but it could be worse. \n\nAlso people that have had this for years are trying to give you advice and help but youre just shutting everyone down. Your only option really is to take antihistamine but that is not good enough for you it sounds like. Maybe you need to find us all a cure.", "It is this Dermatographia?? Have not been diagnosed. PCP thinks it is nothing...  Looks quite a bit like it, if anything it is some form of hives or sensitivity. Do the scratches bump up then fade away within an hour or so? When did you notice it starting? Happened about and hour ago. The scratches are bumped up and itchy, but starting to fade. Trying REAL HARD not to scratch more! It seems to happen randomly. This time I was outside for a walk. I am allergic to tree pollen, so hubby thinks it may be the pollen in the air that caused me to be itchy in the first place. Same thing happens immediate after getting out of the shower, so I am not sure what is really causing it or if several things causing it. I take Singular, two 24 Claritin and Flonase on a daily basis for allergies. Could be .. but could just be a one time thing. If it happens again and you get hives when u scratch then that is what it is It is been happening for years, but my PCP says it is nothing. It is been happening more frequently, so decided to look up symptoms. I ended up here...lol. I think I may go see a Dermatologist. There is not even a cure for it I would just take that allergy medicine and not waste money on seeing a dermatologist cause they are expensiveeee lol That is what I do anyway lol I have had it for years too =/ Ugh, good to know. Thank you! Looks like Benadryl will be my friend for now. Looks like a mast cell disorder. That is interesting. I am looking it up now. Thank you! It is difficult to say if it is dermatographia or not, it seems to follow in line with it. With or without a diagnosis there is not much to be done other than the antihistimes, trying to avoid hot showers, alcohol makes the flare ups worse, keeping hydrated (water and lotion/moisturizers on skin), and avoiding itching/topical cream when itching, some say different foods help as well. For some it is set off by allergies, being sick, etc and can just be short flare ups, have it for a few years and it goes away, or you have it for awhile (like me with 10ish years or more at this point). Be careful of what allergy meds you use and when, I take a 24 hour one and Benadryl if needed, and it is important for every few months to change types (Zyrtec to Claritin etc) since they loose their effectiveness overtime. I hope this is a temporary thing for you! Thank you so much! May be time to switch to Zyrtec. I have been taking Claritin for a while now. Xyzal has been amazing for me. It is a bit pricey it has helped more than Zyrtec I am going to have to try that!", "Tattoos? I have dermatographia, and it is not really that bad but right now it is completely inactive so nothing at all. My doctor said it will eventually flair up again but for now I am pretty good. My question is, can I get a tattoo? My doctors said that yes but I guess I wanted to see if any of you had bad reactions. More specifically I want to get an oleander tattoo which is a pink flower. The reason I am getting it is because my brother died two and a half months ago and there is a story that involves him and an oleander that I want to remember so I want to get it in color. I am sorry about your loss. \n\nI have several tattoos and as long as I stuck with my daily Zyrtec/antihistamine, my skin was fine. I had no trouble healing. The tattoo will get itchy, but that is normal. Do not scratch it or else you will risk an infection and/or disturbing the ink. I am sorry for your loss tattoos are a great way to symbolize someone you love. \nI have two tattoos but in black. They have not given me any irritation as long as I have consistently put lotion on and kept the skin very hydrated. I would ask the tattoo artist you decide to work with about this situation and see what type of ink they use. Good luck and would love to see update pictures if you get it! Thank you very much I appreciate the help Hey! I literally went to the dermatologist a few days ago to ask for her professional opinion and she said it is totally fine!! You can take benagril (?) to slow down the welting! I also asked the same question on this sub and some people have done it. So, goodluck!! I have had tattoos for 13 years. But I only realised I have dermotographia over the last year when my old tattoos became raised and itchy but only on my arms. Doc said I was allergic to the ink (def not as it is a decade later. My skin has always glowed bright red after a small scratch but I never thought it was anything other than sensitive skin. \nNow I take daily antihistamines and all my tattoos are really non reactive. \n\nEnjoy the ink!

I started out taking 1 zyrtec a day and that worked for about 18 years.  It got worse.  My doctor gave me Zantac but I found out I am allergic to it.  So, he said to just bump Zyrtec up to two pills a day.  In the last 2 years, I have started taking Xyzal as well in the morning since that helps a lot with seasonal allergies.  I have been noticing lately that my skin is getting more red than normal when scratched and hives are starting to form again when scratched.  I am just curious what everyone else is taking so I have an idea of what works for others when I speak to my doctor. I have been taking Xyzall ever since I got dermatographism, my doctor told me I could take up to 3 a day, so I take one in the morning and if I see that my skin is getting worse, itchy or burning, I take another one, if I do not need it I will not take it that day.\n\nMy dermatographia get worse in extreme weathers (hot summer/cold winters), maybe it could be because of that? Try buying a fan/AC unit, wearing lighter, looser clothes and stop stressing. \n\nDermatographism goes in ups and downs, so just be careful of when and why it gets worse and try to avoid the triggers that make it worse. I have seen living inside like a caveman and I have central ac so it is not the weather. I unfortunately have never found triggers (not food, not clothes, not weather and I have lived in opposite ends of the climate spectrum). Clothes have never bothered me but I have been living in pajamas since I work from home. That is good to know that Xyzal can be taken up to three times a day. I will keep that in mind when I see my doc. Thanks! I actually read an article a few weeks ago about how dermatographism is the body\u2019s response to an internal body trigger, it is usually due to a stomach or hormonal issue and that is the body\u2019s way of dealing with it. \n\nAsked my doctor about it and she confirmed that it is true and that the tests that she asked me to take a long time ago  (I have been avoiding blood tests for a while because I am deadly scared of needles\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) were to see where the problem was located. Maybe you should ask your doctor to prescribe you blood, gut and hormonal tests to see if everything is fine. \n\nOne of my mom\u2019s friend had a gut problem and stopped eating gluten and she got \u201ccured\u201d. \n\nI am not saying this is the reason, since no one really knows much about it, even the most specialized doctors... but this may be a good start. I decided to take some tests once the pandemic calms down here in Europe. You are actually dead on in my case. I have ulcerative colitis which is autoimmune. Usually when you have one auto immune condition you have a second. Dermatograpism came along when I was 8 and UC came along when I was 24. Unfortunately (or fortunately) my UC numbers for inflammation have been fine.  But even when numbers are fine, some symptoms just do not go away. I actually have not been happy with my GI for awhile and want to change but I am worried that the devil I know is better than the devil I do not. Oh what joy having a body that attacks itself. Sorry to hear that bud..Hope you find relief soon!\n\nI swear that the name brand stuff does not do as good a job as generic brands. My go to is the Generic Pink Pills called \"Allergy Relief\" from Walgreens. The best price for 200 pills and I get the most relief from them.\n\nI just posted my tips for dealing with Dermatographia in this sub as well labeled \"My personal Tips for dealing with Dermatographia\". Up to you if you want to read it..But..I posted a picture of the Box there so you can get see what it looks like! \n\n(  P.S. - I am also a huge candidate of taking a short break from taking pills daily so you can get their max effectiveness. ) I typically buy generic for the meds because it is cheaper.  I am not dead set on one generic or another.  Lately, it is been Target's because of free shipping.  There is no taking a break from the pills for me.  I literally will not stop itching.  Unfortunately, meds tend to lose effectiveness over time for autoimmune diseases. I am really sorry to hear that. My only other piece of advice I can give that changed the game for me is.. to try to eat as little sugar as possible. This changed my life when it comes to the itchiness. Almost immediately and I can tell when I have had something really sugary.. even a drink, because I get itchy right after. Ill keep you in my prayers! And I really hope you find something that works fornyou! Keep that head x", "Future Moderna booster concern from pre-existing Dermatographia Hi, I have had Dermatographia my whole life. I am reading all about the Moderna issue and it makes me concerned since in my country you cant choose what booster you get. I have had two Pfizer's that have not causes any issue.\n\nDermatographia does not cause me any discomfort like itching, so I am wondering if anyone who has had it long before the vaccines, has experienced any worsening of dermatographia after Moderna - like itching for example.", "Anybody with Dermatographia gotten tattoos? I have had my skin condition for over 6 years and now that i graduated college, I have been wanting to treat myself in getting tattoos. But I am afraid my condition will not allow it. Anybody have experience with getting tats? I have dermatographia and very VERY sensitive skin. Like I once wore a tank top and rested my arms on a freshly wiped down table at McDicks while on a road trip and ended up with hives for a solid week. That type of sensitive. And I have a lot of metal/food allergies. So getting tattoos was daunting for me, and as I waited to get my first one (in college), I thought about how my mom was going to kick my ass if I had a reaction to the ink. I read up on having allergies and getting tattoos, and the rule of thumb seems to be that colored inks (primarily red I think?) contain a lot of extra things in them to achieve the specific hue and vibrancy, and black ink is the most hypoallergenic and least likely to get rejected by your skin. I am generalizing here, but anyway, I solely stick to black work style tattoos for myself so it works out for me. If you want something with color, I suggest doing some research on hypoallergenic inks or getting a swatch test from an artist. \n\nBasically, I was fine. Barely hurt and healed up within a week and a half. I took extra good care to keep it out of the sunlight and keep it moisturized, and I was super disciplined about not scratching. I have not been able to shake the craving for new ink since lol. I have 21 tattoos and although they do take a little longer to heal, they are all fine eventually :) \n\nI have one that turned into a keloid but i think that was an allergic reaction to red ink vs. anything having to do with my dermatographia. I have five tattoos and i have never noticed a difference between my healing process and anyone else\u2019s. It should be just fine! Omg do not do it you will die. I see this every single day. You will be fine. But you will die. Would not it swell and bother the process though? Thank you for the reply! If my skin swells, it will not affect the tattoo? Thank you sooo much for the reply, definitely keeping this in mind. \ud83e\udd29 Nope! At least mine never do - as with everything medically related, i am forced to say everyone is body is different :) oops! did not see this until now. mine all swelled but i have noticed even people with \u201cnormal\u201d skin swells up during the process as well. my swelling in general takes about an hour to go down and it did not make any of them look any different. i hope this helped!", "How did you know you had a thyroid problem. Obviously people got tested by a doctor but I am curious what symptoms people had when they realized they needed to see a doctor? Can thyroid disease be a problem you live with for months and not ever be that severe?", "New Diagnosis I got diagnosed with this this week, a week after my moderne booster and I thought it was a freak one off. Seeing this thread and knowing that it is somewhat common is crazy! Zyrtec has become my friend so quickly, I wish I would have checked this subreddit before going to the doctor and paying out the ass for someone to tell me what some homies on the internet could have. What an absolutely wild condition. Cheers to all my mutant friends!", "Hello, Moderna\u2026 Just like many of you here, I have new/worsening skin symptoms after my Moderna booster. Full disclosure: I have a history of many chronic and severe allergies, idiopathic urticaria, and MCAS. However, these things were all well controlled and practically dormant, with minimal skin symptoms over the last 2-3 years.\n\n13 days after my booster I ended up having to be hospitalized and required 5 epi pens over the course of 3 days. Aside from the hives and itching, I had throat swelling. Again, I also have MCAS and other autoimmune stuff so I infer this is why I had additional symptoms many of you here did not have.\n\nAfter 4 days, I was discharged and met with my immunologist who is well familiar with my hx of allergies, skin issues (hives, itching) and MCAS.  Currently on Pepcid BID, zyrtec BID, OTC lotion, topical Benadryl (I was weened off oral Benadryl due to rebound effects and extremely high doses while admitted), and oral prednisone (I will be on 40mg for another 2 weeks, partially due to the fact I was on 120ml IV \u201csuper prednisone\u201d while  admitted). I was also given Hydroxyzine for the itch.\n\nCurrently, I have seen very minimal progress, about a week after. I have noticed early AM and 5-7pm seem to be the worst. My issues: dermatographia, generalized itching all over, hives on palms, butt, back, chest, face, scalp. Some itching on the legs, but overall yes chest and back and stomach are hit the worst, aside from my itchy palms and scalp. I have also noted that now, whenever I eat or drink, I develop a red rash around my chin, mouth, eye brows, and nose. Sometimes it itches sometimes it does not. Sometimes it is blotches and sometimes it is lines. Immunologist says to expect 6 weeks to return to full baseline\u2026. Based on my history. Labs were ordered to see if I will qualify for Xolair which was already something we looked into years ago. \n\nWanted to throw this out there to see if anyone else related as I see more of the cases seem more controlled or mild, also wondered if anyone else had any history of these sorts of issues prior to the booster. Either way, this is WAY worse than I have ever had and I have never had these severe symptoms. Hope we all continue to chat on here together, makes me feel better to know I am not alone and see other stories and recovery. We are all in this together lol", "Dermatographia and clothing? Recently been struck with dermatographia. Yaaay!!!! Started off pretty mild. Would get random itchy spots, especially at night. Thought I had some sort of infection, or bed bugs or allergic to  my new dryer sheets. But nope. Turned out to be dermatographia. I skip one dose of allegra and my skin just goes crazy!!!\nEver since this condition has started, I am not able to wear high waisted jeans or mesh tights, or my nice bras basically anything that is slightly tight. I am petite so I cannot pull off baggy clothes. \nWondering if I can get any tips on comfortable yet stylish clothing. Thanks. I cannot really give you much advice on the clothing but have you tried increasing your antihistamine dosage? \n\nI have a mast cell disorder that first started with onset dermatographia like you. \n\nI was told by my doctors to increase my dose of antihistamines to relieve my symptoms of dermatographia, other mast cell related symptoms... I take about 20mg of Claritin and about 10-20mg of Zyrtec. ...along with H2 blockers like Zantac/Pepcid. My case is a bit extreme but with the amount of antihistamines I am taking my dermatographia really is non-existent. If I skip a dose of lower my daily intake though... It can get pretty bad. 2 antihistamines in a day!!! Do they make you drowsy or do you take it at night? \n\n take the 24 hr non drowsy allegra. I take half a tablet because it interacts with the other medication I am on and that leads to brain fog most of the day and uncontrollable naps during the day. Ever since I lowered the dose along with changing the timings, I have been doing better in terms of drowsiness(not skin) \n\nDo the H2 blockers help? I have started taking histamine lowering probiotics, and switched to almond milk instead of regular diary. Also try to include more veggies and fruits in my diet. But nothing seems to be working:(\n\nAlso, did you have to get special tests done for mast cell disorder? When you take that much antihistamics, it stops being itchy right? And is you skin still turning to red? Since I do have a mast cell disorder, I can lightly stroke and it will turn red for about 30 seconds (overestimating as most of the time it will usually disappear around 15-20 seconds). Prior to taking an abundance of antihistamines, I could lightly stroke the skin and it would stay red for about an hour. It is extreme but unfortunately the mast cell issues that manifested months after acquiring dermatographia are more of a concern now (especially mast cell anaphylaxis). It is really the only thing I can do to mediate the other symptoms. \n\nI have dry mouth all the time from the antihistamines and I have brain fog all the time that is probably  Though, again, I have a mast cell disorder and I pretty much have a reaction with everything now. Much of my lethargy and malaise and over all poor QoL is from mast cell issues vs the abundance of antihistamines I am taking. \n\nTo answer your question, there are tests that you can do for mast cell related disorders. Most doctors start with a tryptase blood test and then work their way to bone marrow biopsy ...etc. \n\nDermatographia is just one symptom of mast cell disorder. If you start flushing on your face when eating and start having GI symptoms like diarrhea/malabsorption  ...even manifesting anaphylaxis to things you were never allergic to in the past are all symptoms of mast cell disorder. \n\nI manifested dermatographia after a stressful period in my life... About 6 months to a year later, the other symptoms of MCD started appearing. Sorry to hear that. Seems like you are going through a really tough time :( I hope things work out for you, and I hope your condition improves with time. \n\nAnd thank you for responding to my post, never knew about Mast cell Disorder. I am going to ask my doctor to get me checked for this. And will try to prevent it from happening if possible \ud83e\udd1e", "Possible dermatographia?  The only way to know for sure, and get a diagnosis, is to see your doctor.  I can clearly make out \"HI\" and the wheals appear to be uniform with clean edges. There are other possibilities but I would say it is probably dermatographia. Regardless of what it is, welcome to the writing on your arms club. Thanks. I do have ehlers Danlos syndrome and recently saw an allergist to evaluate me for MCAD. She was totally useless and I am wondering if I should see someone else if anything for some piece of mind to rule it out.  Me too!  U r nor alone.  An allergist/immunologist told me I had to spend the rest of my life on Zyrtec because I could spend hundreds and thousands of dollars doing tests to determine the cause of my hives/itching but we would never figure it out. Then when I pushed back and asked him again with the cause of my hives was, he said well it could be your thyroid but that would also be a waste of money getting that tested. I walked out of his office and never returned again, then went home and booked an appointment with an endocrinologist because my mom previously had thyroid cancer and I wanted to be checked out. After bloodwork turns out I no longer take allergy medication, my thyroid is being treated, and my hives are totally gone as long as I keep up with thyroid meds. I can rely on my doc, maybe u need a second opinion. Ever gotten any bloodwork? Yes, my thyroid has been checked multiple times over the last year but after speaking to my rheumatologist he suggested I get an ultrasound of my thyroid as no one has ever done that. There was a little concern when one of my thyroid tests came back super low but not low enough to be hypothyroidism so I am wondering if maybe it needs to be monitored more closely. U can get 2nd opinion from endocrinologist.   Best of luck.", "Performing normal activities?

Aside from the embarrassment caused by someone thinking you are having some kind of transmissible rash, I find that repeated exposure causes EXTREME itchiness and often pain.\n\nI have been avoiding these activities, but am now realizing this is not going to be possible over time.\n\nThank you for your help.", "Dermatographia How do you guys manage weals?", "Dermatographia and weal prevention How do you guys manage weals?

So, currently I am only taking 10mL of Zyrtec per day. It seems to control the itching and SOME of the redness but only to a somewhat tolerable level. \n\nI have heard keeping your skin moisturized can help, amongst other things, but I am curious. What helped you the most? Zyrtec yes... but have you been tested for allergies or thyroid issues? These tend to be a cause for a lot of patience. Turns out I have a thyroid condition and instead of taking Zyrtec I take my thyroid medication which is kept it at Bay for over 11 years I have been tested for both in the past yes, this all started after my third Moderna dose so I highly doubt it has anything to do with those two things for me personally, considering my thyroid was normal and I basically was allergic to every grass and weed in my state but had been dealing with it fine by taking Claritin without any sort of dermatographia prior to the third dose.\n\nUnfortunately Claritin seemed to do absolutely nothing for dermatographia when it started up, but Zyrtec seems to be helping a lot more. I changed my diet.  No more dairy or whey.  Took a couple weeks but I have been welt-free for several years. Hydroxyzine and colloidal oatmeal lotion Hydroxyzine helped more than expected, but makes me very sleepy. My dermatographia started after my second moderna shot. When it flares a round of prednisone is the only thing that helps, but day to day I switched from Zyrtec to Xyzal, it is sold over the counter and Costco has the best deal I have found! It worked sooo much better than Zyrtec for me. You can also take OTC pepcid, generic is fine, a few times a day. When I need immediate relief I have a steroid cream my doctor gave me, Triamcinolone. Also definitely staying moisturized, my favorite is Aveeno unscented, use it at least twice a day I also got it after moderna :( I take 1 zrytec in the morning, always use colloidal oatmeal lotion after showering, use fragrance free body wash, and take half of a benadryl before bed. Feel 100x better than I did before I did all of those things. Now I just get get red marks and they last about 15 minutes. Very little itching ever. Interesting. My moderna shot was in January so I find it strange that it could cause this in me now\u2026. Although that is been a hunch of mine. \n\nI mean, I have always had low reactionary dermatographism, but lately my disease is quite out of control despite Zyrtec and singulair. Looking at Dupixent allergy shots soon\u2026. I have noticed that when I get a cold or something my skin gets so much worse. I really did not think it was the moderna shot but an allergist I saw said that it could have caused my body to react that way. I have a large family history of auto immune disease so I am kind of waiting for that to show up. I was about to start the allergy shots, but moved before I could :( Yea. So my other theory is that the drug I took for a UTI in September two weeks before my allergy symptoms started is probably the culprit. I also was getting much better and then I had to get a flu shot for work so I am back in the same moderate allergy reaction situation. \n\nI am sorry you could not start the allergy injections. :( I am really nervous they may be my only remaining option. Hmm that could be it! especially the flu shot could cause a shock/disruption to your immune system. I totally understand, the shot really was my last option but hopefully it brings relief to you to know I have been okay without it! Most of the time my skin is manageable and with taking xyzal daily I do not even notice it (aside from when it flares but that is not very often). I could totally find a different doctor where I moved to and get the shot through them, but it no longer bothers enough to make me overcome my laziness lol! After reading through other peoples experiences on here and elsewhere I have just come to accept that it will be a thing for awhile, so as long as it is not itching or out of control I am okay with it! I hope the shot works for you!! Thank you! For me the itch and flare ups are still pretty moderate. But I just found out my list of allergens today so that is at least something to help me move forward!

Three days after I got my first shot of the vaccine, I started to develop these rashes that would appear randomly all over my body and be gone within 20-30 minutes. After much research and digging, I have self diagnosed myself and it definitely is dermatographia. \n\nI wanted to know if anyone else had the same issue? I think I read one comment somewhere in this sub about how someones was triggered after they got Covid. \n\nDo you think it is worth it for me to even see a doctor? Or should I just take antihistamines and learn to live with it? Is there hopes of it going away?\n\nIt is so uncomfortable! So sorry that everyone here is dealing with this It is a sign of the bill gates micro chip implant. Rip bro I have had dermatographia for many years, and since I got the second Moderna dose eight days ago, it has been flaring up. \n\nUsually I have a flare up if I have ingested too much stuff I am allergic to, particularly nickel, or if I have ingested gluten, to which I have an autoimmune reaction due to celiac disease. \n\nSevere Covid and long Covid are both autoimmune issues. \n\nI think because of the type of immune response the vaccine provokes, it is flaring my autoimmune issues as well. This is pure conjecture on my part. I have read a lot of academic papers about the Covid vaccines, but I have not seen this mentioned. My MCAS is flaring after the vaccine. Vaccines are designed to stimulate immune system response, so it is not surprising that conditions involving overactive immune system would flare after getting a vaccine.\n\nI think it is worth mentioning to your doctor if you do not have a history of allergic issues. I am new to having dermatographia. I had the Pfizer vaccine, first dose 12/22, second dose 1/12. By mid-February I noticed that I was getting itchy patches that would come and go. The itch was so intense. At first I though maybe our dogs had fleas; they did not. Then I considered contact dermatitis, but that did not make much sense because I did not change any of my soaps/detergents/etc. I was the only person in my house experiencing any itching or skin issues. \n\nAnytime I had a \u201crash\u201d it was tiny areas of skin colored to pink colored bumps. Of course, I also get the classic \u201cskin writing\u201d where I scratch. I have even broken into small hives since this all started. \n\nI saw my PCP twice before being diagnosed by a dermatologist. Everyone says \u201coh no, it could not be the vaccine\u201d, but that is the only thing that has changed in my day to day life. I think it is the only thing that would explain this. \n\nHere we are, nearing the end of April, and I am still struggling with this problem. Now, I feel like it is even worse. I scratch subconsciously, and I have been covered with bruises as a result. The worst spots are my inner forearms, legs, abdomen and chest. Showering greatly increases the itch, even with lukewarm water. \n\nI went from only taking a BP pill once a day to now also taking 4 Allegra, 1 Singulair, 1 Pepcid and 2 hydroxizine tablets a day, and I am using Cera Ve anti-itch cream, all under direct instruction from the dermatologist. \n\nIt is overwhelming, and I feel like people think I am crazy when I talk about it. This came out of left field, and it is miserable to deal with. \n\nI am not sure if everyone is so quick to dismiss the correlation between the vaccine and this newfound issue because they do not want to discourage people from getting vaccinated, and I understand that. I want some honesty though. I am an RN who has been on the frontline of COVID, and I am still grateful to have been vaccinated. I personally had COVID in July 2020, and I had very mild symptoms, but I have witnessed the devastation this virus can bring to some people. At the end of the day, I would do it over again. I am just praying for some relief soon! I could definitely see the two having a link and I was surprised too to not find much, if any, information on it. I figured someone here might have some I never had allergic issues so this definitely caught me by surprise :/ I will make an appointment and see what they say. Thank you so much Ugh that is unfortunate! I wish I they did not just dismiss it like that. That story is very similar to mine in that the only thing different was the vaccine really. I agree though that I do not regret having gotten it but it is actually such an uncomfortable situation. \n\nWow that is a lot of tablets in one day. I am sorry that you are dealing with this too. I will get the Cera Ve anti-itch cream and see a dermatologist for an opinion. Thank you No problem, best of luck. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb I have this. My doctors do think it is a vaccine reaction. No end in sight :( What is the treatment for that condition? It depends on how severe your symptoms are. I take 4 zyrtec a day, along with hydroxyzine, pepcid, singulair, symbicort, flonase and I get xolair once a month. I have to be very careful about what I eat, no soy or corn or their derivatives, no peanuts or tree nuts, no natural or artificial flavors, nothing package on styrofoam. Triggers vary by person, for example my daughter reacts to tap water. Thank you for sharing. What type of doctor diagnoses MCAS? I have only seasonal allergies but since the vaccine, I am on that level if drugs to control rash. My doctor is an allergist. The first one I went to was not helpful, but I found my current allergist from a list that one of the Facebook mast cell groups created. That is the best way to find a doctor who knows how to diagnose and treat it. By the way, I think if a good number of people report this reaction it might help you with studies and what not in the future. If you would like to report, you can using this link:  I am so glad I found your post! My husband has been dealing with what seems like dermatographia the past week since his first Pfizer shot. He was telling me he thinks that is what caused it, but I was not sure. Finding this could also be happening to other people definitely makes me think he is right. \n\nHave you gotten your second shot yet? I am now worried if he should go get it. Yes I did end up getting the second dose on April 3rd. My skin did not get any better or any worse than since the symptoms started and it is still happening. I figured I could not be the only one that this happened to. I am sorry he is dealing with it too:/ How frustrating! I am sorry for you too, it does not seem fun. Hopefully with time it will go away for you both! OMG! I thought I was the only one.  I have NEVER had allergic reaction to anything, 24 hours after Pfizer on 5/10 I developed a rash and now 3 weeks later I have full blown Dermatographia.  I am not taking the second vaccine.\n  It is so frustrating, and cannot even touch my face or I get this red spots.  I also developed acid reflux which I NEVER had any issues with before.\nIt is been 3 weeks and still the same, let us hope this is not permanent. Hello there! I am experiencing the same and it is been 3 weeks since I got the  Pfizer vaccine.\nDid you get to see the dermatologist? What did he/she say.  I have an appointment with a hematologist as my primary doctor does not know what is going on either. \nI developed this systemic allergic reaction and I also have acid reflux which I never had before or had any allergic reaction to anything.  First time in my life I am on a daily antihistamine. This has really affected me :(\nNot sure if to see a dermatologist or an allergist. Ugh I am so sorry to hear that you are going through this too! You are definitely not alone. I have not gone to a doctor yet. I have an appointment with my GP on Monday. I am going to ask for a referral to an immunologist rather than a dermatologist tbh as this seems to be classified as an autoimmune. It is good because most immunologists also double as allergists so it will be two birds one stone and there is a better chance of them knowing about dermatographia than a normal allergist. I have NEVER had allergic reaction to anything, 24 hours after the Pfizer vaccine and I developed a rash and now 3 weeks later I have full blown Dermatographia.  I am not taking the second vaccine.\n  It is so frustrating, I am miserable!  Besides the rash all of the sudden I get this itchy throat and ears at night  and I get horrible acid reflux and last until the morning.  I cannot sleep at nights sometimes because  of new symptoms which I never had before.  It is affecting my life now but the stomach burning sensation is worse than the rash.  All started after the vaccine. \nIt is been 3 weeks and still the same, I am on steroids almost done with my prescription and I still have same symptoms.  \nAre you having any other symptoms besides the rash? Hello, I am desperate looking for a treatment as my doctor only gave me steroids and not helping. Can you please send me the link to the Facebook groups to find a doctor if there is is one? No, I only have dermatographia. Steroids are notorious for causing GI issues. I would recommend taking either a PPI like Prilosec OTC or an H2 blocker (which might even help the itching, in addition to your other antihistamines) like Pepcid, and follow up with your doctor. So happy to have found this!! Yes I unfortunately also contracted Dermatographia after 1st dose of Moderna. No prior allergies and no prior skin problems. My first flare up was 4 days after the vaccine. It is extremely uncomfortable and I will be seeing a dermatologist soon! Looking like theres no end in sight. Thank you! Hi there! Any updates on your condition? I am still struggling with this urticaria. It is no longer dermatographia, it has now turned into hives and I am itching all day.  Im waiting for my appointment with the immunologist.  And the heartburn is definitely from my immunize system. Hi there! How is you doing any improvement? I am still miserable itching and I have horrible acid reflux which I never had before. It is seems like my immunity is attacking my body. Ask the dermatologist about triamcinolone cream. They recently added that to my routine. I put it on after the shower and cover it with cerave anti-itch cream, and it has made a noticeable difference. Thank you so much for posting! I am not crazy! I had the Pfizer vaccine in January instantly broke out in rashes on my chest and abdomen, went away after a few minutes but continued randomly since then. I got the second shot, by this time I was still randomly breaking out in hives for no reason and they go away in a few minutes, same deal but was not as bad as the first. I just got to an allergy dr this week was administered food allergy test, no allergies. He scratched my arm gently with his pen and boom. Now I am diagnosed with dermatographia. I told him about the vaccine and how I got hives instantly from it and now since then I am randomly breaking out. He dismissed my claim and said it was not the vaccine and it was just idiopathic\u2026despite the fact I have no history of this until the vaccine. I will not be taking the rx zyrtec and hope to find an alternative to meds to help. Hey! I am so sorry that you are also getting acid reflux. I have not experienced that but my dermatographism also has not gotten any better (or worse). Benadryl works for me if it gets really bad - which is mostly at night but I try to avoid the medication and take it really only as a last resort. My freezer has become an ice pack holder and I have found that freezing headbands is the way to go. It only takes about 30 seconds once removed from the freezer that they become pliable enough that I can bend and contort them to my body. I would not say the condition has improved but I have found a way to deal with it. My second shot is scheduled this coming week but I am still debating on whether to get it or not. Have you gone to a doctor? I am currently looking for dermatologist in my area to get seen. I took the Pfizer vaccine 5 weeks ago, 24 hours later I started with a rash it then developed into dermatographia but a week ago the rash changed to a regular rash with hives that comes and goes. I had no previous condition of any allergy, it is been 5 weeks and it seems like the rash is getting better, but it just started getting better a couple of days ago.  The itching is not as Intense and it seems like maybe whatever it is in the vaccine  is starting to wear off.  I went to the hematologist thinking it was blood related cause I know allergist will not give and answer since this is systemic and it is related to our immunity being stimulated due to the vaccine.  Both my doctors suggested not to take the second vaccine after I showed pics of when the rash started and how it got worse, mine was really bad so I decided not to take the second vaccine.  I have taken pics and they seem to believe me but I had to show Proof otherwise people will look at you like you are crazy.  My primary doctor has known me for a while and he knows I was healthy and no previous allergies or skin conditions before.\nHang in there, it will get better just be patient.  I was taking 2 antihistamines a day because of the horrible itching and hives now I am not taking anything, but the itching is tolerable. After the horrible experience with hives, itching and dermatographia I decided not to take the second vaccine.  My doctor also suggested not to take it after I showed him pics of when the rash started and how bad it got.  I was given steroids prednisone which helped with the rash but then aster I was done with the medication it came back again and worse.  I have an appointment with a allergist but after reading posts I do not think the allergist can help cause they will just do skin test.  The vaccine has stimulated our immune system and it is overactive. I am so sorry to hear you are dealing with this too! My family and friends also kept trying to dismiss my claim and tell me that it is just an allergic reaction and it will go away but currently I am going on the 3rd month of dermatographia. It is not necessarily getting better for me but I have managed to control the symptoms. I went to my GP last week and to my utter and absolute shock before I even finished my first sentence he was able to diagnose me. He did say that it could be triggered by anything and in my case it definitely could be the vaccine (my side effects started 3 days after getting it). He also ended up telling me if I have been dealing with it for this long it is most likely permanent than not:/ which is not quite what I wanted to hear. He said taking Zyrtec as I have been every day is great and he also told me to take Pepcid which Is a stomach acid medication. He explained that over the counter allergy meds block one histamine receptor in the body and the stomach acid ones block a different histamine receptor. With these two working together he is hoping it will be almost unnoticeable. I started taking them together the past 3 days and to be honest, it has reduced GREATLY!  Hi I just wanted to give you a little update! My GP told me to take stomach acid medication alongside my daily Zyrtec as they block a different histamine receptor in the body. The combination of the two pills has been working pretty good for me the last few days. I think it might be worth a shot to control your symptoms if you are still having a hard time with it Yes! I went to the allergist yesterday and prescribed me the same thing and so far no rash or itching! I am so happy right now after 5 weeks but we do not k ow how long this will last hopefully soon! Thank you so much for the update \ud83d\ude00 Ofcourse! I am so happy to hear that. Hopefully it will continue to remain under control for all of us \ud83d\ude01 That is super interesting and helpful about the Pepcid and gut histamines. I was basically told the same about this being a permanent autoimmune disease. I think I will pick up the script and ask dr if I can take it pen when I have bad days. I have a breakout at least daily but most days it is not bothersome.  Every so often like once or twice a month I want to crawl out of my skin! Hi! How you doing? I am taking my Pepcid and Zyrtec every day and it works like magic but I stopped for 2 days to see if I still need the medication and my rash and itching came back \ud83d\ude1e I wonder if this will be permanent.. it is so upsetting! Hi! I have the same thing going on tbh:/ it works great when I take them (2 Pepcid 1 Zyrtec a day) but if I happen to forget a dose I really suffer the next day so I am sure if I stopped taking it all together, it probably would go back to the way it was when it started. My doctor unfortunately did say it probably will be more of a permanent thing if it is lasted this long but I still see miracle stories on this sub so do not lose hope! I e had a similar reaction after the moderna vaccine. Dermatographia along with hives a few hours after the vaccine. Antihistamines helped. First allergist ignored the dermatographia and allergy tested me saying I was allergic to everything. Second one did blood work. Every doctor has encouraged me to get the second dose, which I am not. Currently on Allegra, Pepcid, nasal sprays and singular. Also none of the doctors I have seen will say there is causation that the vaccine has caused this reaction. Super frustrating. how are you now? I still have some itching, but it is much more mild than before. I still have to take all of the meds, plus a steroid cream after showering, but I no longer an breaking out or scratching until I am bruised. I feel for you. I got the 2nd shot on July 1 and it came a week later. I feel like it will go away soon enough. People who have had it for years tend to have had it since childhood or teenage years. I tried fasting for 3 days because I thought it may be gut-related, but no luck. Good luck! Thanks, same to you. I also tried dietary adjustments, but I did not seem to notice a difference. It is such an odd condition, I really think that it varies from person to person to a degree. Until I looked on here, I could not really find much info other than the generic \u201cskin writing\u201d definition. \n\nOne of my coworker\u2019s daughter went through this when she was very young. The dermatologists at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh told them hers was probably caused by a fever, and that it could potentially be a year before it went away. My coworker said that it lasted a couple months and then just disappeared and never came back. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f hi how are you now? Thank you for posting this. I have been dealing with dermatographia post shot 2, two weeks now. First I did have really bad acid reflux, like never before, but now it is seemingly gone. And now this has been going on for the past two weeks. I do have a history of allergies, to many, many things, including nickel and cobalt, so, it is very hard to avoid allergens. I am just SO GLAD to find out I am not alone. I cried reading this thread because I thought I was going crazy. I literally drew my initals in my arm to prove I am not. Still, I am so glad you are a lot better 100 days later. I hope this is the case for all of us. Which specialist did you end up seeing? I am scheduling an appointment on Monday (I was waiting the 2 weeks after D2) I still have all the symptoms but mild now.  Acid reflux happens every morning with cough then it goes away but it is every morning and sometimes in the afternoon.. ugh! So annoying .  Now I am super cautious of eating anything that could irritate my esophagus.  I NEVER suffered from any acid reflux until the stupid vaccine!  I am now allergic to animals hair which I was not before.  I know It will go away but it will be a while.  I still have very mild dermatography, sometimes it is worse than other but for no reason.  I keep a journal of what can trigger it but nothing I do or eat.  It is just my immunity attacking my own body.  \nHow about you? Hi! How are you doing now? Same thing here. No issues with 2 part Moderna then booster caused hives one week later. Could not figure out a rhyme or reason to the patches until I recognize that I could write words on my skin and make them appear! Has been about a week and it is pretty itchy and gross. Also of note was I woke up in the middle of the night with really bad gastric/esophageal pain as well as rectal pain. It was really bizarre and they both came on at the same time and were very painful. I have started taking Pepcid and using cream to relieve the pain. Really bizarre stuff and I sure do hope it clears up on its own sooner than later. No regrets though\u2026 I would still take the vaccine again. Any relief? My husband is going through this after booster. After ER visits,pcp and so much expensive testing we were sent to an allergist. I was told it could be anything, but given the reaction to steroids making it worse, it is the Covid vaccine. Steroids make the Covid vaccine hives worse. How I wish allergist would blast this to the PCP\u2019s. Steroids make it worse!? Yes, prednisone and 2 steroid shots Any updates? Any updates? Updates for me really is managing my symptoms through the pills every day. If I forget to take it one or two days in a row then all the same symptoms return:/ hoping it will resolve itself eventually Hi there! How are you doing and are you still having any acid reflux? After the vaccine I stayed with acid reflux symptoms which I never had before abs does not go away. I feel like sometimes is stuck in my esophagus the it goes away .. so exhausted if this! Hi! Any updates on your symptoms? I am so tired of this acid reflux, started after the vaccine but it seems like it is. It going away.  I feel like sometimes there something stuck in my esophagus .. I developed severe hives covering my entire body, extremely swollen and painful hands and feet, and heartburn that I thought was never going to let me sleep again 6 days following my 3rd Moderna booster shot. Treated with steroids, Pepcid, Benadryl, and hydroxyzine. 3 and a half weeks from the initial reaction and hives are much reduced and heartburn is more manageable, but now have pretty severe Dermatographia that is really annoying but only lasts about 30 minutes. It is really limiting for a lot of my favorite activities (dance, hiking) that have a lot of friction. It is really depressing. I am going to an allergist a week from today and can hopeful get some insight on how to better manage this. \nI really appreciate this thread, I was relieved to find I am not alone but really sorry to hear so many others are also suffering.", "Are Allergy pills like Reactine making my symptoms worse? I have been suffering Dermatographia for a while now, and I was told to use Reactive (Certirizine Hydrochloride) to help ease the suffering how ever I have noticed after every 24 hours I do not take the pill I get really itchy, itchier than I used to be before I took the pills.\n\nIs this the cause of withdrawal? should I get off them? Hi! I do believe cetrizine does cause withdrawals and increased itchiness. I used to take a cetrizine pill (10mg of the stuff) everyday for my dermatographia and it was keeping symptoms low, my scratch marks did not become hives but they were just very red. I did not like the idea of take medicine so I wanted to get off it. I just stopped taking the pills one day and symptoms were slowly building up, until I would feel the itchy tingling feeling in my palms and bottom of my feet. Then I started feeling the itch in my gums when eating and decided I should just take it again, this was day 5 of not taking a pill. Eventually.. I started weaning myself off. For example, every two days I would take a pill. Then it would turn to every three days. Right now, I am at the point where I take half a pill every 5-6 days. I do not think you should stop taking them altogether but it might help to slowly wean your body off of them. i like your idea of lowering doses, and im experiencing the same things (when im on the pills i dont get marks but red lines or marks), do you think I should start taking 1 every 2 days, then 3, then break it in half later on?\n\nthank you for responding !! Yeah! Take one every 2 days for like a week. Then take one every 3 days for a week (to make the transition smoother, I would say two weeks). Then break in half and take every 2 days, for a week. And then every 3 days for like two weeks and see how ur body is doing. It is really all about experimenting. It is still going to be itchy tho, tbh.. :( \nAnd you are still going to hive up when you scratch (just resist scratching it anymore). But the itchy tingly feeling in my palms and feet do not come until like the 3rd or 4th day. thank you so much and will do, its only been a day for me and im getting bad urges of itchiness, again thank you for the advice!

I take it around once a week and I am cured of itchiness until around 7 days after and it comes out of nowhere and I get really itchy and welt a lot. Loratadine is the only treatment I first tried and I have had no reason to try anything else as this has always worked. \n\nMy only other way of treating it is having a burning hot shower to basically burn all of the itchiness but is only a temporary fix.\n\nSo I am curious if anyone else has similar experiences? Only just found this reddit and it is weird seeing everyone with the same thing as me Loratadine is just Claritin, and it does very little for me. It is also only effective for max 24hrs so if you think it is effective for an entire week I think something else is going on. I also have heat sensitivity so hot showers make it worse. Claritin is the brand - Loratadine is the drug. Yeah, I have not looked into the biology behind it but when I take one I do not itch for a week then I itch like crazy and it has been like this for years Very strange.

Has anyone in this sub gone for surgery and what was your skin's experience?  I am getting ACL reconstruction surgery in february and wondering if anyones had experience with surgery or if i should be concerned. \n\n I am consistently itchy but have gotten used to controlling the urge to not itch as I have grown. I have tried changing my diet, detergent, clothes, etc but havent found anything to alleviate symptoms except taking Zyrtec daily. The zyrtec softens the itch sensation and instead of seeing hives, my skin turns red but without raising. I plan on taking Zyrtec ahead of the surgery. I do not experience hives when i shave my legs but i will hive easily from bug/ dog bites, or hard scratches. Any info would be helpful cuz I cant seem to find any research! I had surgery in the fall and the tape they used for the bandages did a number on my skin. When I realized that my skin was starting to blister, I asked the nurse for hydrocortisone cream and gentler adhesives, which they provided, but it took many days to heal. In hindsight I should have informed the hospital staff during intake that they needed to use sensitive skin bandages, but I just did not think of it at the time.\n\nAs for the incision sites, they did itch a tiny bit as they healed, but since they were covered, I did not scratch and so they did not get worse. It was really all about the adhesives for me. Same. Breast reduction a couple years back - adhesive bandages were the only problem. Incisions were slightly itchy as they healed, but that is normal for anyone. \n\nJust give them a heads up. I was more worried about my skins initial reaction to the incisions and healing, I did not even think about the bandages. They asked about latex allergies, but I am not sensitive to bandaids or gloves so I did not think about it til now. I will let them know I may have a reaction. Thanks, glad to hear your surgery went well otherwise! I have had a breast reduction, gall bladder removed, and bilateral salp. I have heard had any issues with my dermatographia with the surgeries or healing. The tape and stitches did not even bother me. But adhesives never really seemed to bother me. I want to say they did use the more sensitive skin tape because I told them I have dermatographism. I told them they did not have to but I think they still did on all three surgeries. I am not sure but it probably does not help since it is a newer sensitive area! I feel your pain! Keep the skin moisturized and maybe try some hydrocortisone cream on the scars when they are really itchy.  I have had severe eczema and dermatograhism for my whole life and have gone through three surgeries no problem. It may itch more than normal but that is about it.

I have sent of for an allergy test with klarify.me but I am just concerned that this has occured very suddenly.\n\nThanks for any help I can only answer based on my own experience as I am not a medical professional. Yes, you can have dermatographia and an allergy at the same time. Mine \"went away\" with time and antihistamines. Any number of things can cause it, including stress. How long did it take to go away? And thanks for your answer It was maybe 2-3 months for me, but I had an idea of what caused it and every body is different. Out of interest what caused it for you? Mine has gotten a lot better (I got it post pregnancy about two weeks after delivering). I was very stressed out at the time. It was really bad at first I would itch for hours and the hives would spread all over my body. It happened daily. I was told by my OBGYN to see an allergist because she thought i must have developed an allergy. I have not gotten around to doing that because of covid but they are not as severe as before, I will get a severe outbreak maybe once every few weeks. Now I only get the bumps when I scratch myself or something and they are usually small. I hope it goes away completely eventually... I have also always had sensitive skin and used to get face hives when I was under a lot of stress but that was different. Avoid any alcohol, fragrances, etc on your skin always. Could either be a food allergy or leaky gut syndrome/bacterial dysbiosis. Keep a food journal, if there is not a specific thing that is constantly making you itch it is likely a deeper gut issue and not a specific allergy. This sounds like exactly what I have. I have had it for 2 years now, came out of absolutely nowhere. I have done a multitude of testing (thyroid, allergy testing, h-pylori, etc etc) and nothing explaining this (also known as chronic urticaria) has come up. Often times it is idiopathic, meaning the root cause cannot be traced (super frustrating) and 'disappears on its own'. That said, there is a medication I am on that has completely gotten rid of any and all symptoms -- Blexten. Basically a high grade/prescription antihistamine. However, if I miss several doses (sometimes I get lazy when re-filling) and too much time goes by, bam, the red marks are back with a vengeance. So it is not a cure but it alleviates your symptoms to the point you forget you even have it. As much as I hate not being able to identify and treat the actual reason this is happening, the Blexten has 1000% given me my normal life/skin back (and personally have had zero side effects from it).

I take a generic Zyrtec every day, but have used Xyzal for specific skin-related flare-ups. It is probably worth a try. If it is not too bad Zyrtec usually does the job.

Wish there were more stories like this on this subreddit!\n\nCould you share if you made any specific life changes, specific medications, etc. that could have helped you? Why not show us what you did to make it better Honestly, for me it feels like it left just as randomly as it came on. I feel like there was a link for me between antibiotics and this, because the whole time I was struggling with the dermatographia I was also getting recurrent bacterial infections (UTI/Strep throat) so I was quite consistently on antibiotics. Once I stopped the antibiotics for a while and did not get sick again I noticed it seemed to go away. My doctor believes that I have some sort of seasonal allergy so I am more prone at certain times of the year to get sick because I guess my body is being triggered by whatever allergen which in turn makes me more susceptible to getting ill due to inflamed tissues etc. Doctor made me do food intolerance testing and I am intolerant to quite a lot of foods which was surprising as I never felt and I still do not feel an association between some of the foods I am intolerant too and any symptoms. Nevertheless I went on a strict diet and i am sure that played a role in helping but I truly could not give a straight answer as to what brought this on and what made it go away.

But at least it is hope! \n\nThanks to this subreddit for always being so supportive and kind in times of frustration :) Antibiotics are a know causer definitely, And specifically I have hear many many people cite a UTI antibiotic Congrats! Go forth and be itchless!! I just developed this after taking Bactrim for a UtI. Is there anyway to stop it from happening? No unfortunately not. I was prescribed stronger antihistamines which kind of does the trick but I ended my antibiotics 5 weeks ago now and my body is still detoxing. But that is just how it is for me, everyone is is different! Do you think because the antibiotics are a probable cause of this issue that eventually it will go away? I am worried I will have it for years haha It does usually go away for me! It just takes time and you have to remember that. I am honestly not sure I had taken my handful of antibiotics before every getting a reaction like that before so whether it is something that is permanent or I will grow out of who knows. But at least the cause is known so it can be avoided (so that is some good news at least)!", "I am currently experiencing my first possible \u201cattack\u201d of dermatographia. I have inflamed scratched and welts in several places on my body and it itches and burns and is not going down. It has been hours and hours and it is still here. I am pretty sure that is what this is but cannot go to the doctor.  Sounds more like an allergic reaction. Dermatographia hives/welts should have gone down by now. Try applying something cold to the area to see if you can get the swelling to go down. If you have trouble breathing or a fever, hospital time!! Agreed, for perspective, my dermatographia symptoms usually last 30min most of the time! Not \u201chours and hours\u201d  definitely as RustyRiley4 said, allergic reaction, as well as cold press and anti-histamine tablet/cream may help, if symptoms process or continue, you will need to contact the emergency services x Agreed with the others about it probably not being dermographia.

However, if I exit keto, my symptoms get worse Sorry I am no help but I find it really interesting that they did further testing on you. My hospital were not even interested in trying to find out why I developed dermatographia as a young teen (still got it at 22) I was told It can happen and just to take antihistamines daily (which I dont. I would rather manage it myself with caution and self restraint) For me the bigger issue is the chronic spontaneous? urticaria, which is impacting me a lot, while the dermatographia is secondary and less pronounced.\n\nDo you live in the US? I reside here now and was shocked how my dermatologist diagnosed me clinically without any lab work and just prescribed a high dose cocktail of anti-histamines. This is how it is going to be, best of luck...\n\nI come from Europe, where the condition (chronic urticaria, specifically) is investigated a bit more actively. From my research in journals and doctors abroad, it seems that it is useful to find the cause, e.g. H pylori, asymptomatic focal infection, etc, etc, as resolving the underlying issue often resolves the urticaria. My urticaria case is quite unpleasant and at least for now antihistamines do not get me symptom free, so I am determined to do my best to see if I could get relieve and attempt to test the eventual root cause. It is so hard on the US medical system, but I hope to get there. This.  I got my prescription for meds and was sent for blood test.

I did this for my patients (healthcare worker) and my unvaccinated kids. No regrets.  That being said, I do hope it clears up over time.\n\nAny positivity you can shed with an anxious person? so you are saying that you developed dermatographia after getting the booster shot? if it is I can say that for me the disorder flares up at times and then gets significantly better with things like destressing and exercise. Other than that I might take a half a zyrtec when it is really bad because I do not want to increase my tolerance for antihistamines Thanks for the reply. Yes I have developed it since the third shot. It is only been active about one week so this could be transient. I will try some Zyrtec and focus on a healthy lifestyle. I would hate to say it but actual dermatographia rarely goes away quickly at all. Most people start seeing symptoms after taking some kind of antibiotic or an allergic reaction. \n\nBut do not worry! It gets so much better I hardly even notice that I have it 99% of the time. You just kind of unconsciously adjust to avoid itching. I also just received the Moderna booster a couple weeks ago and I have developed the same condition.  I have been researching Dermatographia and it is really discouraging. I really hope this does not last. I will be seeing a doctor today. Please let me know what is said. I bet it was the PEG. How are your symptoms? I take one Zyrtec daily and for the most part it is pretty controlled. I just took a shower today for the first time in a week and my skin tolerated it well except where I really rubbed with a towel. Even then, I am noticing that there is a decrease in the severity of the redness. It has been one week since the rash started and I do not have any more rashes popping up. The only thing remaining is the dermatographic changes but even then it seems well-controlled with the Zyrtec. Next step is to taper off the Zyrtec over the next week. Please let me know how it goes today. It is going to be OK, this is going to get better and we did the right thing by getting vaccinated. I also developed symptoms after my 3rd Moderna shot Update: still have it 3 weeks later but it is slowly fading. Just taking one Zyrtec daily for it itching. MD was not concerned in the least. That is reassuring. It is been about a week and a half for me since I started showing symptoms. Seeing my doc on Monday so hopefully I will get some similar news. I have been pretty worried because the itching has been something fierce and really want it gone Ask for a steroid shot- wipes it out. Or take 2 Zyrtec and 2 pepcid daily. Either way it will pass. Thanks friend. I will do that. Got you. People downvote on here for some reason. Avoid the negativity! Well I ended up being diagnosed with Dermatographia.

And other advice. I am losing it from lack of sleep. Starting a new job next month and REALLY want to be in top form. Thanks so much in advance for reading and replying.\n\nLittle background if that is OK. I am 33 and my skin has always been susceptible to hives if I scratch. Like when I get mosquito bites and the like. I also get really red if I randomly scratch myself. It looks like claw marks but goes away after an hour or so. I never thought to much about it. But for the past week, every evening around 730 I get hives. They always start on my left ankle and work their way up. Just on my limbs! After a couple days I realized the hives only happened AFTER I scratched. If I ignored the itchiness (SO HARD), the hives would not appear and the itchiness would be there but not get worse. I googled like mad, and found this condition and this sub. So full disclosure: this is a self diagnosis with Dr. Google. \n\nSo since figuring out I think this is what I have, I have been lotioning like mad and taking anti-histamines. I take Claritin at like noon, and then a Zyrtec before bed at like 9ish. Mostly it is willpower. Which is ok, except I have been waking up at 130 am (almost on the dot) the past 3 nights covered in hives because I have been scratching in my sleep. So I get up, put ice packs in the hives (that is the best relief I have found) and take another Zyrtec. THAT one seems to work. The hives subside and I go back to sleep. But usually not for at least 90 minutes to an hour. I wake up feeling fine, no itch, but groggy as hell from the super interrupted sleep. \n\nMy questions: 1) is it ok to just take two Zyrtec before bed? If it matters I am a female, 5\u201910\u201d about 195 lbs. I have no health conditions. Would taking two even help? Or is it the timing that matters? And 2) and other advice?? Disclaimer: not a doctor, definitely ask them. \n\nBUT. My allergist told me I can take up to four per day. I usually do this for 4-6 days a month (always the week before I get my xolair shots). I am also 195 pounds, but I am 5'6\". \n\nSo. Based on that, I cannot imagine 2 would be problematic. BUT AGAIN I AM NOT A DOCTOR. :) I take one in the morning and one at night, that seems to prevent night hives for me. I usually take 2 certrizine (sorry, spelling is terrible tonight) at a time and that usually works for me for a couple of days at a time (I used to be terrible at taking tablets once a day, I would forget) I take one in the morning and one at night. I take two Claritin at night. Sometimes I switch up with Zyrtec. Just depends on the season. Have not had any issues. Definitely call your doc though. Mine wanted to go through all my meds first before giving the greenlight. My doctor told me I can take 2-3 in one day if I need to. I take it twice a day when I have a bad flare up. Several critical medical conditions like stomach cancer, gall bladder cancer and gi tract issues, and thyroid issues also can cause(in rare/extreme cases. Not always) symptoms similar to dermatolographia. So, its best to consult a dermatologist who will rule out other possibilities with tests and make the diagnosis. \n\nPs: I usually take levocetrizine and when it is uncontrollable, I take Allegra. One dose of Allegra does the trick but it is make me drowsy and sleepy. If you have a mast cell disorder, this is likely the norm. \n\nI technically alternate between all the 2nd gen H1's and typically take up to four pills of one or the other ...\n\nI still can see remnants of dermatographia with my current medication regimen. \n\n2x - Xolair - monthly\n\n4x - H1's (2nd gen) - daily\n\n2x - H2's - daily\n\n4x- Zileuton - daily\n\n2x+- - Hydroxyzine (1st gens) - nightly\n\n2x - Quercetin I only took one daily.  Please go see a doctor for diagnosis  and help.  Allergist, dermatologist,  someone.   It could be your body crying for help My pharmacist said it would not do any good to take more than one brand at a time and taking more than one 24hr pill a day is pointless. You cannot develop a tolerance and more will not help. Just take it the same time every day. Any one brand can randomly stop being affective over time and just switching to another brand is usually a fine solution.

Holidays around my in-laws dogs is miserable but I love those dogs! I always get rash from my beard, every time I place my chin in my arms. Also it takes 10 minutes for my rash to appear from contact then minimum of an hour to be gone. About the dog hair, are the hair pointy? Cause if the hair is pointy it causes pressure on our skin which activities our condition, but if not maybe you are allergic to hairs or dogs. By the way I also have other allergies like from dust, maybe we really are sensitive kinds of being.

I am not sure if I can help, but here is my experience. \n\nMy dermatographia is not severe. If you poke my skin, it turns colors. I can write words on my skin and they show up a bit later. If I scratch myself, I get a few hives which go away within 30 minutes if I stop scratching. \n\nI have a number of tattoos. The first one never gave me any reactions. It is a bear on my back/shoulder blade and about the size of my hand. \n\nMy second tattoo is on my arm. It would flair up and make the tattoo puffy, but it was not itchy. This happened periodically for about a year. That tattoo is a snake and when it would flair up it felt like it was moving, which was actually pretty cool. It also had some texture all the time, so I could actually trace it without looking. Again not itchy. \n\nMy third and fourth tattoos were like the first one. No noticeable reactions at all. (Side note, my third tattoo is the only one that the color red in it. I would heard some anecdotal stuff about red ink in tattoos causing allergic reactions in some people. Turned out to be no problem for me.) One is on my thigh and the other is on my upper arm. \n\nOne of my tattoos is on my calf. That one had a full on reaction. Every morning, as I got out of bed, I would have to slowly lower my leg to the ground. It was swollen. It throbbed. It was (for me) a full on flair up. \n\nI thought, \u201cWelp, I guess I am never getting another tattoo.\u201d But after a couple of weeks, the flair up went away and my desire for another tattoo came back. :)\n\nThe next one, on my back, caused no problems at all. \n\nI included the locations of my tattoos in case location has some bearing on the reactions. That sounds like a heck of a trip lol. Glad everything went well for the most part. Thank you! it got swollen how it usually does during and right after but did not affect the tattoo.

Plus side is I am more trained to ignore the urge to scratch than I would be without dermographia. All of mine were fine! No big deal and did not affect the process at all.\n\nThe only bad reaction I had was when one used a Second Skin bandage, which is supposed to stay on for about a week while it heals. I am not sure what it was, maybe the strong adhesive pulling, but my skin was in a constant state of irritation with it. It puffed up right under the bandage and did not go down at all. All the ones I did not apply that to healed well with the normal care instructions. Made sure to take my prescribed antihistamines that morning and it went fine! I have three tattoos from before my dermatographia showed up, it is good to see that if I want more, it might not be a huge issue.

I am afraid about living on antihistamines (if they start to work) and about long term negative effects of the constant inflammation and the pills.\n\n1. What doctors should I visit? Derm, allergist, etc.\n2. Any tests to do? So far I read about H. pylory and about Thyroid related causes, but should I do other lab work too?\n3. Any recommendations for specialized doctors in the San Francisco Bay Area or California to visit?\n4. Since it is early on, anything else I can do to find the root causes and/or to improve my chances of recovery? Been trying to answer this all day so here we go.  So there is no cure. Full stop.  That being said it occurs predominantly in persons 20s and 30s with a decent portion growing out of it though I do not know the numbers. For me, I am in year 7 and have it in the same places, it has never really improved but it is easier to handle in the winter (or the AC on. I have kind of learned to accept the marks but the itching is still annoying ha...\n\nWhat causes it? We do not know, but we do know that the symptoms worsen at night, and that heat, stress, emotion, exercise and physical stimuli (primarily physical stimuli) can cause it to appear in an individual instance.  You mentioned stress so that is probably it as 1/3 of us with dermatographism developed it after a significantly stressful life event.  It wears down your immune system so doing what you can to take care of yourself physically and mentally (e.g. watching your diet, physical activity level and possibly therapy if you think it is needed) may be the best route for your symptoms improving.\n\nWhat treatment is available?  H1 Antihistamines such as cetirizine and loratadine being a first choice with H2 Antihistamines being added on to provide better coverage. There are tests underway for a drug but it is purported efficacy is around 70% so we will have to wait and see.\n\nWhat testing is available? There are no labs or testing to suggest as we do not know what causes it, it effects 2%-5% of the population and is seen in everyone regardless or race so it is been around a while. You may opt to have your cortisol levels or other stress hormones checked.\n\nI would not worry too much about the inflammation or about the long term use of antihistamines. As for when they will begin to work, they will probably take a few days to built up in your system as they will need to be present prior to any scratches for the body to call on their affects.\n\nExperts/specialists.  If you have not already gotten the stress under control then you should probably find a therapist.  If you want you can ask your PCP for a recommendation for a dermatologist in the area.  They have the same toolkit as your doc but may have more experience with it or similar things and be able to offer a better solution.\n\nBest of luck. Thank you for taking the time to respond in such helpful details, u/Alix_Chevalier. Hugely appreciated. And even if I do not like what I read, your response is very helpful.\n\nI will do my best at taking care of myself and will hope for good outcomes. Fingers crossed for an upcoming resoltion for you and others on this subreddit.\n\nWhat is interesting is that in my case the dermarographism might be an accompanying condition to what seems to be some form of (chronic?) urticaria. Is that what many of you are also experiencing?\n\nI came across an article from S. J. Deacock that at least gave me some hope that I could try to find out more about the condition I have. ( for anyone who finds it helpful.\n\nYou mentioned upcoming/new treatment with 70% success rate. Could you share what it is? Are you referring to cyclosporin? You seem very knowledgeable, so if you have any other helpful resources or directions to share, I would greatly appreciate it if you could do so. Alix\\_Chevalier basically nailed it. I have been suffering from dermographism / chronic urticaria for 2 years now. Came out of nowhere, did all the tests you mentioned and more, no explanations. I have been on a medication called Blexten that has completely gotten rid of my symptoms (has not cured it though..if I miss too many doses, the hives come back). I have also been recommended to try Xolair (a shot/injection); apparently after a few rounds it can completely eradicate the hives. But since it is very expensive and I am not planning a pregnancy anytime soon, the Blexten is totally fine for me (and the faint hope that it will just go away on its own eventually) I developed this 4 years ago (same symptoms as you), and I believe it was caused from significant work stress at that time. I went to several dermatologists as well, but unfortunately skin allergies/issues are hard to diagnose. They usually say to take anti-histamines to deal with it; in the beginning I was taking 2 Benadryl a day, but did not want to live off on them as well, and began to take them only when I really felt like I needed it (currently about every 4 days, but sometimes it fluctuates). I also thought it was thyroid related, so I did a test, but nothing was found there. \n\nSince the redness/itchiness/welts are caused by a histamine release, I have recently started looking into low-histamine diets to see or at least help identify which foods especially trigger my skin. Those diets also talk about natural antihistamines through vitamins (such as vitamin C, B12, B6), which I started taking as well, but again, there is still not enough research on histamine intolerance and related symptoms to determine what works and what does not. Also, everyone reacts differently to different foods, but that might be a way to help you pin point which high histamine foods could be contributing to the release of your histamine. And at least you will know that you will get a reaction when you eat them. I have only started the low histamine diet about a week ago, so I cannot form much of a conclusion yet, but so far, although still consistent, the intensity of the hives has decreased. Sorry to hear you have been suffering through this for 4 years. I hope the low histamine diet would help you, though I am not sure mine is a caused by histamine intolerance. Another way to test this out would be to try some DAO supplementation, but better measure your levels and activity first. I have not done this yet, but is on my list. In any case, I have been on it for about 3 weeks now, and I am still unsure of it helps, or if it is the medicine. One thing is for sure though, it is rather restrictive and makes meal planning a huge chore. \n\nMy urticaria case seems relatively bad, at least to the degree to which it does not seem to respond well to antihistamines. I am currently on 40mg cetirizine, 40mg famotidine, as well as montelukast, which is the next step in the escalation of the treatment. Yet, I still get hives in the morning, and some itching thought the day :(. True, I have been meaning to look into DAO supplementation as well; agreed, the low histamine diet is definitely time consuming and restricting, and might not even be related at all. I am sorry that your skin is not responding to those antihistamines - I hope it does eventually, or that other lifestyle changes may help! It sucks that there is not a defined solution for this. Another thing you could look into is Eastern (Chinese) medicine in terms of drinking herbs that can help remedy from within the body - but that is definitely time consuming as well in terms of finding a doctor, adhering to it twice a day, and can be expensive as well.", "Is not it something normal??

So maybe omega3 could aid  your sensitivity.\n\n*Overproduction of Leukotrienes*  \n*With salicylate intolerance, there is an altered metabolism of arachidonic acid and eicosanoids. This leads to a predominance of leukotrienes over prostaglandins. Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators that have been linked to many conditions.*  \n*There is also activation of basophils and eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, platelets, and lymphocytes in salicylate intolerant individuals. These cells play an essential role in the symptoms of salicylate sensitivity (3).  Taking the long-chain omega 3 fatty acids EPA and DHA found in cold water fish and fish oils can help reduce this inflammatory process.*\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(  \n( Eggs.

As for the pen cap it does but it is very small and hard to notice. More pressure = bigger bump. And yeah it itches Did you snap the rubber band on your wrist? If so, those are just welts.

I developed dermatographia and pressure urticaria (hives on butt from sitting, feet from standing, etc) 9 days after my Moderna booster - my first 2 shots were Moderna, too. A day or so after the hivey symptoms started, I had swelling of the skin around my lips out of nowhere, and it went down shortly after popping two Zyrtec on doctor\u2019s advice. Since then, I have been on a Zyrtec in the morning and two Benedryl before bed, which has just about completely eliminated the pressure hives and rendered the dermatographia mild, though not gone. Tends to be worse at night which makes me wonder if I should be adding another Zyrtec to the daily menu. Anyway, it is been about two and a half weeks on this routine, and this morning, out of nowhere, the skin around my mouth swells up and gets very red, in a matter of seconds. I took my morning Zyrtec and it went down quickly. Had anyone experienced anything like this? I cannot think of any explanation for the suddenly swelling - anything different I did or ate.

Hey! I am so sorry that you are dealing with this. What ended up working better than Claritin for me was Zyrtec (you can take one every 24hours) with Pepcid alongside it (2 a day recommended) and it pretty much has it under control for me. The reasoning behind it that my doctor explained was that they block different histamine receptors in the body for it to minimize it even more since this condition is due to your body releasing too much histamines. You can get both of those items OTC. Oh and he also said it is very safe to take them as often as I am. I would try to go see an allergist. If it is caused by the antibiotic, I would guess that it might go away if you stop taking the antibiotic, but I have heard other people get it from an allergic reaction and it does not go away. I generally take Allegra, but I have heard that others take Benadryl or Zyrtec. Cold bathes also help, though I have never tried it myself. God, fuck Macrobid! Same thing happen to me. I got it after 3 days of finishing it. It is been almost 3 months now. The first month I was miserable. I thought that was the rest of my life.

I work in a gut microbiome lab and always read about how harmful antibotics are on your gut. Typically takes 6 months to go back to normal for some kinds.

I kept track of my symptoms and soon found out that my skin turns red extremely easily and that is what was causing the rashes. I showed my stomach doctor and she said I had dermatographia. I spoke with my primary, and she ordered blood work. Everything came back normal except my ANA was positive so I was sent to a rheumatologist. She said it was too soon to tell if I have an autoimmune disease but prescribed me Zyrtec everyday, and will have blood work redone in the fall. Do I bother going to a dermatologist or should I be finding a new allergist? Thoughts? Yes, you should go to the dermatologist for patch testing. I have a nickel allergy, which they test for, and too much nickel in my diet seems to cause dermatographia for me.

My allergist was a complete moron however all I can say is I am thankful to him for running these tests because it led me to my endocrinologist and my thyroid condition and shortly after starting thyroid medication I have been cured from dermatographia. I just checked and it said TSH and TS4 was normal. Not enough.  U have to ask for T3 and TPO and other antibodies.   That is  what pinpointed  my thyroid issues. Wow good to know. Were you having any other symptoms? My only other symptom is fatigue At the time my only symptom was dermotographia  actually.   Fatigue from Low iron and D did not  come until about 3-5 yrs later.  My mom had thyroid cancer when she was younger so when he said I would have to live on antihistamines  for the rest of my life  I pushed back and told him I wanted to know the cause.  He said it could take thousands of dollars and tests to determine what the cause was so he did not want to waste my time. I pushed back again and said I want to know the cause and he said well it could be your thyroid but again that would be a waste of time. That is when I walked out of his office and never returned and called an endocrinologist the very same day.  My antibodies  were thru the roof.  It will only take another blood test if that is  it.

I developed severe dermatographia about 2 months ago. It is making me extremely depressed. I am starting my final year of graduate school and this condition is making it so much harder. I developed it about 4 days after finishing an antibotic for a UTI that keep coming back (4 courses of antibotics in 5 months). A dermatologis told me this was probably why, also possibly due to stress from the worst semester of my life. \n\nI just keep crying it is never going to go away. I take 2-3 zyrtec and 1 allerga a day. This helps it not be so severe and itch all over my body, but does not help for my arms or make the marks go away. I am tired of seeing rashes all over my body and itching anytime I move. Has this faded for anyone? Mine comes and goes but it is mostly gone. It was intense when it first started for several months but then it got a lot better. I do not even have to take antihistamines anymore Hi, I totally feel you. Mine got worse this January to the point were I regularly had to take multiple cold showers to make it stop itching. So I went to a doctor and they first prescribed me 4 zyrtec a day, then 4 bilaxten daily. Both did only work the same as you: it was not itching as much but the marks were still there and stressing me out, because people made comments constantly. Also I was always tired and had no energy to do anything. So they put me on desloratadine, also 4 daily, which destroyed my focus completely and I almost failed the semester. I stopped taking them now. The condition has stayed the same and it is hard for me to be optimistic. I hope you get better soon!! Sorry to hear how you are feeling. It does go, though it could take a year or two. Stay positive, and know this is not forever. The good news is people with dermographism seem otherwise well. Take care! I had a similar experience in college. The stress flared it up and then I did not know yet that a zertec would help. I took cold showers and tried to wear clothing that offered some compression. Best of luck for your condition and studies I am so sorry you are dealing with this! I am still new to my diagnosis as well and I have found that -in addition to the antihistamines/allergy meds and colder showers- a good moisturizer on e or twice a day slathered EVERYWHERE you can reach can also be somewhat of a help. I am so sorry dear, but I can relate. Currently waiting to see a derm as blexten and nasal spray and creams do not do enough, they barely help. I am applying for disability so I definitely will not be able to take 4 pills a day if that would work better than 1. I itch all over my body, from clothing especially bras and pants, from sweating, from having an orgasm, I itch all the time, today it has been especially bad, I itch on my scalp, I itch down there, I itch all day long, nothing is helping enough not hydrocortisone creams, not hypoallergenic body, face wash and lotion, etc lukewarm showers help but not enough. I am lost. I almost went to hospital recently because it got so bad under stress. But even under low stress it is still really fucking bad. I cannot live like this. It is making me extremely depressed and suicidal. I cannot afford 150 a month on allergy meds fuck, I am dying inside. I can barely afford 1. I will not be able to for quite a while. Gosh why must I suffer so fucking much. It is unbearable.\n\nHave you seen a derm and/or allergist already? Here is what my allergist told me to do: wear hypoallgernic lotion all over, use only sensitive skin wash and detergent, take lukewarm showers, do not scratch as that makes it worse, lower stress (impossible to do all the fucking time) and take antihistamines. \n\nIts just not enough. I am going insane. Quercitin may help, also Prednisone, xolair etc...\n\nCheck out endsickness.org he has a lot info on histamine intolerance/macd", "We would be terrible porn stars Not sure why this popped in my head but all the marks all over your body while getting busy would be very distracting LOL I love the people that downvoted this... no sense of humor (sad trombone noise) Dangit Maybe TMI but more often than not the red marks are a turn on to some people, it is like they are proud they \"marked\" your skin because it was so intense and rough. Spoiler alert, it was the dermatographia, not you :) Well that took a dark turn Dude!! But imagine a plot starting with drawing a dick ON a dick!!!", "Soo tattoos can we get them? I am getting a tattoo in a few weeks and I am worried that my Dermatographia will affect it. I would say definitely no. I would never take a risk like that. Plenty of people have tattoos with it. I got a small tattoo just to test what would happen and informed the artist about it beforehand and it went smoothly. If anything take a heavy antihistamine dose beforehand and drink plenty of water. I got all mine before getting dermographia. I would seriously use a ton of antihistamine before. But you have the ask if that is safe itself. I would worry on the side of not getting a tattoo while in a period of dermographia. I literally cannot image how awful it would be for needles to pick my skin so much considering what happens if I get a scratch or rub against something wrong. Be safe and wait. Consult a dermatologist if this is something you really want done. i have big tattoos and have dermagraphism!!! it is definitely possible to do but everyone reacts differently so i cannot promise u will not have a reaction to it :/ you should also find out if you are allergic to red ink bc that can affect it also, that is what happened with me Thank you! I do not have a bad case of it, it has gotten better over the years but I still have it. I remember doing an allergy test when I was younger and I did not have any reaction to anything, do not know if I did red ink though. I had zero issues getting tattoos with dermatographia. I have over thirty all over me - the only ones I had an issue with were anything with red ink. Not sure if that is just me being allergic to the dye or actually related to dermatographia but like someone else said - everyone is different. I got 2 tattoos before I found out that I had dermatographia, an original and then a cover up. I am not sure why exactly, if it was a reaction or the fact that my artist is heavy handed, but my tattoo it very raised wherever I have solid lines. The tattoo healed great but I took longer than anticipated. If I get another one I will probably take some extra antihistamines prior to it and inform my artist. Honestly I do not want another tattoo at the moment. Like other commenters here, I have tattoos. Most of my right arm is covered and I have a chest and two back tats. When my dermatographia kicks in, I can definitely see my tattoos raise in spots and the line work itself even pops up a little (which kind of feels cool). \n\nOverall, I have had the skin issues come and go for years now with the tats and they always settle back into their regular form. Like others have said, everyone is different, but I feel like tats are perfectly fine on most people with this skin condition. I have two tattoos! I have had dermatlographia my whole life and got both last year. Some inflammation and swelling is normal for tattooing and can be worked around. I would recommend finding a tattoo artist who will sit down with you and talk to you about it and help make a plan together and to get a small tattoo in a hideable place as a test before commiting to something big and visable. The main issue is that your tattoo may be itchier than for most people, and you have to avoid scratching it. Running water over the tattoo, using ice on it, and blowing on it with a hair dryer on low are all things that might help with the itching, but if you do not think you can avoid scratching that is the one reason I would at do not go for it. Oh wow! My tattoo lines pop up sometimes too, I did not realise that was the cause. Right? I am not super sure that is the cause because I feel like I can remember a time before dermatographia where my line work would raise up by itself sometimes (similar to when you get goosebumps). But nowadays they definitely raise up during the itching. I have had it sense infancy so I do not have any expirance of tattoos before. Its really interesting the crazy things our bodies do. I had no issues! I do not ever get color though so can only speak to black and grey! Took Zyrtec in the morning and again that night. Got two last weekend :) they are healing exceptionally well, actually.", "Cutting alcohol after long term consumption? Hi, I have been posting a lot this week, haha. It is kind of taken over my life and majorly affecting my sleep so I am desperate for relief. \n\nI know it could have come out of nowhere. But something I see mentioned pretty often is symptoms being triggered by alcohol. This sounds really bad when I write it down but I have had at least 2-3 alcoholic drinks every day for the past 10 months. Not enough to make me drunk, just to take the edge off 2020 I guess. \n\nI decided to cut out the drinking 100% (right before Christmas and New Years \ud83d\ude29). I was wondering if anyone else has done this, did it help, and how long until you noticed results. \n\nThank you so much. I was an alcoholic too. Every time I drank, my itching and hives became uncontrollable even after taking my anti-histamines. But sleeplessness had a much worse effect than alcohol. Quitting alcohol has lessened my symptoms.but did not cure it completely as, it was not the cause of the problem. It only made it worse in my case. I also have dermatographia and I have never really consumed alcohol super super regularly. \n\nNever everyday of the week for a prolonged periods of time etc.\n\nDo not get me wrong I am Irish and I did a shit ton of drinking in 1st year of college but I am think I had it before then. \n\nIt has just gotten worse since. \n\nCoincidence?\nCausation?\n\nI really do not know but interesting thought.\n\nPersonally I wonder if it has something to do with exposure to Glyphosate. There is some evidence to exposure causing skin issues but I do not know if it would include Dermatographia or not.\n\nMy guess is it does but I could be wrong No. Reducing alcohol and sugar consumption made a huge difference for me. I stopped drinking about a year ago (unrelated to this) but it really has dramatically lessened my symptoms Changing my diet in general helped a lot, that includes a very reduced alcohol consumption ( You can expect the effects of alcohol consumption make things worst or in your case ...begin... with dermatographia (which btw is a tell tale sign of a mast cell disorder) especially if the dermatographia is onset. ( That is really interesting. \n\nThank you for the info I have noticed noticed alcohol making my dermatographia worse", "Pretty sure I have Dermatographia after getting covid booster. Hi all. I got my Moderna booster on the 11th. Besides a sore arm after my first 2 doses, I had no side effects. Even after my booster, I felt fine. \n\nMy rash/hives started on the 22nd after a stressful/emotional weekend..I thought I just had a stress rash. It started off small.. it was a patch at first, not streaks.  I got a virtual visit with a doctor because my ears started to swell and I thought I was having an allergic reaction to something. She thought I was just having a generalized allergic reaction to something since I have never been allergic to anything and besides extra stress, nothing in my life changed (and the booster, but that did not click). \n\nI took Methylprednisolone with no help.. went to an urgent care and that doctor thought I had Atopic Dermatitis. Put me on Prednisone. I have also been taking zyrtec in the day and benadryl at night. I do not notice Prednisone helping..\n\nMy rash confused me because it was streaks and patches. It would show up without me touching my body. I overlooked all of the Dermatographia articles. Then today I finally experimented and wrote into my skin purposely and sure enough, the design appeared shortly. \n\nI am going to try to get into see my doctor tomorrow, but I am really hoping this gets better soon. It is so frustrating! \n\nI would still get the booster if given the choice again, but ugggghhhhh. \n\nSorry to all that are dealing with this! Any tips on getting it under control are welcome! Especially when it comes to getting it on my face.", "Will it ever go away? I was diagnosed with dermatographia when I was merely 8 years old, I am 16 now. It is recently been getting worse over the past couple days, but only on my face. It is occurring out of nowhere; no recognition of me scratching my face or anything. Will I ever out grow this condition? It was cool at first (minus the burning and itching), but now it is just annoying with everyone always asking about it. Thoughts? Lots of ppl in this group has been dealing with this condition for 10+ years. Some say it comes and goes but it is always there. I have been dealing with mine for about 3 months I have already decided to get ready for the long haul. I have had it for as long as I can remember, since I was around 5. I am 35 now. My 14 year old son has had this since he was a toddler... I am guessing he will always have it. Nothing otc helps him. It might go away, might not. I have lived with it for about 10 years and expect to have it for life. Did not know what it was for the first 6 years, just treated my strange itching condition with micro-doses of OTC Zyrtec. It is pretty cheap, thankfully, and I did not need much to find relief. Weened myself off it a few years ago though. \n\nIf you have not already, you might want to see a dermatologist and nutritionist. Many people have found relief by altering their diet. I recommend avoiding anti-histamine meds as much as possible, just because it sucks to be dependent on them. \n\nIn any case, just try your best to ignore the occasional itching/burning fits. There will be times when it will drive you insane, but training yourself to ignore it will make you stronger. Best wishes to you! I was never diagnosed but I have had it as long as I can remember. Anyway, 30 years later, over the counter zyrtec helps a lot (and also with allergies and sleeping in general as it is drowsey). But as others mentioned, I try not to take it too often because I do not want to become dependent on it. I was 8 when I started noticing it and I am 22 now. It goes in waves of severity but I have accepted it will always be a fun fact about me What do you mean by be dependent on them? I have a bottle of Zyrtec would it be bad to take it every day?", "Dermatographia from withdrawal? Basically I have been withdrawing from medication (mirtazapine) which is known to also be an H1 antagonist. I think I have always had a mild form of dermatographia, but it was never THIS BAD. Only symptoms are just when I scratch my skin turns red in a couple seconds. Stays for maybe up to 5 minutes. Sometimes when I scratch real fuckin hard a small portion will stay red for maybe a couple hours. No welts tho, but my skin is also now dry as hell. When I was on medication I had no issues whatsoever. Not sure what to do I am assuming you stopped taking it on the advice of your doctor, I think you should call them about this. It is unusual since you would expect this to have happened when you were on it, but I can relate because I get side effects (often bizarre and long lasting) from almost anything I am prescribed and my skin is super sensitive to everything. Have you tried taking an antihistamine yet? I am not sure how soon you could see your doctor, a pharmacist can be a good resource in the meantime, especially since it is the weekend. I would not leave this if it is not improving, I hope this helps.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add (saying this in the voice of my husband because he is always reminding me): \"DO NOT SCRATCH!\" I also forgot to ask if you could put an update if you find out why this happened. Good luck. \ud83d\udc4d How is it bizarre? I was basically on a antihistamine for sleep, and now my original condition is returning. I have talked to my doc plenty of times and it is pretty normal. ?? I said MY side effects are always bizarre. If your doctor said everything is okay that is good news. In your original post you said you were not sure what to do, so I thought you had not been able to see a doctor yet. Ahhh ok. I guess I am just anxious about it. I guess it just startled me, but I will probably go to another doc for another opinion. That is okay, I hope everything turns out alright.", "Can HPV cause dermagraphism Anyone here with symptoms starting around HPV diagnoses ?", "For those who got this condition following the Moderna booster, what was your combination of shots taken? Did you get moderna for all 3 times, get J&amp;J initially and then the moderna booster, etc.\nJust wanted to get an idea if one vaccine cocktail tends to cause this more than others. I have mild dermatographia since before covid was a thing, just took my 3rd moderna shot (booster) and am mildly convinced that it might make my condition worse", "Question A couple years ago I was diagnosed with Dermatographia. After a couple of month it mostly went away. \n\nRecently it is been acting up again, and after looking more into Dermatographia I am not sure if I have been diagnosed correctly. I itch all the time and in random spots (goes away when I take antihistamines), and when I touch my skin, even with almost no pressure at all, I get red/white marks where I touched it. Looking at pictures of other people with Dermatographia their marks always seem to also have bumps/swelling, the place where they touched is elevated above the surrounding skin. With me it is just the red/white coloration and the itching. \n\nIs it possible I have been misdiagnosed? Or is it just a more minor Dermatographia?\n( Probably just more of a minor version, I mean really any instance of touching the skin and ig results in redness and or hives could would be considered dermatographia or dermatographism", "Sleeping is difficult with this condition As my body presses on the mattress, that area heats up and with the pressure of laying there I am  highly likely to develop rashes middle of the night making it really hard to stay asleep.\n\nIf it is really humid that helps but I live in a dry climate. \n\nHas anyone found any way to improve their sleep short of taking anti-histamines?", "Moderate-severe dermatographia after moderna booster I developed dermatographia 10 days after my moderna booster. It is pretty bad. I went to see my dermatologist 5 days after it begun. I was started on prednisone. 40mg x5 days and then tapered to 20mgx5 days. It helped the hives, but did not take away the dermatographia (which I was okay living with). After I was done with the 10 days of pred the hives came back in full force. Now I am on 10mg of pred for 10 days. The itching is worse at night. I am hoping that as the booster starts to wear off, the dermatographia and hives will start to taper. I am so PRO-Vaccine and I am very disheartened by this response my body has produced. I work in the health field so I feel it is my duty to stay vaccinated per CDC guidelines and I am going to look into a possible Pfizer vaccine booster if a 4th shot is required. \n\nMy med regimen starts in the morning with an Allegra, prednisone tablet and a Pepcid. I take one xyzal at lunch and was also prescribed hydroxzine before bed. This all started on November 11th. So it is been about one month of this and I am very discouraged. I honestly feel it has not improved since first onset. If things do improve I will update this post for others who are curious.", "I think I may have dermatographia \ud83d\ude15 It started several years ago, seemingly out of no where.  I went to the doctor and they just asked if I had changed my soap or detergent or eating habits to which I said no.  I requested allergy testing and they wouldnt do it. \nAfter a while it went away for a year or so then started happening again. \n\nI get small bumps after being touched and they itch like crazy. The only way I can stop the itching is just to scratch it until it stops itching and another area will start to itch. \n\nI get it pretty much any where. Arms and legs, back, chest/stomach, butt and groin. Occasionally on my face or neck.  I get really red and welts appear where I have scratched but they seem to go away within 15 to 30 minutes.  \n\nI have spent years now dealing with this not knowing what was happening until I came across this on google recently. I think this might be what I have. \n\nIt is been a daily thing for me recently. It gets worse at night when I go to lay down and after I remove my clothing. It is been happening at work though and it is really embarrassing but I cant help but scratch it. Then I am all red and bumpy and look diseased.\n\nHow do yall deal with this ? Has anyone ever had a medical professional do any thing for you? I went to the ER once.for something unrelated and showed the male nurse and he took a writing pen with it unclicked and made a line down my back and a welt appeared. He said, woah, I have never seen anything like that before. They gave me a benadryl and made me stay an hour to make sure it went away and then let me go.\n\nPeople ask me about what is wrong with me or tell me to stop scratching that I am only making it worse, but the itchiness is so intense it feels like needle pricks on the bumps and if I do not scratch, my muscles involuntarily spasm until I scratch the itch. \n\nI will post a pic if I can figure out how to. Yup. Sounds like dermatographia. Such a random a** and unnecessary and annoying disease to have. Like why you got to be allergic to everything \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnyways, i would advice an allergy test, but the issue with that would be is that your skin will react to everything, so maybe a blood allergy test. I do not know the details for that myself, but planning on asking my doctor for a referral. \n\nAntihistamine help. I like cetrizine all day, because it keeps my skin under control all day. I still get red, but the itch isnt too bad BUT for me it causes drowsiness. Even the non drowsy kind. So give it a try it might work for you. But if it doesnt try something else. At this point its all trial and error with allergy meds. Other than that get aloe gel, it helps calm down those nasty itchy spots. Immeduate relief it the gel is cold. Icing the spots help too.\n\nHope you feel better! Same... dermatologist prescribed OTC Allegra 180mg 2x a day for about 3 weeks.  Now I just take 1 a day.  Also a steroid cream to clear up the itchy spots.  She said it may come and go with the seasons.  Basically it is a build up of histamine in the skin. That sounds just like when I got it. I was in college and would have nights crying in bed out of frustration. Doctors kept giving me allergy meds that put me to sleep, which is not really an option when you have to be in classes all day. I did end up going to a dermatologist though, and he diagnosed me immediately.\n\nFind your antihistamine. For me it is Zyrtec, pop one a day and I barely notice any symptoms. Claritin was not strong enough, and Allegra put me in a super weird semi-hallucinatory state. Hopefully an antihistamine is all you need! Any update??? How are you now?", "Just wanted to introduce myself to this subreddit, I just developed this recently  Welcome to the club.

Ibreak into really bad itching fits, so bad I bleed. Help. My skin burns and itches so bad and it happens out of nowhere sometimes. Today shopping my arm looked terrible and I tried to contain my scratching while in the checkout line. I was aware people were watching assuming I have scabies for something. At times, like right now, its my shoulders and head. It looks like I have lice the way I am scratching. \n\nWhat should I do?? I take two 24 hour Claritin and Singular everyday on top Benedryl as needed. That is what we found worked for me. I still get breakouts, but not nearly as bad. Talk to your physician on other safe medications for you if you choose to go that route. I have found that one Zyrtec a day works well for me. I just met with an allergist who recommended at least one nondrowsy antihistamine a day, but I could take up to 3 a day. She also talked to me about stronger medications in the immunosuppressive and corticosteroid families of drugs that can be used in extreme cases.  Try out different nondrowsy antihistamines and find which one works for you. Personally Zyrtec is the one that is best for me, but there are a few options (Claritin, Allegra, Zyrtec).  She recommended staying away from sedating antihistamines such as Benadryl unless it is at bedtime (one at bedtime and increase the dose over 1-2 weeks until you can sleep through the night without itching).I would find a good allergist and talk with them. Also, avoiding hot showers and activities that increase core body temp can help. She gave me so much insight into this disease and what the treatment options can be. Best of luck, I know how bad this can get... I have had episodes that were pretty debilitating as well. Yes this! I have done the same thing for years. However, after about a year of taking Zyrtec, my breakouts started to get worse and worse, especially when my pill would start to wear off. My doctor told me I was essentially having Zyrtec withdrawls, and recommended Xyzal, which is what I take now. It is essentially the same thing, but \u201ccleaner\u201d (according to my doctor) and so far, so withdrawls! I use the spray on aquaphor!

I get really bad colds during the winter that leave me bed ridden so I was wondering if perhaps this has something to do with it. And if I was to get CoVid would it be worse? No, in theory I do not see why that would be the case. Autoimmune is essentially an overactive immune system. The only risk is if your autoimmune disease is treated with immunosuppressive drugs that make your immune system weaker. Antihistamines are not immunosuppressive so it should not have any effect on Covid-19\n\nIf anyone has evidence otherwise then I am happy to learn and be corrected\n\nEdit: oh I should add that the deadly part of covid is often the cytokine storm caused by the immune system kicking into overdrive resulting in excess inflammation. However Dermatographia is thought to me more of an allergic, IgE mediated, response which is a totally different pathway. So the two cannot really be conflated I think this response is unintentionally misleading. There is so much we do not know about Covid 19 and there is not a universal understanding of what causes all cases of  dermatographia. Original poster- please take extra precautions. This is just based on my personal experience and basic readings but... I know what happened to me and what I felt.... and am still dealing with.

I have been on it a month now, thinking about going off of it for a while... I do not have many side effects. I take one xyzal at night. The Pepcid makes things maybe slightly more gassy but it is mild. \n\nMy allergist said I could go up to 4 x the regular dose for xyzal (so up to 2 pills in am and again at pm) and 2 pills a day for Pepcid, and said that was ok for long term. It possible more xyzal would make me drowsy, but I do not feel that I have needed more at this time. How long of being on stuff before you saw results? Was it immediate? When I take anti-histamines.. nothing really seems to happen but maybe I should try it for more than a day?SOS.. so itchy I can see effects a couple hours after taking the meds. Antihistamines like zyrtec or xyzal help some (reduce swelling/welts) but red marks are still bright and noticeable with those by themselves. Adding the Pepcid on top makes a more noticeable difference - I can brush my hands against things that would have caused marks before, and no longer get a mark at all, or a very light one, when I add the Pepcid.", "Is this dermatographia???

I was recently diagnosed with this, I seem to get it occasionally, maybe 3x/week. It is awful! I have a very stressful job and I changed nothing, have never been on allergy meds my whole life only as an adult (28 now). It usually flares up after work when I remove my clothes, sometimes as work. I just got prescribed Hydroxyzine. Anyone have any recommendations for it in relation to stress? I cannot take the hydroxyzine before work, it makes me too groggy for the job. Zyrtec or the generic cetirizine Helps quite a bit. you can buy it at the store. it is pretty non-drowsy. Stress, heat, light touch, cold, hot water, cold water, sweat, the wind blowing during a full moon while I am sitting at home...everything. \n\nzyrtec helps! \n\nAlso, the last few months I have been taking Vital Proteins Collagen (the blue package powder) in my coffee and I found that helps me too! I do not need to take Zyrtec at exactly 24 hours. I stopped taking the collagen for a few weeks and it came back. So it helped me. Stress yes, I have learned to endure the itchiness because I have heard antihistamines can cause prostate problems in the long run. Both Xyzal and Allegra have worked for me Yes! I tend to get it on the underside of my forearms, so I thought it was the gloves. Turned out the job was just stressful and that is what was causing it.

On a more positive side it could be ice-breaking explaining how it is like living with that for years. \n\nI have been trying to keep my stress levels low like exercising more often, going to places I love (eg a cafe near my apartment) or the tea store, as well as colouring letting go all the stress.

Im not sure what the cause of this is. I have been taking a really old pre workout and have used the tanning bed a couple times last week but that is pretty much the only possible triggers I can think of. Now I am taking medicine (Zyrtec and prednisone) to try and calm the symptoms. \n\nIs this something that is going to be for life? Has anyone ever had it for just a short stint and then is fine? Everything else I read everyone just talks about having it for years.  Maybe? None of us even know truthfully. Take an antihistamine, find a dermatologist and that will at least help you. As much as I wish I could say it is temporary, it has not been for me. I have some friends/family with pretty mild dermatographia and does not have too many symptoms so it is basically like random flare ups. I have heard people say it comes and goes, you grow out of it etc but I think there is too much that can effect it. With me I randomly got it in middle school, never been formally diagnosed just told to take Zyrtec basically. I have occasional flare ups that do not last too long thankfully. Overall I keep it pretty controlled with meds but I read diet can help with it. And I recently found out that there is this anti itch medicine/gel by benedryl which works great if you might not want to take allergy meds daily due to them being drowsy. I have had the same experience. When I was first diagnosed, I was not a functioning adult without antihistamines. Now my flare ups happen for a week or so, maybe 2-3 times a year. I know my triggers (mostly just the summer season in general), and can pop a Zyrtec when I feel it coming on. \n\nHoping it is as mild for you!  I just got it a few days ago I think. Everything itches. And everything turns red when i itch or rub it. I have been taking Zyrtec in the mornings and Benadryl at night.  Thank you! I am hoping that is the case for me too. \n\nDoes sun exposure make it worse?  For me it is just the heat. Hot weather irritates my skin very quickly.  I had it for a couple years and then it went away. I do not  know why it started or why it ended, or if it will come back.", "Fasting and dermatographia Currently I take a Zyrtec in the morning and one at night and it controls the itchiness but not the welts. I have started alternate day fasting and the days I am fasted I have had a complete lack of symptoms and to top it off, on days I am not fasting and I manage to keep my protein low (say under 15% of calories) I do not have any symptoms either.\n\nAnyone have any ideas why this happens? Has anyone else seen something similar? I would guess that the dermatographia was triggered by something you were eating. Have you had allergy panels done? Probably should have added that when tested I did not show any food allergies. (It is been at least 10 years since I have been tested and dermatographia has only been been a thing for me for maybe three years or so.) hmm I wonder if it could be hormonal. I know when a person is in a fasting state hormones veer off of their normal trajectory. \n\nI have posted on reddit before about how I have PCOS, which is hormonal, and one day I took a Plan B, also hormonal, and my dermatographia went away for a whole day...a mystery. That would be amazing. It might be worth getting a blood panel on fasted/nonfasted days to see what differences show. for sure! Since the reaction produces hives (urticaria) whatever causes it releases histamines and causes swelling. Avoiding anti inflammatory foods (or all food lmao) would reduce the degree of swelling. So like dairy and red meat since they have saturated fat would increase your levels of inflammation. Intense stress makes it worse too since that produces cortisol. You make an interesting point that I did not think of. I have been trying food diary-ing in preparation for a doc\u2019s appt about my dermatographia and I noticed that since I have increased my fresh veggie/fruit intake (and therefore, for me, decreased meat consumption and some other processed foods), my symptoms have been almost entirely at bay. My allergist told me to avoid foods that are high in salicylates and histamines and ever since I have, my dermatographia is like night and day. I also take a vitamin D supplement, which I have read can help with chronic urticaria. I am not allergic to any foods either, just sensitive to the ones high in either salicylates or histamines! Yes that is why regardless of what causes dermatographia (food/material allergy etc) reducing stress via meditating or exercise and changing up your diet to limit the building materials for your body to create hives will reduce how sensitive you are. I find that if mine get worse I usually have to exercise more, or I will go strictly non dairy and non red meat for a few weeks along with half a zyrtec until I stabilize. No one has mentioned salicylates to me. Based on some of the other comments, I think I will need to start a food diary to see if I am hitting something that pushes me over.", "Behold my mum has found Antihistamine cream  Definitely let us know how well it works.

Skin is burning 24/7 and feet and hands burn the worst \ud83d\ude1e  Here is some more background. I have had whatever this for about three years and no formal diagnosis. It is not an allergic reaction as I have ruled that out with an allergist. Will be going for an allergist appointment on Monday to test for some oral allergies so I have not been able to take the medication that helps with this, which is hydroxyzine, for about 6 days to ensure accurate testing. I am wanting to get off of that medication due to trying for a baby soon and that medication can cause birth defects. I am in AGONY 24/7. I will have little bumps as well as large welts that appear even when my skin is rubbed lightly. I just want some relief \ud83d\ude2d Cetirizine (Zyrtec) helps a lot for me and a lot of people Generic Zyrtec works great for me. Kirkland allertec $18 (price will vary slightly) for 365 tablets. I do not even think about my dermatographia except sometimes I scratch my face or try to pop a pimple and people think I was attacked, but the itching is virtually nonexistent. I recommend Xyzal.  It is available over the counter and works better than Zyrtec for me. Mine is worse when I have been eating too much stuff I am allergic to (nickel and salicylates, cannot avoid 100%, but can limit enough to avoid anaphylaxis if I am careful). I am also allergic to a lot of things that are in soaps, lotions, haircare products, etc. Patch testing by a dermatologist is the only way to find out about most of those allergies, as well as nickel.\n\nI take Claritin every day. \n\nWhen I do get a flare up if dermatographia, coconut oil and cocoa butter are the only things that help. Coconut oil is the best, but is greasier than cocoa butter. \ud83d\ude02 HaHa you are doing that thing where you get an itch on your back and then scratch it further and further till you cannot reach. I know it well. Good news is there is relief and it is simple. I have had it since I was a child and I do not even think about it anymore. Sorry that you have suffered. I do not know what the cause is either. I thought food allergies or environmental. It seemed to be less severe when I went to Colorado and worse in Atlanta and Dallas. I have also done 7 day water only fasts where I stop ingesting everything but water, even medications, and by about day 3 I have no allergies or itchiness. Makes me think there is a food component. Definitely autoimmune. That is just all anecdotal experience and not scientific at all. Anyhow, best of luck to you, the allertec (Zyrtec) 100% made a difference in quality of life. I second this Spoke to a doctor about mine. He said it was not allergies which I thought it was for the longest time. He said it was mast cell activation syndrome which caused me to have dermatographism.  He told me Claritin will not work but Zyrtec or Allegra will. Zyrtec worked better foe me than Allegra. This is definitely demographia, and I am disappointed that the allergist did not recognize it. Your skin reacts every time you scratch it, or perhaps you get welts when wearing necklaces or other items that put light pressure on it? \nI am not sure, but I would think the antihistamines will be okay to take if you are trying to get pregnant. As others have said, Zyrtec is usually the most effective. \n\nIf you want professional confirmation, I would check with a dermatologist. I am kind of surprised that an allergist would not recognize it, but it is specifically a skin condition, autoimmune in nature, and a good dermatologist should recognize your symptoms right away. Mine certainly did, even the first time I met him. That is interesting, and the location difference makes sense in my experience. Heat has always been one of my strongest triggers. husband and I used to talk about moving, and I ruled out any southern states immediately. Even Pennsylvania summers are enough to make me look forward to autumn. The thought of living somewhere hot makes me want to curl up in a ball and cry 100% Cetrizine for me, costco brand (Aller-tec). I believe i pay about 12$ for 365 tabs. Zyrtec however, is ridiculously overpriced, i dont remember the exact price but its something like 1 bitcoin a tab. Im at 2 10mg a day and i dont get itchy, occasional redness but not very itchy at all. If i ever skip/miss a dose i definitely pay for it. The itchiness always starts in the palms of my hands and bottom of my feet. Ive tried all kind of of others. FYI, do not, I repeat DO NOT get any herbal remedies from mexico, they are known to put prednisone in the magic herbal blends. Mine is as extreme as yours. Without medication I burn and itch all day. I take Doxepin every night and Xyzal and Claritin twice a day. \n\nIf I miss a pill (does not matter which one) I go back to the miserable burning and itching. \n\nMy allergist is wonderful. We tried Xolair shots for a year but they did not help. Take biotin daily! Saved my skins life! I take 10,000 each night and have been for years. Every time I run out my extreme swelling comes back. It may take a couple weeks for a full effect. I use aloe.  The sunburn green gel helps me. Singulair is something to consider. Prescription necessary i go for allergy testing on wednesday so i am off zyrtec and i am also miserable. i cannot wait until the appointment so i can feel normal again I will third this. If I ever forget to take my Zyrtec or if I am like \"no, I am good, I am sure it is not as bad as I remember\" - it is a GD lie. The Zyrtec does not help the rashy part for me, but anything to stop the itching.\n\nEdit: Also, I was trying for a baby/was pregnant, and I stayed on the Zyrtec. I do know for me that stress makes things worse and baby anxiety did not help, so I was definitely struggling a little more. Famotidine helps so much. I read it is safe to take during pregnancy but check with doctor/pharmacist. Benadryl. Or walmarts equate brand, anti itch continuous spray. It has lidocaine in it so it numbs your skin in about 30 seconds. It works amazing. \n\n$3.88 at Walmart", "Do socks bother anybody else?

Without thinking I had yogurt as a snack sometime mid week and by the following day I was so itchy, red, and inflamed I could not get any work done. I have found it increases my acne and dermatographia as well. I have switched to drinking only hemp milk. I think there are some non dairy yogurt substitutes out there as well. Reducing anything you are allergic to or have an autoimmune reaction to will reduce dermatographia. I am almost totally free of dermatographia now that I have identified my allergies and removed them from my diet. Patch testing by a dermatologist was essential for me. The scratch tests my dermatologist did were not accurate and the blood tests are considered unreliable by 7 of 7 doctors I have asked. So when you did patch testing were you highly allergic? Or just showed a reaction? I showed a reaction to like 7 things but my allergist said it was not enough that I HAD to cut them out, only if I wanted to. He also said they could turn into more severe reactions over time but for now they are just irritants. Milk was on that list! I am highly allergic to nickel but the only patch I was so severely allergic that it scarred me was gold. Luckily gold is easy to avoid as it is only used to decorate sweets and in liqueur. My salicylate allergy which there was apparently no reliable test for is anaphylactic and has put me in the hospital multiple times. Alpha-gal syndrome caused my dermatographia. So I cannot eat red meat or milk products. I have never heard of that!! How were you diagnosed? Blood test for alpha-gal. I had dematopgrapia for over a year controlled with 3 zyrtec a day. I was tired of being tired, so I went to a different Dr.. She looked at All my tests. Tests for thyroid, Autoimmune, food allergies, ect. And said let us just test for this. That was it! It is a tick born illness that causes you to be allergic to a sugar found in mammal meat and mammal products like milk and even gelatin.  It does not show up on food allergy tests because they test for proteins not sugars. Fantastic.   Keep up the good work.", "Thank You! Hi all,\n\nJust wanted to say thanks to this subreddit for all the information and help. \n\nI got my first dermatographic hives in December of 2020, and it got much worse starting in February of this year. I made an appointment with my doctor after finding this subreddit and learning that it could be caused by either allergies or thyroid issues. \n\nAs someone with some serious chronic allergies, I assumed I would just find out another thing I am allergic too; however, I mentioned to my doctor how I had read online that it could be thyroid issues or allergy issues, and my amazing doc tested my Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels in the interim before I saw an allergist. \n\nLo and behold, my TSH was elevated (indicating hypothyroidism), I eventually tested positive for a large amount of TPO antibodies (indicating chronic autoimmune hypothyroidism likely caused by Hashimoto\u2019s), and I was started on Levothyroxine. Ever since starting the Levothyroxine, my dermatographia has subsided completely and I feel comfortable in my skin again. \n\nSo, again, thank you to you all for some clues on solving this medical mystery of mine, and I hope that others have some similar luck to mine from the advice given on this subreddit.

I had asthma as a kid, but after significant endurance training for track in middle school, my asthma basically went away. I have spent my teen years and my young adult life as a fairly healthy young man and my only real health issues have been seasonal allergies. Now, I suddenly have asthma symptoms returning, and it happens to coincide with my new case of dermatographia. So far an old albuterol inhaler and meditative breathing techniques have got me through it, but I was wondering if anyone else with dermatographia had suddenly begun experiencing tightness in the chest and shortness of breath, and if there were any tips or tricks you recommend for remedying or staving off those symptoms? I do not have health insurance anymore and I do not really have the luxury of doctors not knowing what to do for me.\n\nTL;DR I suddenly have asthma in addition to dermatographia and I am curious if anyone else does", "Has anyone managed to cure themselves or are we stuck like this for life? I developed this condition out of nowhere at the age of 30 and its been with me for the last 5 years. I do not want to have to live on anti histamine tablets for the rest of my life buy if my do not take them my arms and legs will go on fire. From what I read online there seems to be no cure, what do you all think? Yeah it is weird, it seems that for some it just goes away one day. I have had it since I was about 5; I am 36. I just learned to live with it instead of trying to medicate it. That sucks. I am amazed that modern medicine does not have a fix for this. They will start working on it... once its profitable. I have been able to greatly reduce and some days eliminate antihistamines by reducing alcohol and sugar intake. It is getting better for me. First diagnosed 15 years ago. Started an anti-inflammation diet back then and that helped delay the reax. Doctor advised adding anti-inflammation meds last year and that helps better than anti-histamines ever did. I randomly got it around 30 too! What are anti inflammatory meds? I take an allergy pill everyday but trying to find alternatives Ideally, ask your doctor. OTC or prescription NSAIDS and other pain relievers control inflammation. Also anti-inflammation spices in food or in capsules - cayenne, capsaicin, ginger, curcumin, onion, garlic. Those helped but BPC-157 controls my reax best. BPC's side effects can be a problem and I will probably quit taking it when the pandemic is over. side effects are very real with those meds so be careful Mine comes and goes weirdly. My doctor said it might happen. Thanks, I plan to try a complete new diet and exercise routine to see if it makes any difference. Will post results. Was there any change in your lifestyle around that time? I have learned to control the itching which was the worst part for me personally. Still sometimes it shows up but whatever, Ive learned to live with it I went through a stressful period at 29... but I am all good now and it is def less but still around :( no idea! I have no other allergies. I suddenly got this at the age of 35 as well.  It is been a year.  Only half way through did I start researching seriously because I thought it would just go away.  I did not change my diet or my environment.  I started taking Allegra and that helps A LOT but as other have said, it sucks to have to take them for the rest of your life and if I forget a day, the itches come back on full\nforce.  My problem is that I also have bad allergies to dust and stuff so my nose is always stuffed year round and Allegra does not do anything to alleviate those symptoms and it is supposed to be allergy medication. I have had it since I was 9ish, am now 24 and living in Scotland. Ive just been managing it with antihistamines, but I have noticed that mine flares up more with stress. When I was going through uni, it was particularly bad and also for a periods when I was unemployed I am going to try extended fasting and will see if it helps", "Chemical peel or am I nuts? I am scheduled for a chemical peel in 3 weeks. Has anyone who has dermagraphia had one? I will be at roughly 8 weeks from when it began after moderna booster. I am like 90 percent better but on claritan. I do think if I went off it would worsen bc it acts up when claritan due. So I hate to cancel my appt but wondering how I will react.", "Guys Need Help Here ..My skin burning and itching while mastering programming language Well it started 3 years ago and i was okay by everyday taking antistamines but from last year when i started programming it just keeps getting intense and making me uncomfortable despite i am taking antistamine so they are effectless and whenever i am off with learning programming it just gets calmy.Recently i figure out regular gym and meditation  soothes condition but it still appears while trying to coding everyday like 5-6 hours , i believe i can do it everyday easily and i am not feeling frustated at all i just want to success at some skills.what  do you guys thinking is there somebody facing this while they stressed out? i am so miserable i been gone couple of doctors and diagnosed with dermographism , and i cutted sugar,flour from my life that is not fixing the condition either after 3 weeks i need big help guys. What antihistamine are you taking? If regular antihistamine for H1 receptor is not working, try taking it with type 2 antihistamine (for H2 receptor). I am a programmer too, but I do not get that stressed out while programming. I am taking Zyrtec so its a h1 and second generation antistamine never tried h2 antistamines actually but right now looking for them.I dont feel  stressed too while coding but with combination of itching,burning and coding making me burn out in more or less 1 hour and devastating myself. 100% aloe vera gel helps. keep it in the fridge and apply as needed on those nasty itchy spots. I get random small itchy spots and cold aloe gel works wonders. Also try changing up allergy meds. you are body might have built tolerance to a particular medication. I do not have much experience with it since i have had for a month and half, BUT from whatever little research I have done, Probiotics, water and avoiding food which causes inflammation and are high in histamine (e.g red meat, alcohol, fried food, sugar, dairy, spinach, aged cheese etc) \n\nI personally cant avoid histamine rich food, because of my studies I need caffeine,sugar and dairy, but I have started probiotics and hoping to see results soon. \n\nI would also suggest discussing DOA supplements with your dermatologist/doctor and see if they could be beneficial. Firstly thank you so much for your recommendations i am considering them and will consult to my doctor asap,well cannot say i am itching partially its all over my body sadly and its persistant which is wrecking me out quietly.From my research stay away from snacks and market stuff instead of seek some healthy sugar resources like fruits,in my case my illness called Leaky Gut Syndrome which is takes 3-6 months to fix and have heal.

Share your details. I have not been to a specialist doctor since I was a child tbh but it is stuck with me through adulthood. I tested positive for all allergens they tested with except for, like, 2. After allergy shots for about 4 years it is gotten noticably harder to actually write unless I have been exposed to an allergen recently. \n\nFor treatment I just use ice packs if it is a big flare up since antihistamines mess with my sleep. So sorry.  I was lucky.... thyroid disease and no more hives with proper meds. Oh man I need to find my glasses, I thought you had drawn a swastika and the title on top of that, oh boy. Same! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "A post I made on an allergy sub along time ago. It is quite amusing to read now that I know. No one suggested Dermographia.  I hope no one gets confused by this post, it is just a picture and not an actual question. I was confused by my itching for a very long time before I finally got help from someone who recognized it for what it was and not just \"Well if the antihistamines work you should keep taking them, you do not NEED to find out what you have got if it works\" basically. Goes to show that a lot of people do not have any awareness about dermatographia. There is not a lot of research about it either. Hopefully this changes soon and we get a cure. Still nobody knows what causes dermatographia. Definitely! I hate to admit it, but the nurse was right (but for the wrong reason) in that I should \"just\" keep taking my antihistamines. At that time I was a bit annoyed and my mother in law was even a bit angry since we were not sure how bad my \"allergies\" were and that they would dismiss it like that. \n\nI would be happy with even the tiniest bit of research, or making sure that nurses and doctors know about this, no one ever questioned that this was anything other than an allergic reaction for me (especially since I have other allergies). Makes me wonder how many out there has been misdiagnosed or dismissed like I was. My allergist would not test me.  I got itchy after 4 foods and he said because I have this that I cannot have skin allergies from food. it took me a legit year to know what it is Oh that is insane. I do not get it, food allergies should be taken seriously or else it can result in a anaphylaxis. I started having reactions to citrus a year ago, and they also did not take that seriously, even if I did not have my dermographia diagnosis. How are we supposed to take things seriously and know what to look out for if doctors will not take it seriously? Yea, that allergy post I wrote was written 2019, so almost two years ago, and when I wrote it I had already had this problems for years. I honestly believe I was just lucky to come across a nurse who knew about dermographia and was able to diagnose me almost immediately. I just do not trust doctors now.  I have Endometriosis and took from 12-29 undiagnosed. Most people have not heard of it. My doctor had no idea and had to send me to an allergy specialist who diagnosed me and after revealing the diagnosis (since everyone wondered why my skin was doing that),  neither myself, my husband, or any family or friends had heard of it. I was surprised and so happy to find a sub-reddit with others since it feels so rare.", "To everyone who recently developed this after the Moderna shot, there is hope. Like a lot of you, I suddenly developed extremely annoying/prominent dermatographia a little over 2 weeks after my Moderna booster. Mine never got as severe as some people here, but basically every time I would itch or scratch myself I would get bright red hives. My clothes were suddenly giving me hives where the collar or waistband pressed, etc. I am sure we are all familiar. \n\nI saw a dermatologist who performed a very simple tic tac toe scratch test and diagnosed me. She suspected food allergies but also acknowledged it could have been from the vaccine (but stressed ANY vaccine could cause something like this). She referred me to an allergist, and I originally was not supposed to get in until Feb ... but by some miracle there was a cancellation and I got in last week. \n\nThe allergist also agreed I had dermatographia and diagnosed me with \"chronic idiopathic Urticaria\" as well. She agreed too that it could be brought about by the vaccine, and mentioned that although most people who get skin reactions from it develop them within 4 hours, there is significant research about delayed skin reactions as well. I was honestly shocked that medical professionals were validating my hypothesis that the vaccine brought it out! \n\nBut anyways, she prescribed me an extremely simple regimen that has been working very well so far. I have gone from developing weird red welts all over my stomach, neck and back all day to getting maybe one or two tiny flareups in the AM and PM. It is all stuff you can get over the counter.\n\nZyrtec 2x daily (one in the AM and one in the PM)\n\nAnd take one Pepcid/Famotidine along with one dose of Zyrtec. (She recommended nightly, but I also suffer from chronic heartburn and take prilosec, so I elected to take it in place of my prilosec in the AM instead) ---- If this is not sufficient, you can take the pepcid 2x daily instead, along with your zyrtec doses\n\nAlso, Hydrocortisone ointment as needed for bad hives.\n\nThe first day, it worked miraculously. I did not even have to use the hydrocortisone for most of the day. I could suddenly scratch my arm neck without hives appearing. I could actually ITCH without a big rash coming out. I was shocked. I did develop hives on my neck again around 12 hours after the first dose of pepcid, but I just used a bit of the cream and went to bed. Woke up with only tiny neck hives in the morning!!!! (Before, I was waking up with a full collar of red from my t shirt almost every morning)\n\nThe second day, worked excellently as well. No hives all day, and ... even better ..... I only got ONE SMALL HIVE on my wrist at night!!!\n\nAnd this morning, even though my neck itched, THERE WERE NO HIVES AT ALL ON MY NECK!!!!\n\nI am so excited!!!! I can have an itch on my waistband again and scratch it WITHOUT BREAKING OUT IN HIVES!!!! I honestly feel like singing it from the rooftops. I feel something itch on my stomach, I look at it, NO HIVES!!!!!\n\nI finally feel like things are returning to normal, and this is just with ONE dose of pepcid alongside the 2x Zyrtec. If it gets worse again I can simply take another dose. \n\nI am not a doctor, and this post is NOT medical advice, simply a journal of my experiences. If you choose to follow it, remember I am not a medical professional and take no responsibility for what happens. But I wanted to say this simple regiment has been highly effective for relieving what I feared would be a persistent and life-changing problem.\n\nI have hope again, and maybe now some of you will too.

All of this came after some mild scratching w my nail I would say it is very likely. \nI have a relatively mild case myself (hoping it stays that way) \nSometimes I do not even get itching, sometimes it just burns a bit. \nLoratidine 20mg a day has made it more manageable for me. Certirizine seems to work just as well. If it is bothersome to you, these are otc meds you could try. Oh! And mine does not raise a significant amount, just about as much as yours does in the pic You can try write your name on your skin with your nails and see if it raises like that. If it does then you probably have it. If not, I think it is just a simple scratch Yeah I have done it before and it is definitely done that. I put pretty much no effort into those scratches in the pic Usually if someone slaps me or if something scratches me I will get itchy for a while so who knows lol. If anything I have got a really mild case Yep sounds pretty like dermatographia. Some people notice swelling of their tattoos too. \nShould not be a concern if it is the only health related symptom you are experiencing. It is possible it can get worse, so pray it stays mild like mine! \nDefinitely bring it up to your primary dr on the next appointment though. Does not hurt to monitor and log. I mean I definitely have issues w anxiety, digestion issues and headaches but idk if that could even be related to this. Tbh it may not hurt to be referred to an allergist to ask if these can be histamine responses in your body. I would not be surprised if you were told no, but then started a treatment for the dermatographia and noticed improvements with other symptoms lol. That is what I am starting to think tbh. Plus I had covid a few months ago so it might even be related to that Mine started after a viral infection! So it likely has provoked that as an autoimmune response after you had covid. If this is new you may take some time to figure out your triggers. I have had it for a while even pre-covid honestly.

Hi guys\n\nI have just come to realize that I have dermatographism and sometimes severe itching throughout my body. I was wondering if you have seen a doctor and what your diagnosis was. I am scared that mine might be mastocytosis or mast cell activation disorder. \n\nThanks I got diagnosed when I was in 5th grade which was around 2010 and for me they said it was \"stress\" but I was also a 5th grader and there is not really much for a 5th grader to stress over but maybe it was the subconscious implications of my parents divorce??? \n\nBut I do not think you should be too worried but if it is really bothering you that much you should maybe just go in and ask them specifically if that should be a concern of yours. Dermatographia is very common in mast cell disorders. \n\nI have a MCD ...masto. Dermatographia appeared two weeks after a major surgery about two years ago.... I have been experiencing literal mast cell disorder he will these past few years. \n\nIt took me about about a year and a half for doctors to even consider a mast cell disorder diagnosis due to the numerous organd that mast cell disorders wreak havoc on. \n\nThat said, dermatographia is typically seen in mast cell activation syndrome, not mastocytosis.  \n\nIf you have flushing (from pretty much anything from stress/emotions to foods and alcohol), GI issues (diarrhea, large --- like mother of God, wtf did I just do stools, gastric dumping, extreme abdominal cramps - the ones that literally make you very concerned because they bring on tears), overall malaise, liver / spleen enlargement, brain fog, memory issues, interstitial cystitis .....and ultimately anaphylaxis or slow anaphylaxis symptoms, is likely to fall under the purview of a mast cell disorder. \n\nFlushing after eating anything due to histamine is likely to be a constitutional symptom of MCD. \n\nHere is a ( to read up on. \n\nSubscribe to /r/mastcelldisease to hang out and chill with your possible fellow MCD Reddit friends!", "Is this Dermatographia?

Zyrtec does it for me. When mine flares up like yours is doing, I just pop one a day and it does the trick.

This all started a week ago, I was crazy itchy and thought it was an allergic reaction to something. I scratched till my skin was red. Then 2 days ago I noticed even slight scratches left red welted marks, but they did not last too long. \n\nI am still crazy itchy, and I am self conscious because there are always red lines visible on my face. :( Hi! I also tend to scratch my face often, it is nice since it goes away within minutes or half an hour. But my employee picture has a giant red scratch across my forehead, which is not ideal but hey I am sorta like Harry Potter. If the welting does not go away try either getting rid of processed foods (I hear this works pretty well for some) or try a 24 hour antihistime/allergy pill. I avoid the 8 hour ones since they do not last as long and I usually only take those when I am having a really bad/itchy day. There is also some anti itch creams that work well I have a Benadryl one that I like to soothe the itchy stuff. Something that is useful is to notice what might set it off, pressure/foods/activities/time of day/time of year it happens, and prepare for it. But when taking the antihistimes I still scratch sometimes and it leaves red marks but it does not welt, and honestly that is good enough for me. I hope all goes well with you!

I have had full body itchiness for days now.  So after time the itch seems to die down once you get it under control (I use the generic Zyrtec since it is works best on me). I got this when I was in middle school and have had it since then so 8ish or so years now. I either got used to the general itching or it has really gone down overall. I think I have a rather normal amount of itching like \u201cnormal people\u201d or maybe a bit above average, but well within reason. I do get full body itching as well sometimes just randomly and once I itch and have a super red body it kind of dies down, I try to itch while in private and often try to refrain from it while in public/working which can be hard but I think after having it for so long I am sorta just used to it? I have occasions where I get super itchy and at those times I use the lotion/cream for itch relief or take an 8hr benedryl type pill to aid in it (just make sure it is a few hours away from your 24 hour one for overall safety). The issue is you need to change antihistimes to avoid a resistance to the medicine. Unfortunately for me the Zyrtec one is what works best for me and Claritin just does not work as well but I did not switch and I tried Allegra and that is not working that well but it is getting better after a week and a half or so.

I hope things go alright with the coffee problem ^-^ Yes! I do and like the other person said it is worse with anxiety too. Kind of correlates. I have noticed coffee gives me flare ups too.

Cannot wait for the itching to stop \ud83e\udd14be mindful of which antibiotic you were prescribed! That may be what is triggered it and you might have to avoid it in the future. I would def ask that in dermatology, but they will probably give you a good assessment. Note what makes it worse (ie heat, exercise, alcohol, etc) Yeah I know exactly what it was. Although I have taken it in the past.\nFor now only nights and touching, scraping.. Yep. Got mine after taking an antibiotic too. Have had it for two years now.\n\nI recommend ceterizine to calm the itchiness. Two years? No signs of getting better? Moisturize a lot. Preferably cream not lotion. My go to is cerave, little expensive but lasts forever.... literally you feel it on your body in the shower for 2 days \ud83d\ude02 The problem is how to moisturize my legs that are hairy as hell ahahah Unfortunately not :( I have heard many stories on here though of peoples' dermatographia disappearing so do not give up hope!

Also all names used do not apply to where I am from \ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Same story, basically, but antibiotics after a UTI a couple years ago. Welcome to the club everybody's itching to get into! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nBut in all seriousness daily Zyrtec (Cetirizine Hydrochloride) makes my life bearable. It can make you super groggy if you are not used to taking it, so definitely take it in the evening. I sometimes have to take a Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) here and there if I still have breakthrough itching. For non-drowsy, Loratadine is best I have tried, but it is definitely not as affective as the Zyrtec for me.\n\nIf you are planning to get any allergy testing you have to have not taken any antihistamines for at least 5 days, if I remember correctly, so in that case I would wait.\n\nI am itchiest at night, so if I cannot medicate for some reason getting to sleep on the early side helps me not lay awake trying not to scratch all night. Also wearing something snug, like leggings on my legs (where l get the itchiest other than palms and wrists) can help too, as can icing particularly itchy spots. YMMV.\n\nGood luck. I hope you are one of the lucky ones for whom it resolves. Loved the joke! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI just took Ceterizine and hidrated my skin trying to calm things down.

Mainly itching on my back at night tho.\n\nThank you! Just any strong antihistimine. It is a histimine reaction. But of course, seeing a derm is a good idea, too.

With looser fitted leg wear I do not so much. Could be that maybe..?  Maybe.  I have endo which makes me swell during the day.  So probably tight. I get them too.

I am currently taking the 20mg and am about to switch to 30 mg.  Honestly, even just the 10mg had helped tremendously compared to before. Before Zyrtec, I was CONSTANTLY itchy and covered in horrible hives from my clothing, heat, or scratching/rubbing my skin. Now, I am just mildly itchy in less places and instead of full-blown puffy hives, I will get red, flatter marks that are not really even itchy but this does appear pretty often. I still get occasional hives, but they are a lot more manageable. I am feeling a lot better and a lot more hopeful that this will continue to be managed and go away. How are others doing?

Do you need help deciding if you do or any advice on it? Kind of both\u2026 I only found out it was a thing this week when I started to experience symptoms so I am not sure about anything. Do you remember when it first started? How manageable is it/are you taking antihistimes for the symptoms? Any way you can see a doctor and tell them about it and get an opinion?  I would never really noticed it before just this week, at first I was getting random hives all over the place, then I started to notice a correlation between scratching and the raised lines/hives. So obviously I looked it up. It is not super bad, just really itchy sometimes\u2026 and I am not on any oral medication for it, but I have been using Caladryl. I am planning on going in to have it looked at, but I wanted to see if there was anything I could/should do beforehand to be sure that is what this is. For sure test changing your diet (often processed foods can cause more symptoms, I am still looking into this to see how correlated it is), test that for a few days and maybe try doing scratch tests before and after the caladryl (thanks I never heard of this exactly before and I may look into having some handy!) even on days where you might not feel itchy or have hives just to see how the skin reacts. There were no changes between your life the week before this to now, depending on location, spring may be starting, some people have this as a seasonal thing (I do not know how it works but just reading some personal stories about it this is a thing as well). I say if the itchy feeling that happens sometimes/often along with any kind of pressure causing the welt/raised skin/red skin is a pretty good indication of this. Of course I am not a doctor just someone who has been living with this for 8-10+ years, and I recommend going to a doctor to make sure even just casually mentioning it during a check up to see if they would agree with how you feel. If it becomes a little less manageable antihistimes are helpful (I recommend the 24 hour ones since I usually do well with those and it covers a day rather than the 8 hours that I only take supplementally when I am having a really itchy day, but do not take them too close in time to each other make sure they are hours apart).

I have to take daily medication anyway, so the added antihistamine is no big deal. Eventually it just becomes a part of your routine. I know a lot of people are not down for being on meds tho.

My entire life, up until a week ago \ud83d\ude02) when I used to have a mild itch, absent-mindedly scratch it, and that was the end of it.

Initially I did not connect waxing to the blistery things but I have realised it is probably that. \n\nJust remembered that it is also happened down there aswell when I wax lol. \n\nSo I am thinking that it is a combo of waxing and dermatographia?

It could be helpful just to rule out any autoimmune issues.

I have not had to take antihistamines for dermatographia for nearly 5 years now, after taking Zyrtec everyday for the preceding 5 years. **I am fairly confident probiotics were what helped me.**\n\nI first started experiencing dermatographia in 2010. Came out of nowhere. My girlfriend at the time would point out all these red scratch marks on me. Then I figured out I could draw on my skin. I drew dicks, of course. It was kind of fun. But then it was not fun. I would get this profound full body itch. I started taking Zyrtec everyday, but that was making me drowsy so I switched to a less potent antihistamine. \n\nI took those damn things everyday for nearly 5 years. I accidently blacked the fuck out too one night when I went out drinking not realizing Zyrtec and booze should never be mixed. \n\nIn the beginning I thought maybe it was an adverse reaction to the Gardasil vaccine. Finished the 3 shot vaccination in 2010 shortly before I started experiencing symptoms from dermatographia. But I could find no evidence to suggest dermatographia as a potential adverse side effect from the vaccine. So I went on living life, just accepting that I would be taking a daily antihistamine.\n\nThen in 2015 I went on a little health kick. Decided to throw a daily probiotic supplement into the mix. I have some other health concerns I thought they might help with; decision to buy them was in no way meant to try to treat dermatographia. And after a couple weeks/months, I noticed I was not as itchy. I became more adventurous, taking a Zyrtec once a week. Then I just stopped taking antihistamines altogether. \n\nIt was only just in the last couple years or so that I remembered I had a C Diff infection back in 2009. Was put on 3 different antibiotic regimens. I was shitting water for months. Truly awful experience. Took a great while for my stomach to feel \"normal\" again. Think I am still recovering to be honest. Piecing together the timeline of events, I realized my dermatographia may have stemmed from the utter havoc that those antibiotics wreaked on my gut. \n\nLet me be abundantly clear. **I am not a medical doctor. I am in no way qualified to be providing anyone with medical advice. Get your doctors input before you do anything.** In speaking with some MD friends, they felt there is a nonzero chance my self-diagnosis is accurate. It is really hard to tell with any certainty that if taking probiotics *actually* helped me, but it is not impossible. Gut bacteria is suppose to be a big deal. I would not be surprised if that was what helped you so much. yeah its strange, I feel like it gets worse and better in waves idk. Right now for some reason my Zrytec seems to not really be working as of recent. Maybe its the generic one im using instead of the regular but that should not make a difference. Right now my dermatographia is definitely worse because im getting redness on places like my palms which I usually dont. Its usually more easily triggered right now as well. I feel like I have a lot of excess inflammation in my body rn and I wonder if maybe I had covid or something that provoked that. So did you have or have you recently had any health issues? And no, you cannot really \"grow\" out of it, but for some it just goes away steadily or even often randomly at some point for some people. Nah no recent health issues. It is probably just the southern heat making it worse. I have had several other allergies phase out over time, I was just hoping this one would have too by now. yeah this is really interesting, recently I had some GI issues, not sure why, but now my body seems much more inflamed and my derm. is worse. I need to get back on some good probiotics again I suppose. Flora plays a big role in regulating inflammation. A lot of people on here seem to have noticed the antibiotic and dermatographia connection, I feel like mine may have came on also after I went on 3 rounds of antibiotics around 8 or so years ago for Scarlet Fever. Will let you know. 4 years so far i had it for a while and i am not sure if it is connected but when i lost a bit of weight it seemed to have gone away as my skin no longer pops up went to the derm when i was 14-15... said usually it goes away as quickly as it appears. now im 27 and still have it. the only time it actually seems to be \"better\" is when im tan, i tan very easily so usually in the summer its better, winter is horrible.

It was horrible for me but I did not know it was not normal to itch like that. I would start scratching and it would grow. I would stop for as long as I could and then give in to the sweet sweet release of scratching.  Slowly I would scratch and creep scratch to my back and get to places I could not reach, so annoying.. I remember many nights miserable in bed with itching. Over time I learned to just itch and let it be like a damn meditation practice. Growing up people would draw on me at pool parties. Through teenage years I would have occasional bouts of itching especially when frustrated or stressed or anxiety scratching but mostly I just got used to it. Once I found Allegra and now generic Zyrtec from Costco ftw, I do not itch anymore. The annoying thing is it completely went away for my sister and she had it way worse than me. Her welts were fattys, mine get big but I remember hers being much more thicc. She moved to the north east for college and stayed and they went away. I am in Texas. Anyway the only time it comes up now is when a barber or massage therapist starts apologizing and im like, \u201cyeah my skin does that, no worries.\u201d Or when I ever so slightly, completely unknowingly scratch my face and later someone looks at me like, \u201coh my god are you ok, what happened to your face?\u201d And I am like, \u201cwhat, oh I guess I scratched it barely at some point, or like just tried on a shirt and the price tag grazed me, it will go away.\u201d And they are like \u201care you sure, you should get that checked out?\u201d And I am like \u201cyou know what, you are right call 911, I was just attacked by a mountain lion and I am trying to play it off..\u201d we have fun.

Now with insurance best of luck to you. As I have shared multiple times get blood test and skin testing for allergies.  Thyroid panels  for high antibodies.

At the end of my rope.  Me (Healthy and active 24 M, 6'2'' 180lb) am dealing with a list of symptoms that seem to all be related to internal inflammation of some kind. I have spent bookoo money and time trying to figure out a root cause, but everyone has been calling this idiopathic... I am coming to accept that maybe that is the case, but I am suffering and cannot seem to accept that as a diagnosis. \n\n**Backstory**\n\nThis February, I got pityriasis rosea ( self limiting virus, not much known, but skin breaks out in red splotches and dots all over your chest, back, and body).  I went to Europe for 3 weeks in March (vacation), pityriasis rosea almost gone, then broke out again for a short time when I returned home (this is not typical behavior for the virus). (note) I was sexually active with a girl while in Europe. We used protection, but I performed oral sex once (obvi unprotected). \n\nAfter the flare up calmed when I returned home. A week later, I began to itch inside of my thighs. Over the next month, I began breaking out in patches of hives all over my body, arms, legs, abdomen. It seemed random, but i finally realized it was dermatographia. I immediately went gluten and dairy free. I have been dealing with the symptoms ever since. They do not seem to go away, but slightly improve or get worse based on certain triggers. \n\nI started seeing an Integrative Physician who put me on herbs, acupuncture, ran some blood test (more on that below). I have since stopped seeing her because after 3 months, I did not see improvement. (Medical herbs are expensive AF). \n\n**SYMPTOMS:**\u00a0\n\n\\- Dermatographia - Skin raising with hives and redness from touch. Very itchy at night and random moments throughout the day.\u00a0\n\n\\- Daily random feelings of heartburn, chest / back / shoulder tightness\n\n\\- Feeling of Dyspnea, Shortness of breath every day. \n\n\\- Neck and collar bone tightness / pain.\u00a0j\n\n\\- My gums on top and bottom row turned white....Have been like this for months. \n\n\\- Vision sometimes obscured / loss of focus\n\n\\- Spots of bruising on legs - Quarter size Yellow spots where I do not remember being hit.\n\n\\- Weird flare up of tiny hives on my feet near my toes. Seems to go away if I use antifungal cream, but I do not think its fungal to begin with. \n\n**Treatment ( Integrative physician )**\n\n\\- Various chines herbs meant to support immune system, detox, and blood support. Heavy Vitamin D and C supplements.\u00a0\n\n\\- Gluten and Dairy Free diet to reduce inflammation.\u00a0\n\n\\- Acupuncture\u00a0\n\n**Treatment (Allergist)**\n\n\\- Hydroxyzine every night before Bed\n\n\\- Allegra during the day\n\n\\- Prednizone (steroid) for 3 weeks (This brought down skin inflammation while I took it, but returned after I stopped). \n\n\\- Had various allergy tests, none of which pointed to something in my environment or food that could be causing these skin issues. \n\n\\- Only thing I showed high allergy response to was dustmites. \n\n**Other notes.**\n\n\\- Integrative Physician told me I am showing markers for Lyme's disease and Epstein Barr.\u00a0Neither of which have \"Recent\" Antibodies, only antibodies from years ago. \n\n\\- I am only showing one marker of lymes. Should I get tested for other infections or diseases that set off that same marker? (I know hepatitis and syphilis can setoff the same marker).\u00a0\n\n\\- I worred that some of these symptoms were parallel to symptoms of lymphoma. My CBC, physician, and chest X-Ray points to \"no\". \n\n\\- Should I be looking at a different approach to treatment? I have seen very low success rates of individuals going on extended antibiotic treatments. I also want to retain my gut health since my immunse system is the best guard against something chronic like this.... Well the most concerning things are you are shortness of breath, gum color change, vision loss, and bruising. The itchiness sounds like it could be dermatographia but the other symptoms sound like something else. The toe hives/itchiness sounds fungal but just gets more irritated because of your dermatographia or overall itchiness. I have had chronic lyme and I have dermatographia. I also work in the medical field. Lyme can mimic many other diseases but I have not heard of it causing significant bruising (it can cause your other symptoms though). But if  you do not have all three markers for it you most likely do not have an active lyme infection. I would most definitely get tested for other diseases with similar biomarkers. Did the symptoms (the more concerning ones) occur after your trip to Europe? Maybe explore autoimmune diseases? You can get an ANA test done to rule out some of them. Did the dermatographia-like symptoms occur after you are Europe trip? If so you might want to consider scabies as a possible cause. I would recommend going to a dermatologist and rheumatologist. If it truly is dermatographia then a gluten free diet probably will not help (unless you have celiacs). I would not think removing dairy would help either unless you have noticed that it causes you to be more inflamed. A generally healthy diet can help. I would recommend not using any detergents, soaps with any perfumes or dyes. I use an organic shampoo that makes a huge difference. I believe most organic stuff (soaps, shampoos, makeup) is BS but it has actually really helped with my itchiness. I hope your find out what is going on. I was almost crippled with lyme disease for years before they found out what it was. This was back when the testing was not as refined. I know how difficult it is being sick with no explanation. i believe it can be Leaky Gut try leaky gut diet which related to dermographism hope the condition woild be pass soon. Okay,\n\nSo all of the above mentioned may have given me a small breakthrough that I have not considered yet...\n\nI have not done any research on Scabies before, but after looking, the rash and bumps on my feet look EXACTLY like the pictures I see online from other folks who have suffered....I have been able to tame it before with anti fungal creme and tea tree oil, but the fact that it keeps returning makes me wonder if I need to treat for scabies, to actually kill the mites. \n\nThe other thing that leads me to believe this may be a cause, is that the only two markers on my allergy (blood tests) that tested Class IV (very high) were for pteronyssinus and farinae.... a.k.a Dustmites...\n\nI cannot believe I overlooked this. \n\nYour response was extremely helpful, so I would obviously love to hear what you think about that discovery. I did stay in a lot of hostels during my trip in Europe, we found bed bugs in one, so I am obviously aware I could have been in a situation where Dust Mites were present. \n\nIs it possible that my other symptoms, not linked directly to a possible scabies infection, are resulting from high inflammation due to this allergy? I have a slightly under normal Hemoglobin level, which I am not sure of the cause. I have not eaten red meat in years, so I have been told by my physician I should try.... You need to get treatment for scabies for it to go away. I would recommend a dermatologist or maybe if you mention it to a primary care doctor they will prescribe you the medication. I believe when you treat you must simultaneously wash all your clothes, sheets, etc. I am not sure about your other symptoms being related to scabies. The other symptoms are a little extreme but having a potential skin mite infestation for months is also taxing on the body. What is your hemoglobin level? If you were iron deficient enough to effect your hemoglobin usually your CBC would be a little off (low RBCs, low MCV, and low hemoglobin) I am away from home for the next 2 plus weeks. I will be calling my PCP on Monday to see if they can send a prescription to a pharmacy in Seattle for me to pickup. Apparently, there are no over the counter medications available for Scabies. Crossing my fingers that I might see some improvement. \n\nMy hemoglobin A1C level was 4.2 in June. (Normal Range 4.8 to 5.6) \n\nMy CBC was totally normal, and so were my vitamin levels. (b12 was normal, but at the lower end). \n\nSince, I have taken daily B12, D, Iron, Multi, B6 vitamins.\n\nMy A/G ratio was just over the normal range (2.3) Not really sure what this measures. Maybe some insight? \n\nI also tested positive for EBV (which I know everyone has) My integrative physician said this could be causing me issues, but I did not show any RECENT antibodies to the virus, so I was hardpressed to believe her. I think I got it back in Highschool.... Sounds like a mast cell disorder. Mast cell activation/cutaneous mastocytosis/systemic mastocytosis. \n\nPityriasis rosea can be misdiagnosed for cutaneous mastocytosis. \n\nHave you had a tryptase test done? Your hemoglobin A1C is related to blood sugar. Above 5.6 and your diabetic. Essentially the higher your blood sugar the more sugar attaches to your hemoglobin. This sugar is measurable and is a good indicator of blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. It much different than your blood hemoglobin level. It would be part of the CBC. If your CBC was normal, your hemoglobin level is normal. \n\nI would not take iron supplements unless you know you are anemic (again your CBC would be off). Your body does not get rid of excess iron like other vitamins. Too much iron is a bad thing. \n\nYour A/G ratio is your blood proteins. If it is slightly high it could be as simple as you were a little dehydrated on the day of the test. \n\nEBV can reactivate but I think it is more common I. Those with severely compromised immune systems. I would think the symptoms would be similar to the ones you had when you were initially infected, which seem different than what is going on now. I have not had a tryptase done. Is that something I can ask my allergist to perscribe? His methodology has been \" we need to knock this thing down before it becomes chronic, steroids and antihistamines, now go\". Is the cause of Mast Cell activation typically idiopathic? &gt; Is that something I can ask my allergist to prescribe?  \n\nYes. - Though most doctors who do not understand mast cell disorders are not going to know how to interpret the tests.  It will be very difficult to get a full on diagnosis if the doctor does not understand.  This is why you need to be your own advocate here.  Most of the mediators for mast cell disorders involves the treatment you are doing.  However, if you do have a mast cell disorder, the symptoms can progress into anaphylaxis or something worse. Start with \\(( and work your way through and see if you find a lot of similarities to what you are experiencing.  \n\n&gt;Is the cause of Mast Cell activation typically idiopathic?\n\nOh, yes.  Very much indeed.  I would definitely look more into MCAS / mastocytosis.  \n\nI probably would talk to your doctor about possibly getting a tryptase test done.  It is probably important to get a tryptase test done within 1-2 hours of a reaction/trigger.  Though, people with MCAS will typically have elevated tryptase levels during a reaction, whereas in mastocytosis, people typically have elevated tryptase levels all around despite any reaction or trigger.  \n\nI have a mast cell disorder.  My symptoms initially came about right after a very stressful life event.  Symptoms first started with dermatographia and pruritus.  - Mostly at night.  As time went on, symptoms started progressing (flushing on face/hands after a trigger, GI symptoms, bone / joint pain).  Many doctors that I have seen did not know what was going on.  I did some research myself and found only two disorders linked to my symptoms - carcinoid syndrome and mast cell disorder.  \n\nMost allergists will do a full gauntlet of allergy tests thinking that it is related to allergic triggers.  I, like you, am only allergic to dust mites, however, I experience anaphylaxis with any type of trigger now (foods, alcohol, exercise, emotion/stess).   \n\nYour symptoms seem pretty mild, however, if anti-histamines are mediating some of that, then I would highly bet on you having something related.  \n\nYou can try to give \\(( to sift through if you think that a mast cell disorder is a possible diagnosis. \n\nThough, I would highly suggest getting a tryptase test done (within an hour of a reaction) and a full CBC w/ vitamin counts.  Most people with MC disorders are deficient in vitamin D.", "Legs itch at night I developed dermatographia this summer. Derm prescribed Zyrtec. It seems to do absolutely nothing.\n\nUntil this week, I would have said my dermatographia is at the level of a nuisance. This week, though, my legs have been itching so badly at night that it is keeping me from falling asleep and waking me up throughout the night.\n\nIs this a winter weather thing? Does this happen to anyone else? I take levocetrizine tablets  daily and it keeps the itching under control. But sometimes when I drink alcohol/ do not sleep enough/do not keep myslef clean, it takes two tablets to work. But if zyrtec does not work, your dermatologist may suggest a different anti-histamine. He may even ask you to take thyroid tests and check for stomach issues. Regarding winter- ofcourse it gets worse during winter especially when the skin becomes dry but taking medication should have given you relief. Thanks. My derm said that it could take months for the Zyrtec to kick in. This surprised me bc people here said it takes minutes. Derm did not seem at all surprised that Zyrtec has done nothing yet. \ud83d\ude15 However, that was before the nighttime itching escalated. I have not been drinking alcohol. Thyroid checked and normal. What kind of stomach issues should be checked for? I take loratidine. Zyrtec wasnt doing much for me either. Made me hella sleepy though. I switched to loratidine, aloe vera gel and curcumin supplements. And it was pretty much under control. Aloe I would keep in the fridge and use as needed. At night I would keep it by bedside so everytime I would wake up due to itching I would just slather some on my itchy spots. \n\nHonestly I dont think its a winter thing. Because dryness, sweat, heat, scratches, pressure...basically everything makes it worse. Lol. So for now if you are experiencing worse symptoms, try moisturizer for sensitive skin and keep skin moisturized. \n\nHope this helps. Interesting, i will consider loratadine. And Aloe is a great idea, thanks!  Yeah. I too am surprised to know that it takes some time for zyrtec to kick in. Very unfortunate for you I guess. They check the stomach, colon and the gall bladder for any issues  coz, these may also produce symptoms similar to dermatographia-just to be sure. Also my dermatologist issued a full STI check up for me even though I had never had sex. Thanks! Do you recall what kind of screening or tests you had for those organs? (I also have had a recent STI panel, all negative.) I was diagnosed about 6-7 years ago. back then I had Full STI check up, stool sample analysis, thyroid function test and an endoscopy. Everything came back negative. Still no clue how I got dermatographia. I put cocoa butter or coconut oil on my legs when they are itchy. Do you shower right before bed? I have heat urticaria (which probably a lot of us with dermatographia have), so I am often itchy after a shower and for some reason it is worse at night. Loratidine 20mg a day. Costco sells it reaaaaally cheap. I still get skin writing but I do not get as much itching. You can take up to 40mg, especially in a flare. I have had dermatographia since I was a child and the only thing that has ever worked for me is Benadryl, two tablets every time I feel itchy. I also use aloe baby oil in the shower and aloe baby lotion constantly on my whole body keeping skin as moisturizer as possible. It always seems to be worse for me in the winter because of the dry air. A humidifier in your bedroom may also help. I heard stress is a factor of dermltographia.Do you feel itchy when you are irritated. Almost certainly. This week has been especially stressful so I am not surprised about the uptick in my symptoms. The main cause of stress has just lifted, though, so fingers crossed maybe my skin will chill out, too. Could be winter itch, dry (white and flaky) skin, or eczema?  What works for me once every week or two is scrubbing  my legs with Dove soap with a facial scrubbing pad then lathering with cream while skin still moist.  May not work for you, but hope this helps someone. \n\nMy Zyrtec took less than a week to kick in.  Maybe move on to new antihistamine?", "Is this dermatographia?

If you have, how did you figure out what kind of gut issues you were having? Has anyone tried a stool test to learn more about their microbiome? I am not sure what \"functional/integral\" doctor means. But I have tried traditional Indian medicine for 6months.  They gave me something called \"haridara khanda\" which is basically something with a lots of turmeric in it. Did not help at all. They said it will take more time to cure it completely and that I should not give up. But i could not control the itching and gave it up. \n\nAnd I did have a stool sample analysis done about 7years ago, when I was first diagnosed. But all results came negative according to my doctor. I do not remember  what he was looking for in it. Sort of. I am allergic to nickel and salicylates, and when I can keep those pretty low in my diet my dermatographia is nearly nonexistent. &gt;salicylates\n\nHow did you identify those as what was causing it? I am currently on an elimination diet but not eliminating those specifically. Cannot eliminate everything at once otherwise I would have nothing to eat With great difficulty. I have had an anaphylactic reactions to salicylates on many different occasions, and when I was a teenager it sent me to the ER twice. At 39, I made the connection that it is in food when I had an anaphylactic reaction to something with wintergreen flavoring. I started doing research and found some studies with actual measurements of the salicylate levels in foods, and discovered that when I cut those my gastrointestinal and skin problems were greatly reduced. Mostly that means cutting out teas, most herbs and all spices plus a few random things like tamarind, licorice, root beer, hops and rose hips. \n\nBeware most salicylate lists on the Internet, they are based on pseudoscience and not actual measurements of the salicylate levels in foods. Functional medicine and integrative medicine are both pseudoscience quackery without any modern medical community approval.", "Just got the diagnosis I have seen from this community that many people have developed the condition due to the Moderna vaccine. I got my booster in November but did not start getting dermatographia until January. Did anyone else have that kind of delay?

I miss scratching my back after I rip off my bra at the end of the day.", "Dermatographia? Wondering if I have dermatographism, and thought I might talk to some people who do have it and compare symptoms if that is cool with you.\n\nI noticed in the past couple years that whenever I get scratched (does not matter what scratched me), I get welts. Which, okay, I thought I was maybe allergic to dust getting in the scratches or something.\n\nBut then I started getting welts on my hands whenever I used hand lotion in the winter. I figured I was allergic to the lotion, so I switched brands to something more 'natural', had the same result. I tried pure cocoa butter on my dry hands, still got welts. Then I tried plain old vaseline, and once again, welts.\n\nThen I developed a apparent skin allergy to cardboard (while trying to pack boxes for a move! Super inconvenient. Packing and unpacking was an extremely itchy experience). Figured I was allergic to the chemical they preserve cardboard with. \n\nTonight, I (fairly gently) rubbed my face while looking in the mirror, and it turned red. That Google search led me here. \n\nDoes this sound like dermatographia, or am I just allergic to everything? I am really puzzled.\n\nIt is not bad enough for me to spend money on a doctor, so I probably will not go in for it. I am self-treating with an antihistamine cream when I get itchy. \n\nAnyway, responses and symptom comparisons are much appreciated! This sure does. Ive had it for two years now. Putting on makeup with a beauty blender triggers it! Nix alcohol and try gradually introducing foods, start with the B.R.A.T. diet. Keep a food log. Also zyrtec daily helps. Im STILL waiting on an actual appointment, where I am the office has a year long wait to be seen! my GP prescribed me zyrtec and that has been the best tool to combat it.  Try drawing on your skin and see if it rises. Its your skin reacting to pressure as if it is a allergen. Holy craaaaap cardboard is the WORST for me, and finding out during a move is basically hell. I, too, just assumed I had some kind of dust allergy for the longest time until it got bad enough that the hems of some clothes would set me off. You sound like you are in the right place, or you are close enough that it is still going to be helpful!\n\nI do not have a lot of constructive stuff to add other than keep a log of what sets you off worst, what foods make it worse, etc. (This does not stop me from eating dairy, for the record. I am not that strong.)\n\n\nRe: treatment - a daily OTC antihistamine may help a lot. I would not advise too much steroid cream on your face if you are prone to perioral dermatitis.

Since the rash started I have been canceling my massages but I am debating finally going again now that I know what it is and it is somewhat under control. I was just reading about how massages can release histamines and now I am pretty confused. Could a massage make the Dermatographia I am dealing with worse? I was thinking that the vaccine is what triggered this rash but now I am wondering if it was the massages?? Please help lol, my throat has not come close to closing but I am worried that a massage could make the reaction more powerful? I get a massage every two weeks, though i took a break for a year and a half or whatever until I was covered by the vaccine. I have only had a problem a few times, and it was because there was not enough oil or cream on my skin. You have to let the massage therapist know that you have sensitive skin and you need extra oil. \n\nI had the Moderna vaccine (second dose) on April 17, and until last week my dermatographia was really bad. Now it is back to almost nonexistent. So it took about a month for me to get back to normal. Thank you! I went for the massage and asked her to use extra oil &amp; explained what was going on. I took a xyzal before going. She used slightly lighter pressure and I left with absolutely no dermatographia marks! Started to think the massage actually helped until I got home and my dogs nails made me look like I got mauled \ud83d\ude44. Glad to know it is dissipating for you! It is been over a month for me and it is still sticking around, but with Xyzal it is not itchy just red looking My dermotographia  was the only symptom  I had when diagnosed  with Hashimoto's  an autoimmune  disease.  See endocrinologist  for FULL thyroid panel including antibodies and vitamins d, bs, iron and ferritin.   Do your research.  On thyroid  meds for yrs, dermotographia  cured.  \n\nI once had allergic reaction like that to oral mesds.  On anything new?  Also heard many found allergies so maybe allergist can help.\n\nFinally,  may want to report side effects to feds and Maderna. Wow I have been reading about Hasimoto\u2019s throughout this process, thanks for the info I think I will try to get tested for it. My allergist did an indoor/outdoor allergy test and of course found nothing. It is been almost 2 months now and with taking antihistamines everyday I am not always itchy, but the dermatographia is still going strong. I have been on watch for a concrete sign of Rheumatoid\u2019s disease (auto immune) so maybe I will finally find something! Best of luck.  Do get tested and if have any other questions, Hashimoto's  has it is  own sub or ask me.", "I am not sure if I have dermatographia or not. Since I was a little kid, when I would scratch myself, the area I scratched would become very red, but it would not raise the skin. Just today, I had been scratching my arm, and I decided to draw something with my nails. The skin raised, but eventually went down. It is still red. When do yours go away? I think I might have a very mild case, because I do not get itchy very often. I would say the welts/raised skin from touch go away anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour. When I can control it with antihistimes my skin often just turns red and does not raise up. Only difference is i tend to get itchy. It seems yours is a pretty mild case if you have it and there is a lot of factors that affects it such as allergies, foods eaten, pressure, antihistimes, and time of year, among others. If you ever get itchy I would suggest trying topical creams for anti itch or antihistimes, but since yours seems to not bother you other than possible red marks and raised skin you seem pretty lucky! I would suggest if it makes you self conscious in any way to try and be aware when you touch exposed skin to avoid the red or raised skin.

I was like wtf..., people who suffer from this know, that antihistaminics doesnt heal you, but only alleviates symptoms. He also told me, that it doesnt really matter to go visit allergist. And I think , that allergist could help me with that.., maybe its just allergy to some food, or something like that..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you have same experiences with your doctos? Yeah no ...there is no cure for dermatographia unfortunately. You could go see an Allergist but likely they will do a gauntlet of allergy tests that might not to be of help / assistance for you to mediate your dermatographia. They could do a skin punch biopsy too, but they will probably only see a congregation of mast cells in the skin (which is the case with dermato patients.) There is only the band-aid effect of taking antihistamines H1 / H2 antagonists to mediate symptoms. Even then, some people who were born with dermatographia typically have no response to antihistamines.\n\nIt sucks IMO ... \n\nThough that said, there are people who seem to recover from it after a period of time however, from the numerous studies I have read ...once onset, you are likely to have it for life. The onset of my dermatographia happened right after a very stressful period in my life. I assumed that once I reduced my stress the dermatographia would disappear. \n\nBoy was I wrong... \n\nLike I stated in the other thread. If other weird symptoms start manifesting, then it is likely overall a mast cell disorder of some kind ...like Mast Cell Activation Syndrome; Cutaneous/Systemic Mastocytosis.

So you may want to have someone else help you test your back, if that is where you react already and you do not have problems with your arms.\n\nAs said in other comments, no matter what the outcome of this quick test, definitely see a dermatologist either way because there is a lot of overlap with different urticarial conditions and treatment may vary.", "is this dermatographia? i think it was onset by an allergic reaction. any chance i can rid it with antihistamines?

Your useless. That looks like hives as there is no clear pattern indicating it is dermatographia and you think it was caused by an allergic reaction.  That said, hives are another type of urticaria so it is in the same family.  Topical benadryl cream may help some as may oral forms of antihistamines and a cold compress but only take these if you know it is safe for you and note the possible side effects such as being drowsy.  These will not cure it butqy help with swelling, itching and should lessen the symptoms.  Even if we were doctors here we cannot diagnose you so if it persists contact your PCP or seek emergency care if your breathing is affected.  If it was dermatographia and not an allergic reaction then it should clear up realtively fast if you leave it alone. What was it an allergic reaction to? Do you get it often?

I was diagnosed today and I am going on a cortisone (pill, Betapred) treatment starting tomorrow. But reading around here and on other subs/forums has me confused. It seems like most people only think this is a \"cool thing\" and a minor inconvenience, I have seen several people who diagnose others and say that it is not something that will bother them in any way and that the most annoying thing is the question \"What happened to your arm?!\". \n\nNow, I did not really get a chance to ask my doctor very much, and it was quite hard to understand (there was a language barrier and I had never heard of Dermatographia before, so I had no background knowledge of it), but the way people dismiss this thing makes me suspect I was either given a wrong diagnosis or that this is something that widely vary from person to person. The language barrier made me question if my doctor really understood my issues or if she just zoned in on my skin becoming red and raised. \n\nMy issues are so severe they affect my day to day life, there is the normal \"Scratch and you will have red/raised skin, can write on skin etc\", but I also get so extremely itchy it disturbs my sleep, if I accidentally scratch myself when I am asleep the itchiness will wake me up. It also gives me proper rashes, last year it showed up around my eyes and they were swollen, red and itchy for a couple of months. This year it has affected my whole face and it is now extremely itchy, red, textured, burning and my skin is slightly peeling. Antihistamines kind of work, but not really.\n\nSo, you guys, who knows more than me, what do you think? Could I have been misdiagnosed or is there a scale on how severe it can be? I am sorry if these are some really stupid questions, but I honestly do not know. Hi it seems like he gave you a proper treatment and diagnosis. I have the exact same symptoms as you and it has turned my life upside down, almost every single night I wake up itching my back/shoulders/arms to death. I have had this for almost 3 years and there has no been end in sight. Except I have to take an allergy pill every single day- which I believe this is not great for my body. But I have no other choice, if I could get a certain pill to help treat this like you mentioned I would jump at this opportunity. I want to try to get this but the waiting times at a dermatologist is insane. My scale is horrible and severe as because it has definitely changed my life for the worst and I cannot go 1 day without taking an allergy pill. Yes there is a scale, some mild, some severe. If you try antihistamines, try Zyrtec, it works the best for most of us. Def would NOT take a cortisone pill, but I guess if you have to and if it would help. Actually though, If you are considering a oral steroid, I would first try to get on Xolair, which is now used for treating dermatographia and is also used for asthma. It does not have some of the negative effects on the immune system that oral corticosteroids do. But idk, I have heard mixed results of Xolair, many seem to say it takes a while to get benefit. But do realize chronic hives is a different thing then dermatographia. I have a horrible case of dermatographism. It does vary by person. Thankfully it does not effect my eyes but going to the bathroom and wiping (as a female it was on both sides) it would get bad. Not sure which is worse. \n\nAfter about 5 years of having a mild case (just welts and red where I scratched/pressure) it started getting worse. 4 years ago I started itching and burning randomly and then the itch would spread. Scratching was the greatest freaking relief but a few seconds later the burning was the worst pain in the world. It was just a huge cycle that would last for hours.\n\nI finally saw an allergist who diagnosed me. He is a Godsend. I was the first/worst he is seen. After researching everything he could not believe how bad mine was. We have tried a combination of medicines and shots. I have finally found relief with a combination of Xyzal and Allegra twice a day and doxepin once a day. \n\nI am not \u201ccured\u201d but I have found relief. I will still get red and my skin will burn for a bit but nothing like before. If I miss a dosage the random itching and burning will start.\n\nWe believe it all started with an autoimmune response to H Pylori and the strong antibiotics it took to cure it. It is very common these days to see many people with mild cases. Those of us with severe reactions tend to not find the condition all that fun. \n\nUnfortunately, there is not a definitive cause or cure for dermatographism. I think many people will just say it appeared one day and disappeared after a few years. 10 years on I am still waiting for mine to disappear. At least I have found relief. \n\nAs someone who has a severe case I pray you find the relief you need. Do not be afraid to see your doctor as often as you need to. Do not just look for an ok response to medication. Find something that will allow you to live your life normally. It is possible but it takes time. \n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you need any help. I do believe you could have dermatographia. My case is not necessarily as bad as yours but mine does wake me up if I do not take my allergy medication. The only one that works for me is Zyrtec. I do not think a steroid is a long term solution. Maybe it will just be helpful in the times where you get lasting rashes. I would recommend trying different allergy medication. I would also recommend re-evaluating your shampoos/soaps/lotions/ detergents. Try to aim for products for sensitive skin. I have to admit that using a more natural shampoo/conditioner/ soap has helped mine be less severe. While others made the hives/itchiness much worse (used my partners head and shoulders for a little, made me so itchy). \n\nAs for people dismissing it - I think a lot of doctors do not know what it is and the ones that do do not really have a solution. Unfortunately we are left with live with it and try to find ways to make it better. I also have not spent time trying to seek a doctor who knew a lot about it, mostly because my symptoms are manageable now. You may want to try and look for another doctor or specialist if you cannot find solutions or relief. Thank you! I was very unsure since I read that most people do not describe symptoms as severe as some of my symptoms are. I am not sure we have any of the medication you suggested, but the Betapred I was prescribed is also used for asthma, allergic reactions and snakebites (lol, I live in Sweden, never seen a snake in my life), so it sounds somewhat like your description of Xolair. I am supposed to take Betapred for 6 days so it is a very short treatment period though. Hi, thank you for your reply! I was a bit worried, our healthcare over here is free, not complaining about that but our hospitals are understaffed and very overworked and people often get misdiagnosed in a rush, and a language barrier added to that made me even more worried.\n\nI do not think the pill is supposed to be a proper treatment, it is a 6 day treatment and I think it is only to help with the bad reaction my face is having right now, last year I was prescribed a cream for my eye are when i had a rash there instead, also a cortisone cream, it worked to get rid of it but it is not a proper treatment still, just something to take away the actual rashes. Thank you! Your story sounds about the same as mine, it did not start off this bad and it was mild for several years, enough to not take any action. I finally called the doctor today since it now spread to my face and will not go away, it is so itchy and stings like hell. \n\nNow that I think about it, It could have started back when I was on a very high dose of antibiotics as well, I had a bad inflammation in my cervix after a miscarriage several years ago. I remember having to take two different kinds at the same time and several each time, I could barely move during that treatment due to splitting headaches from the high dosage. It is kind of fuzzy though, I am also allergic to birch and that makes me itch too so it is all just kind of blending together. \n\nI will definitely keep pushing for something that will work for me, these antihistamines I have been having now are rubbish, but they were left over from spring and the birch allergy. Thank you! The Betapred is only a 6 day treatment, probably to help with the rash covering my entire face, and I am very grateful if that helps the rash go away. Last year the rash around my eyes lasted for a very long time and I would prefer if it did not do that this year, lol. I do not feel like walking around with a swollen, rough, red face for a couple of months.\n\nI am going to order a couple of different brands of antihistamines available to us here in Sweden, unfortunately we do not have the kinds that is often recommend on this sub.\n\nI am using a sulphate free shampoo and silicone free conditioner, both with mostly natural ingredients. Any time I use a shampoo with sulphates my hair/scalp starts smelling horrible, like sheep's wool or some kind of metal, do you know if that is connected somehow? \n\nThe way people were dismissing it was one of the reasons I started doubting this, but I did not know if there was a scale to it If it is just redness, then it is an inconvenience, but if it itches, then it just sucks. I take bilaxten (bilastine) everyday in the morning. No itches, but redness. Going swimming is embarrassing. Wearing swimming goggles will lead to embarrassingly hilarious results. Other then that, it is fine. I used to take ranitidine, until it was recalled.\n\nOne thing that seems to work for me is taking vitamin c and d. Since covid, I have been taking those vitamins everyday and I find that out reduces the redness quite a bit. I am not a doctor, but I would suggest looking into it. I was diagnosed a few weeks ago and Zyrtec works to relieve the burning/itching. It began about 2 weeks after I had surgery. I was give strong antibiotics and pain meds. I hope it goes away! You are not alone with this one Mine is so terrible. The itch is something sent from hell. It drives me mad and end up bruised all over. I take Brexton daily and it works for the itch but not so much for the redness.

You guys were extremely helpful so I wanted to add this story to the list of accounts for anyone looking for hope or information.\n\nHe started taking two Zyrtec a day on you all's recommendation and it got a lot better, but it took a couple days to take effect.

So then we went to the doctor.\n\nThe doctor confirmed the dermatographia diagnosis and was honestly a little shocked at the severity. She prescribed Prednisone and told him to keep taking the Zyrtec. She thought it was odd that there was no obvious cause (she ignored the moderna suggestion) but suggested a potential fungal infection (which would have spread to me but did not). She told him to come back two days later to check in, and also to buy some lotion for eczema (we bought Aveeno eczema therapy which soothed it a lot).\n\nIt is now been three days on Prednisone and he is made a remarkable recovery. The doctors visit yesterday confirmed that it is not fungal, since he is had such extreme improvement. She referred him to a dermatologist for a more long term solution, but he is gone from not being able to wear a shirt or lay down without blinding agony to being able to go about regular business with little more than discomfort. You can still draw on him, but the huge rash patches are gone. He is going to try and phase off the Prednisone now but stay on Zyrtec, so hopefully that holds.

I may have had covid or something and that plus the stress cause an excessive inflammation response That is what I am taking and it is controlling the itching really well for me, but my skin is still raised when I scratch it.", "Is this dermatographia?  Looking for any advice: this started happening to me around 5 weeks ago when I went off hormonal birth control (not sure if that was the cause, but seemed to be the only change in my life). I was advised to take zyrtec and have been using it twice daily along with calamine lotion and pinetarsol baths etc to ease the itchiness - however it is still so insanely distracting, itchy, and frustrating!\n\nI read online this is caused by scratching your skin, though I feel like i do not scratch - I literally just wake up and they are on my body. Much worse after about 2pm and evenings... \n\nAnd tips would be so muchly appreciated. Looks like dermatographia. The best advice even though I know its hard is not to scratch, and be cafeful not to cause friction on the skin. And also go to a dermatologist!!!! \nSome random tips, I find keeping my skin moisturized helps. Also atleast for me cold helps with the itching so like a ice pack on a very itchy spot or s cold shower. Take your meds religiously. Thankyou for taking the time to reply - ice packs sound like a great idea! I find that when I had very istchy areas and I scratched them it would get worse so cold packs help to relieve sensation without scratching it. Any pressure applied to the skin will cause these inflamed marks. General antihistamines should work to decrease the magnitude of skin raised and itchiness. Dermatographia can be caused by hormonal changes. I remember someone on here telling me they had it, and disappeared after she was treated for I believe hashimoto's. Obviously you do not have that, but I am just here to say it will probably go away after your hormones balance out again Thanks for the info! Yes! I get that too!", "Life is even more fantastic when you have both dermatographia and chronic idiopathic urticaria.  I have both too!  Symptoms were greatly reduced by reducing sugar and alcohol intake. Have you looked into Xolair shots? I was going to mention xolair too. I had to take it for a year before I could really tell a difference, but it was worth it. Yes! I was going to start it last year but I got pregnant so I could not. I do not drink (ever) but I think I will try and cut out sugar just to see if it helps. I need to diet anyway so it is a win win.  Wait.... are not they the same thing? Various charts from my dr have both of them listed and I thought they were just part of the same histamine reaction. I am trying to get the Xolair shots at the moment, was it beneficial to you? Hi trying to get the Xolair shots at the moment, I am Dad! :) Unfortunately, no. I tried for 6 months but it did not help. I do not get hives just extremely miserable with my dermatagraphism. It was just a hopeful attempt to calm down my itching. Hey, i know this post is a couple of months old now but I have been searching around, after 2 and a half years of hives I was diagnosed with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Antihistamines do not work on them. I was feeling a bit deflated but seeing someone with skin like mine has helped. Hope you are keeping well!", "Merry christmas :)  Nice one.

Isolated through thanksgiving and second at home test came out positive thanksgiving night. 3 days after symptoms started, they were done. Happy to have had a mild case. \n\nDoctor prescribes doxycycline to prevent bacterial infection due to Covid, and although i emphasized i was no longer having symptoms, she thought it was necessary. Started 12/1, and on 12/4 developed a rash that prompted me to stop the medication.\n\nFrom there, I have had worsening hives everyday. Urgent care doctor prescribed a steroid which did not help and they are sure the continuing reactions are not from the medication as it is long out of my system. Lucky to say the itching is not as bad as it was before the steroid. Before that i would have to use a cold compress to get some kind of relief, but now the burning and itching only lasts momentarily. Interesting to note, Claritin does not seem to help keep the hives away so i have not been taking regularly. \n\nI came across dermatographia while googling and my husband drew a line in my skin to test the theory.

So I just tested positive for every single food allergen, and the allergist said that I have Dermatographia. \n\nI have been suffering from full body hives like you would not believe, and my primary care doctor told me to avoid all common food allergens until I could get in for allergy testing. \n\n\nLooking at these pictures, has any of you experienced hives at this level with your Dermatographia? \n\nThe allergist gave me a kind of useless print out that only explains the skin writing, not the massive full body hives and welts ( Speaking from experience, look for a non drowsy daily anti histamine. That should take care of the worst of the hives. If I understand correctly, dermatographia is an immune condition where you have overactive mast cells that release histamines in reaction to mechanical pressure, hence the hives. The more you scratch the more it itches, the more it itches the more you scratch. It is a vicious cycle. Try to figure out and avoid trigger allergens. For me that is strawberries tomatoes shellfish dog dander and dust mites. Just take a breath do your homework and you will be fine. Besides, skin writing makes for a neat party trick lol. ", "Is it just me, or is Dermatographia worse in the warmer months or when you are hot? I have had Dermatographia for about five years now. In my five years, I have come to realize that my flare ups are generally worse in the summer than they are in the fall and winter. My skin seems to be more easily agitated and it is so much easier to cause my skin to redden and raise when it is hotter or warm. \n\nAlso, if I am feeling embarrassed, nervous, or anxious, my body temperature rises and I feel hot. The bumps will miraculously begin to form even if I have not physically triggered it.  \n\nDoes anyone else feel like the condition is worse when the weather is warmer or when one\u2019s body temperature is hot? 100%. Heat is easily my biggest trigger...I hate summer. I cannot wear any kind of jewelry, and my scalp gets *so* itchy from my dark hair trapping all that heat. \n\nWhen I am having a bad flare up, it even extends to showers. Getting out of a hot shower makes me look like a lion mauling victim. I often take colder showers and stay indoors when I can feel one coming on. I knew I could not be the only one who noticed this! Thanks for sharing. I will definitely have to try to take colder showers. anything that gets me sweaty - exercising, summer, hot showers etc. actual hell \ud83d\ude44 Oh my God it is horendous when hot or during the summer. I think it is starting to flare down there which is the absolute worst. So relatable \ud83d\ude15 Ughh I hate when I feel that happening.", "tattoos have any of you all with dermatographia gotten a tattoo? is there anything i should know/ bad reactions i should be aware of? I have four. No issues outside of the saniderm. May not want them to wrap it. The tattoos were and are fine! Both my tattoos were completely fine, no crazy reactions like I get from normal scratching.", "Experience with waxing? Papa's getting getting his back waxed, and I am wondering how that is going to turn out.\n\nWould any of you have some tips? \n\nThanks \ud83d\ude0a I have also wondered how this would turn out! I always try to make sure I do not have any plans for the rest of the day because you cannot stop the swelling so the best you can do it cover it up with clothes. But keeping the area cooled and soothed with aloe Vera or something helps with the itchiness I feel :) I prefer waxing over shaving honestly. Every time I shave my skin gets super irritated but waxing I find the irritation does not last long at all I do hard waxing on my legs in addition to epilating: taking a little more antihistamines and aspirin will suffice! I only recently got diagnosed but i got eye brows waxed in the this month and my reaction has been fine, annoying but fine. It takes longer for the swelling to go down so I just make sure I am having an evening at home other than that it is not a miserable experience for me.", "i have been having this for like, 4-5 years, i ve already get used to the itchyness, and feel fine mostly, i guess this is fun to have lol, plus, i didnt seek a doctor and just lived nomally, do u guys think i should do so? just to do check ups. and is it a dangerous problem if not treated?  Certain foods tend to make my skin more sensitive so my mom always worried I would develop anaphylaxis but I have never had any serious issues.  Pop a benadryl and red lobster here I come! It is not dangerous in and of itself (though a pain when shaving). But it can be a symptom of auto-immune issues. A bunch of people here, myself included, have hypothyroidism as well. So see your doctor, have them look at your thyroid levels. Chances are they will prescribe antihistamines, but that will just take care of the heavier hives, not the whole thing. Mine went away when I quit using nicotine (for the most part) - drinking too much can bring it back a little bit. Do not go getting prescriptions for shit or Zyrtec or anything without adjusting what your doing - chances are you are engaged in something your body is not happy with i have no any bad habits, and considered myself to be a healthy eater... lol, aint sure what is causing it. but i guess could be hormonal problems like the first guy mentioned ok thanks, i will see a doc and try to see if my thyroid levels are normal. So your skin does not welt up anymore if you are careful about what you are having? Best of luck! It took awhile, but yeah I pretty much do not have issues for the most part. If I get really stressed, drink too much, or eat like crap, than I can still have a bit of flare up. For the most part it stays dormant though.", "Eyebrow microblading I really want to get my eyebrows microbladed (semi permanent tattoo) it is not permanent so it is not as deep as a regular tattoo. I am worried about my dermatographia being a problem here and making the procedure turn out badly. Does anyone here have experience with this or something similar? And will taking anti-histamines make a difference in my skin reacting strongly? I have been wondering this too. I do not know for sure, but here are the things I have been considering: \n- I currently get my eyebrows waxed and that has not caused any hives or flare-ups\n- I did not have any problems when I get a tattoo\n\nIn general, I think that when pain is involved like this, my skin does not react like it does to scratching, rubbing, or pressures (probably because these are usually more enjoyable than outright pain). \n\nIdk if your skin is similar to mine, but when I am weighing the pros and cons of micro landing, my dermatographia is relatively low on my list of concerns. I have really mild hives- just if I itch hard and I am not usually feeling itchy. I have been researching microblading for three years because It is such a heavy decision imo and finally now that I have found someone I trust and who is work I love right before purchasing I was like \u201coh shit\u201d I hope my skin disease is not a problem. Same boat here. I finally found someone who trust and she gets what I want/like. Still have not taken the plunge yet though... definitely a big decision. \n\nI cannot imagine it being itchier than a normal tattoo healing, but being on your face may potentially make it itchier, *buuut* no clothes rubbing on it or anything. \n\nNo one can say for certain, but seems like your reactions may be on the mild side. You could always ask your tech to do a couple of trial strokes in an inconspicuous place (as inconspicuous as possible) and give it a day or two to see how it plays out. At the height of my dermatographia I got a tattoo (yolo) and i had no reaction to it. \n\nI took 1 extra zyrtec than I normally did that day...my normal am and then I took one 2 hours before getting tattooed so that might have helped. Iv gotten multiple tattoos, iv found that as long as they do not dick around iv been fine. If they go too slow I get hives and we need to break. If they move quickly they can sorta \u201coutrun\u201d the hives with the tattoo gun lol. My hives can also take a upwards of 5 minutes to show up and 30 to disappear. I say go for it! Thanks! That was really helpful. I have my eyebrows microbladed and didnt have any issues with dermatographia although i did not have a flare up at the time. I also have 2 tattoos (no complications there either).", "Armpits? I am 15 and a guy and I have not had armpit hair or dermatographia for long, and I started noticing that my armpits are always itchy. I think it might be because of a lot of friction going on there. Does somebody else have this? Does someone have an experience with shaving them helping? My deodorant caused major issues; I had to get the clinical strength stuff cuz it is the only one that does not dry my skin out.  Are you on antihistamines for the itching? I itch in the randomest of places when I am having a flare up I already have it for three months and that is the longest flare up I have ever had that also caused me to check this out. There was only one time before that it was active but I did not Know what it was. I am not on antihistamines because for the most of it I can handle the itch and because when I did take them they did not really work. That is why if I do not need to I would prefer to just shave my armpits and see if it helps. Best of luck, I hope you find something that works. I have been shaving since before my diagnosis so I could not tell you if that makes a difference. However, if you are already itchy I would worry that it would irritate it more. Have you got a barrier cream like Double Base?  I can buy I guess, thanks for the recommendation I would not shave. Armpit hair grows back way too fast. It will be prickly and abrasive before the day is over Same! My deodorant was causing all sorts of problems, drying out my skin. I can only go clinical now. Hey just found this. I shave everything and that helps a ton. But daily Zyrtec (I buy bulk generic) takes away alll of the itching for me! 10 mg does not work but 20mg daily does the trick- which is a completely safe dose.

Anyone have any experience getting tattoos with this condition? I have had this for as long as I could remember, so I can only assume its been since birth, and I have been wanting to finally get a tattoo but im worried that it will be an issue. Im afraid my skin flaring up will mess up the tattoo process from the actual art and tattooing, straightness of lines or accepting of ink, to also the healing process. For me, no where is safe from the swelling and flaring up, and all the places I would consider a tattoo, arms chest back, all get it the worst, so there is not any avoiding it. \n\nAre tattoo\u2019s with this condition even possible? If they are, are there any issues to be aware of or any personal experience getting one? Anything that can be done to suppress it for a session like taking antihistamines or do you have to just go through it until my body exhausts itsef of histamines? Are tattoo artists aware of this condition and will know how to handle it? \n\nIf anyone has anyput or links to information that would be absolutely amazing! And if theres any artists that you know have dealt with customers having this condition or anything please let me know. Im located in NY for reference I have. Just make sure to tell the artist about it so he does not trip about it. Other than that, you should be good to go As long as I take my daily antihistamine, I have zero issues with getting a tattoo and the after-care. I have it! I have posted this on another post a few months ago about tattoos too.\n\nThings I have noticed: \n1.\tIt hurts more than it is itchy. During the tattoo itself I did not feel any itchiness. At all. Just that kind of cat scratch pain, so it was fine during. \n2.\tMy swelling was bad immediately after, and I was bummed that my artist did not use my photos on their Instagram lol. But they post most of the tattoos that they do so mine clearly was gross right after because of the swelling. It went down after 6-8 hours but I assume that is different for everyone. \n3.\tThe healing. Oh. Fuck. The. Healing. You will get over this. I promise. It is just 1-2 days maximum of very itchy skin. Do not scratch. If you scratch, the scab will come off. If the scab comes off, that part of the tattoo may end up with lifted ink and you will need to get it touched up. My tip: ask your artist what lotion they recommend you can use during this time. Keep it in the fridge (if your symptoms are helped by cold, which mine are) and use it. Ice the tattoo if you need. The itchiness was when the scabbing was the worst, about 3-5 days after the tattoo itself, for me. \n4.\tOnce fully healed, I noticed no issues and my skin treats the area like normal. I have read about some people here getting a slight raised area where they have ink once in a while but I did not experience that.\n\n\nGood luck!! Tattoos are fun as hell. Thank you :) this makes me more confident that getting one wont be ruined I have 14 tattoos, so you definitely can get tattoos when you have dermatographia :)\n\nI make sure to take antihistamines before I go, and warn the tattoo artist so they know what to expect. I have never noticed any adverse effects to the tattoo itself or the healing tbh.\n\nGood luck and enjoy:)", "Help!

If it is helped you, how soon did you notice a difference? I started it today (1 pill) and no difference tonight, though I would not necessarily expect it to be instantaneous.

Maybe I will end up needing more than one pill a day... Yeah, I am on 2x day (morning and night) and it kicks in pretty fast - and I can DEFINITELY tell when my previous dose wears off! \nThat said, even with the meds, I still get the redness/reactivity from some contact - breaking down cardboard boxes and seeing where the edges dragged across my arm is a big one.

I usually feel chills around the same time the itching goes away. I saw the dermatologist today. She told me it may take months for Zyrtec to start to work for this.

I have been having Claratyne (loratadine) every day and I am still having rashes all day and welts in the 6 hrs before a dose.\n\nWhat do you use? How often? How much does it reduce your symptoms? I alternate between loratadine (Claritin) and cetirizine (Zyrtec). A couple of weeks on both and then alternate to not build tolerance. \n\nTry to get some hydroxyzine (prescription) to help as well.  Sounds like a good plan. I only got diagnosed 3 weeks ago so I am new to all of this. I have taken Zyrtec for years. Most of the time I have taken a full pull (10mg) per day with no symptoms. After making some adjustments to my diet and things like soaps and shampoos I can get away with taking 5 mg with no symptoms until the end of the day.  I take bilastine 20 mg (Bilaxten) in the morning and ranitidine 150 mg (Ranidine) in the evening. ", "HELP I have suffered from dermatographia for years.

It is just super embarrassing and when it happens when I am wearing make up it looks awful. I look like Iv just been battered bruised. The scars go away within half an hour but they are sore and red and look bad. Have you seen an allergist, it sounds like you need to make an appointment. At the very least they will get you on some kind of antihistamines Thankyou I use prescribed cetirizine, but reactine also works for me! Thankyou! I will try it Have u seen doc yet?  Bloodwork  or other tests?  Any meds prescribed?", "Symptoms subsided - a brief tale I first went to a dermatologist, who had only ever seen this in children and referred me to an allergy specialist. Took an allergy panel and made sure to explain that *every* sample, even the controls, would swell - and they did. However, the one that really showed above the rest was dust mites.\n\nSince then, I have taken some steps to help remove that particular allergen and after a year or so, my symptoms have subsided quite substantially. The itching is gone and I barely swell when scratched.\n\nThat is my personal \u201csuccess\u201d story - finding that environmental factor and working to eliminate it. I hope this helps someone else... Your dermatologist sounds really good. My dermatologist has only prescribed antihistamines. I am thinking I should go to the allergist. Thank you for sharing. Interesting, I am also allergic to dust mites and have dermatographia. \nWhat are the steps you have taken to reduce them? Tons of cleaning, dusting, and vacuuming. Changing HVAC filters more often than required. Running air purifiers near constantly. Replaced my pillows and added a dust sleeve to my mattress. Ensuring that any sheets and pillow cases put on the bed are freshly washed and have not sat in the cabinet for too long.\n\nThat is probably the most significant moves... Can you recommend a dust sleeve? I have never even heard of that! And do you store your sheets a certain way to keep them from collecting dust so easily? I do not remember where I ordered it from and cannot seem to find the invoice. I thought it was Amazon but no luck finding it in my order history. \u201cDust mite mattress cover\u201d has lots of hits though!\n\nI keep sheets in a plastic drawer inside a wooden cabinet, as opposed to just sitting in the cabinet itself. Thank you!", "I seem to have developed dermatographia out of nowhere at almost 31 yo? Any tips please I am sooo itchy!!  Whoa! You got it bad. Looks like you could not resist the urge to scratch. Please consult a dermatologist to rule  out the other causes like thyroid issues, gut issues and other stuff and they will prescribe you an anti-histamine to you.(and looks like you need it urgently). And do you remember what you did do differently the day that you triggered the onset of dermatographia? So I have always had very itchy skin. Like I would bruise from scratching so much in my sleep. About three weeks ago this started happening when I would scratch anywhere. I started taking Zyrtec again. For about a month and a half I have been using Budesonide (a steroid) through nasal wash to try to help with my 5 year ongoing anosmia. To kickstart this, I also was given 10 days of prednisone. I finished the prednisone a little over a week prior to this happening.\n\nI scheduled an appointment with my PCP for Monday. I saw an allergist prior to starting the steroids where they did an indoor and outdoor panel. I only responded to one tree pollen. The allergist was the one who said I didnt need Zyrtec everyday as I had been taking for like three years, lol. So honestly it could be a lot of things. I got my thyroid levels (the usual free T and t4 and tsh tests) first week of Feb and it was all within limit. \n\n\nTldr/ no fucking clue but trying to figure it out \ud83d\ude02 You should also go to a dermatologist and have patch testing done. My dermatographia flares up when I have too much nickel in my diet, because I am allergic to nickel. There is other things on the patch test that could be the culprit as well. You do have a very complex medical condition. When I was diagnosed I was asked to check my thyroid, stomach, gi, and a full STD panel. \n\nAnd welcome to the club. Yeah I dont think I have had anything GI or stomach related tested. Would not be surprised if there is something going on there. Who knows maybe this will be the things that helps me figure out what is causing all my other myriad of issues no doctor can figure out lol My dermatologist takes forever to get in with. Depending on how Monday goes with my PCP and then the potential of going back to the allergist I do plan to try to schedule with the derm. Will probably take six months tho lol I 2nd going to get more bood done.  I got tested for multiple  thyroid levels, including antibodies, and BANG my whole world  changed... but no more Dermatographia! I have been wanting thyroid antibodies tested so hopefully they will do that now. Thanks! Best of luck!  Let us know how it goes For me it is montelukast that I take for my asthma which causes it. All kinds of medications can trigger it but for me, I would rather have the legit benefits of the montelukast and live with benign dermatological symptoms, than the other way round. Personally I find calamine cream or any zinc oxide cream a lifesaver, it really soothes it :) When mine appeared in college I did a round of steroids after talking to my dermatologist and started zyrtec. Neither helped at all so I stopped taking zyrtec after a few months, and after about 2 or 3 years it subsided some to a more manageable level. It still flares but it is much better now, I use the most moisturizing body wash and lotion I can find to eliminate any unnecessary dry skin related itching. It seems like every person's experience is different, so hopefully you can find something that works for you! Good luck to ya I took Zyrtec for about a year... did not really seem to help but perhaps the placebo affect was there. I stopped because I do not want to take meds unless I have to and while Zyrtec worked to a degree, it was not like an off switch by any means. \n\nI quit tobacco (to quit tobacco not for anything else.) and my derm symptoms significantly reduced. I have discovered they are worse when I am low on sleep, eating poorly, after drinking alcohol for up to a couple days. \n\nAvoid hot showers when your symptoms are around.\n\nBe patient... that is not fun to hear, but I will say my symptoms came hard and fast - then slowly have let up over the past couple of years. I am aware of it, but it is not frequent enough to be on my mind all the time like it used to be Omg... I take montelukast and have for three years. I was started on that, zyrtec, and flonase at the same time again to try to combat my anosmia to no avail... i do not actually need it soooo \ud83d\ude32 No way! It is a weeeird medicine, it also gives me an allergic reaction to cold (hives, or cold urticaria). Stops if I stop the montelukast but unfortunately it does really help my breathing :( Did you perhaps have covid? That is super helpful! Thanks! I am in the process of quitting nicotine and of course have noticed lots of benefits. It also started when I was in a different state with harder water than where I live regularly - altho I have spent tons of time in the other state without issue. Will be patient! I got the in shower lotion and eczema lotion for post shower! Did you take antibiotics for anything? Maybe a UTI? No I took Prednisone for 10 days for my sinuses though. I had also taken it 3 years ago with no skin issues. Alright I will talk to my PCP about getting off it to see. I dont take it for asthma. Ugh sorry you have to be one something with this as a side effect!! Nope! I am fully vaccinated. Have been for about a month. I developed mine after covid.. is this common???", "Zyrtec better than other antihistamines? I have recently developed dermatographia and my dermatologist suggested Zyrtec. I have been taking Allegra for years for hay fever and recall that last time I tried Zyrtec for that, it did not help. But it does sound like many of you use Zyrtec specifically. Have you found that it works better for dermatographia than other antihistamines do? And/or is there a known mechanism for that? Maybe I ought to make the switch... I take Zyrtec, but I have never tried a anything else.\n\nI have been diagnosed less than a year, too, so not a ton of experience. I took Zyrtec every day for years and it worked really well for me, but the itchiness was absolutely unbearable if I forgot to take it or ran out. I stopped taking it a few years ago (holy shit, the first few weeks were awful) and just grit my teeth through itches these days. How are you doing now that you are off of it? Have you found other things that work? Oh, sorry, I read too quickly. Sounds like you are doing ok with tolerating symptoms at the level you have them--glad to hear that! I really enjoy not needing to have Zyrtec everywhere (home, car, work, in the Dopp kit for vacations, etc.). Itches come and go throughout the day, but they are fairly easy to ignore as long as I do not start scratching! \n\nHot showers and hot tubs dry out my skin and make me very itchy. I really enjoy both, but try not to give in to temptation. I took Zyrtec for years and have recently switched to Claritin and occasionally Allegra. Zyrtec was better than both for me What caused you to stop the Zyrtec? I went for a check up and they noticed some high levels in my liver and advised me to switch. If Zyrtec gave me 9/10 relief I would say Claritin is a 6/10 in comparison. That is for me at least. Everybody is different. I take both! Issue still not resolved, oh well \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Zyrtec works much better and much longer than any other, Allegra is second best though, Claritin does nothing, and Benadryl kind of works but def not taking that daily Zyrtec/cetirizine is the only one that helps. All the others (loritodine is one I think?) did not do bupkiss. Take out dairy, gluten and coffee from your diet. And look up leaky gut syndrome. I have almost completely reversed dermatographia by taking out gluten and coffee. Not sure what the science behind the coffee is but after I stopped drinking it while also taking out gluten, the side effects decreased dramatically.", "Can you get a vaccine excemption for due to dermatographism?

I am just sharing to help everyone realize that it can ALWAYS be worse!  ? This is a rare form dermatographia. I inherited it from my mother. My skin is insanely itchy all the time. No welts, just the redness of the histamine. And the Groin is the most itchy area on the body. I have had this for 30 plus years... Oh that must be a struggle. I am extremely itchy mostly at nights but I cant even imagine dealing with that all day. What do you generally do to help with the itching? Itchy all the time too, but in all different spots, no specific focus. It definitely sucks. I cannot even lightly brush my skin without it swelling up and going red. Mine is more like this I think. I do not get the \"skin-writing\" like urticaria that is a hallmark of this condition but whenever the skin it scratched with normal pressure, it will itch quite a lot afterward and sometimes cause the red marks. There is really nothing that can be done about it. My general practitioner (best doctor ever!) was the first to diagnose it 5 years ago or so. He studied it over a couple of weekends and got into the chemistry behind the internal process of the issue.\n\nHe then found a medication called \"Sodium Cromolyn\" which was the pill form of ventolin that folks would take to ease asthma attacks before ventolin became the new method.\n\nHe prescribed it to me and it was shipped from a factory in new Jersey (the only place that manufacturers them to date.) I took a pill on the previous night and the next day my skin felt great! It felt like brand new skin. I scratched some areas just to test and there was no redness nor itchiness. \n\nUnfortunately, a couple days later my skin was even more itchy than normal so I stopped taking them. I freak people out in public,  because sometimes I do not know I am scratching. It is just something I do naturally. One co-worker lady I was working with at a gas station asked if I had crabs once.\n\n Laugh out loud!\n\nThanks for asking! My doctor told me this type of dermatographia is the worst of the two. I only got diagnosed with it 5 years ago, but I have been dealing with it for quite some time. How about you? I have had for around 8 months now. It is pretty mild I think, just more annoying tbh. Thankfully I do not have it as bad as some other cases on this sub. The random itching (pretty sure it is gut related and caused by some bacterial dysbiosis) which comes on sometimes around eating is pretty annoying but I have gotten used to it. And I have also conditioned myself over time to just rub/stoke the skin instead of scratching an itch. Extreme heat/cold exposure will also make the skin, especially on my hands, itch/sting for awhile but there is no urticaria.\nWhat helps is moisturising the skin with cetaphil almost everyday; this stops the random breakouts and itching (sometimes it will still happen even with doing this, just in the areas where the moisturiser was not applied) but not the dermatographia reaction. Taking Allegra (fexofenadine) stops the itching overall by like 80% but I try not to take it regularly as I notice the itching actually gets worse after a period of going off it. bro do you take Zyrtec?? No, it is pointless to take any antihistamines. They are no match against my bodies auto-immune system. My skin used to do that.  My doctor said it was my mast cells acting up and I found ways to control the itchiness, even though anti-histamines do not work for me anymore. r/MastCellDiseases might interest you.

I do not have the super noticeable skin raising, but I do get red lines when scratching, but that is about it. I was diagnosed with dermatographia by a dermatologist. \n\nI started really noticing it after going on a cruise and binge drinking for a few days. It is most noticeable when my skin comes in contact with clothing, so most clothing is itchy to wear when my skin is feeling the best and close to all clothing is itchy when it is at it is worst.\n\nSome other triggers\n\n* after a shower, even when using lukewarm water and not standing directly in the shower water\n* cold weather makes it generally worse\n* working out sometimes\n* most clothes tend to be itchy, especially after a shower\n\nI was traveling in the south all of December and my skin generally felt better (not perfect). I came back to the Pacific Northwest in January and my skin has been on the decline since. I started moisturizing 2x a day and taking 2x anti-histamines recently, but not sure if they are helping much.\n\nI was diagnosed by a dermatologist with allergic contact dermatitis through a skin patch test, although I have never had any rashes. At the same time I was also diagnosed with dermatographia, although I do not get the super raised skin, so I am not 100% sure I have it, but it is possible. \n\nI talked to another dermatologist that I am getting a second round of skin patch testing done through and she said it is more likely that my itching is from the dermatographia and not the contact dermatitis, so I am trying to look more into that now.\n\nAlso around the same time I started having dry eye, which was diagnosed as Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, which is inflammation of the gland in the eye that produces oil where the gland gets clogged. I feel like these two could be related with the symptoms starting around the same time.\n\nAnyone with similar experiences with dermatographia where the contact itching is more of an issue than having welts? If so, what worked for you treating / curing it? I am looking into probiotics and elimination diets. \n\nAppreciate any help I have had this particular type of dermatographia all my life. I inherited it from my mother. It is far worse than the other type of dermatographia with the raised welts!\n\nI suggest using aloe, leave the bottle in the fridge, and look for a type of lotion called \"Sarna\" they sometimes have it in Walgreens, and other big box stores. \n\nYou have overactive mast skin cells which trigger your autoimmune system to dump histamine on to the cells. This causes the irritation, and the scratching helps kill the overactive cells in unison with the histamine. I believe the pain of losing the cells is what causes the relief sensation when the brain chemical, serotonin (pain relief) is released. However, the serotonin causes another wave of discomfort which causes a feedback loop of itchiness. Have you tried any elimination diets or probiotics? Do you find most clothing to be itchy as well? \n\nI saw your pic in your post history, looks like your skin gets red, mine does not unless I scratch it. The pic is right after scratching...  \n\n\nI am currently on an all-vegetable diet, but I really think the diet has nothing to do with the issue. I tried fasting for a whole week with no results other than Spiritual ones.  \n\n\nClothing has always been an issue for me. I wish I had a solution for you, but the only thing you can do that I am aware of is temporary relief! Aloe, organic coconut oil, and Sarna. All Natural soap too! Use dermatologist-recommended laundry soap. This type of dermatographia is not well researched, unfortunately.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI know that my current struggles and skin irritations are nothing compared to the Glory I will share with YHVH and His Son Y'shua Ha'Maschiach.

What is the likelihood that Dermatographia developed as a result from exposure to Poison Ivy?  Could be, scientists do not really know what causes Dermatographia, but one of the indicators might be linked to allergies and skin reactions to certain types of exposure to things. \n\nI would say the chances are around 70% that it is linked to Posion Ivy. Interesting. I also recently developed what seems to be dermatographia after exposure/reaction (although not severe) to poison ivy a few weeks prior. I had previously never reacted to poison ivy. \n\nI had also been travelling when the dermatographia started, so I have been considering other possibilities (stress, environmental factors, change in diet). For what it is worth, it showed up after my skin resolved the Poison Ivy reaction and persisted for 2 months before resolving on its own. That is promising! Mine showed up right as the poison ivy was clearing up (just about a week ago now), hoping it will resolve soon!

They said it only had benefits so I agreed. My head itched crazy but they insisted to let it stay for 7 hours. After taking a shower I could not comb my hair because there was big parts of my head scalp shedding. And on my forehead area there were blisters. And a few weeks later my dermatographia started. Yet neither doctors nor my parents believe me when I say it was due the damage of the garlic. My parents say it was my \"poor hygiene\". Today my head is still one of the worst and most itching parts of my dermatographia is there really no cure?\ud83e\udd14 Sorry no cure. And the garlic definitely did cause damage to your skin since it is acidic and can cause adverse reactions to skin when left long enough, and from what I can tell skin writing has many different causes like I got mine from either a ring worm infection or the treatment for it.\n\nAlso if you go on health line they have a list of possible causes:\n\nstress\n\na history of allergies\n\nexcessive rubbing from clothing or bedding\n\ninfections\n\ncertain medications, including penicillin\n\nexercises that cause excessive skin rubbing (such as wrestling)", "Can Dermatographia Be Cured Completely Over Time?

It is going to suck really bad. keep a bug repellent on you. get aloe vera, and take precautionary anti-histamine. I had a terrible experience with mosquito bites last year. Got to the point where I would just avoid going out at dusk.   \nIt wont be too bad if you are prepared though. and do not itch :) use ice to numb if you get a lot of bites but the real solution is not to control yourself and not itch it initially. take anti histimine at night so you when you itch in your sleep it will not get bad. It super sucks. Even more so if you have type o blood as mosquitoes are even more attracted to you then.  If you can find peppermint scented sunscreen or perfume/deodorant/essential oil that may help, I have heard that mosquitoes hate that smell.

So I tried antihistamine tablets and they get rid of the 3dness of my dermatographia but the redness still occurs. I found a tattooist that did not turn me down thankfully. Has anyone got tatted and what was your experience during the session and the healing process? I would suggest you not to pls. My dermatographia gets pretty bad on occasion so I take an antihistamine every other day. I have gotten tattoos before this condition started and while I have had it and I have had no issues so far. \n\nObviously everyone is different, but my flare ups have not impacted my ink yet and it is been some years now. I had no issues getting a tattoo or the recovery. I got my tattoos before I was diagnosed, so I did not have antihistamines in my system. Sometimes my tattoos become raised but that has only happend a few times over many years. It does not hurt to talk to your doctor or allergist, though. I have got 4 now, 2 on shoulders and 2 on wrists. I found that it was okay if you plan right. The last time I took an antihistamine in the car on the way to the shop and let my artist know well in advance (for the record I have not had anyone turn me away because of it, but it might just be different where I am). I would ask your artist if its okay to use a numbing gel/spray, I have not used one myself, but I think it might help in terms of giving you a bit more time to let the artist work. \n\nDuring it, it was very very nippy, but not the same scratchy that usually occurs. Pain level will vary depending on where you get it, but I assume you know that haha. I found that it was worst for me about half an hour or so after I was finished and it was wrapped up, at that point it burned like hell. My best advice at that point is take a painkiller and have something cold to numb the area a bit. I found this the worst on my wrists because of all the nerves in that area fyi. The area does get very red while it is happening, but it does not have any lasting effects and for me it eventually died down when I added in the cold. \n\nThe healing was not too bad for me actually, mostly because the advice that I was given was to keep it wrapped for a while and then in the following days keep the area moisturised which your artist should recommend you do anyway. If you keep it moisturised, then it should not scab (resulting in a better end result) so it should not get irritated as much by the dry skin, or at least that is what I find. And keep taking the antihistamines if that is how you usually deal with it. Hope this help! :) I have a tattoo. I got it when my dermatographia was not very severe so the session was not particularly abnormal. Neither the healing. But I would suggest you ask your family doctor. Mine said it is fine. But I am not an expert. Even with antihistamine? So I have heard, apparently skin essentially forgets to continuously send histamines to the surface when getting tatted. Thank you so much! It seems the some of the tattooists here find it hard to adjust to certain severities of dermatographia. I wish they would consider training with sensitive skin for more inclusivity.

Plan B Has anyone noticed a link?? \nI took a Plan B (lol) and my dermatographia went away for an entire day. I also have PCOS so i am wondering if hormones are the root. \n\nanyone have any ideas? I suffer from both also, but had never linked the two before. Same! Please elaborate. I do not know what plan B or pcos is. PCOS is a hormonal imbalance characterized by too high or too low hormones like testosterone, androgens, estrogen, or progesterone. \nPlan B is an emergency contraceptive made up of Levenegstritol (spelling?) \nso i am thinking whatever effect that plan b had on me temporarily remedied the dermatographia Thanks for taking your time to explain. Whenever someone says about a cure for dermatolographia or a way to control it, I become curious. Guess I will get my hormones checked. I started experiencing dermatographia last April. Diagnosed with PCOS the following October. There could be something there!  I literally just googled this! And was happy? to see your post. I have been trying to figure out all of my issues and if they are linked. I have PCOS, dermatographia which showed up 2 years ago, alopecia areata which caused almost total baldness until my current trial that I am in. I gave up on myself after losing my hair and so I gained weight which caused my PCOS to be worse and the dermatographia flared at the same time.\n\nI start metformin and spironolactone today which helped me in the past for my PCOS so hopefully it helps with the dermatographia. If it does then I would bet money it is hormonal.\n\nHave you tried Famotidine, generic pepcid? It is a life saver for my dermatographia.", "Is this dermatographia? I just rubbed my fingernail on my stomach and 2 mins later this happens. Skin is constantly itchy too but only flares up if I scratch it.  Yes, because your skin raised where you scratched it and looks like that Hard yes, this is dermographia. The welt, the constantly itchy skin with red reaction...welcome to the club Fraid so.

Wanted to hear others experiences. If you have tried this, which h1 blocker did you take? And which H2 blocker did you take? Did you experience any side effects?\nThank you fellow skin writers :) I take h1 &amp; h2 blockers on a daily basis. Works well. \n\nIf I take the h1 blocker by itself, it relieves the itching, but the redness remains. The h2 blocker reduces most of the redness. \n\nH1 - Bilaxten (1 in the morning, at least 30 minutes before meal)\nH2 - Ranidine (1 in the evening, after meal) Thank you very much for your reply. I just decided to check this method our hopefully it works Good Luck. I plan on starting it soon. Hope it works for you! Wait, tell me more! Why have not I heard of H1&amp;H2 blockers ? Are they better than anti histamines ? Does it really get rid of the redness ? I am not qualified to give a thorough explanation, but this is what I know. \n\nThey are still antihistamines, but they block different receptors. Most of the over-the-counter antihistamines are H1 blockers. But if H1 blockers alone does not help, you can try taking a H2 blocker. Taking a H2 blocker along with a H1 blocker improves the effectiveness.\n\n Oh ok, thanks a lot ! I am definitely going to look into this.", "Is it genetic? Hey, so I am new to this subreddit and I got to say, I feel welcome considering there is people out there like me, I am 19m and have had dermatographia for basically my whole life, my mom has it and so does my little brother but they have it better off than me. For me, once I scratch once, I cannot stop scratching and the raised bumps get itchy while for my mom and brother, they just get one itch, a small bump and that is about it, they do not need to scratch anymore. I have also compared several bumps with my mom and brother to see how the sizes compare and I seem to get them bigger than both of them even when we apply roughly the same pressure. Do I have like a more severe condition or is it just me looking too much into it? I have the exact same issue. No one else in my family (that i know of) has it but me so not sure if it is genetic. Just one thing that has consistently worked for me is pressing on the area I scratched till it gets warm and raised and the itchy feeling goes away. If you cant control, scratch with your fingers, not nails. Hope that helps. A lot of people have sensitive skin. I see an allergist who is also an infectious diseases guy and he says it is not believed to be genetic. I got a whole lecture about it. I get one every time I go in and ask a question or mention a new \u201csymptom\u201d though.\n\nHe compared it to my telling people I have ADHD and said he is sure a lot of people say they prob have ADHD too when I mention it because they probably forget things or do not concentrate which are completely normal things that happen to humans. People with ADHD have brain function differences than non ADHD people. \n\nItching and welts are common of dry skin, hives, eczema, anxiety etc so many people think they have dermatographism too. \n\nPlease do not think I am saying your family does not have it. They very well could and you guys are unique. \n\nDermatographism shows differently in many people. I know I have a very severe case (regular antihistamines do not lessen my symptoms unlike in other people). Mine also started after I had H. Pylori while other people have not had it or have not been tested. \n\nThe truth is they just do not know much about it. my cousin is the only person i know (except me) that has it, so my case is probably genetic. Well my grandmother has it, my dad has it, and I have it. They say it is not so bad as they have gotten older. But I definitely think it has something to do with genetics. I dont know about my grandmother, but my dad and I were both born with it. All I know that this condition is REALLY painful. But no one in my family has this....  \nMy mum had it for a few years when she was young but then it just went away for her according to her. For me, it is chronic. Have this since birth but it started getting worse after the age of 16. The raised bumps, itching, burning, skin writing, a feeling where I feel like someone is piercing me with pins....I have a severe one. You should go to the dermatologist. I am planning the same.   \nI take anti-histamines daily. But I have to do a proper treatment.

I am not officially diagnosed yet, I am waiting to make a dermatologist appointment when I get home from university for winter break.  But based on images and symptoms alone, there is nothing else that matches my symptoms.  Things started extremely suddenly in September (possible late August) where I would get extremely itchy in certain parts of my body (mainly arms, inner thighs, and legs).  The itches would be so severe that I would literally break blood vessels with how hard I had to scratch to relieve it.  The worst part is that it would go from intense itching to burning to dull pain.  However I did not really correlate a pattern until I moved to my current university.  When these hives and wheals got more frequent and severe, I honestly thought it was because of 1) weather/season change 2) my new location.  For context, I moved from Los Angeles Southern California to Santa Cruz Northern California, for uni.  Nothing explained my hives and I felt increasingly frustrated as people would tell me all sorts of things.  \"Change your detergent\", I have changed my detergent almost three times due to other reasons not related to my dermatographia.  \"Change your clothing\", I had been wearing the same clothing for months and years.  \"Food allergies\", I know allergies can start at any time but I have no history of allergies and no pattern in my diet could make me feel suspicious of it.  All I knew is that my reactions would start with an area of my skin starting to tingle and itch, and then scratching or contact with my clothing would lead to instant hives.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinding this reddit gave me some peace though.  I could start to make sense of what was happening to my body and also let me know to start taking some antihistimines to curb the effects.  But honestly it is been taking a toll on me lately.  I never know when a flare up will happen and sometimes they happen in public where I feel self conscious that people can see the angry red scratches down my body.  They also make it hard for me to concentrate in class where my brain is literally fighting against intense itching and burning.  The benadryl I have been downing to give me any semblance of relief makes me feel constantly exhausted on top of the little sleep I get.  I have yet to go one day without getting a reaction, and now it is so bad that even a hair brushing on my forehead can set my face into hives.  My friends are concerned, my family is concerned, but I am so used to it, the appearance of the hives no longer concerns me.   It is just painful.  This happened out of the blue very suddenly and I have no idea how.  I will be switching to Zrytec soon because I have head from people here that it does not make you feel as drowsy and Benadryl.  Hopefully I can see a derm or doctor soon and see what more I can do to ease my reactions.  It is getting harder to balance my university work with this condition but I will stay positive!", "\u2018Good\u2019 type of Derma?  Good case of Derma?\n\nHello all!\nFirst time posting here, and I was just wondering how many of you have a fairy \u2018good case\u2019 of derma? \n\nI feel as though I have a relatively decent type of dermatographia, I have never been officially diagnosed, but my mum used to work in a doctors surgery and she is pretty certain this is it. \n\nI only really get reactions on what I call \u2018soft skin\u2019, like the under side of my arms and legs, my neck, and sometimes my stomach and back. I get very clear welts which last about 20 minutes. \n\nRecently, with having to wear a mask I get an outline on my face too. \n\nAbout twice a week I will have a bad case of \u2018night itches\u2019 as soon as I get in bed. Like my whole body is on fire. It usually only lasts about half an hour and then subsides. \n\nReading this sub I feel like I have a seemingly mild case, just with very obvious visuals ( if that makes sense lol), I cannot imagine how bad it must be to have the constant itch all the time :(\n\nNot sure how to add a photo to this post though :/\n\nAnyone else have \u2018conditions\u2019 like mine? I would say I have a similar case to you when I take antihistimes daily. I also get night itches like you do as well it is not usually as bad during the day for me but I get marks on me often without knowing. Do you take any antihistimes to deal with your symptoms or use any topical lotions etc? Sound the same as mine. I am usually fine in the day, only bad when I get out of the shower. I do not take anything or use any lotions. All I have done to try and help it is to use fragrance free body lotion and mild shower gels.

Something to consider hi, you can ask for blood histamine levels and undermethylation tests\n\n(\n\nat least that was my case! My doctor told me I could take twice the dosage of Claritan. If you can, try to see a dermatologist or an allergist and see if they recommend that. Also it took me a few days for it to \"build up\" in my system so I did not get improvements until like day 3 or 4 of changing medications Cetirizine hydrochloride, which I believe is Zyrtec, is the only one that would work for me so definitely try it. Start with one dose first to see if that helps. My doctor told me it is ok to double the dose if needed, actually he recommended it when one pill wasnt working as well in the dry winter air. Generic Zyrtec works amazing for me.  You can get a year supply for $18 at Costco.  Pharmacist told me doubling dose does nothing. Give it a week to get intoyour system but just take one a day.  If I miss a dose one day I can usually tell by midday i start sneezing and itching.  If I let it get activated Ill have full on nose drips for a few days and everyone around me thinks im sick. But if I take it consistently in the morning I dont have any symptoms.  My skin still welts a bit when I scratch it but it is managable.  Ive had it since i was very young so i sympathize with you.  Didnt know itching like crazy wasnt normal till i was in my 20's. I used to just scratch to the point of tears some nights until I developed a mind over matter ability, but the zyrtec for me was an absolute quality of life booster. Do you still get the welts on scratching after zyrtec? Not usually, unless I am having a bad itchy day which is very rare. I would honestly work with an allergist if you can find one that will treat it. My routine when it flares up really bad is Zyrtec in the am with a hyrdoxyzine and Zantac. Afternoon Benadryl or Allegra and evening a xyzal with another hydroxyzine. But my allergist was there to monitor me. Now I have weaned back to Zyrtec in the am and xyzal in the pm. At least until my next flare up. Also watch for triggers. I figured out what sets mine into a full flare up is milk. Sorry for the itchiness. We all understand! I actually am going through this right now. I just saw an allergist who put me on Zyrtec and singular. Both because you should not take two Zyrtec a day is what she told me. I am also still taking Benadryl at night just to help me get through the worst of my cycle and settle down the itchiness. \nOne a day Zyrtec helped for a very long time.

Like 30 minute out of control, itching. Usually my back, legs and shoulders. Sometimes face/jaw. (Always had sensitive skin. Allergic to nickel, cheap jewelry etc kids also have severely sensitive skin. Eczema and all)\n\nThe itch intensity really kicked in about a month to month and half ago. I thought it was moisture issue, soap, how I launder my clothes. I have always had the little white bumps when I itch. But I have never itched THIS BAD. I finally found this sub. \n\nSo, I try to write on my skin like you all do, and it welts into the words. But in form of tiny white dot welts. So by first sight, you can read the word, but its bumpy little white dots. \n\nIs this dematographia ? Could be. It could also be that you are ingesting too much nickel. I have cut the nickel in my diet way down in the past two months (my allergist and dermatologist neglected to mention that food and drink were a big source of nickel) and my itching and dermatographia have almost completely disappeared. It is almost miraculous. What type of food contains nickel ? It sounds similar, but the only person who can give you a definitive yes or no diagnosis is a doctor who has personally seen you. I know it is tricky to get to a doctor\u2019s office/on a call currently, so some advice until you can see a professional- 1. Try to keep your skin moisturized if you think that could be a part of the problem. My skin is super sensitive as well and almost every lotion burns but I use Vanicream for sensitive skin and it works great. 2. Do not itch!! If it is dermatographia, that will just cause the areas around where you scratch to also become itchy and it will make everything worse. Use a heating pad, ice pack, lotion, put on gloves, anything that will ease the itchiness and prevent you from scratching. 3. Try to avoid scratching your skin in general if you can. It is kind of cool to be able to write words on your skin but that could start and itching episode or cause damage if you scratch too hard. Good luck! Any water that is not distilled or reverse osmosis filtered can have high nickel. no longer drinking tap water made a huge difference or me. \n\nBuckwheat, wild rice, soy (all legumes), peanuts, beans, lentils, coconut, oats, tree nuts, shellfish, seeds and chocolate are all high enough in nickel that they make me sick every time I have more than a tiny amount. \n\nI highly recommend the nickel navigator app. It has actual measurements of nickel levels in foods, though because nickel naturally varies (due to soil composition, growing conditions and which part of the plant you are ingesting), they are always just going to be rough estimates. Some food measurements vary widely, which is frustrating. Well, I drink straight tap water so I will start there. Thank you \u2606", "Can dermatographia be caused be something you are allergic to? Or is it an allergic response itself? Unclear Super technical question here. I am taking the drug humira for my crohns disease and recently developed dermatographia.

I have not had issues, but I do make sure to use sunscreen and uv protective clothing. I am terrified of getting a sunburn with the dermatographia again. Happened a few times, and it is agony.

It would only flair in summer when I sweat or after a hot shower (cause I am a woman\ud83d\ude44) \nThen, just before the lockdown (I am from SA), it started getting worse like I would flare up just as I woke up and before I went to bed. It gradually started getting worse. I now flare up sporadically during the day. I was advised to take Allecet which helped a lot. I never flared up and I only would if I missed a pill for 24hrs. \n\nMy issue is that I just found out I am pregnant. I cannot take any anti-inflammatories or anti-histamines. It has gotten unbearable. I itch for a good majority of the day. I do not sleep cause a good hour and a half is spent on scratching, trying not to scratch, trying to cool down or really anything to just help the pain. I have not gone to an Obgyn yet (going next week) but the pain is ridiculous. Can anyone help? More so the Dermatologist and Gyneas please IANAD, so apologies if my input is not exactly what you are hoping for. That said, I have lived with dermatographia for 10yrs and have been off antihistamines for about the last 3. Here is my advice on how get through it, though maybe you have already come across all/some. \n\n- This one\u2019s pretty obvious: avoid physical triggers (hot showers, hot tubs, scratchy textiles, and scratching any itch)\n\n- Figure out what works for you to calm the itches. For me, lightly touching or pressing on an itch can usually make it subside. Another thing that helps me is to have skin contact with any non-irritating textile like bed sheets and soft clothes.\n\n- for times that you know you are prone to itchiness, just try to keep yourself distracted. Try watching tv or listening to an audio book as you get into bed. \n\n- Deep breathing and meditation can help get get you through whole-body itchy spells. \n\n- Diet - ( details some foods that are believed to exacerbate symptoms of dermatographia. It also has some tips like staying hydrated and moisturized\n\nThat is all I can think of right now. I really hope some of it helps, and that you can find a doctor that can help as well. I feel your pain of going off the antihistamines. The first two weeks were hellish for me, but it did get better... very slowly. It will get better for you too, but the unfortunate truth is that it is going to be rough. Best wishes for you and the baby. Take out dairy, gluten, and coffee. You are most likely allergic to one of these and its causing leaky gut. I was able to almost completely reverse dermatographia from taking out gluten and coffee. I never flare up anymore and my skin will only raise with big scratches or abrasions.\nAlso a huge supplement is L-Glutamine - does wonders for your gut and immune system and it is super cheap Thank you so much. I am within the first 2 weeks of getting off.  \n\nThe unfortunate part is I have been anemic for 11 years so what a struggle it has been reducing the amount of heat in my showers cause I get cold-FAST.\n\nI have realized if I lightly \u201cwipe\u201d ways at the triggered part, it subsides but it starts somewhere else so what a nightmare \ud83e\udd23 however I am definitely going to look into my diet. So far, I have dropped red meat, struggling with dairy cause it calms my morning sickness down but I will get to it eventually. \n\nThank you. I really appreciate it \ud83d\ude33Whaaaaat? \n\nI have cut out coffee so far. I have cut down hectically on gluten and I am struggling with diary but THANK YOU. I am definitely going to try it out. Yeah np! Look up leaky gut syndrome, it makes a lot of sense as to why it would cause dermatographia in some people. You just need to find out what you are eating that is hurting your gut and most of the symptoms will start going away after a few weeks. I would try this probably after your pregnancy but the easiest (also most difficult lol) way to figure it out is to fast for a few days and then introduce foods back in. You will know almost the day of which food is causing your dermatographia. That is actually how I figured out coffee was also causing the symptoms. Thank you. This has actually helped a lot Coconut oil has really helped me. I keep it on my bedside table and every night I wake up covered in swollen itchy scratches. So I cover them in coconut oil over and over until they slowly stop to itch. Sometimes it takes an hour but that is the only way to somewhat help (if you are not taking an allergy pill). I hope you figure this out because I have always wondered what happens when I become pregnant one day because of this skin condition and taking an allergy pill every single day. Please keep us updated if you find any treatments Thanks for that. I have not tried coconut oil out yet. I will give it a shot I have severe dermatographia and my reproductive endocrinologist said I could take Benadryl in my second and third trimester.

For the past 13 years, ever since my skin writing started I would say about 85-90% of my BMs are loose. Am I alone in this? Mine are irregular frequently (1 out of 3 times maybe). My dermatologist ordered a full body analysis including stool sample analysis and it came normal. \n\nDo you think it has something to do with your dermatographia? Yeah I do,  I have just been managing with 10mg loretadine daily for the past 13 years every now and then skipping a few doses to check in.  Just recently Its not been enough so I bumped to 20mg daily but its got me worried that this might continue to escalate or what if loretadine stopped working all together. That thought has pushed me to start looking more closely at this issue. Anyways, as I read up on it it seems like diet seems to be a trigger for some folks and it got me thinking that maybe my BM\u2019s and this skin thing are connected.

Yeah its not great but its a lot better than what its like unmediated. Like having poison ivy all over my body No I am pretty fit, it was sudden onset for me. One day fine, one day... bam!

Close call!! \ud83d\ude05 I have had GI issues on and off over my life but they have definitely been flaring up as my dermatographia has worsened. I got some bloodwork done that an allergist ordered. Some results were abnormal though not everything is back yet and I have not gotten the doctor's interpretation. I am convinced these things are related for me, but we will see. If you are having multiple issues, you may also want to consider going over them with a doctor to see if there is something systemic to address. Yeah, I know that I really should do that. I am self employed and have high deductible insurance so I just have not prioritized it. I know that I should though Best of luck to you. Sorry that you are stuck with terrible insurance, it is a rotten system we have got. Mast cell activation. \n\nIf you have dermatographia and systemic symptoms ...you most definitely have a mast cell issue. Never heard of it. Will definitely look in to it!! ( did you take any antibiotics around that time? Its very possible but it was so long ago I cannot remember. That link describes so many things about me. What does it mean if you have a mast cell condition? Is there a specific type of specialist we could go see? Mast cells are innate immune cells in the body. They are supposed to activate (degranulate) and release certain mediators (cytokines, histamine, interleukins, catecholamines etc) when your body comes in contact with a specific pathogen (pathogen is a loose term here ...it is really a response to some sort of point of contact with a trigger). \n\nA good analogy here is to think of the response you get (feel?) when you come into contact with an allergen. Your body causes you to sneeze, have watery eyes, itch. When that happens, that is your bodies innate immune system activated and mast cells degranulate and release certain things (such as histamine, interleukins) to mediate the pathogen. \n\nWith a mast cell disorder, the innate immune system has gone rogue and anything the body comes in contact could potentially cause mast cell activation and degranulation, thus, causing a whirlwind of responses. \n\nA good analogy here is to eating food. You have no known IgE food allergies and you like to eat bananas. Without a mast cell disorder you could eat all the bananas you would want and not have any serious issues with eating that type of food. With a mast cell disorder, you could eat a banana one day and not have any issues or reactions only to go into anaphylaxis the very next day once you have consumed such banana. (This happened to me two months ago). \n\nThat all said, there are three commonly *known* mast cell disorders: hereditary alpha tryptasemia (HAT); mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic); and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).\n\nPrevalence in terms of how common they are go like this: HAT = Super rare; Mastocytosis = Rare; MCAS = ? - it is not really known but is suspected to be way more common than the other two disorders. \n\nI have systemic mastocytosis where via genetics, my body creates too many mast cells in my bone marrow. These mast cells can line the organs of the body and wreck havoc on then. \n\nI have skin, liver, bladder, and most importantly, GI involvement where mast cells like to conjugate. \n\nI have urticaria pigmentosa, dermatographia, and other forms of urticaria ...in addition to, skin (red ) (cyanotic) flushing due to histamine and interleukin release which can stem from (food, emotions, medications, etc). In addition to that, I have activation that involves GI issues relating to diarrhea, gastoparesis, GERD, extreme stomach cramping, bloating etc). Moreover, I can have hepatomegaly during a strong reaction which looks pretty freaky because I can visibly see my liver bowed out during such response. I can have hypotension and extreme heart palpitations during a reaction in addition to anaphylaxis related to pretty much any type of trigger. \n\nAs I said above, one day I can be fine and the very next day do practically the same thing from the day prior and have a reaction (potentially going into anaphylaxis). \n\nAs for doctors, an allergist/immunologist should be the first doctors to see. Followed by a hematologist, then potentially a rhumatologist  MCAS is not widely known currently and most doctors probably would not know about the disorder since it is still an newcoming disorder that needs to be fully recognized. \n\nSystemic mastocytosis and HAT are known a little more but prevalence is severely uncommon. Thank you so much for this information! I definitely feel like I can bring this up with my Doctor. I worry she will not know what I am trying to ask for. Hopefully I can speak to her with confidence about this. Thanks again Have you tried taking probiotics? I developed dermatographia after taking antiobiotics, but after taking probiotics (liquid form) it went away after like a couple of weeks... but, it also helped regulate me! A lot of IBS sufferers take probiotics for this reason.\n\nYou have to take them everyday for a couple of weeks though, and it is recommended you take them at the same time of day every day (like every morning or at night) I have it too! I have chalked it up to my antihistamines :/ I am in the same boat with loose stools. I would HIGHLY recommend getting a bidet insert for your toilet. When I have to travel and go without it I develop irritation, but at home with the bidet I have no discomfort.", "Just found out what dermatographia is today. Im pretty sure I have a classic case. Confused because histamines do not help at all. Could it be related to the thyroid?  This all started maybe 4-5 years ago, not sure what triggered it :/ moisturizing helps a lot, but Benadryl does absolutely nothing for it. I had my blood work done, and my dr put me on meds to bring my thyroid levels back to normal now, but it is been going on. Does this ever go away? Feels like it happened over night. Dermatographia is an autoimmune disease and cases vary from person to person. I have had it for over 30 years, and I doubt it will ever go away with me. Some people only have it a few months. \n\nYou might try a different antihistamine, to see if it helps keep it under control a little better.", "Try calamine? Hi friends.

I did not know what it was until I googled it tonight. At least I have answers now...  Antihistamines and moisturisers are your best mates, trust me. Helps with the tiger attacks. Xyzal and Allegra together worked for me. Thanks guys", "Bed bugs and dermatographia Has anyone dealt with bedbugs and dermatographia? My question is do bedbugs cause a flare up or are bedbug bites distinctly itchy in their own way, apart from a possible Zyrtec withdrawal or a flare up. Experienced both, unfortunately!  Bed bug bites are a lot like flea bites.  They are usually in 3s.  The best way to find out if you have bed bugs is to look for them, or evidence of them.  \n\n( some information.\n\nI discovered evidence in my apartment along a shared wall in the bedroom.  I used a flashlight and examined under the carpet against the wall and found a bunch of dead ones/skin/little black specks (their poop).  I was also able to find live ones in the screw wells in various parts of my Ikea bed frame.  They are ridiculously tiny!  And fast!\n\nGood luck.  I still have PTSD from my experience so I am hoping for you that it is just dermatographia. I upped my Zyrtec dose for a day and it improved. Still have the drawing feeling across my body tho. I do scorched earth on the bugs tho. Diatomaceous earth, neem oil, allergen setting on my washing machine and peppermint and lemongrass oils on dryer balls. In addition to beg bags and pillow bags. If I had them, I do not now lol. \nStill trying to pinpoint a reason for the flare tho and have not found anything conclusive but this has gotten me to take my dermatographia seriously, so thankful for this community. My dermatographia ended up being caused by an allergy to dairy (the whey part in particular).  I also found the docs to be unhelpful so I tried an elimination diet (hellish).  Found out afterwards that a blood test exists that can test for food allergies.  Maybe give that a try. Great tip, I am scheduling an allergist ASAP.", "Boosted recently and developed what I now know as Dermatographia. I thought I was going insane. I kept itching really bad and could not help but scratch it. I would even scratch it without thinking and it would whelp up so badly that people would stare, ask if I was okay. It is annoying for the most part. Everyone kept telling me it was stress. And I kept thinking, well, what am I stressed about? I am doing completely okay. Well, last week it finally made me absolutely enraged and frustrated. I went to my doctor and she did not know either. Said it was similar to something she would heard of because I could write on my skin. Nothing I did helped. Well, tonight, I had finally had it after taking a shower and it worsening. I looked up my symptoms, saw some pictures and descriptions VERY similar to mine. And stumbled upon this r/. I was boosted about two and a half weeks ago. I am so relieved to know other people are having this issue because I was about to give up and say it was stress. Is there anything to ease it up a little? I have been trying some hydrocortisone creams and liquids. But nothing seems to ease it for long enough. I am trying an oatmeal bath tomorrow.", "Got the Covid vaccine!

Thank you so much for taking the time to post! I am so glad it helped someone else!", "What treatment are you taking for dermatographia? Hi everyone, I got dermatographia 2 months back and still it is irritating and annoying. I am taking cetrizine to reduce the itchy hives. I do not like to take medicine for life long. This red patches making me sick and disturbing. Have you tried any other treatment to control it? I have had it for over 30 years, basically at some point I just gave up and accepted that I will always have to deal with it and treatment was not an option. Hopefully you find something that works for you though. Thanks for your reply. I feel sorry for you that you had for 30 years. I had it 12 years ago and it gone in few months. Are you taking any antihistamines regularly to control it? There is no cure, only medications to attack symptoms. You might get lucky and it might get better and go away on its own. That happens to some people. Others like me have it 26 years later and probably will for the rest of my life. I do not take anything for it, honestly after time I have learned to ignore the itchiness. For a while in my 20s I became a bit of an attraction on graveyard shift, by writing notes on my arm with a paperclip... I am also trying to accept it. I hope you feel better soon. I will try to avoid medicine and ignore the itching hives. Hopefully it should go away sometime. At urticaria  diagnosis, Zyrtec.  Once diagnosed  thyroid disease, no Zyrtec, thyroid meds only, and now dermatographia  GONE for over 5 yrs as long as I keep up with thyroid meds. That is good to know. I am having hypothyroidism and taking levothyroxine 50 mcg. May be should I increase my dosage to control dermatographia? That is me, and Hashimoto's.  My levo level is not much higher.  I am not a medical professional and do not  know your case, so pls ask your doctor.  \n\nEdit... What would happen if u stopped  antihistamines  for several  days?  Tried that yet? Ok thanks I will check with my doctor about this thyroid issue. We replied so fast not sure u saw my edit... What would happen if u stopped antihistamines for several days? Tried that yet? If I stop antihistamines then slowly itching red hives coming all over the body and bothering so much. If our thyroid level is normal, then dermatographia controlled? Shucks.  Wish I could say... every body is different,  but for me it seems so. When I was diagnosed they told me I have Cholinergic uticaria which is heat hives, I dont get any welts or anything but my skin starts to turn pink as if somebody smacked me. If you break out in heat or sunlight like I do, the best thing for me that tends to work faster than antihistamines is just finding somewhere cool to sit down. No antihistamines seem to work well for me and many not at all. If I know im going to be in the heat and I cant help it, I have found that if you are able to work enough to sweat that sometimes it goes away, but my legs hate any form of wetness and it always causes a reaction on my legs so be warned, you might have the same thing happen to you. Its called sweat therapy if you are interested. I also found that by cutting back on fried or fatty foods my condition betters a bit, but that could be different for you. It got a lot easier over time, I still miss swimming though :( Nothing really, only a Zinc solution when it is really annoying. Thanks for your reply. How do you use zinc? Is it zinc tablet or cream? Does it control the itching? (\n\nIt is original intention is for neurodermatitis.\n\nAnd I meant micro silver, not zinc apparently.. my bad.\n\nIt gets completely rid of the itching in an area almost immediately. Could not wish for a better treatment. Never tried the usual stuff since this works perfectly fine. Thanks I need to slowly stop the antihistamines and control Dermographia. Hopefully it should go away! Hey , this is exactly what happens with me. Started exactly an year ago . Since then , i have stopped taking certain foods , like coffee , sugar, soft drinks , peanuts , refined flours , fried foods etc and including natural foods like aloe vera juice ,green veggies , whole grains , fruits also helped a lot.\n\nStill I cannot go out in the mid day sun , cause my body starts to heat so much and i still have dermatographia , hives from scratching , but there has been some improvement in the itching.\n\nThe sweat thing is also true in my case. When i workout in the gym  , as soon as my body starts sweating , i feel really good.", "Popping Pimples with Dermatographia I have just recently developed this condition. Something I have noticed is that when I pop any zits or pimples on my face, those spots swell up like a balloon for about 30 mins.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? Is this just a consequence of having Dermatographia? Does anyone have any remedies that relieve this swelling? (I have tried antihistamines but they do not do anything for me). I feel like applying pressure on anywhere on my skin causes the swelling, so yes, even on the face it does happen to me as well. But honestly, I do not think there is really any way to avoid this; dermatographia is just shitty all around. I am just waiting for the day when I wake up one morning and it is gone forever. Until then, hang in there! The same thing happens to me if I scratch my face or rub my eyes too hard. The only thing I have found that is somewhat helpful sounds a little silly- you can buy a jade or metal face roller for a reasonable price on Amazon and keep it in the freezer to use when your face gets puffy and itchy. It seems to help with redness and swelling and also feels pretty great. Hope this helps! Yup exaclty the same thing I second this suggestion! Occasionally I would wrap an ice pack in a paper towel and just press it against my face to reduce swelling.", "Tattoo with Dermatographia. People had some questions about getting a tattoo with dermatographia, and I wanted to answer any questions since I just got a new tattoo a few days ago.  It hurt during the process, but that is to be expected. It was very red and its still swollen. My  dermatographia has only recently started, so this was my first tattoo while suffering from this. The biggest thing I noticed that was different than tattoos I have had before is how sensitive it is. It still hurts quite a bit and that is not something that is happened before. Wow! So, how did the tattoo artist work around the welts? Did you take extra meds for this? Any extra itching or welts after the tattoo in that place? And any special non-allergic ink or normal ink? I would like to mention that I currently do not take any medication for itching or welts. So no, I did not take any extra, but it was okay. \nI think this artist was talented enough to work around the swelling, but it was a pretty quick tattoo as well, which I think helped. He did not use anything special! My arm was welted from the tape he used to bandage it, but I did not notice any welts on the tattoo site. It does not itch (Yet) because it is still fresh... fingers crossed it does not get too itchy, lol. As far as welts tho, I really did not notice any on the tattoo site. I was surprised by this but I am glad! It is really good to know that getting a tattoo is possible. Now I might even get myself a tattoo one day. I had   thought that getting one was out of question. Thanks for sharing your experience. The disorder only seems to be onset by abrasion of the first layer of skin. I think this is exemplified by how tattoos can work, as the needle goes down to the second dermal layer. Is this your only tattoo? I have about 40+ hours of work done and my arms have never been a problem. Back, legs and butt are the worst. This is my 8th tattoo! This particular part of my arm hurt really bad but I wonder if it has to do with my recent issues with dermatographia. I have got a tattoo on my neck and the pain was comparable to this tattoo! Nice to know. I have always been afraid to get one. I always thought, \"What if it makes me constantly itchy and unbearable?\" After years of suffering now I am able to keep the itch under control by regular medication and by avoiding certain triggers and allergens. Well the problem would not be a recurring itch but what I was first scared of was the tattoo being distorted by swelling as I am getting it. But it does not look like that happens. Interesting to know! I have 2 tattoos and both of them were after my onset (and before starting antihistamines), so it is nice to read a comparison. My artists did not seem to have any issues with it. My skin did welt, but it was not nearly as bad as I anticipated. the really interesting thing with getting tattoos (and I have heard this from other dermatographs) I had three sessions and mine did not pop up at all (unlike the way it pops up for normal skins). Ironically, it almost seems like dermatographs have the perfect skin for tattooing. I just got two tattoos last weekend! Absolutely nothing about it triggered a reaction. Everywhere else on my body has been freaking out as usual but my tattoos are totally fine! I did take a Zyrtec the morning of though to be sure. Also the artist used a CBD tattoo balm during so that could have made a difference? I have not noticed any increased pain, swelling, or itchiness in healing. The second skin they put on top I did have a reaction to, though, when I took it off. Went away after a few hours. any updates nearly a month later? did it take longer to heal than your others?

I think its because I am allergic to a lot of outdoor allergies and now I am not exposed to any of that. Funny how the conventional wisdom is that dermatographia is idiopathic, but when we reduce our allergen exposure it almost completely disappears. When I cut down on my intake of nickel and salicylates, this solved the problem for me. This was never suggested as a possible result when those two allergies were diagnosed. And just not getting hot rushing around too fast \ud83d\ude02 Mine has gotten worse After quarantine mine got worse. Right after a hefty does of antibiotics Same! But some of us are not allergy related.  An allergist/immunologist told me I had to spend the rest of my life on Zyrtec because I could spend hundreds and thousands of dollars doing tests to determine the cause of my hives/itching but we would never figure it out. Then when I pushed back and asked him again with the cause of my hives was, he said well it could be your thyroid but that would also be a waste of money getting that tested. I walked out of his office and never returned again, then went home and booked an appointment with an endocrinologist because my mom previously had thyroid cancer and I wanted to be checked out. After bloodwork turns out I no longer take allergy medication, my thyroid is being treated, and my hives are totally gone as long as I keep up with thyroid meds.", "For those who developed this condition after getting a booster - has it gone away? I have very recently realized that my recent onset of dermatographia is related to the booster. I am a bit frustrated about it, but cannot figure what to expect for the future.\n\nI am wondering about people's experiences. Has anyone had this resolve on its own? Or is to too early to tell?", "Do you suffer from conditions related or or arising from your dermographia? Hey everyone! I am new this subreddit.

Would be grateful for your thoughts I have alexithymia which I think were my condition for dermatographia came from due to lack of stress management. for me mental health is the biggest factor on how my dermatographia  presents itself. when I am stressed I can feel it regardless of allergy medication when I feel great it goes away. Same situation with me too. I am having trouble in breathing for last 2-3 months and had dermatographia for last 8-9 months. You think it is not asthma?", "Sharing my Story W/ Moderna Booster Hi all, I developed hives about 10 days after my Moderna Booster shot on 11/23/2021. It became so severe I was out of work for a week with hand swelling, arm pain, and just intense redness and itching from the hives. The arm which I received the booster had noticeably more swelling than the other. I had to go to the ER and was on Prednisone 40mg for 4 days. Doctors said it could be from the vaccine, but there are still no resources to tell. I have never been allergic to anything in my life, nor had any health conditions. I have also never had hives or any skin conditions in my life either. I exercise frequently, and am the healthiest person you would ever meet. I have been left with no explanation or resources to help deal with this issue that I see if affecting others. Today, I am still experiencing full body hives and skin sensitivity. As soon as my skin is touched it will turn red and I will feel heat in that area.This is one of the only places I have found many others dealing with this issue. I have already reported to Vaers as well. It seems that mainstream media will not talk about this enough &amp; we are left to deal with these effects from a vaccine we are encouraged daily to get.

This is me every morning when playing with my pup!", "Living with dermatographia - it can get better! So like many of you, I broke out into hives a few days after finishing a course of antibiotics for a UTI about 3 weeks ago, and have had dermatographia ever since the hives subsided. Went to the ER at the height of the hives and the tests actually showed that the UTI had not gone away and I am currently on my second round of antibiotics...still TBD whether the infection or the dermatographia will subside. \n\nAnyway I wanted to post some words of encouragement here, because in my first week suffering from this condition I turned to this subreddit, read about people suffering with this condition for years, and absolutely bawled my eyes out. At that point, the itching was so bad it kept me from daily life. It kept me from sleeping. My whole body was swelling up just from my own scratching. It was absolute hell and I will be honest that some seriously dark thoughts crossed my mind: how long am I actually capable of living like this?\n\nThe hopeful news that I have a few weeks later is actually NOT that my dermatographia has been cured. For the last few days my symptoms have gone down and then today I had a flare up. The good news is that either my skin or my brain has somehow learned to turn the itching down a bit. I feel it but it is less maddening. I can scratch once and then stop, even though I am still getting the same marks that I got weeks ago. I did not think this would be possible two weeks ago so I just wanted anyone stumbling upon this page like I did to know that even if your dermatographia is not totally cured, it is ok. There can be a normal life with this condition. Yesterday was my first full day back working (luckily self employed so I can be a little flexible) and I have not had to think all day every day about itching.

Zyrtec works best for me and most of us it seems It seems to be different for everyone, i have seen some horrific stories of people saying antihistamines were not even helping them. In my case in the first few months it was so bad I was taking antihistamines everyday and now it seems to have calmed down and i am fine most of the time fine without antihistamines, its just the red marks where I scratch which tend to annoy me.

Before that I was at a healthy weight.\n\nI have thought about whether sweating more, weight gain or unconsciously scratching (Dermato.) might be the culprit, but I do not know much about Eczema and if these could even be causes.\n\nI am curious, has anyone with Dermatorgaphia regularly experienced Eczema? Are these comorbid conditions? Could it be because of weight gain? Holy shit. I have been wondering about this myself. I have had it for about 2 years as well, and about a month or so ago I started getting these patches all over my upper arms and neck. I did not know what it was, but when I read this I looked it up and now I am 99% sure it is eczema. Of course without a diagnosis we wont j know for sure, but it sure as hell looks like it.\nI do not think it is because of the scratching. I am a 24 year old male, and I have basically trained myself not to scratch at all, but I still got these damn patches. I. Did gain a little weight, around 7kg, but funnily enough the patches started showing up about a month after I started dieting. Do you enjoy drinking? I have been drinking a lot over the past year but my alcohol use has gone way up since around November, so I wonder if that might be the culprit. Omg this is crazy.... Yes I have started drinking way more, ever since the pandemic hit. i thought of this as well but was a bit ashamed to admit it. Personally I feel like there is nothing wrong with whetting the whistle every now and then. I moved to Tokyo a year ago and the drinking is the only thing keeping me sane, however I think that my skin seems to disagree with that notion. I also have a history of eczema and allergies, it is most likely a disposition. Do you have any food allergies? My first and only incident with dermatographia so far happened when I had to take 2 different antibiotics back to back since the the bacteria that caused my UTI was resistant to the first antibiotic. I did not notice any GI issues but I know there is a link to GI and immune response, I.e. skin rashes. I am allergic to many foods so I am sure that is why I have eczema. The dermatographia was terrible and lasted a few weeks. It would appear anywhere on my body randomly and when I scratched it would leave streaks and raised lesions. I put a lot of hydrocortisone which helped and took Benadryl to sleep. A few weeks after I fished the last round of antibiotics I have not had an incident since. I actually do not have any food allergies, I am not allergic to anything, except scratching haha. Glad to hear yours went away! Eczema for 22+ yrs, dermatographia 11 yrs later.

I am sorry for the weird question, this is my last resort. I do not know, give me a few minutes. Ok after doing some experimentation i think it could potentially leave some welts. Thank you to your contributions to science! can you explain the potential? \ud83d\ude2d Well i tried a few things scratching did not do much but i thing it was a mater of power which i was not willing to use much of, pinching did form a bit of a welt.

This is not supposed to be a racist question. I have been suffering from dermatographia for several years and been a  memeber of multiple online communities over the years and have interacted with several fellow sufferers. All the images I have seen are that of light skinned people. But I have yet to come across a person with dark skin suffering this. (Maybe I h\u00e0ve not looked properly). I just want to know if this has something to do with skin colour. \nSince we still do not know what causes dermatographism, I want to know if such detailed profiling exists anywhere. Interesting  question.   After 10 minutes, I cannot  find anything  online. I guess dermographia affects people with light skin more because there skin is not as good as dark skin when it comes to handling sun light energy because if we look at people in Australia many people suffer form skin cancer due to if exposure on light skin.Or maybe light skin makes red rashes look way worse then it is as compared to brown or black skin. Yeah..shows that a lot of research needs to be done in this subject. I wonder if anywhere in the world some research is going on to cure dermatographia.. Yeah. Are there any dark skinned people with dermatographia in this group? &gt;But I have yet to come across a person with dark skin suffering this.\n\nWell, I will be the one. I am South Asian, with brown skin. I have dermatographia. I cannot speak if this is a common occurrence for lighter skin vs darker skin, but let me be a representative on the darker side of melanin. I think in the case for me, I only found out I had skin-writing when I was well over 20. No one diagnosed me with it, my mother thought I was allergic to cow's milk (mind you, she was raised up as a Hindu, and she would say that we do not eat beef because of the mad-cow disease, but clearly there is a bias there). I was most diagnosed with eczema, hives, etc. But it is clear that I have skin-writing (dermatographia). I have seen a black person on here with it, I also knew knew a Latina with darker skin who had it This sub is English language and generally in English speaking countries, darker skinned people have worse healthcare outcomes. I suspect that no matter the actual rates of occurrence in darker skinned people, it is probably underdiagnosed. It looks like a minor condition unless you are actually experiencing the discomfort of it, so it seems very likely to be overlooked or dismissed by medical professionals. It might even be harder to see visually on darker skin tones. This is a highly valid point too. But still no pics available on the net yet. you may be right I am also also a person with brown skin (on the lighter side). I am asking about full dark skin. Thanks. I guess it is common to all then. You are welcome. Thanks I am black with a lot of melanin. I have had dermatographia since I can remember and I am 17 now I have really sensitive skin I have passed the eczema parts but the dermatographia is not getting better. I can show a picture it is very noticeable but it does not turn red I just took my tablet so I will take a picture when it acts up again Thanks for the reply. Too bad that you have been suffering for so long. I guess we can conclude that this disease does not discriminate.", "Could it be mold? My girlfriend has this and it started in June after we moved into a new house that is 40+ years old and had mold in the crawlspace. Has anyone considered this? Just trying to figure it out for her. I think it is probably pretty common that the cause is an allergy. My dermatographia was really extreme until I removed most of the nickel from my diet after that allergy was diagnosed. Now it is nearly nonexistent From food ? Interesting Unfortunately. It is impossible to avoid 100% in a balanced diet because it is in most veg. I cannot eat any seeds, nuts or legumes. Although I too have mold in my house I am pretty certain I got Dermatographia after taking an antibiotic. This seems pretty common on this subreddit, but I have also seen some pretty random ways people have gotten it to. I will say it seems kind of unlikely that a mold would trigger her immune system to attack her skin, but I am not a doctor so take this with a grain of salt. Could be mold... most are allergy related, mine is thyroid  disease", "There are people like me.... I just found this community (via dermatographia.com) today and I legit cried. I have had this condition the past 10 years and never figured out what it was. Bloodwork - all normal. Allergy tests - just pollen, which does not explain why I get itchy welts after staying indoors all day in winter. I have replaced every product in my house to no avail and cried to sleep so often. I thought I was seriously the only one who had this condition. And now to find an entire community of people who are just like me... idk. I am relieved to finally put a name to what this is. Do you find temperature is a trigger? Its a huge one for me but took forever to pinpoint it was temp related. If I went from cold to hot or hot to cold too fast for my skin to adjust (eg summer into air conditioned room) it would start up. I found for me that is one of my biggest triggers but working with a dermatologist has greatly reduced the frequency of occurrence (it used to be almost daily sometimes whole body other times a more targeted area) Yes! Temp is a big one for me, mostly heat (cold is not that bad). Ice packs and cooling lotions are my saviors.

Mw too unfortunately:/ Here for more answers but\u2026\nI got my third shot and started getting rashes about 3 weeks later. Pretty sure I have developed dermatographia now. My doc prescribed me a steroid Creme first, then I got a steroid shot on Tuesday. Got better and now I feel it is kind of the same\u2026 :/ Same. Shit. Glad I am not alone it is impossible to find anything on this Yeap! No just that, Also I became allergic almost to everything, every cream I had, shampoo, hair conditioner, soap, all my perfumes and etc . . . I became food sensitive, no IgE mediated allergy, but still reactive. It is called Mast cell activation, check it. Mast cell got activated by vax ((((( it is my biggest regret! I got allergies after vax. I have never had allergies before. I had to throw all my face creams, perfumes, shampoos and etc . . . I could not eat, cause I was getting reactions after food, I lost almost 10 kilos. Check Mast cell activation disorder. My Mast cells got activated after vax (but in a bad way). I have to do low histamine diet, take antihistamines and Quercetin (it is known to be natural Mast cell stabiliser) look at my comments below or above. I did moderna vax 6 months ago( still have allergies (got them after the shot) and it is getting worse((( My story is that I got my second shot end of May. A week later I caught the common cold so I took pseudoephedrine for it. I started itching like crazy so not sure if the vaccine or the drug did it. But it is pretty much gone 4 months later. I really do not know if the third shot is worth it if it makes it flare up again. yep it showed up about two weeks after my booster shot (moderna) and is still going strong another two weeks down the line. had nothing similar beforehand except that i was allergic to mosquitos &amp; penicillin. eek ack ook", "Comes and goes? So I guess I have dermographism. Insane itchy \"rash\" since spring. I did the skin test and sure enough bumpy letters appears within minutes. \n\nIs it normal for it to come and go? Like some days you do not have it? Some days are mild and some severe? It is like flare ups? Is that right?\n\nAlso, have you ever had deeper tissue swelling? Like swollen fingers, toes, lips, elbows? Full on giant hives? \n\n(I do have an allergist we did a virtual visit a few weeks ago, he ordered blood work, and then more blood work, I will bring this up to him) I am guessing it is very individual, but for me personally, it will not come and go day by day wise, it is more that I have s few months with less itching and then a few months with more itching. \n\nSome foods might make your histamine levels go down though (just like antihistamines will) and perhaps you are eating the right kind of foods that day. Yes for me its very much related to stress! Its always there, but on a stressful day even with anti histamines my skin itches immensly, and then the next day its not too bad at all. \n\nI havent had any problems with swollen fingers but I do have my upper lip swell sometimes. My boyfriend tells me I sleep with my thumb sometimes, and the warmth of that makes it so I sometimes wake up and due to the temp difference and the friction it swells up! Or when I go outside our warm home into the cold air outside. \n\nMy biggest tip is to just stay free of stress (the hardest to master for me) and also take anti histamines like Ceterizine or Desloraterine (idk if I spelled that right sorry) Yes and yes! For me, my level of rash/swelling/hives depends on the amount of my allergens in my diet. I am allergic to nickel and salicylates, so unfortunately they cannot be avoided 100%.  That has been the biggest mystery for me. Doctors in my experience kind of shrug it off even after diagnosing it; they do not understand how awful it can be, so there is very little guidance. Mine is bad enough that I am often having to explain it to coworkers, etc. \n\nI have had it for 10 years, but during certain periods it will lessen or even completley dissappear for the most part for up to a month. But then it always comes back. It has been very bad recently, but varies from day to day with alternatively one day being normal bad and the next day I go into a room without realizing I touched anything and my arms are covered with the horrible chains of itching red welts where it had any touch, I am burning and itching, and my husband despite being used to it now is shocked at its appearance.

And it is been enough time for the meds to be long gone \n\n Anyone else have just had theirs disappear? Will it come back? Definitely considering keeping up with the Zyrtec just in case. !!! Similar situation. I took general antihistamines for years and when I stopped a few days later I found out I had Dermatographia. After a couple years of taking them I tried to stop and after a week and a half of my skin flaring up it calmed down. That was one year ago last month and now I am fine. I get small flare ups every once in a while but not as severe with antihistamines.\n\nI assume that taking antihistamines for so long (I did for 5ish years for allergies since my mom told me to take them) has caused the body to increase the histamine response to return it to normal levels, and when stopping meds the increased levels stay the same until dissipation a few weeks later. Try experimenting by not taking antihistamines for a couple weeks and see what the result is. It may be difficult but that is what worked for me. I realized that antihistamines are related to thyroid issues which I have suspected I have since I always feel warmer thsn those around me but I have no hard evidence to prove it. I recommend stopping antihistamines for the long term and take them as needed (though I have not since getting off them).\n\nPlease update us to let us know what happens and Good Luck! When I was diagnosed my allergist said it usually goes away after 3 - 5  years.\n\nIt is been 17 years. Maybe I will try what aguaman  suggests and not use the meds for a little while.

It was difficult to get off meds. 5th day was the worst but then gets better When were you diagnosed? About 6 years ago. Stopped taking Antihistamines last August 1st 2020 Cool. I wonder how much has been learned since my diagnosis. I have not seen an allergist or dermatologist about it since we found the antihistamine that worked well. I found out that a low histamine diet, no meds and supplementing l-methionine, q10, vitC, calcium, d3, k2 and mg could aid high histamine blood and unsermethylated people (my case) .\n\nNo flares for almost 3 weeks and I started eating some high histamine foods little by little (avocados ftw) I am slowly cutting back my dose (currently on 8% of a regular dose), and this is working for me.

Should I put cetrizine everyday to control it? Are you getting red patches when it wears off, or right after taking it? It usually starts to wear off after 12 hours. If you get the redness right after taking it, try a different antihistamine, like Allegra. If it is when it is wearing off, try taking it more often. Usually I get itchy red hives but after taking cetrizine it really helping in reducing the itches but red patches appearing and disappearing in few mins. Ok I will try different allergy medication.

I get full body hives that can last between ~5-6 hours to a couple days if I do not take my allergy medicine the second I see symptoms and I have other issues like anxiety, allergies, and skin problems that seem to trigger it as well. The frequency of the flare-ups when they do happen has gone down a lot from before as I have been taking a lot better care of both my mind and body but when they do happen they still last forever and it is incredibly distressing. \n\nAlso if I shave, the whole area will be swollen and irritated for like a week until hair grows out enough (ingrowns).

Yes, zyrtec... amazing stuff..  Tested for allergies or thyroid yet?  I had a borderline Ana test also and if I remember correctly that is for inflammation/ autoimmune. Zyrtec did wonders but thyroid medication is what treats me thanks to Hashimoto's  thyroiditis.   \n\nWhat doctor are you seeing? It may be time for a second opinion, like endocrinologist  or rheumatologist. This is why my body looks like without fail if I miss taking a zyrtec on time. Like the other comments, taking a zyrtec or generic antihistamine (costco/sam's club will sell you a bottle of 365 if you have that option available) is the best day-to-day for me to avoid the horrible itching. \n\nAlso I second the other comment here about seeking a second opinion if you can. Some docs are willing to put in a little more time than others regarding this condition. A day in the life of a dermatographic. Is this over the counter ? Yes Yes! If you have a Walgreens, Target, CVS, place with a pharmacy, etc., you can easily find a bottle of zyrtec or generic brand antihistamine. Speaking as a US resident though, so I apologize if my advice is not helpful. No rheumatologist will look at me without a \u201csuggested\u201d diagnosis &amp; referral from PCP.

I have been suffering with dermatographia for the past 15 years at least with minimal success and was so happy to find out that there is a sub for people who also suffer from it/put up with it! It is great to feel like I am not alone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, I was just watching a youtube video about IPL and wondered if anyone has tried it, or even tried laser? One of the biggest issues for me with my skin-writing is that when I shave, the feeling of the hair growing back is one of the biggest irritants to my skin and how active my dermatographia is. I will be fine on the day that I shave and then the following day I cannot stop scratching even when taking a double dose of antihistamines. I usually resort to having to put Vagisil on my underarms as they are the worst culprit for being scratchy and obviously I do not particularly want to put a thrush cream on my underarms haha. So yeah, I was just wondering if anyone has had any success with IPL or laser or just in general how to deal with shaving. I can usually deal with getting my eyebrows waxed, but on more sensative areas I am more cautious and i bloody hate threading, it is so painful! My hobbit looking legs thank you in advance! Oh man, this is me too! I have not tried laser so I cannot answer the question but you are not alone. In fact, for me, this was the start of dermatographism. My underarms were just so incredibly itchy, especially after shaving, and then it just spread from there to the rest of my body. I have also not tried IPL but have stopped shaving all together and opted to start trimming with a nice pair of shears. I can get pretty close to the skin and there is no itchy grow in. This works on my legs, armpits and privates The process does take longer however I have had ipl facials over the past couple of years (facials are a different setting on the machine) and Ive had successful series of laser hair removal (for axilla, bikini and legs) about 15 years ago... my last \u2018touch up\u2019 was over 5 years ago. I have always had dermatographia. The laser hair removal (sorry... I do not remember the machine) was life changing! I had similar issues and not having to shave and have that constant irritation and all that goes with it... has been really wonderful. I remember during all treatments I would have an exaggerated response at the time but it would dissipate within about 30 mins to a \u2018regular\u2019 response. Basically I just would get very very red... I always spoke with technicians beforehand about my skin. I was always the first dermatographia they had treated and derm offices were the only places that even knew what it was. The first few times for laser hair they did lower settings... no positive results but could tell my skin could handle it with no negative/ long term issues. Luckily I initially worked with one amazing women who eventually was able to use even higher settings on me than she used with many people... and I had wonderful results. \n\nSince she retired a long time ago Ive learned to always research the lasers first (for hair removal touch ups or facial etc). I look up the recommended settings for people with my coloring on the Fitzgerald scale before going in for an appointment. I take an extra allergy pill before getting anything done, and I very briefly explain dermatographia and my skin if it is someone new or unfamiliar....basically, I tell them that it means my skin is going to look very very red and angry during treatment (so please do not be scared lol) but 4-5% of the population have it and I have had laser treatments before and these are the settings I would like and the results I get and would they be comfortable with that) I hate! being that obnoxious person (I am very nice, apologetic and grateful... plus it is extra important to tip well if it is a tech and not owner (I have worked in similar jobs)) but if I do not do this whole thing I end up being treated with settings that are so low that I get no positive/desired results.\n\nEveryone is skin is different - so low settings, at first, make sense (some places will offer a free spot test and consultation) but if it continues it would be a waste of your time and money. \n\nIpl facials felt like rubber bands snapping against my skin. Bikini and under arm laser hair removal HURT! But it was without question totally and unquestionably worth it, for me. Also while my skin looked \u2018angrier\u2019 initially (I really did scare some people even while promising them I was fine and really trying to get them to laugh lol) the redness and sometimes swelling faded to a \u2018normal/expected\u2019 reaction within 30 mins to an hour.\n\nSorry for the convoluted rant... and maybe you are skin could be more sensitive or the initial response could last longer or maybe you will not even have an exaggerated response at first at all... but I just wish someone had explained all this to me and that I had more info when I first started \ud83d\ude02 \nHope this helps and if you decide to do it I hope you get amazing results and some deserved relief!", "2 weeks post Covid MRNA vaccine Newcomers blessed with developing dermatographia post Covid vaccine\u2026\u2026 did it go away?

", "something is off with my skin i cannot remember a time where i did not have dermatographia, so i have had it for a long time. however, last night, i noticed my legs had dermatographia bumps (in a pattern like a cow\u2019s) all over my legs. i went to sleep, but when i woke up, the SAME exact pattern was still there! it has not gone down one bit for more than 12+ hours. does anyone with dermatographia have any experience with a situation like this? maybe something with your bed sheets and the way you had them pressed against your skin/slept with them? has it gone away since? sorry! i forgot to take down the post- it turned out that i had hives, i was so used to seeing my dermatographia that i did not consider it to be anything else. thank you for the comment\ud83d\uddfd", "Tight fitting clothes for work I work in law enforcement and have to wear a ballistic vest and duty belt. After a 12 hour shift my entire torso is welts and my waist is even worse. Does anybody have ideas on making this more bearable? Maybe different under-shirts or something?\n\nI already take a zyrtec and claritin during the day (one when I wake up and one around noon when I start to get itchy) and I usually take a couple benadryl before going to sleep. \n\nI usually wake up from itching and have to take another benadryl to get back to sleep. This is so frustrating. By the end of my weekend I am back to normal and then it starts over again as soon as I go back to work. Suggest patch testing to see if you are allergic to something - maybe your laundry detergent if your clothes and sheets both make you flare up? Maybe your soap? That is a good idea. I have tried a bunch of different soaps and detergents with no noticeable change. \n\nForgot to mention I have a coconut allergy. I tested negative in both skin and blood tests but have a mild anaphylactic reaction so my Dr gave me an epi pen anyway What clothes are you wearing on the weekend? Maybe switch from your current duty undershirt to one made by companies/out of materials you know do not irritate your skin?\n\nI just did patch testing last week and it is life changing. Truly life changing. the itching side of things can be allergy related, diet can help control that part of it", "Covid Vaccine Does anyone here, with dermatographism, had the COVID vaccine shot? \n\nI just wanted to be sure that is ok No symptoms from Pfizer, besides sore arm and fatigue after second dose. I had the Pfizer vaccine, both doses. I had no reaction other than a sore arm for both doses. They both only lasted about a day.\nGenerally the current recommendation is that it is safe to receive as long as you have not had any reactions to the ingredients of the vaccine, or had a reaction to any vaccine before. If you have had a severe allergic reaction in the past to anything other than a vaccine component it is safe to receive it, but they will have you stay in an observation area for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. If you have no history of severe allergic reactions they will have you stay for 15 minutes. If you are concerned, and have the ability to, you can also talk to your doctor and they will be able to tell you personally if they believe its safe on top of the interview you get insuring it will be safe for you that the people administering the vaccine give when you arrive.", "Started getting it after flu shot? Hey guys I got the flu shot in September and had an allergic reaction involving hives and now 4-5 months later I am still experiencing itchy ness and dermatographia. Has anyone else had this experience Yes, some meds give me a rash or dermatographia that lasts for months or years unless I take the right medication. Depends on the ingredients. Suggest a good dermatologist help you take care of that. Sometimes too I will have the symptoms with dry skin, which comes hand in hand with flu season. Ok I will bring it up at me next appointment, talked to an allergist and they were zero help My dermatologist told me (and the dermatopathologists at my lab confirmed) that basically ANY new meds/illness/major shift in your body can start a dermatographia episode. So definitely still talk to your doctor but do not stress too much about vaccines being a trigger in the meantime. (I am not a doctor. I just do transcription for them.) Same thing with me! That makes sense. My current rash (lingering dermatographia) started after a 2016 dose of medicine that I would taken before with no problem. That med probably started affecting me because of my then-recent daily workplace exposure to something in that med; that exposure apparently caused a major shift in my body. Has it stopped for you or is it still continuing? Got my flu shot in October and its been ongoing This is random but are you still getting the dermatographia? Almost 6 months in and zero improvement Yes I am. It is not as bad since I started taking antihistamines, but still getting it.", "Moderna People: Should I consult a doctor? I developed dermatographia exactly two weeks after receiving my moderna booster. I am really relieved that I am not alone because I was super nervous for days wondering why I was itching and having \u201cmysterious\u201d hives and rashes. I then realized that the hives were caused by any minor touches/irritation to my skin whether it be from a mask, clothing, shower, etc. I also realized that taking an antihistamine which I already have prescribed for my allergies helps as well. I am seeing an allergist for allergy testing/shots for my pet allergies this week and I am wondering if I should tell them about what I am experiencing. Should I see a dermatologist and receive a diagnosis? I am just not sure what to do and I am scared to be invalidated if they think I am some antivax conspiracy theorist reading things on the internet. Anyone else experiencing this, what did you do? And should I report these side effects anywhere? I had not heard about this until coming on Reddit so I hope they can make this side effect more well known", "I LOVE DERMATOGRAPHIA! Am I the only one here who thinks that this stuff is so cool! I have had it for all my life and I fucking love it! I love scaring the shit out of people and making them think I got attacked by a tiger or some shit, or showing them how I can write my name in my arm! It is so fucking cool! My husband does not mind his and I have a GREAT time drawing shit on his back. I like to slap his ass to leave a handprint. I am an artist and do not mind it too much.  When I eat too much dairy and have an \"episode\" I like to scratch down my arms and try to make patterns.  I just hate staying up all night cause I am itchy AF. My forearms are instant notepads to jot something down.  Comes in handy sometimes. I would think it was cool if it did not pop up all over me just because my skin rubs my bedsheets. Or pop up on my feet because I wear socks. Or cause my body to be an itchy nightmare. All fun and games till your friends draw dicks and equations on your arm before an exam and you get kicked out I liked it better when I could write on my skin and not cause subsequent allergic reactions in my lungs and throat. Currently in this weird phase of very strange immune issues with it.", "Symptom relief Hi all,\n\nI have had dermatographia for the past few months after taking a two week dosage of antibiotics. The first month or so was pretty bad for me. I had constant flare ups of redness,swelling and itching all over my skin.  However, my symptoms has greatly improved these three months. Although it is a lot better I am still not fully recovered yet so I am still careful about what I eat. I believe I will make a full recovery soon since the effects from the drugs takes around six months to disappear(or so I heard).  What works for me is mainly focused around food consumption. When symptoms were bad I absolutely stayed away from:\n\nDairy products\n\nSeafood\n\nBeef\n\nSpicy Food\n\nFried food\n\nAlso, maybe try to get some exercise in, I felt way better after a good workout. I think that one reason it helps is that it lowers the stress level and improves your overall mental health. Even though this plan worked out for me YMMV. I know it can get really bad and stressful sometimes, Good luck! wow, you have it good... i have had dermatopgraphia ever since i can remember (got it from me mum.) from me understanding there is (2) types of dermatographia. (1): slight itchiness/irritation, and then a weird welting/hiving response from a light or heavy scratching stimulus, but if you are like me you have number two (which is by far thee worst, and most intense): Itchiness all over the body, at all hours of the day. (I can scratch the skin on me scrotum any time, it is always itchy. it is like when i move in a certain way, and then i am like, \"oh yup, they are itchy\" all the time. i can scratch right now, and if i do it in public, which happens a lot, people think i have crabs/pubic lice. it has really taught me the concept of stoicism, believe or naught.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow, NONE of these remedies you have listed above have carry no benefit for me, or those suffering from my type of dermatographia. i have tried a vegetarian diet, i have tried a vegan diet, i work out, every anti-histamine you can name, and none of this works, but I am happy that you have found a solution, yo! :) are you irish", "Hi, could this be dermatographia? There is red discolouration on my arms and legs, and I do not know what this is  /u/itchdoc, could you lend your expertise here? When did it start? Any other symptoms? Could you take a few more pictures with strong lighting? Does not look like it to me Poor quality image, not enough information shared for a meaningful response. Not surprised at all. I had asked OP for pictures with better lighting. :-/\n\nOh well, thanks for chiming in. I do not think so its probably just a rash or an allergic reaction you should use a toothpick and write words on your hand if they bump up like a really bad mosquito bite you probably have it but in this photo nah fam, ya dont"]
