["How long before I should notice a noticeable voice change? I have been using testogel since late April, and about a month ago I went from half a pump to one pump as prescribed ( one pump is 20.25 mg of testosterone ).\n\nAs the title says, how long before I should notice a noticeable voice change? I compared a clip of my voice from before I started to now and there is some change, but very little.\n\nMy voice is something I am most insecure about ( I grew up with gaming, so you can imagine that sounding young while trying to play and bond with people of your age would be difficult when your voice never dropped ) so i am rather eager for my voice to get deeper haha. Assuming you are a male, it takes about 2 years which is how long our puberty lasts. During that span there might be changes to your voice, but after 2 years what you have is what you get.\n\nI was a really late diagnosis and my voice did deepen some but is still high comparatively.  That actually sounds quite a low dose, your doctor might have to increase the dose depending on your blood test results and your age. Your doctor might be increasing the dose slowly instead of putting you straight in at adult dose. \n\nPuberty can be a long process, between 2 - 5 years and you do not get all the changes in one go. The fact you have noticed a small change already is a good sign but it will probably take another 12 to 24 months before your voice change is complete, depending on your testosterone level. Im dont have anything scientific to say but I do have the same problem with my voice while gaming. I used to be sooo insecure but now I realised that if my friends are constantly making fun of me, then they are not my friends! If this applies to you I suggest you cut them off. But otherwise, just joining a lobby with randoms it dont matter to me. They are not going to hear again so the more they hear your voice the better. I cant pinpoint how I got over my insecurity with my voice but all I can say is the more you talk to others the more you realise they dont really care and neither should you! BTW I play on PS so if you want to play we can anytime!", "33 year old diagnosed with IHH at 16 I am a 33 year male. Diagnosed with HH at 16. I have and had a sense of smell.  Short stature, no body hair, small testes &amp; small penis. It felt like i was starting puberty and then just stopped.  I went to my mom expressed my concern and then began the series of test and bouncing around from doctors which we all know last for years. I started taking Androgel. 16-17 and was really disappointed by its effects. It really just acted as a mood booster. The secondary effects were not significant. Unsatisfied with Androgel, and a couple of years of more test  I went to a bigger hospital, and through my mother and I applying pressure on doctors they prescribed me HCG to grow testicles and produce my own testosterone. At this time i was 19-20, very much caught up in life and living with roommates in basically what would be a modern day trap house. I did not go fill the prescription. It sat there. This past Friday, 13 years later I met with a fertility and reproductive specialist who is well versed in cases of HH begin taking HCG. He diagnosed me with Isolated Hypogonadatrophic Hypogonadism. He sent out the prescription. All  I have to go through the preauthorization process and then we are off.\n\nMy labs as of Feb 2020 are \n\nGnRH &lt;2.0\n\nTestosterone Total 15L\n\nFSH &lt;0.7\n\nLH &lt;0.2 \n\nIn those 13 years of being on and off testosterone. I grew to 6'3 (although i do not think that is credited to TRT but the lack their of) Slender build, minor breast tissue ( mostly it just looks like i have  athletic chest that needs some toning) Bones are very small and slender, wrist ankles arms all that. Weakening of bones and bone density is a symptom of HH. Muscle mass Low/medium.  I have hips,  (i would not say they are severe but I notice them). Keep in mind I am currently not on TRT and have not  been for a good year (with the exception of  receiving a shot in February, which only last a month). My labs provided above were taken right before receiving injection.  In 2018 i asked my endocrinologist to start taking injections (Testosterone Cypionate ) , he responded with why. I basically kindly told him \"cause i fucking say so\" . 2018 to beginning of 2019  I was on injections, Its the biggest i appeared, as far as muscle mass. I had morning wood, aggression, sex drive and everything. My body reacted to the injections better than the gels. The trade off is when i came off of the injections  there was a crash with the works. Depression, less sex drive than i ever experienced, and some points it felt like i did not even have a penis or genitalia. In retrospect i should have had gels on hand  so i did not just crash. \n\nAs for  present day secondary characteristics, my testicles are still adolescent size. Penis  is adolescent-to young teen. Like with a lot of things it varies. There is no doubt tho that there is a developmental issue. Side story, I went to the clinic for some std testing. This girl whom i was imitate with, told me that she tested positive for a STD. I arrive at the clinic and they told me there would be a physical exam. Like all of us have experienced, anything that involves taking off our clothes our  body goes into panic mode.  My stomach dropped. I contemplated just walking out of there and saying fuck it. In the end I went through with it. It was a cute female doctor. By this point my dick had shriveled up to a 1/4 of a vienna sausauge with all the mental panic. She un awkwardly  examined me i pulled my pants up and left. About a hr later she called me, to further inquired about my health. I explained to her that i see an endocrinologist for HH and she was like okay i just wanted to check up on you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been a longtime silent supporter of the community and have seen ndsmith videos online, and commend you for being a voice for something that we all struggle to talk about. Today i felt prompted to share cause I read some post this morning about the mental health struggles, intimacy, virginity and body image issues. I wanted to speak more towards that but not before giving my story thus far.\n\nI will do a post more on lifestyle with HH, sex, funny stories, how i lost my virginity and things. \n\nA little advice is some obstacles in this life are not exclusive to having HH or whatever form of it you have. There are people out there with \"regular anatomy\" that still struggle with losing their virginity, intimacy &amp; body image. Those feelings come with life no matter who you are. Regardless of whatever issues we have, we have to focus on our mind, our purpose, exercise the body. Even if you are not seeing the over night results, exercising releases endorphins to improve your mood. \n\nI also recommend this book.  \"The way of the superior man \" originally published June 1, 1997. This book lit a fire for me. It really gets you out of slumps and mood drops, and is very insightful without being toxic.  \n\nLove &amp; Light /u/morelifemattx, I have found an error in your post:\n\n &gt; \u201cinjections, ~~Its~~  the biggest\u201d\n\nI feel you, morelifemattx, ought to have used \u201cinjections, ~~Its~~  the biggest\u201d instead. \u2018Its\u2019 is possessive; \u2018it is\u2019 means \u2018it is\u2019 or \u2018it has\u2019.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!) Good to hear from you. I always appreciate hearing from fellow patients and I think it helps other patients to hear from as many different people as possible. We all have our own unique experiences in how we cope with this condition and it is useful to hear other opinions, \n\nI have not heard of that book before but I will look out for it.  \n\n\nI do totally accept when you say the obstacles people with Kallmann syndrome / CHH are not unique to us and other people will have their own hidden problems to deal with.  \n\n\nTestosterone therapy does show however how strong a hormone testosterone is and its effects on our emotional wellbeing can not be underestimated. Thanks for responding, and I agree 100 %.\n\nThe emotional effects are there and like the physical, another obstacle to be overcame and not downplayed. \n \n\nWas the 11/07 zoom meeting recorded and online to watch? We can not record the Zoom meetings directly but I do publish the slides Andrew Dwyer used in his presentation. \nThere is a You Tube video from a presentation last year where the slides are narrated with extra information and there should be a link in the Facebook groups to the slides used in this year's presentation.\n\nThere is a Kallmann syndrome You Tube channel where I collect together any KS related videos that I can find, including some with me talking to Dr Dwyer about commonly asked questions about Kallmann syndrome.", "Kallmann syndrome &amp; CHH. Basic treatment options. ", "Androgel eficacy? I have been using androgel for a year or so after finding the caps to be rather \" unreliable\" in terms of consistency of T levels. Now I am finding a similar issue on the gel. I feel bad for my GF as I have stretches of low libido and although she figures it is just how it is with Kallmans I am sure she would appreciate less \"ups and downs\" on thar front ( no pun imtended haha). Has anyone found a way to stabilize the fluctuations a bit, maybe specific diets, time of day that I dose,  or...??\nMy doc has looked at T levels and we upped the dose a bit several months back( three pumps a day usually in a.m. before work) , but generally my levels seem to be good over time. I just have low libido stretches that I would like to even out. Also, efficacy not eficacy...doh Are injections an option for you? I have found that it has kept my testosterone level in a good spot and i never have low libido. My wife gives me an injection once a week, went to the hospital and a nurse showed her what to do the first time. I self injected into my thigh for years after my diagnoses. Those large bore needles combined with the thickness of the cypionate....ugh! I just got so tired of it that when an alternative came along I took it. Did the capsules for a long time, tried the patches but they were apparently hard to source, then on to the gell. The pellets mentioned in other posts sound promising but I am not sure they would be available where I am ( or affordable). Oh I totally get that! I did the same thing for a few years and absolutely hated it lol. I get the injection in the butt now and it is 100x better, i also decreased my needle size from 22/23g to a 27g because I am on HCG at the moment and that also helps a lot. It is all dependent on your girlfriend being comfortable with it though, mine almost passed out leading up to the first injection but now she is really good at it. I also have not tried any other treatment though, getting shots is still no fun so if there was an alternative that worked just as good I would probably do it. I do not have any advice, just wanted to empathize with ya. When I went on birth control before I knew I had Kallman's, my very high sex drive plummeted and I felt so annoyed with it. I \\*wanted\\* to match my then-partner's libido, but it chemically just was not happening. He was very understanding, but still a frustrating experience.\n\nHope you find what works for you :) I used to use the gel (prescribed by a GP doc) until I started seeing an endo who explained that, at least for me, that is way too ineffective. Now I inject every week. And have had great success. Also, the pellet is a very effective option", "If you live in the UK and have Kallman Syndrome, you can get free prescriptions. \n\nBasically, you need your GP to fill out a form (FP92A) and I tick off anything relating to Diabetes Insipidus and other forms of hypopituitarism as the reason.\n\nIt is a shame that it is not widely known. This is SO amazingly helpful! Thank you - I am going to be giving it a try, because they are cheeky with my prescription and charge me for two separate \"medications\" because my HRT contains oestrogen and progesterone(!?). Sigh. I have had some people in our patient groups who have had problem getting this but I have had no problem myself. You might have to persistent but it can be done. Covers all medications as well. \n\nYou do have to ask yourself though, I have never had a GP or consultant suggest it for me. Prescriptions are free in Wales already", "Do I have KS? I am 13 years old and my voice has not dropped/ started to crack, I do not have a lot of hair on my body, zero hair downstairs, I have started working out for the past year and while I have lost a little weight (10 pounds or so) and gotten a little bit stronger, I have not gained much muscle, I also have a relatively undersized penis and testicles, sorry if this is to much detail, but I have also masturbated before and while I did climax, no sperm came out, I talked with one of my friends about this and they said they do not think I have this but I do not know, something feels weird, I am a 13 year old boy, 150 pounds, and I am 5 foot 3 inches", "Is this some odd Kallman? I am actually only 13. I started puberty at age 10/11. I have many traces of it etc.\n\nI have never gotten a deep voice/voice cracks. People in my class has them and definitely didnt start as early, they do not even have pimples. \n\nI also feel really short. In fact, I am really short. Almost everyone in my class is taller. \n\nSo is this some kind of 50% KS here? Hey there, so being 13 it is honestly a little hard to tell what is going on. Some Kallmann's patients are short, some are not. Similarly, with weight some are fat, some are thin. If you are particularly concerned you can ask your folks to go to the doctor for checking, but with how young you are it is going to be hard to tell much of anything. Plus this is not really a proper place to get a diagnosis of any particular issue you might (or might not) have as few of us are medical professionals, and you would need blood workup done.\n\nOne thing that you can relate that *may* indicate that you should be concerned is if you have a sense of smell or not. If you do not have a sense of smell there is a chance you might have Kallmann's but, again, we cannot tell you that for certain. The only people that can are doctors. I have very much sense of smell. I smell mostly everything even if I am sick. Being short does not mean that you have Kallmann syndrome.\n\nKallmann syndrome is a rare genetic disorder you cannot get that secondary sex characteristics (body hair, facial hair, deep voice, muscles, developed penis) because of.\n\nWell, if you feel that your puberty is not fully complete go to a doctor, but that is not Kallmann syndrome in my opinion.   \n\nNot only Kallmann syndrome can cause problems in puberty, there are people who have tumors that cause them hormonal problems and so on.\n\n\nBut again, if you feel that something is wrong, go to a doctor and get you testosterone levels tested. That rules out Kallmann's then. One of the primary symptoms is anosmia (no sense of smell). You will definitely want to talk to a doctor. Wait what do u mean talk to a doctor You have a medical concern---your stalled puberty---the only thing that we can do for you is tell whether your symptoms match known symptoms for our condition. We cannot make a medical diagnosis that you do or do not have an issue, only a doctor can do that.\n\nBased on what you have described you do not match with our symptoms, which means that further diagnosis can only be performed by a doctor. You will need to talk to one if you are still concerned that something is not right with your body.", "The Endocrine System | The Hypothalamus &amp; Pituitary Gland | The Institut...  A You Tube video series suggested by a couple of KS friends.   \nInteresting view of the hypothalamus and pituitary.   \nIt is the failure of GnRH production by the hypothalamus that is the root cause of Kallmann syndrome / CHH.  \nGnRH is supposed to released by the hypothalamus which should stimulate the pituitary to release FSH and LH (the gonadotropins). Lack of GnRH production, or incorrect GnRH production, can prevent the release of the FSH and LH.   \nThere are a number of different ways that the GnRH production is blocked, one of which is the failure of the migration of the GnRH releasing nerve cells into the hypothalamus during early development into their correct location which is seen in Kallmann syndrome. Since the olfactory / smell nerve cells are supposed to follow the same route as the GnRH releasing cells, they are blocked as well. This prevents the olfactory bulb being developed which leads to the lack of sense of smell.", "GnRH Hi guys\n\nI have KS myself and am at the stage where I have been on TRT for a few years and have developed normally other than small testicular volume and little to no sperm count.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently saw an endocrinologist about fertility treatments and he mentioned GnRH to increase LH and FSH and that would also increase testicular volume in the process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is does anyone know if the testicular volume increases and stays that way, or does it tend to atrophy again afterwards? I asked my endo about it and he did not seem to want to take me off the TRT due to fatigue etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance The GnRH pump would be a very good form of fertility treatment if you are able to get hold of it.\n\nGenerally with hCG treatment for testosterone production there is very little increase in size of the testicles.\n\nIt is on FSH treatment for sperm production where you can get an increase in size of the testicles as it is the Sertoli cells, sperm producing cells, that increase in number and cause the volume to increase. The GnRH pump can cause natural FSH production. \n\nFor the majority of men with KS this growth will only last for as long as the GnRH or FSH treatment lasts. It can take 12 - 24 months to get the increase in volume but once treatment stops the testicles will shrink back. However they do not always decrease all the way back to the original small size. So if you are starting at 4ml you might get to 10-12ml on treatment, but decrease back to 6ml once treatment stops. It does seem to vary a lot from person to person. Thank you for the reply that is very useful\n\nI have seen from your previous comments that you have had fertility treatment before - how did you feel when you were on that as I believe that it means you have to stop taking testosterone injections/gel - did you find you were more fatigued etc? I have been on full fertility treatment twice in my life and I am currently on hCG treatment for testosterone alone.\n\nEven though my blood testosterone level is a little lower than it would be if I was on the injected form I feel fine in terms of fatigue and drive. I think there is something better having a natural supply as opposed the the injection / gel.\n\nIt can take a little while to get the correct dose of hCG but I think it is worth it. I always prefer being on hCG / gonadotropin therapy.", "A collection of You Tube videos on Kallmann syndrome and delayed puberty. ", "Testosterone Treatment For men with Kallmann, how long did it take for you to see any serious changes after treatment? Particularly, any significant penis, testicle or body and facial hair growth? So far I have been on T for about a month. I cannot remember it that well, but it was around a few months. The biggest first change was that I suddenly could get an hard on and started to experiment what you can do with it.\n\nStarted with hormones with around 21 - 23 (I should check - beginning of university). I ended with normal sized genitalia. Getting a beard took way longer (years) and it is just ok and not a great one.\n\nRegarding muscle I did not experience a real change I remember. You will not become a hulk from just taking hormones for sure.\n\nThe only thing that I hate/struggle with is my puffed breast. It is nothing major but you can see a smallish female breast. It will not go away with hormones and is due to the late diagnosis. Shit happens. :)\n\nHope I could help a little. Wish you the best! About 3 months for me. Nothing super different but my mental state improved. The facial hair can take years. Only been on TRT for a year so I do not have any facial hair. After a certain age physical secondary sex characteristics are unlikely to show  improvement. Your voice will change some and some more hair but that might be about it. How old are you if you do not mind be asking? It does depend on your age and what dose you are taking. You should notice the mental changes such as energy gain, alertness, better sleep patterns and higher sex drive within a couple months of starting treatment.\n\nPhysical changes can take up to 3 years to develop but you should notice some changes such as hair growth from about 3 months. Muscle development will occur if you exercise and you should notice skin changes as you start to look older. Pubic hair should develop first.\n\nBeard growth is not directly linked to testosterone levels but you normally need at least 12 months of testosterone treatment in order for the hair follicles to develop enough to produce facial hair. \n\nIf you are below the age of 20 you should get some penile growth but it might not be as much as you might hope. Men with Kallmann syndrome can show the same variation in size as with any group of men but we do tend to be on the smaller size. The earlier you start treatment, you more likely you are to get the growth you were destined to get.\n\nIf you have Kallmann syndrome rather than just delayed puberty you will probably not get any noticeable testicle growth while on testosterone alone. There is another different form of treatment you would require for that to happen and to achieve fertility. \n\nIf you are on a low monthly dose, as opposed to injections every 2 or 3 weeks it might take longer to notice any changes. Does trt help reduce gyno? In my experience no - sry Started with depo-testosterone shots at 17 (Cannot remember if it was early or late 17). Huge change from 18-19. Freshman year of college I grew 6 inches (5'6\" -6'). Also started getting much more facial hair, Did you have a undeveloped genitalia before the treatment? Yes. I would say the normal size of a pre-puberty boy. But as far as I know my parents were told at birth that it was quite small. Did not help me to get diagnosed early.\n\nPerhaps a very big thing I forgot to mention: with treatment I started growing again. I already was quite large and ended up wit 1.98 meters (6\u2018 6\u2018\u2018). Kind Of did put some people off who do not expected you to still grow (e.g. at Abitur meeting). All in all it is quite nice and it distracts from possible differences. :)\n\nI looked like a child going to university. Now not so much - although I often see the female features like slightly wider hips. Not sure about others. I am 17 yrs old, do you think it is good idea to take hormone treatment Is your parents tall? I am 19 years old. Sorry for the late replies, I have been busy. It is been about a month now since starting treatment. It is ok. You started in your teens at least. Ask your doctor about anything that maybe bothering you though. He/she maybe able to offer some more information that will comfort you. All the best of luck to you. I hope it works out for you. Thanks a lot. Also another thing. This could be due to a messed up sleep schedule and from the lack of physical activity. But I have had kind of a body soreness or type of pain around the joints and bones. Read HRT is used for patients to build bone density could this just be changes to my bone structure? Something I will also ask my doctor the next visit. I would not have the slightest clue. I also have joint and bone pain though. You should definitely ask your doctor. I live in a developing nation so I do not really get the best care. Sorry I could not be of help. For you has it been chronic? Yea. I have pretty bad knee valgus so it is the source of a lot of the pain. My shoulders and pain hurts  sometimes but it is  way less frequent. Have you had any side effects. After a month currently I wake up with a kind of swollen looking face (lips and nose) and mildly itchy \u201cparts\u201c. Wonder if this is normal, or if it would be like an allergic reaction. Otherwise I am hoping I would not have to stop taking the treatment Have any of you had any side effects. After a month currently I wake up with a kind of swollen looking face (lips and nose) and mildly itchy \u201cparts\u201c. I had no side effects at all. I do not even experience the mood changes during high and low testosterone levels.\n\nIf you took it for a month, I do not think you suddenly developed a allergy. As far as I know you should in this case develop symptoms far earlier. And most likely you would not stop treatment but change the medication. Like from Testosviron to Nebido. I did this to get away from the four week injection to the twelve week one.\n\nI\u2018m no doctor of cause! Talk to your Doctor if it is an issue or you want to be sure. I have been doing the treatment for 4 months and a half now, my voice is a lot different, I notice a few more body/facial hair but not much, I think that is all...\n\nI am 18 and got diagnosed for almost 5 months now My voice is also a lot different after about 3 months. Practically the same situation as you. Yeah my voice is a lot deeper now, how old are you? If ur 18 we are probably at the exact same boat my friend I am 19 right now If you do not mind me asking, what is your prescribed dosage? I am getting 200mg injections and notice I tend to get swollen feet and face the first couple days after injections Hay man, I guess it is just 2mg every 21 days, I have notice the first or second day I tend to sleep a lot, I mean a loooot, like 15 hours in one night... But nothing like swollen face... Yeah it is weird for me. Could be my diet but I would wake up kind of puffy and the swelling goes down after about a hour or 2 How do you recive testosterone? By gel? Always injections. Testosviron in the beginning, Nebido the last two years. Is it hard to deal with mood swings? Do not you go \"crazy\" by the hormones you recive? Do not have any mood swings at all. I do not think I\u2018d notice a medication stop that fast.\n\nYou only get a normal dosage of testosterone. And injections are way more stable in testosterone levels. That is good to hear that you do not have mood swings, because that is my biggest fear of starting the treatment. But I think it depends on people too. For example if you have mild Kallmann syndrome maybe you have less mood swings or none. Do you have mild or full kallmann syndrome btw? Define mild. Before treatment I had a very very small amount of testosterone. No puberty. No LH/FSH. No sense of smell (still nothing of cause).\n\nI\u2018m lucky regarding physical issues that might come with kallmann. So no issues there.\n\nMood swings should be only hormonal and this is of cause person dependent. But testosterone levels are only set with my injections. The testicles do nothing on their own. People with mild Kallmann syndrome can grow pubic hair, can ejaculate. Some of them can grow a little facial hair too but that is very rare. So they got natural testosterone level. No, not the case here. No sign of puberty without treatment starting in university... ~21/22 years old.\n\nDo not be afraid of starting treatment... got only benefits out of it. Do you do workouts/exercises?(weightlifting) If yes, is it hard to gain muscle? I\u2018m more the cardio guy. Got a bit too much weight the last years, but I managed to get fitter especially this year. Since January I run 2-3 times a week and do a small amount of body weight fitness with each run. I\u2018m around 103 kg/ 20% fat / 1.98m. I find it hard to get muscle but I never did proper lifting while eating enough. So no idea.\n\nGot rid of 9kg this year. I try to reach 15% fat and then start to build more muscle. We\u2018ll see ...\n\nThe bigger goal is to get the 1000km running together. Not that easy for me.", "Finally got diagnosed with Kallmans and started Testosterone Gel, but I have a question I have been prescribed to use half a pump for 6 months and according to the instructions leaflet, it says to put a thin layer on my elbow / upper arm area \u2014 I did not realise just how little how half a pump was, it was really hard to evenly distribute it on both arms and I do not think I did a good job.\n\nI was thinking about just applying it to one arm instead, would that be okay or should I strictly follow the instructions leaflet?  Half a pump seems a very low dose, I presume the doctors will be checking your testosterone levels after 6 months to see if the dose needs increasing.  \n\n\nThe shoulders and upper arms are the usual areas but other areas can be used. The instruction leaflet normally says to avoid using it around the chest / heart area and applying directly to the genitals but apart from that any other part of the body is ok.  \n\n\nWhen I used to use the gel I used to start on the shoulders and back and then put the rest on my waist and legs to make sure as much of the gel was used up as possible.  \n\n\nOne arm would be fine, perhaps using a different arm each day", "Lost adolescence as well as well as lack of puberty. This perhaps comes from own experiences and will not be shared by everybody I know.    \n\n\nIt is more the fact that Kallmann syndrome robbed me of my adolescence that has the greater impact on my life than the failure to go through puberty.   Hormone treatment can help with some of the physical effects but it is not always easy to catch up on those lost years of emotional development as a teenager and young adult.     \n\n\nOn my bad days I really resent missing out on being sexually aware as a teenage and young adult. Part of that was caused by growing up just before the internet age I suppose.   \n\n\nI went to University undiagnosed with no libido at all. I know I missed out on the social opportunities at Uni. It took a long while even after diagnosis to develop drive and confidence. I do sometimes feel like I missed out on a lot.   \n\n\nBeing on testosterone can restore my libido but it has been very difficult to gain confidence to act on that libido. As a ks person I know what you mean. I feel like there is so much I was robbed on and then while still not treated married, happily. But, I do ponder what I missed out on. I do not have any before I was married stories like most people. I mean nothing wild or anything like that. But no one night stands, missed out girlfriends due to lack of knowledge of sexual attention, and so forth. I talk to many fellow KS friends around the world and we all seem to have different stories on how we cope with the condition.  \n\n\nThere are so many variables. The condition itself comes in different severities and with extra symptoms that only occur in some cases. Age of diagnosis and treatment is a big factor in how we cope I think. It is a broad spectrum condition. I have found it very difficult, if not impossible to recover from not having those developmental years as a teenager / young adult on both a physical and emotional level. Yeah, the psycho-social aspects are worse than not being able to grow body hair or a beard.  I have the emotional development of a 16 year old at 33.

Well even though it is exponentially harder to loose weight and gain muscle it is extremely gratifying when you finally reach your ideal body weight and physique Thanks for your reply Thanks for your reply How old are you, and did you do weightlifting exercises? Did it worth? Well I was on my high school football (America) team and on the testosterone scale I am at .3 which the average is 300 so it was extremely hard. And I had to work hours on end and my coach learned about the disorder and helped me because he has low T as well with him at 50 so he understands how hard it is and it would take me a year doing the regular works outs to accomplish what the normal kids did in a month but with protein shake, Testosterone supplements, healthy diet, water, and non stop work I could keep up with the other kids and at the last game of senior year my coach told the other kids and showed them the videos of the coach doing one on one training for 15 hours a day on the weekends and 10 on weeks days and it took forever to lose weight but it is so hard to keep the weight off because low testosterone means low metabolism and once foot ball season was over and my coach could not help within 3 months I was back at 200 lbs. so yes it does help but it is a constant grind. Well, I am 16 and it looks like I have KS, but I lose weight easily. I am 64 kg, so it is very slight compared to my classmates who are about 70kg. If I would not do exercises, I would be about 60kg I think. Well most Kallmanns syndrome patients have little to no metabolism so all the weight you lose is weight lost by hard work but you may have normal metabolism and you will be good in that aspect To help reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis any type of impact work, basically anything other than swimming, can be helpful for us.\n\nEven when we are on hormone treatment the fluctuations in levels does make developing osteoporosis or osteopenia more likely. I do have a couple of KS friends who are fitness trainers and body builders and have achieved good looking results when on hormone treatment, Nebido normally. I understand, but does Kallmann syndrome have any affect on muscle gained after a workout? Do I gain less muscles or as many as other normal people would? You would need to have make sure your hormone replacement therapy is giving you a normal and steady testosterone level in order to gain muscle if you work out.\n\nIf your T levels are normal you can gain muscle just like anybody else but if you come off treatment or your levels are too then you would not be able to build much muscle regardless of how much work you put in: I do not think there is any difference between KS men and non KS men once you have the correct testosterone level. You should be able to build the same amount of muscle as anybody else.", "Rare Disease Day 2019. Kallmann syndrome - absent or impaired puberty. ", "My Kallmann syndrome story.

Apart from the physical symptoms the condition has left me with emotional or psychological issues.\n\nThe psychological issues arise I think from the feeling of being left behind when all my friends developed physically and socially. I now find it very difficult to engage socially and form emotional or physical relationships.\n\nThe only time I can feel truly relaxed among other people is when I am with fellow Kallmann syndrome friends.\n\nI find it very difficult to get relaxed in most social situations. Before diagnosis, as a teenager I was invited to the social events and parties but I was too afraid to go. I had to keep on making up excuses not to go. In the end people stopped inviting me. If I had forced myself then to be more social it would probably be better for me in the long run.\n\nI have lived on my own ever since leaving home for Uni, which on the whole suits me well. I cannot see myself living with anybody, apart from perhaps a fellow Kallmann Syndrome friend who might be able to put up my idiosyncratic ways.\n\nI am actually ok in intimate situations but find it very difficult to have the social skills to get me to that point in the first place. It took me a long time even after diagnosis to get to the point I felt able to intimate. I did not engage in any sexual activity until I was over 30 due to having a very low sex drive and not having any confidence at all. I have had a few sexual encounters since, very enjoyable on the most part but they are few and far between.

There are a couple of medications you can take to help with that problem.

Turns out I will be going on HCG for a couple of weeks. Scared of it not fully kickstarting puberty.\n\nAnybody have experience here with HCG? Did it kickstart your puberty? Should I try to push for TRT or ask my doctor for anything? From my own experience and talking to other patients with Kallmann syndrome:\n\nThe gonadotropin therapy of hCG / hMG can be very effective in producing a natural looking puberty and can help with fertility in later life. However it can be a slow process with 3 to 5 injections a week.  \n\n\nHormone replacement therapy with testosterone can be a lot easier to take and can give quicker results but you will not get a totally normal puberty and you will not get any testicle growth.   \n\n\nIf you want the fastest results, with adult levels of tesotsterone quickly, I would take the testosterone therapy.  \n\n\nHowever if you are happy to wait a little while longer to get a more gradual increase in testosterone levels, a more natural steady testosterone level and possibly help with fertility later on, go with the gonadotropin therapy (hCG / hMG). hCG can be very effective but it might take a few months to get to the correct dose and get the required testosterone level.   \n\n\nI was not offered hCG / hMG treatment until much later in life, I had to start on testosterone only treatment when first diagnosed. Knowing what I know now, if offered the choice I would go the hCG / hMG route, but it is down to personal choice in the end. I see. Do you know how long it would take in weeks or months to see some changes in terms of puberty. Like voice drop or height growth? I just heard HCG does not raise testosterone high enough so I got worried hCG can be slow I have to agree and it seems to depend on the type of hCG you are prescribed and the dose you are prescribed. It can take 3-6 months sometimes for the doctors to find the right dose depending on how well you respond. Some men with KS respond a lot better than others, often it depends on the initial testicle volume. \n\nHowever as a patient who has tried both methods there is something better about having the natural, testicle produced, testosterone hCG gives you than having to inject it or use gel. It is difficult to describe in words but some KS patients (including myself) do prefer the natural testosterone hCG can give you.   \n\n\nIf you are after the fastest results in terms of looking older and getting development then testosterone may be the best option. You can always try hCG / hMG in a couple of years time.   \n\n\nHeight growth is not normally testosterone related, you should get your growth spurt even if you do not take any treatment. If anything testosterone acts to stop the growth spurt when you have achieved the correct height.  \n\n\nI had my growth spurt (height) at ages 20 to 21, before I was diagnosed and treated. But to do hcg, does not that require the pump with the hypo in all the time? That is what turned me off from that option. As bad as testosterone shots are, it was only twice a month.\n\nEdit: Also patches are still an option for testosterone too, right? The pump is a different form of treatment than the hCG / hMG.  The pump uses a hormone called GnRH. It is the hormone that we are lacking in Kallmann syndrome and the cause of all our problems. GnRH pump therapy is very rarely used these days and is not available in many countries. It is very effective though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhCG / hMG therapy is given via sub cutaneous injections with a short needle just under the skin, which makes them easier to take that intramuscular testosterone injections. Some of the hCG medications come in the form of an injection syringe pen which makes injecting even easier. If you do go down the hCG / hMG route it would mean 5 or 6 injections a week. Testosterone therapy can come in many forms depending on what country you are in. Intra muscular injections every 2 weeks are common but you also can have the option of using daily gel, daily patch, daily capsules, sub cutaneous injections or 6 monthly implanted pellets. Wow! I think I could easily do 5 or 6 subcutaneous injections. I hate the sore lump IM testosterone leaves.\n\nIs this available in the US? Oh, nevemind, I dont have health insurance, so the testosterone is probably all I can afford lol. Yea it looks like I will be going on HCG. Hopefully I see some meaningful changes, but seeing other people\u2019s experiences I am not entirely sure. Oh well, if it does not work I am going on TRT anyway. hCG / gonadotropin therapy is certainly available in the US but it is super expensive and not easy to get even with health insurance. Since it is labelled as \"fertility\" treatment it is often declined by insurance companies who have no understand what Kallmann syndrome is.\n\nTestosterone therapy is a lot cheaper and you should be able to get it even without insurance. The cheapest option would be the gel which you can sometimes get from a pharmacy that offers compound medications, where they can produce a generic, non branded form of testosterone gel. I like being on hCG and it does seem to work for most KS men who try it but you have to get the dose just right. At least you have the back up option of testosterone therapy if it does not work as quickly or as effectively as you would like it to. That is true\n\nHow long do you think is reasonable for me to expect some changes? I am asking so I can monitor myself and realize early if things are not working to bring it up to my doctor I would think 1 month is a reasonable time to notice any changes. You should feel the changes before you might notice any physcial changes. A dose of between 1,500 or 3,000 IU twice a week is normal.   \nThe testicles do contain both the Sertoli (sperm producing) and Leydig (testosterone producing) cells even if they have not grown in size since childhood. It can take a few weeks of injections in order for the Leydig cells to come out of their inactive state and start to produce testosterone.\n\nOnce they start producing testosterone you should notice the difference in emotions, energy levels and drive before any physical changes such as hair growth, muscle build up or voice breaking would be noticed. Alright sounds good. Thanks for all your help", "What is a normal testosterone level for a guy with kallman syndrome?  Do you mean what level should be average that one is trying to get to and maintain with therapy? Before replacement therapy I was at zero, my body did not produce testosterone. Same, it is tough not making hormones. My testosterone level at diagnosis at the age of 23 was 1.0 nmol/l or about 25 ng/dl in American units.\n\nThe normal range for male testosterone can vary slightly depending on the testing method used but is around 10 to 30 nmol/l or 300 to 900 ng/dl.\n\nWhen on treatment the aim is to remain within normal range all the time and not have wide variations in levels.  For some of us with KS is the large variation in levels that cause the most problems rather than the level itself. I am 17 and mine came out to be 325 but, the symptoms are showing As a patient I would say 325 is far too low for a 17 year old male.\n\nIf you have had no testicle growth at all you should be seen by an endocrinologist for a full hormone panel; three important hormones to check for would be prolactin, FSH and LH.\n\nDo you have a sense of smell or any problems with your hearing ? I can smell and hear just fine I can smell and hear just fine, but my genitalia never grew. 17 would be at the top end of the range for delayed puberty but it is still possible that normal puberty will start soon. \n\nHowever it would be worth getting a hormone profile done by an endocrinologist. There is a test they can do called the GnRH stimulation test which normally can tell if you have delayed puberty or if there is problem with the pituitary gland. \n\nSince you can smell you can not have Kallmann syndrome but instead have the related condition, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This is a rare condition and delayed puberty is more likely but you would need an endocrinologist to be able to distinguish between the two.\n\nSometimes doctors will give a short dose of testosterone injections to see if that jump starts puberty. I forgot to mention that I also have gyno and also should I go to my main doctor or go straight to endocrinologist. I forgot to mention I also have gyno and also should I go to my main doctor first or go straight to a endocrinologist. Gyno can be a direct result of your low testosterone levels, when you have too much of the female hormone, oestrogen. \n\nPersonally I would go straight to an endocrinologist, preferably one who specialises in reproductive endocrinology. It is very possible that it is delayed puberty rather than something else but it would be best to get it checked now. Do you think 17 yrs old is right age to make it all right and also will the shots increase my genitalia. TY for answering all my questions. 17 would be a good age to start treatment regardless if you have delayed puberty or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH).  \n\n\nOnce the endocrinologist makes a diagnosis they should be able to start you on testosterone treatment quite quickly. You will notice the positive effects soon after starting treatment I think,   \n\n\nAs for increasing genitalia size that is a difficult one to answer. If you have delayed puberty and start treatment soon then you will most probably get the development you were always destined to get. If you have HH rather than just delayed puberty you might not get the full development you would expect or hope for.   \n\n\nOnce you get a diagnosis the endocrinologist should be able to give you a better idea of what to expect. Hopefully it is just delayed and you will start developing as you hope once you start on testosterone.  \n\n\nIf you are delayed only you might only need a few testosterone shots before puberty starts normally and you would not require any more treatment. Thank you so much man, I am going to keep my hopes up\ud83d\ude4f Thank you so much good sir, I am going to keep my hopes up\ud83d\ude4f Let us us know how you get on. There are people here who can help with questions. Hopefully it will all start on its own soon, I remember what it feels like to be left behind. Honestly the way I see it I might have HH instead of delayed puberty because I did grow some facial hair and armpit hair. But I am hoping for the best I am not entirely sure I understand the difference between HH and delayed puberty.  They seem to be one and the same, delayed puberty causing HH, at least, for me diagnosed at 26. Delayed puberty once treated, normally for 3 to 6 months leads to a normal puberty development with all the hormones working correctly and the reproductive cycle working. You get all the normal growth of puberty, with the testicles growing and producing sperm and testosterone.   \n\n\nIn HH the release of the pituitary hormones is blocked so the testicles never grow and develop and there is no puberty. You can give testosterone to produce most of the changes seen at puberty but the testicles stay small and undeveloped. There is no sperm and testosterone production so you have to take testosterone all your life to replace what should have been made by the testicles.  \n\n\nIn HH you can be be treated with gonadotropin therapy instead, this mimics the missing pituitary hormones. Here you will get testicle growth and sperm / testosterone production but only for as long as you are taking the gonadotropin therapy.   \n\n\nDelayed puberty is a one off event, once treated, everything works normally.  \n\n\nHH is a life time condition requiring life long hormone replacement therapy.

I think the normal for a non-KS person is like 300 something, I do not really remember", "Self-Conscious Hello,\n\nI am 15 and still in high school, I have just started receiving testosterone injections after being on andriol capsules for a while (due to the low dose they were ineffective).

That is it really, just kind of wanted to vent.

I would like to have some more beard for example.\n\nBeing so young with a diagnosis gives you the opportunity to get a nearly normal puberty. You might be a bit late, but compared to others here you had a lot of luck. A bit of progress monitoring and patience will help. You got this! I do not know, I guess we all have different experiences. I think it has gotten a lot easier since I started testosterone at 18. I live a normal life, have a wife and have developed like any other person would. I just cannot smell and take a shot every week, it is not the end of the world. I have been lucky to have supportive friends and family which is something a lot of people do not have unfortunately. I guess so, but congratulations.

Not even going to bother trying to  soften my experience, constant bullying as i was the under developed kid. Personally i didnt even bother to try having sex before my twentys becouse i really didnt feel the urge or the necesecity to do it. At 21 in college i found a girl i really liked when things got serious i freaked out as i didnt know what the f\\*\\*\\* to do. I was ashamed but thought to myself, well i have two options, Fake it until i make it or ask her to guide me as I dont have the experience. \n\nChoosed the second, really ashame to come clean with her but it was a really great feeling.

Hope this comment helps you in any way possible. We are not lucky by being born with kallman, but that doesnt define what you can and can\u00b4t do. I understand totally what you mean about what you mean about loosing your teenage and young adult years. I felt the same and even now it does annoy me.\n\nI did not start treatment until I was 23 and even for a few years after treatment I saw myself as being asexual. It did take me a long to time to convince myself I could still have a sexual life even with KS. I have talked to and met many others with KS over the years and nearly all have gone through the same thought process. There is always an initial doubt that we can perform, something suddenly clicks and we force ourselves to take a risk and then we find we can actually enjoy sex and perform just as well as other people.\n\nI think we will always have our doubts about our appearance but that should not stop us being able to enjoy sexual activity. Through experience comes the realisation that sex is a whole body experience and even though we might be smaller in size in one respect we can still make sure a partner can enjoy the experience.\n\nYou have said you have changed a lot since you have started treatment. This should mean that you will have more energy and stamina and be more likely to get and maintain erections and you certainly should have the drive to want to do it.\n\nMy first couple experiences with women were paid for experiences. I totally regret that now but at least it got me started on the process and now have a far more active life, even though I have far more experience with guys than I do with women. I do not know how to put this in practical terms but there will come a time when you just have to tell yourself that you can have a sex life and your life is not limited to your Kallmann syndrome.\n\nThe first couple of experiences might not go well but if you have the right partner you might surprise yourself and realise just how much you can enjoy it and make your partner enjoy it. There is a theory that since we tend to be smaller than other guys we have to take more time to learn what our partner likes and wants and not just rely on visual stimulation. I can feel you 100%. I do not have Kallmann syndrome, but I am almost 30 and have not fully completed puberty. If you read one of my most recent posts I talk about how damaging it is to my psyche to not feel or look like a man.

", "Hello, I found out about this subreddit from stalking someone from a leftists subreddit. I am also intersex and would like to learn about this condition If I am bargaging in I understand, then I believe it better to just refer me to resources. Not barging in. Kallmann Syndrome is an x-linked genetic abnormality (one or more genes on the X chromosome is improperly structured). This presents in anosmia (no sense of smell), the body does not go through puberty (cannot have kids without hormone therapy) or develop secondary sexual characteristics (voice does not change, no or little body hair, no development of a period for females or enlargement of the penis for males among other issues).\n\nThe Wikipedia page has a good write-up on the Syndrome:  I should point out that we are not officially accepted as an intersex condition.\n\nWe do match the traits and characteristics on many fronts to be considered intersex, but neither the council nor many Kallmann Syndrome patients consider themselves to be intersex, and there is a lot of back and forth over it. I am certainly happy to talk to you about Kallmann syndrome or answer any questions you may have.\n\nIt is a subject that is raised from time to time but the overwhelming consensus from Kallmann syndrome patients and KS medical experts is that KS is not in itself an intersex condition. In saying that it is very easy to see how they could occur at the same time. I have three close friends with Kallmann syndrome who are also intersex.\n\nI myself have a poor self body image due to my lack of physical development but I  certainly feel male, even though the strength of my feeling can vary due to hormone levels. Sorry, I realy hate to do this but Kallmann syndrome is not solely an x-linked condition.\n\nIt certainly can be x-linked but the classic x-linked form of Kallmann syndrome accounts for less than 10% of all cases.\n\nThere are now almost 50 different genes, with multiple variations, occurring on different chromosomes that have been linked to Kallmann syndrome / CHH. The genetic picture of Kallmann syndrome grows more complex each year which does not help in its diagnosis or the chances of predicting inheritance. Ah so is it like people with Kallmanns syndrome are very likely to have an intersex condition?\n\n\nAlso on basic reading i saw that afabs and amabs are able to get the syndrome. That Is super interesting to me. How would the X chromosome mutation affect the sexual development of someone with xy chromosomes? People who are born with Kallmann syndrome are almost invariavbly XX or XY. The physical defect that causes Kallmann syndrome happens around the 20th week of pregnancy, after the sexual organs have become the penis / clitoris - labia / scrotum.  \n\n\nSo in the majortiy of cases a person with Kallmann syndrome will have the physical definition normally associated with XX / XY. Whether or not they feel \"male\" or \"female\" is another matter of course.  \n\n\nKallmann syndrome is not caused by an x-chromosome mutation. There are numerous genes that are known to cause Kallmann syndrome and from memory only 1 is on the x-chromsome. So somebody with XY, will normally have a penis / scrotum. In the most severe forms of Kallmann syndrome there may be a drop off in hormone levels during pregnancy leading to micro-penis and undescended testicles but this happens in less than 20% of Kallmann syndrome cases.\n\nNormally a person born will Kallmann syndrome will look no different than any other male and female during childhood, it is only when puberty fails to start as a teenager that they realise they have a problem.

Apparently, the androgen/estrogen ratio not only led me to develop a decent pair of breasts (I had them removed a few weeks ago), but I am now noticing that I have a substantial hourglass figure. My chest and hips are larger than my waist by a significant margin. Did any of you other males have this problem and were you able to increase muscle/fat to pad out the waist area and make the shape less pronounced? Having low testosterone or excess oestrogen will make it very difficult to be able to build muscle and reduce fat around the waist area. It is certainly possible to recover a more masculine / muscular body withe the right diet and exercise but that would require the testosterone levels to be normalised first. \n\n  \nSometimes taking anti-oestrogen medication can help restore the testosterone / oestrogen balance if your testosterone levels are, used with testosterone replacement therapy if required. My testosterone levels are well within the normal range since beginning TRT.

We went went through the invitro process with donor sperm when trying for our first child. Did not work out. Went through adoption. Fast forward 14 months. Wife is ill and doctor was going to prescribe something but wanted to do a pregnancy test first because medication is harmful to pregnancy. Just a formality because we all knew pregnancy was not a possibility. Surprise, infertility does not mean impossible, just highly unlikely. So, 9 months later our 2nd is born ( or perhaps 8 months by that point). Not me personally but I have at least 5 friends with KS who have had children in the past couple of years. We have stories of both KS males and females having children in our Facebook groups and here on Reddit.\n\nThe path for fertility treatment is differently for male and female patients. Normally it takes longer for male patients (two years in a lot of cases) as they have to start from zero sperm count. There are cases in milder forms of Kallmann syndrome where fertility can be achieved with no treatment or treatment over a very short period.\n\nFor females with Kallmann syndrome they are normally born with the normal number of eggs inside their ovaries. This can in some cases make fertility treatment reasonably quicker if they can find a doctor who has experience of treating KS women. Given the correct hormone injections egg production and release can be stimulated within months. \n\nOverall the treatment for both males and females is known as gonadotropin therapy.

You managed to have a child regardless of being deemed infertile", "New Diagnosis/ a few questions Hello!  \nI am super glad I found this sub reddit, I recently saw a Genetics team and was diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome.

And if that changed after starting treatments.\n\nAlso I was wondering what hormone treatment looks like for you? And after starting treatment did you notice an onset of \"puberty\" \n\nThank you all in advance for the answers, I cannot seem to find much online so I am so happy to be here. Hello, welcome.  \n\n\nWe do have groups on Facebook for patients with Kallmann syndrome/ CHH, including one specifically for women with Kallmann syndrome.   \n\n\nDepending on your age now you will normally be started on oestrogen only therapy for 6 to 12 months. This will allow your body to develop the normal secondary sexual characteristics seen in women. Later progesterone will be added. These will replace the hormones that you are missing.  \n\n\nYou will not have a normal \"puberty\" but the hormones will make it look like there is nothing different. With the right use of hormones you can get a menstrual type bleed every month or three months but you will not be fertile.  \n\n\nHowever women with Kallmann syndrome are normally born with the normal number of eggs within their ovaries. This means that they can become fertile with the correct hormonal treatment, known as gonadotropin therapy. The ability to put on or to loose fat is controlled by your hormone levels. Having low oestrogen would make it more difficult to loose body weight. Once you start oestrogen therapy and get to normal female levels you should find that it becomes easier to loose weight.", "Have you talked to somebody else or met somebody else with Kallmann syndrome ?

With KS being such a rare condition just being able to meet and talk to fellow patients can be a benefit I think. \n\nIt is a difficult condition to explain to other people I think it helps to be able to meet and talk to people you can talk to about the condition without having to explain about the condition.

Will my kids just carry the gene or will they also be diagnosed with KS too? What is the probability that my kids could get it? It is not easy to give a precise answer to this question. The complex genetics of Kallmann syndrome / hypogonadotropic hypogonadism makes it very difficult for doctors or geneticists to be able predict inheritance.\n\nIf you have a strong family history of the condition, at least 2 generations, there is a better chance of knowing the genetic cause of your particular case.  \n\n\nAny case of Kallmann syndrome / HH can be passed down to the next generation. The maximum possibility would be 50%, and that would be for only a very small percentage of cases.\n\nMy own KS specialist who deals with many male and female KS patients said that in his opinion, without any information on the genetics the average chance of passing on KS / HH would be 20%. Also, due to the nature of the condition, just by passing on the KS / HH related gene does not always mean that any offspring would get the condition. \n\nYou could ask your doctor about genetic testing. It does only have a limited scope but if you have one of the more common KS / HH related gene defects you might get a result that can help with the prediction.

Even though I do not desire children myself at least 5 of my KS friends have had children through treatment. If I have testicular volume on the lower end of the KS spectrum does that put me at a high disadvantage ? I am only a patient but from what I have been told and read about KS having a lower testicular volume may increase the time required for treatment to be effective but it is not a big disadvantage.  \nNormally testicles have to be &gt;4ml in volume in order to be able to produce sperm. It can sometimes take months of treatment in order for men with KS to get their testicles to increase in size.   \n\n\nHaving undescended testicles when born which were not corrected early in life can reduced the chances of the fertility treatments working.", "Kallmann syndrome &amp; CHH on Twitter.

Even at the ripe old age of 46 I still hate the term \u201clate bloomer\u201d.\n\nI was stuck with this tag as a teenager. I had to watch my friends and class mates develop into young adults while I was being left behind both physically and emotionally.\n\nUp to the age of 13 I was a fairly normal boy I thought. Not very good at sports, reasonably ok academically, did all the usual things kids did at that age.\n\nThen it all changed, slowly at first, but it did become increasingly apparent I was being left behind. Part of this was my fault as I did not feel the same as everybody else as I had not started puberty. I was invited to the normal teenage parties at first but I kept making excuses about not wanting to go as I felt so much different than everybody else. Eventually the invites stopped coming. I was being left behind both physically and emotionally. \n\nAt first I thought, fair enough we all start at different ages, but once you got to 17 or 18 and still had not started puberty it was obvious something was not quite right. I was sent to the doctor by the school nurse but the doctor just dismissed me as a \u201clate bloomer\u201d and told to wait and see.\n\nEven as a 19 year old at University I was being told I was still a \u201clate bloomer\u201d\n\nIt was not until I started my first real job after University at the Royal Free Hospital in London that I eventually found out what was wrong with me.\n\nI went to see one of the endocrinologists there. I did not have an appointment, I just went to his office. The first question he asked was \u201cdid I have a sense of smell\u201d.\n\n23 years of age and no doctor had ever asked that question before. I said I had never been able to smell. This lead to the diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome.\n On the bright side, \"late bloomers\" can sink whole nations! :)", "Did i have kallmann syndrome I am 19 Years old, i got all of the symptoms, at first i thought i had Klinefelter plus one extra problem, which is Anosmia ( Kind Of permanent, because i have never recognize how things smells like ) and then i search up for Anosmia. Google said permanent anosmia could happen because of kallman syndrome and a quick search makes me believe i has a kallmann. Going To see a doctor soon, after the whole pandemic probably.\n\nThe symptoms are :\n\nSmall Penis\nNot normal testicles\nNever had puberty\nNo pubic hair ( only small amounts )\nMy voice is still like a girl\nNo muscle like at all ( Hard to do exercises like push up, sprint, and etc )\nCannot smells\nVery tall ( Above average of my families )\n\nSorry if my English is messed up. If you do not see the signs of puberty although you are 19, I am sure you have Kallmann syndrome.\n\nI think I have Kallmann syndrome too, I am 16 years old. My pubic hair appeared when I was about 13 and nothing changed since then. I do a lot of exercises, but I am sure that I gain less muscle because of this shit.\n\nSorry for a question like that, but you can help me a lot if you answer that \ndo you have wet dreams sometimes?\nAnd can you ejaculate when you are masturbating?\n\nAgain, I know that these are so weird questions, but you help a lot if you answer. I cannot even eject sperm, lol. I had wet dream but does not necessarily makes me wet. Thanks for your reply. I had wet dreams like this when I was about 13. I have dreamt a lot about having sex, but never ejaculated. I had my first wet dream when I was 15, ( about a year ago from now) but if it would be the first sign of puberty, I would have moustache and deep voice... but I do not have. Just clearing things up, detailed answer.\n\nNo, i cannot eject even a sperm. I sometimes had wet dreams, i feels the sensation but unfortunately i still did not ejaculate. When i masturbate, i feels it will came out, i feel the sensation but yet again not a single sperm ejected. Probably every month, i had a dream of having sex. \n\nFrom what you wrote, i think you are just a late bloomer, unless you got Permanent Anosmia like me. I can smell, but not as good as other people. Although this, I have normal sense of taste, but maybe I just THINK that I have...who knows. \nWhen I masturbate, sperm comes out, (white, sticky) but it would fill a half teaspoon. That is not so much.\nI do not think that I am a late bloomer which is why my pubic hair appeared when I was 13. So I hit puberty, but I did not complete it, like Brandon Westfall (search for this guy, read his comments on Youtube and AMA because it is so helpful) Ok so maybe you just a late bloomer, and From what i read, KS had some severe, maybe, just maybe you got a mild KS That is true. And I would be happy if I would be just a late bloomer. Yeah i would be too. Anosmia from birth combined with an absent puberty is most likely Kallmann Syndrome. Both conditions separately are pretty rare to begin with, combined they are most of the time caused by KS.  \n\n\nWhat you need to do is get an appointment with your doctor first, or directly go to an endocrinologist. It depends on where you live what the usual steps are, but you should not wait for the pandemic to pass. Do not think you are not important enough. Not only pandemic tho, but economy too and my city is literally on the bad side, i am afraid the doctors will not take it seriously. And why do you recommend me to see doctor now ? Regardless of pandemic. Can it be too late to see the doctor? Physically a guy with Klinefelter and a guy with Kallmann syndrome can look very similar, though normally a guy with Klinefelter will have more advanced puberty and larger testicles.   \n\n\nThe blood work and genetics will be totally different however. The fact you can not smell could suggest Kallmann syndrome rather than Klinefelter.  \n\n\nSeeing a doctor to get a blood test work up would be the first step. Both Kallmann and Klinefelter will have low testosterone levels, with Kallmann syndrome normally being very low, even below the normal range for females. When you see the doctor remember to tell them you can not smell, it is surprising how many times people forget to mention this when they have lived with it all their lives and not every doctor will ask.   \n\n\nThe key difference is in the levels of two hormones, called gonadotropins, LH and FSH. \n\nIn Kallmann syndrome the LH and FSH levels are very low or even zero\n\nIn Klinefelter syndrome the LH and FSH levels are very high, well above the normal range.\n\nThere is a simple genetic test called a karyotype which can confirm Klinefelter, there is no reliable genetic test for Kallmann syndrome. Never too late to see the doctor. If you have Kallmann syndrome and low testosterone getting on some form of testosterone therapy will help you. Sorry to be picky but when you masturbate you produce semen. There is no way of knowing if this semen contains sperm or not without having a specific test and looking under a microscope.\n\nGuys with Kallmann syndrome &amp; low testosterone can still masturbate and produce semen but often they will produce a lot less than they would expect (especially if they have watched porn) and there will be no sperm in this semen. \n\nThe fluid in the semen comes from the testicles and a couple of other glands located close by. In Kallmann syndrome or pre-puberty these are not fully developed so the volume produced is less than you might expect a \"normal\" male to produce. I appreciate your help sir, yes I am always forgetting the fact that i cannot smell, and i thought karyotpe may works on me but you said no, so how can doctors confirm that i am Kallmann instead of Klinefelter, because Klinefelter is very often not known to the doctors here, even after doing karyotpe, i have seen some people in my country with potential Klinefelter and yet he did not even know about klinefelter, his doctor only tell him that he got low testosterone only. As well as testing for testing for testosterone, the doctor should be testing the levels of the two hormones, **LH and FSH**.\n\nIt is the result of the levels of all three of these hormones that will tell if you have Klinefelter or Kallmann. When i masturbate, nothing came out, not even a single liquid. If you not completed puberty yet you might not be able to produce much liquid, especially if you try to masturbate every day. If you drink plenty of fluid (water not alcohol !!) and abstain for a few days you should find you produce a lot more semen. \n\nIt does vary a lot from person to person though, some guys are are able to produce a lot more than others. Maybe i cannot produce liquid. But can i produce semen + sperm after doing Testosterone Therapy? Or the therapy does not work every time? If you have delayed puberty and go on testosterone therapy, you should get totally normal development and be able to produce semen and sperm just like any other guy.\n\nIf you have Kallmann syndrome and go on testosterone therapy you will get some development and be able to produce semen but you would require another form of treatment in order to produce sperm. \n\nThe key is the size of the testicles, if the testicles grow in size you are very likely producing sperm. If they stay small you can produce semen but not sperm. Honestly i did not really care about being fertile or not, because i have already accepted, what i want is fully develop my body just like normal person, like Lower voice, Have beard, and normal or near normal sized penis. Are these things can be gained by doing the therapy ? If you go on testosterone therapy you should develop most of the changes normally seen at puberty, apart from the testicles growing in size.\n\nYour voice will break, you will be able to develop muscle, you will look older and you will develop body hair. \n\nYou should be able to grow a beard, but this has to do with your genetics as well, but it will certainly help.  \nYou will have more energy and higher sex drive.\n\nYou should get some penis growth but it does depend on how old you are now, but most men with Kallmann syndrome do experience some growth but it might not be as much as you might want.   \nIt might take 2 years of treatment to notice all the physical changes but you will should feel the difference quite quickly. How often the therapy, because i have seen the proce of the testo gel, it is kind of expensive for me, is it 1/week or 1/month? The reason is that an appointment can take some time, might take 2-3 months from the moment you make it to the actual appointment. That and mentally/physically it could help alot to start treatment sooner than later. Luckily it is never too late.

Was wondering for those that had HCG treatment and experienced growth ( penis and testicle). How long did testicular growth take? Where did you start out at?

All though mood has improved I have not noticed much in the other area? My gf said she can noticed some change in penis like thickness and brain fog has greatly diminished. Libido has improved as well. So I am generally feeling much better and grateful for whatever improvement I can get. If anybody can share their experience, it will be greatly appreciated. I will dm you Cook If you have Kallmann syndrome, rather than delayed puberty you might not get much testicular growth by using just hCG.   \n\n\nhCG stimulates the Leydig cells, the testosterone producing cells, which do not provide much of the volume of the testicles. However they should grow a little in size and become more sensitive to the touch while on hCG.  \n\n\nIt does sound like you are producing natural testosterone which is a good sign so you should get some penile growth, both in terms of length and width but just how much you get will depend on your age.   \n\n\nI never get beyond 4ml in testicle size while on hCG but I do get a reasonable testosterone level. To get testicle growth and sperm production we normally have to take another injection alongside the hCG.   \n\n\nWhat dose of hCG are you on and what type ?  Thanks for responding. Yea I know it is case by case and happy to hear some progress stories. I am taking 2ml of pregnyl 3x a week. I started treatment end of February of this year, after many years of taking TRT. Since a kid I had low t and unmeasurable FSH and LH. In my early 30s now. Do you take HCG for long stretches of time? Since my diagnosis at the age of 23 I have been on different forms of treatment. I tend to alternate between taking testosterone therapy and taking hCG.  \n\n\nI prefer being on hCG since it produces a natural testosterone production and I think I feel better on that, even if my actual blood test result for testosterone is lower than it would if I was taking Nebido.  \n\n\nPregnyl has stopped production in a lot of countries and patients have had to find different versions of hCG to take. I used to take Pregnyl but at the moment I am using the Ovitrelle injection pen which is really for female use but it can be used for males as well.   \n\n\nI know you are injecting 3 times week, and the volume is 2ml, but do you know what dose of Pregnyl you are on. Are taking the 1,500 IU vials or taking 2ml from a 10,000 IU vial each time. On the side of the vial there should be a figure in \"IU/ml\" and it will normally be 1,500 or 10,000.   \n\n\nWithout treatment my LH, FSH and testosterone levels are practically zero as would be expected in Kallmann syndrome but it still took until I was 23 until I was correctly diagnosed and put on treatment.

We have a group on Facebook specifically for females with Kallmann syndrome / CHH.   \n\n\nThe treatment does work, and in some cases can work very quickly. Unlike other forms of female fertility women with Kallmann syndrome have the normal number of immature eggs within their ovaries.  Once the correct hormones are given, and more importantly at the right time, the eggs can be made to mature correctly and normal fertilisation can occur. You might not even need any form of assisted technique. There is a high success rate for this form of fertility treatment.   \n\n\nOnce you become pregnant the placenta normally develops correctly and can produce the hormones required as in any normal pregnancy.

When you say fast how many cycles ? \nI do not have Facebook.. thx again for your help When you say fast how many cycles ? \nI do not have Facebook.. thx again for your help I am afraid I do not have personal experience for you, but as a female with Kallmann Syndrome, my endocrinologist has reassured me multiple times that, with the injections, I should have the same or similar chances to get pregnant and carry to term successfully as any \u201cnormal\u201d woman, barring unforeseen circumstances that could affect anyone. He says that he has seen many Kallmann patients of his conceive successfully. He has also said that (dependent on a few factors) that he has seen female Kallmann patients conceive without any assistance - rare, but not as rare as you might think. So maybe this could be a reassurance for you? Does your endocrinologist not discuss these things with you? It can vary a lot from person to person. I have known women who became pregnant within 2 months of starting treatment, overs may take 12 months.  \nThe timing of the injections is important but there is a high success rate for this type of treatment.

If you know why please tell me.\n\n\nAlso, the bloodwork was tested 3 months ago, which means if my testosterone is normal, I need to see changes on my body after 3 months.\n\nI assume that my testosterone is just below the needed amount and that is why I cannot go throught puberty.\n\n**I also masturbated before the blood test** &lt;--Sorry, I know I am weird but I needed to write it down, it might be a reason why my T levels were higher than usual?\n\nI hope you can help", "Kallmann forum Hello,\n\nAlways good to see a forum dedicated to Kallmann syndrome.\n\nI was diagnosed at 23.

", "hCG treatment Hey guys, I am new to the sub, I got diagnosed at 18, (4 months ago) started the treatment w testosterone monthly and today I went to the doctor and he said I did not have developed much the testicles so he prescribed a 3 month treatment with hCG (I do not really know if that is right) every week\n\nSo, did any of you all used this treatment? What changes u got? Results? hCG is the hormone you need to produce your own testosterone but it will not increase testicle size that much if you have Kallmann syndrome or CHH\n\nThe new method is a three month treatment with a hormone called FSH or hMG which allows the testicles to grow in size first before adding in hCG at a later date. If your testicles have not grown in size at all since childhood using FSH first should give you the best chance of seeing testicular growth with both sperm and testosterone production.\n\nDo you know the name of the injection you have been prescribed ? I am taking the monthly intramuscular one, (I forget the name and I cannot understand the doctors prescription)\n\nThe doctor also said that the hCG is for producing sperm (or something like that) and help w fertility or something like that... It is FSH or hMG injection that will help you produce sperm and make the testicles bigger normally.\n\nSome men with KS who have had a little bit of puberty and the testicles have grown in size can produce sperm while on hCG on its own but it is not common. \n\nYou normally take hCG injections two or three times a week and it comes in a pen syringe form.", " Can we donate blood? Curious about donating blood, for those who are on testosterone gel/injections, are we allowed to donate blood? Could not come up with a reason why not. You should ask your doctor or the guys where you want to donate. Tell us when you know more!\n\nSince you do not separate female/male blood I think hormones are not that important. Yes, you can donate blood in the UK. I have donated on and off for over 20 years.\n\nYou will have declare your testosterone and have a medical interview for the first donation, which can delay the first injection for a little while but once passed you will be same as any other regular donor.\n\nFor some patients on testosterone giving blood is actually helpful as it can help reduce the Hb and haematocrit levels of blood which can be a side effect of long term testosterone delivery. Are there any ways to reduce these side effects? One effect of testosterone treatment is that over time it can lead to an increase in red cell production, which in turn can raise the haemoglobin and haematocrit levels within the blood.  \n\n\nWhen younger this is not much of an issue but can over time lead to an increase risk of high blood pressure and even strokes. Doctors will often order a full blood count or complete blood count every 6 months or so to check on the levels. If the Hb or HCT levels are too high they may stop testosterone treatment for a while.\n\nA way to avoid that is to remove blood from the circulation by taking a unit blood out of the body. This is called venesection, and that blood is normally thrown away. However if you are a regular blood donor this acts in the same way by reducing the blood volume. The body soon recovers and there is normally no ill effect in removing a unit of  blood from a donor.  \n\n\nYou can not really prevent it as it is a natural action of the testosterone and you do need the other benefits testosterone gives you. As you get older on treatment doctors may make more checks on your general health and even reduce the testosterone dose but hopefully not stop it totally. Well, that is a thing I will need to care of while being on treatment", "Abstract on article linking CHH with an increase risk of ADHD &amp; autism.

The absorption effect of oral testosterone undecanoate soft capsule does not seem to be very good, so will the absorption effect of testosterone gel be better? But testosterone gel is very expensive in China. I would like to ask about its efficacy and dosage. Andractim DHT 2.5% Gel 80g costs $160. If the effect is good, I would like to give it a try. No experience with the capsules, but I used the gel for several years. I felt it worked fairly well, I just got tired of having to put so much on everyday. \n\nAre pellet implants an option there? I have liked that the best for both convenience and most stable levels. Here (USA) the cost of my implants is far cheaper than the gel. Gel was about $400/month. The implants last me 5 months and it is about $500 each time. You should give it a try, it is different for different people. For me the gel was good in the first few days and got worse with time (and generally was not enough even at max dose)\n\nIf you like to travel keep in mind you have to keep bringing bottles everywhere you go and gets quite annoying Wait, we can get the implants in the states?

I am not sure if other facilities will be so low. I am worried about when my doctor retires. There is one or two other providers here who do implants, not associated with SottePelle and their prices are much higher. One wanted like $4k just for a consultation. The pellets themselves come from a compounder in Tennessee. They get shipped to my house after the doctor is in the order, then I take them to my appointment. Yeah, our healthcare system sucks. I know I am privileged to have good insurance. I have experience with testosterone cypionate injections, Androgel, Testoderm, and SottePelle implants. The implants and gel worked the best for me.

London. 17th August 2019. We are planning a patient meeting for Kallmann syndrome / CHH patients to be held in London on **17th August 2019**.\n\nProf. Nelly Pitteloud, a world leading KS specialist will be in attendance along with other KS experts from the UK.\n\nThe meeting will be a chance to hear about the latest news on diagnosis and treatment, ask medical experts questions and to meet fellow patients.\n\nFull details to follow. I am looking forward to this meeting.\n\nWe are hoping to have 15 to 20 people there. It is normally a good chance to meet fellow patients and to talk to KS medical experts. Some early thoughts after the patient meeting yesterday. In due course I will try to write a longer account with copies of some of the diagrams used in the presentations. \n\nThe ongoing research project to use Kisspeptin rather than GnRH as a diagnostic test for Kallmann syndrome is showing a lot of promise. This test should help to more easily identify a case of Kallmann syndrome / CHH from delayed puberty in teenagers aged 14-18. \n\nThe use of FSH only in pre-treatment for fertility is probably a better method than hCG only at first. Using two months of FSH treatment before the use of hCG mimics normal puberty more closely and gives better results in fertility treatments.\n\nEarly use of gonadotropin therapy (hCG / FSH / GnRH) in teenage years helps speed up fertility treatment when older. Early use of FSH / GnRH can allow male patients to become fertile with just the use of hCG (normally a lot cheaper) when older. \n\nFemale treatment as teenagers should be oestrogen only in the first instance, without progesterone. This mimics normal puberty more closely and is most effective for the development of secondary sexual characteristics. \n\nThe use of stem cells in treating KS / CHH, including the anosmia is theoretically possible and something that some research projects are looking into but it is still a long way off being able to be used in human patients. \n\nGenetic studies at present might not be able to help patient treatment but they do lead to a better understanding of how effective some fertility treatments might be and the chances of a KS / CHH case reversing.", "Talking to newly diagnosed Kallmann syndrome patients. Recently I have been having conversations with people who have just been diagnosed or are in the process of being diagnosed. \n\nIf somebody is late starting but has not been diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome / CHH I feel like I should hold off telling them all about the more negative parts of the condition as it might not be relevant and I do not want to worry them. However if they ask direct questions I have to answer the best I can.\n\nI do try to suggest what questions they should be asking their doctors and hopefully not being dismissed as just being a \"late bloomer\"\n\nIs there one piece of advice or suggestion you wish somebody had said to you when you were first diagnosed or looking to be diagnosed ? I\u2018m curious about what negative parts you want to keep unmentioned. I now a lot is difficult and you will not have a completely normal life. On the other hand it is nothing life threatening or something pushing you necessarily to the edge of society. What do you want to keep for yourself? (Just curious)\n\nMy advice would be to appreciate and maintain your friendships. Being older it is more difficult to form new relationships. And regarding Kallmann stuff: take your testosterone and be assured, you are normal. It is only when somebody is still in the \"late starter\" category and not yet been diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome / CHH that I perhaps would not give the full details of Kallmann syndrome, unless they asked directly of course.\n\nI try to advise them what questions to ask their doctors in order to get a correct diagnosis of KS / CHH or delayed puberty first. I just feel I do not want to worry a person with the full details of KS if it turns out they are just \"late\" and subsequently goes through a normal puberty. \n\nIf somebody is 20+ then it is fairly obvious that it is more likely to be KS / CHH so in that case I would answer any questions they might have and try to be as open and honest with my experiences with the condition and from talking to fellow patients.\n\nI never want to keep anything to myself, if anything I am always happy to talk about my experiences with the condition to anybody who wants to know. I do try to tell as much as I know about KS, especially that it is a broad spectrum condition and people will have different symptoms and severity of symptoms.\n\nI totally agree it is not life threatening and not something that should stop a person having a normal active life. I do certainly try to be as positive as possible when talking to others. Ok. I misunderstood you a little. For someone where it is not yet clear he has a genetic defect or is just late you of course do not need to go into detail. I appreciate that you help to answer questions. I wished that doctors would be more aware of these problems and a early diagnosis would be common. Did not have that luck myself besides obviously being way too late in development. what are the negative parts? I speak to a lot of fellow patients with Kallmann syndrome / CHH and their experiences do differ but it is not an easy condition to cope with sometimes.  \n\n\nIt is more on the psychological side, there is a feeling of being left behind both physically and emotionally as everybody your age develops. The lack of physical development at puberty can lead to a very poor body image and low self esteem. In more severe cases this can prevent people from engaging in physical and emotional relationships with others as they see themselves as totally inferior to others.\n\nThe fact that the condition causes infertility can be be a major social stigma in many parts of the world and not something a patient would want other people around them to know about.\n\nEven on hormone treatment patients with Kallmann syndrome / CHH do not have a normal puberty. Men with Kallmann syndrome are often left with undersized penis and testicles which can seriously affect their confidence. It is an invisible condition and not one that is easy to talk about or to admit to having. i guess a lot of that has happen to myself. the best you can do  when you start getting Testosterone is to work out and eat fairly clean. i have a good feeling relationship are way out the door although i still try but realise i am the problem and it never works out anyway. I think being in a relationship really does help when you have Kallmann syndrome, it can help you make yourself feel more \"normal\".\n\nIt has never worked out for me but I do see it in plenty of my KS friends where they have successful and happy relationships and marriages. \n\nBeing on treatment does play a part in trying to keep a positive outlook. It is certainly not the worse condition to have but it is difficult to look past it sometimes. What kind of stuff do you reckon it helps other than being normal?\n\ni guess your've just got to except the hard truth sometimes, it is what it is and there is nothing you can do about it. \n\nhave you ever spoken to a therapist about it? I have never seen a professional therapist but perhaps that might have been useful when I was younger. I see my therapy in being able to talk to and meet fellow KS patients on line and in real life.\n\nWhile a therapist would be good at getting you to talk and expressing your feelings I always doubt that they would have any real understanding about Kallmann syndrome to be of any practical help.\n\nIn a way it is a case of accepting \"it is what it is\" and making the best of it that you can. The small matter of getting over self confidence and body image worries might not be easy to overcome but it is possible. i get the same feeling about therapists, unless your KS specialist has a connection for a therapist which could be handy.\n\nyou say that your therapy is speaking to other ks patients but could that be why your getting self confident issues and worrying about your body image if your always thinking about it?\n\nyou do not piss out of someone else's cock", "I have so small palm and foot and thin fingers compared to other people.

", "Would it be possible to induce more penile growth at 23 by switching my treatment? Diagnosed at 16 and have been on andro gel since then. (23 now)\n\nDecember 2020 I begun a fitness journey that I take very seriously. Since my treatment I have always assumed the testosterone I was taking make me on par with any other guy out there. Sadly I have not really seen much improvement in my body other than a bit of weight loss. (I say this because after some research today I found its harder for us to build muscle like other guys. Not impossible, just a lot harder)\n\nOnto the subject matter here\n\nSomething that has been really bugging me lately is the size of my testies and penis. They are just so freakishly small. I look in the mirror and they just look so useless. Its really frustrating to think about. Because of this I have been putting off researching more into KS because I get really mad and frustrated when I do. However today I thought possibly there is something out there that can help.\n\nI have expressed my concerns to my endo for the past 5 or six visits (every 6 months) about how I am really concerned about my size and asking if the hormone therapy to produce sperm would help or possibly switching to injections. She brushes me off every time and is dismissive of it.\n\nAfter some research today I think it would be possible to potentially \"grow\" a bit more. I have read stories of men my age starting injections and growing to a normal size and having it reverse their KS completely. My endo has told me the overall goal anyways is to reverse it so I produce everything on my own. I am thinking of switching to a male endo as he might be a bit more sympathetic to my case. I also feel l have to hop on this asap as I am not getting any younger.\n\nI know I am not going to grow a really big penis. I just want to be a normal size. And I want this for myself to not for anyone else. Just want to be the best self I possibly can be.\n\nHas anyone here seen big improvents in growth with certain treatment? Should I just up my dose of test myself? I only switched from one testosterone medication to another and saw no changes at all (Testosviron to nebido). My penis is average size and testicles did not change at all like expected. I would not expect further penis growth with another treatment, though. Is your testosterone level normal with gel instead of injections? If yes I\u2018d say there is no real difference to my treatment.\n\nWith injections / sperm treatment I assume you mean the hCG treatment. I also heard of benefits and how in a few cases it helped to start the natural hormone cycle. Up until now I decided to not change my treatment though (never change a running system) and only think about it if I might want to try to get children. Maybe the idea of regular self injections did not help. But compared to the current injections into the muscle it is way more safe actually.\n\nApart from the genitalia issue I really understand your building muscle struggle. Did not know it is harder for us. I never see much progress but I still think it is due to suboptimal routine. I still have too much fat and therefore never really trained with caloric plus. If you lose weight that could be also your problem.\n\nI\u2018d like to hear from people with hCG experience, too. Would not say no if it is overall better. But I also fear that it might be less effective with less testosterone. I\u2018d really like to avoid further breast tissue for my mild gynecomastia.\n\nAlso increasing dosage without supervision seems not great. Should help the muscle growth but at the same time bodybuilder who use it are not known for a bigger penis. There are a lot of health issues with too high testosterone level. I would try to avoid it. A little more with ok from your doctor might be fine depending on your blood testosterone level. Penile size is dictated by the presence of stem cells in the penis during puberty. After our teenage years these tend to get re-tasked to other things in the body. There may have been some limited growth with first treatment. That said, even if you switch to another type of androgen, up your dose (do not do this, there is a lot of complications that can happen from it), or even manage to get your body producing on its own (which is also unlikely, reversals/the body kicking into puberty on its own is super rare with KS/HH), you are, unfortunately, probably going to be about as big as you are going to get.\n\nOn a GnRH treatment you may see testicle volume develop, though they will not get particularly large. After GnRH treatment you will also notice that they will reduce in volume as they are no longer receiving the correct signaling to produce sperm. r/angionmethod GnRH treatment would be a great treatment if more widely available. It is the one form of treatment I have not tried and would like to try if it I could in the UK. I prefer being on hCG because I seem to prefer the feeling you get with natural testosterone, even if my actual blood testosterone levels are lower than they would be if I stuck with testosterone therapy.\n\nhCG therapy can be a bit more intense with more injections but I think it is worth it.\n\nhCG with hMG and FSH treatment would give testicle growth which can be desirable but will normally only last for as long as you take the injections.\n\nI am not sure if there are studies to show whether you get better penile growth while on hCG than on testosterone. When first diagnosed doctors seem to prefer testosterone only first because it can give a higher testosterone level more quickly but personally I would have preferred to have been given hCG / FSH when first diagnosed. I did not start treatment (Nebido) until I was 23 so got very minimal penile growth. I seem to have more girth than the few other KS guys I have seen but I was left with just over 4 inches. It took a long time to get any sort of confidence.  \n\n\nI certainly know some KS guys who have started testosterone treatment at 15 or 16 who have got totally normal penile growth and more than happy with their results but it is so highly variable. I am holding out for gene splicing and stem cell therapy.\n\nDoubt it will happen in my time though. Not enough money in KS, and too much controversy in the states to support a lot of research on either. :/ ", "Two AMA's posted about Kallmann syndrome today. ( (", "Self perception in Kallmann syndrome. From my own experiences and from talking to / meeting a lot of fellow patients I do feel there can be a large difference between how somebody with Kallmann syndrome views themselves as a person and how others see them.\n\nHaving KS is such an invisible condition. We know how underdeveloped we can be, even when on hormone treatment but outwardly we look totally normal to other people and this probably affects our behaviour and the behaviour of others towards us. I think being on treatment can actually make it worse for some us (certainly in my case) where you can get the strong libido but still have this self doubt over your own development.   \nIt can be a hard thing to overcome but it can be done. Early diagnosis and treatment helps some but it is not always the answer, more important perhaps is how early we meet somebody who accepts us totally for the person we are (physically &amp; emotionally) and shows our physical development need not hold us back from having relationships. Very true, but I think finding a women to accept a man who views himself as \"broken\" early in life is nearly impossible unless one is desperate.  Regardless of the man's view of himself as broken or not, there are physical things that you cannot get around, like genital development or lack of secondary male sexual characteristics like body shape and facial/body hair.  Thankfully my genitals are normal sized, but I have nIHH not full Kallmann. However, feeling and looking 18 at 30 is a mind-fuck. \n\nIt is weird to think that ones genes put one in a position where for all intent and purpose, you are not supposed to reproduce.  Your genes are supposed to be gone from the gene pool, because they are \"wrong\" and that is kind of a fucked up thing to have to think about.\n\nOne need not accept it, obviously.  I am trying to date for the first time in my 30's after finally starting treatment and it is...hard. But I am being upbeat about it. do not forget, women can have kallmanns too! being a teenager or young adults with poorly developed breasts, no period, and no real functioning reproductive system is NOT easy to overcome, especially in a world where unfortunately looks mean everything to an individual.

My parents and I went to the doctors and they had multiple blood tests done on me. Not sure what is going on but all i know is that the doctors are waiting for a specialist. Apparently they are not in the UK currently or something and with covid its taking really long. I always get asked for my age and being in A-levels, I am reminded that I am not the same as everyone else. I really find this annoying, I cant smell a thing and its not like Im at least tall either so cant cant even play it off or something. Although i have not really struggled academically but its starting to get to me and affecting my grades at school. Im starting to get really sad about it and that is not fun at all. Im missing out on all the normal things teenagers at my age should be doing. I find it hard to relate to my friends sometimes but luckily they are very supportive. Please tell me i can have a normal life in the future where i can leave this behind me. Im posting here purely because I do not want the doctors to sugar coat anything about this condition, Im a completely new and have done hardly any research. Can someone tell me some basics or something? Please ask any question you may have. \n\nYes, you can have a normal life. You might require extra treatment to have children, but even that treatment has a good success rate.\n\nYou will notice the difference once you start on treatment. You may not get a totally normal puberty but you will get enough development to appear the same as anybody else your age.  \n\n\n16 is not a bad age to start treatment. I did not start treatment until I was 23.   \n\n\nAt 16 they will probably start you on adult dose testosterone therapy as soon as they can. This will produce nearly all the growth you normally see at puberty, with hair &amp; muscle growth, skin changes, libido &amp; penile growth. The one thing you will not get unfortunately is any growth in the testicles.  \n\n\nAre you in the UK ? yes I am in the UK, can you explain why there wont be any growth in the testicles? At 16 you could still have delayed puberty, but the lack of sense of smell does make Kallmann syndrome more likely.\n\nThere is a test the specialist will do to distinguish between delayed puberty and Kallmann syndrome.\n\nHowever since you are already 16, it is possible that they could start you on testosterone treatment even before you get a formal diagnosis. There is no need to wait, as you are noticing the effects of being left behind already.   \n\n\nIf it is Kallmann syndrome:  \nPuberty is controlled by hormones released by two endocrine glands within the brain. Normally when puberty is due the hypothalamus tells the pituitary to release the hormones that tell the testicles to start working and start puberty.  \n\n\nNormally the pituitary releases 2 hormones which makes the testicles grow, produce testosterone and sperm, which leads to puberty.  \n\n\nIn Kallmann syndrome there is a blockage between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is unable to receive the correct signal so it does not produce its own signal to tell the testicles to start working.   \n\n\nThe testicles remain in their dormant, small size they have been all your life because they have not got the correct signal from the pituitary gland. If you have Kallmann syndrome you can get treatment that will make the testicles grow and produce sperm and testosterone.\n\nHowever when you are first diagnosed they normally put you on testosterone first to get you through all the other physical changes, to make you look and feel like your normal age.   \n\n\nIt is a rare condition but there are a couple of very good KS specialists in the UK, one based in Newcastle and one based in London. You will have to see an endoctrinologist to get the full diagnosis but you can ask your GP to start you on treatment earlier if there is going to be a delay in seeing an endocrinologist. \n\nAt 16 you are still within the range of being a late starter, so it is still possible that normal puberty will start but getting on testosterone therapy will help. Thank You! I help to produce a range of different materials to help patients find out more information on Kallmann syndrome. I can send you links to medical papers and more comprehensive information if you wish.  \n\n\nI have a You Tube channel where I have collected some videos on Kallmann syndrome, some of which I have made myself.   \n\n\n /u/ndsmith38 is a treasure trove of information, as you have found out. :)\n\nFrom my perspective, since you are catching it \"in time,\" you will be better able to adjust than some of us that were caught later. It is really awesome that you have supportive friends, and they will help you a ton.\n\nI grew up in the US and my experience is going to be wildly different from yours, but try not to let it get you down. Since you are in the UK, getting access to androgen producing hormones, and treatment, will be less difficult---especially once the specialist is available. I know the wait is hard, but believe me, you are in a super good place to get this handled, and you are not too far behind everyone else. Just make sure that you stay on treatment, and life will get better. Maybe not perfect, but better.\n\nWe are also all here to talk to if you need support, and you are welcome back at any time. Welcome to the group. You are quite early with a diagnosis compared to others here. If you start treatment it is like you were a late bloomer. Just need regular injections.\n\nOnly difference the others mentioned already are your testicles. They stay small and you stay infertile. There is another treatment but I\u2018m not familiar with it. I currently have no kids planned and stay with the working testosterone. And of course your sense of smell will not suddenly work. But I do not really miss it, since I never had one.\n\nRegarding your height: with treatment I grew a lot and became quite tall. That is up to your genetics, but it is not unlikely. There is not an influence on intelligence as far as I know.\n\nYou can live with it quite normal! I missed out a lot due to late diagnosis, but you are still in a good spot! Hello, I am 15 and am quite self-conscious about literally everything (voice, height, lack of leg/arm hair, etc). In terms of the condition there is nothing really to sugar coat so much, aside from the fact that you will have to take testosterone artificially and will hit puberty a later than everyone else, there is not much to it. An extra step or two in terms of if you want to have children, but other than that... I think the most annoying part is what I am going through now which is where all my friends have hit puberty and I always feel self conscious of myself in the back of my mind. But once that barrier is surpassed there should not really be any problems. So I went from about 5'3 to 5'7 and gained about 15kg from when I started at 17 to now at 20. Worst part is the fact that acne suddenly came and is a bit bad", "Afraid to take hormones.. Hey all, I am a 28 year old female- I was diagnosed with Kallmanns officially in August (2019) \nMy doctor prescribed me a vivelle dot patch and prometrium pills. \nI have not started taking them because I am really afraid of how they will make me feel? \nAny other ladies have encouraging words about how hormones helped them feel better? Will they make me feel better? I am not a female, but have you been working with an endocrinologist or OBGYN?  I cannot say how hormones will effect you, but I have been using Sotte Pellet implants for probably 10 years and have been happiest with them. My provider is actually an OBGYN, but happens to be the only one around that does the pellet insertion. I think the majority of his hormone therapy patients are menopausal women.\n\nLook up Sotte Pelle and their provider map. Maybe there is a provider near you that you could discuss treatment with.", "I have been suspecting this Help would greatly be appreciated. My husband has total anosmia (no smell) which my mother in law always attributed to a fall he took when he was 7. Since he has no kind of memory of ever smelling anything, I have always thought it could be congenital and we should look further into the cause of it. I googled it a few years back and read about Kallman syndrome, but since he has had a normal puberty I brushed it off my mind. \n\nMy husband always refused to investigate further. However, 6 months into trying to get pregnant and no results got me thinking and I told my OBGYN about it. He told us to get some exams and we did, today we got the results. \nNormal spermogram (great count actually), but low LH (1.36). Besides the total lack of sense of smell, he has no other symptoms, maybe a mild case of gynecomastia. But had normal puberty, has a lot of facial and body hair, normal genitalia, etc. \n\nDoctor\u2019s appointment is in 3 days but I am scared. Any insights? Kallmann syndrome can come in a range of severities, from mild to severe.   \n\n\nPeople with mild Kallmann syndrome can go through partial puberty, and produce enough sperm to be fertile. Normally their testicle volumes would be in the 10-15ml range, a little below the normal adult range. If the FSH level is also low, along side the LH and testosterone it could suggest a mild form of Kallmann syndrome.   \n\n\nThe slight gynecomastia might indicate a lower than normal testosterone level.   \n\n\nHis doctor will probably check all the hormone levels. It would take a review by an endocrinologist to test for possible Kallmann syndrome. Thank you very much for your answer. The FSH level is normal as well so we will review it with our endocrinologist. Hoping fertility is not compromised... See I was told I have a mild version of niHH but it drives me crazy because there are no answers beyond that.  No idea why.  Idiopathic does not cut it for my psyche. I never liked the term idiopathic and it is not often used now, I tend to use the term CHH (congenital) when writing about the condition. There is a better understanding of how the hypothalamus is controlled which has helped doctors and researchers discover more about the root causes of HH. It is frustrating for me because I am on the border of diagnosis.  My levels were 171 ng/dL and I would sometimes get in the 250's or 290's on a 350-1,200 scale....but Dr. Dwyer said I probably did not have Kallmann which I agree with.  However, cannot cHH people have slightly higher levels? \n\nI thought I had an FGFR1/2 mutation because my sister and I both needed orthodontic work, have longer faces, and she had early closure of the sagital suture, and an extended lower jaw.\n\nCraniosynestosis with a bicornuate uterus which she has is associated with FGFR2 mutations, and FGFR gene is also associated with male hypogonadism.  \n\nMy testicles worked because I responded to clomid, however my hypothalamus was always downregulated in regards to GnRH it seemed because my pituitary produced very low LH/FSH. The normal sense of smell would take out the Kallmann diagnosis but you would fit into the CHH category I would suspect.\n\nIt is such a broad spectrum condition with a range of severities and extra symptoms. Do you have problems with your hearing by any chance ?\n\nI presume you are on T therapy with a level that low. \n\nI talk regularly with Dr Dwyer and meet up with him at least once a year. It is my husband, not me. No therapy whatsoever... we are just finding this out. I am terrified and he is too", "Fertility treatment? Hi fellows, I have been diagnosed \"KS\" but with sense of smell, at around 14/15 years of age (male). Now I am 32. I recently moved countries,  and doctors.  Even though I am not seeking fertility at the moment (but would like in the future) my new doctor is suggesting therapy with gonadotropin to \"prime the testicles\" for spermatogenesis. She said my earlier gonadotropin cycle (which was 3-6 months) was too short. \n\nI was trying to find info on the subject and wanted to ask if you did something similar and what to expect. hi there !\n\nwhile i would never will kallman syndrome on anyone, the \u201cbright side\u201d is that with the proper fertility treatments, most men are able to conceive. However, evidence shows that it can take up to 24 months, if not longer to start producing sperm with gonadotropin treatment.\n\nThe biggest barrier to starting this type of treatment is cost; without getting into the details too much, you will require injections several times a week with both HcG (an LH analog) and FSH. Again, depending on your country and insurance, this can range from little to no cost, to several thousands of dollars per month.\n\nHope this is helpful! Let me know if there are other questions I can answer CHH - congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  \n\n\nFar easier just to say CHH. There is a high success rate for fertility treatment for men with Kallmann syndrome / CHH but as already stated the time frame can be as much as 2 years. The key factor is the initial testicular volume (and FSH level). Generally you need a testicle size of over 4ml in order to produce enough sperm to have an un-aided conception.   \n\n\nSome men with milder forms of KS / CHH have larger initial testicle volumes and these men normally can achieve fertility a lot quicker, some are even sub fertile with no treatment at all.   \n\n\nIt does not matter how long you have been on testosterone therapy as this does not seem to reduce the chances of the gonadotropin therapy working. If you had un-descended testicles which were not corrected before 5 years of age, this could reduce the chances of the treatment working.   \n\n\nI have been on fertility treatments twice in my life as part of clinical trials. I have KS. I achieved sperm production both times but I have never wanted or needed to be fertile.   \n\n\nThe type of gonadotropin medication you need and the availability with vary from country to country but the premise is normally to give FSH or equivalent to produce sperm producing cells and hCG to allow natural testosterone production. It is the FSH medication that is normally the most expensive and takes longer to work, Thank you this is very informative !", "Question I have had just pubic hair for a year and a half and no other advancements should I be concerned or do people with kallmans syndrome even get pubic hair I am a 15 year old male Yes, kallman's syndrome people get pubic hair.

If you think you have kallman's, get a doctor to do some blood work for your Lh &amp; FSH hormones. If they come back low then you get to see an endocrinologist who will help you. I definitely will Patients with Kallmann syndrome can get stuck at Tanner 2 of puberty and look like they are just starting puberty but never really progress. The key sign of male puberty is to notice the increase in the size of the testicles.\n\nAt 15 years old you are still in the possible delay of puberty stage but it would be a good idea to see a doctor to check your hormone levels checked. \n\nIf you have no sense of smell, remember to mention that to your doctor as well.", "I just started treatment for HH, but I have to go to college next month. Should I do online or in-person classes for the first semester? I apologize if this is not an appropriate place to ask this question, but I figured the people who can best understand my situation is those who have went through it themselves. So I am 18 and have recently been diagnosed with HH (like Kallmann but without anosmia), and I just started testosterone treatment several weeks ago to induce puberty. Physically, I am mostly prepubescent. \n\nI am supposed to start college next month. My college is located overseas, several hours away from home. I will probably  Ever since I started getting diagnosed, my parents and I agreed that I will do online for the first semester, for the treatment to start kicking in and for me to mentally adjust. The second semester will be in the second half of the year - perhaps by then I will start looking more my age. \n\nHowever, I am beginning to have second thoughts. It seems like not a lot people are doing online school at the moment, and I really do not want to get left behind socially. I do not want to miss out on the full college experience. \n\nBut I am not sure if I am physically or socially mature enough to actually attend college. I still look like I am 12, for one thing. and I still have shit social skills. \n\nWill people bully/look down on me for my condition? Will I be able to make friends? I have not really been bullied a lot for my condition but that is probably because I go to a school of angels where most students are just really nice people. The most I have experienced are some friendly banter about my baby face or voice, which I do not really mind. But college is probably a different beast altogether. Plus, I am going to another country so the culture is probably much different altogether - maybe the people in my country are nicer. The thing is, I was supposed to start college last year but I took a gap year due to Covid. So another gap year is out of the consideration. \n\nAnother reason why I am nervous is that college will be the first time I have to act like an actual adult. I have always been under my parents wing and this time I will be alone, which is terrifying. It would probably be less terrifying if I look and feel like an adult.\n\nEven if I decide to go in-person, I am still not sure if it is possible to be fair... First of all, I do not know if my parents will agree to it, and secondly, how the hell do I continue healthcare in another country? I will probably have to do some research about that...\n\nRegardless, for those of you who went to college with KS, what has been your experience?

Hello everyone! I had my Kallman\u2019s syndrome found really late so I started taking testosterone at age 17 and stuff for my thyroid, I wanted to ask you all today if you have had a similar problem with weight? \n\nI have been slightly overweight my entire life, I am 19 atm and I have been trying to lose it ever since I was a kid. I somehow have not consulted a doctor about it yet but I somehow just cannot shake my body fat? I constantly stay at the same weight. I have tried all sorts of things, calorie deficits, diets, weight lifting, cardio, even not eating at all.\n\nNo matter what I do my body stays looking exactly the same, I have given up too many times. Now I have been trying to fix it again, I have noticed I am getting stretch marks but I fear it is not because I am losing weight, but gaining it. I am on a calorie deficit and only eat one meal in the morning and one in the evening. Currently I am also not taking my testosterone because I moved country and they do not want to prescribe it to me. Hey! I started when I was 18 as well (27 now), I was also a bit chubby. After a year or two I started shedding fat and gaining muscle. I also was working out and eating pretty good, though I have always retained a bit of fat in the sides/lower belly but I think if I really put my mind to it I could get rid of it for the most part. I have read it is pretty common for us to have fat in that area that is hard to get rid of. I have been doing crossfit the last couple years and am one of the better athletes, it just takes patience and commitment! Unfortunately it is your low testosterone levels that are potentially causing the problem. Testosterone plays a big role in fat distribution and muscle build up around the body. Also low testosterone can give rise to higher oestrogen levels which also can lead to fat distribution around the hips and breasts. \n\nThere are drugs you can take called anti-oestrogens or anti-aromatase drugs which can help reduce oestrogen levels which might help reduce the fat build up. However the most important factor is your testosterone level.\n\nWe need testosterone, not just for normal male sexual function but it acts on so many other parts of the body, most especially for bone strength and preventing diabetes. \n\nIf a patient is on Kallmann syndrome is on the correct treatment they should be able to loose weight and build muscle with the correct diet and excercise but without testosterone it would be an uphill battle.\n\nI would certainly try to find a doctor who will prescribe you testosterone.

Do any of you have experience with this and have a recommendation? Thanks! Kallmann's syndrome is an endocrine issue, you will need to go to an endocrinologist. There are some urologists who do specialise in the use of hCG / gonadotropins for male patients but these tend to people who have progressed through puberty and require their testosterone levels topped up rather than male Kallmann syndrome patients. \n\nKallmann syndrome is a rare endocrine condition and the best place to get treatment, in my opinion at least, is through a reproductive endocrinologist.\n\nA urologist might be better than an a standard endocrinologist who only treats diabetic / thyroid patients but a reproductive endocrinologist is more likely to have the experience in treating fertility issues with Kallmann syndrome patients.

What causes these problems? Do everyone have this?\n\nThe therapy does not always cause penis growth. Why?

Hey there,\n\nI use the gel, and have to every day. The mood swings are a pain for sure, though I cannot say for sure what it will be like for you. As for me, yeah they hit pretty hard. I honestly cannot tell you how to avoid them, but I learned to manage mine by doing activities to give my mind a rest. Walking and listening to music helps for me.\n\nWether there is a difference compared to gel and injections when it comes to mood swings, I cannot say.\n\nFrom what I understand the injection needs to be taken every three months (could be wrong). My doctor tells me that the gel generally takes longer developmental wise when compared to using injections, but the gel is a more steady approach, letting things develop over time at a more natural pace. There is also a risk of less height grows when using the injections.\n\nI have had the option to use the injections, but the gel works best for me.\n\nIn regards to pain, I have been on the gel for 5 years now, I have had no pain to be honest. Everyone is different though.\n\nThere has been notable growth in the nether regions for me. Only started to notice around a year or two into treatment. Do not be worried if you do not see anything change right away.\n\nIn regards to stopping the treatment and then starting after a break, I can say from my personal experience that there is no notable side effects. I have gone as long as a couple of months. Due to laziness and running out of gel due to disrupted deliveries thanks to Covid.\n\nHope I have been of some help. Thank you for reply How long time did it take to see major signs like facial hair? Facial hair has only just starting, hair in other areas appeared much earlier, about 6 months into the treatment.  Hello,\n\nFor the majority of guys with Kallmann syndrome the health benefits of being on TRT outweigh any of the possible negative side effects. If you find the correct method of TRT at the correct dose for you there should not be any bad side effects of TRT, you are just replacing the hormone you are missing.   \n\n\nMood swings can be avoided by ensuring that you keep your testosterone level steady and within a normal range. Sometimes this can be done by using daily gel application or by using more frequent but lower dose injections.   \n\n\nThe choice between gel and injection is often a personal choice, it might depend on how well you react to the medication. Daily gel application can give you a steady level but so can injections taken every 14 to 21 days.   \n\n\nAt the age of 16 you might get some penile growth but you will not get any increase in the size of the testicles. It might not be as much growth as you would like but starting treatment now should producing a noticeable effect. I am not sure about any pain associated with taking TRT, it is not something I have heard people mention before. It is certainly not a common event and if it occurs should be investigated as it is probably not linked to TRT. \n\nTaking TRT will help increase your bone strength and help you build muscle.  \n\n\nYou can stop and start treatment at any time but for your general health it is better to be on treatment. Try to monitor yourself and if you have side effects, try something different. I have been on TRT in different forms for 23 years. I started with testosterone cypionate injections once a week. Downsides were giving myself a an intro-muscular shot, and uneven energy levels. Then I did the daily gel for quite awhile (Androgel). Side effects were minimal and my energy level was fairly consistent. I tried the patch for awhile (Androderm). That gave me mood swings, plus everyone who noticed it assumed I was a smoker trying to quit. Now I do SottoPelle implants. For me that last about 5 months. This has been my favorite form of treatment. Everything is more even and consistent as long as I have my next implant on time. I have ended up a couple months late before and definitely experienced energy, libido, and mental decline. Hey man, I was 16 when I started and now 18. I did not use the gel because I am active in sports but I did use patches. They are very helpful and I highly recommend. I have not really felt any of the side effects from them Why could not you use gel? I mean why could not you use the gel if you are active in sports I just did not want to. I have used gel medication for other stuff and it is just annoying to deal with. The patches are easier Hello again! I thought of getting the treatment with the patch because I have read about the gel treatment and it seems it really needs a lot of attention. I would be happy if you would share some information about the patch treatment with me.\n\nCan you tell me how long do you need to leave the patch on? Also, can you go to water when your patch is on you? Yeah ao the gel is just a lot of work and requires a lot of attention. The patches are really easy. I just put it on every night. You can put them on your arm or leg but I usually put it on my thighs cause it is more discreet and you do not feel it. I forget it is even there too. And do not worry about activities cause I run track and work out every day and it stays on fine. It only may fall off if you are swimming cause the water but the gel will not do much against water anyways", "Sexuality for men with KS This post is particularly for the men in this community, but women's and other genders' opinions are also welcome, anything that keeps the discussion going.\n\nI had Kallmann Syndrome diagnosed since birth, and thus managed to get treatment early on and live a pretty normal puberty, comparable to that of people my age. However, besides my complete inability to smell, the other obvious symptom of KS I have is the reduced size of my sexual organs. \n\nNow, even though I personally do not mind the reduced size (given the complete functionality of it), I imagine that sexual experiences are pretty different for individuals like me (I would not know yet). And I wanted to ask, what are your experiences with sexuality as a man with KS? Has there been any difficulties with partners and self perception? How about protection like condoms, considering abnormal size? hey i am not a KS woman here. i recently thought i had that but it turns out i am just dumb and my hypogonadism and lack of puberty was solely because of a different endo disorder. still no clue why i have no sense of smell tho. anyway, here is my contribution to the discussion:\n\n1. Not all women care about cock size. there is a lot to sexuality that does not involve PIV sex. learn up on other stuff.\n2. Women like me cannot really accommodate a larger penis vaginally, whether because of KS or other hypogonadism disorders. So finding a partner that is specifically looking for smaller-membered guys could be like a match made in heaven.\n3. there is also a kink about smaller cocks, if that is your thing.

Being on testosterone or oestrogen / progesterone therapy can produce the majority of the changes normally seen at puberty.\n\nEarly treatment can prevent the feeling of isolation that can occur when patients see everybody else growing up around them. \n\nUndiagnosed young patients with Kallmann syndrome can feel like they are the only person in the world not going through puberty. \n\nIt is fortunate to meet a doctor who can link the lack of puberty and lack of sense together.

I do not know what made me google to see what Kallmann syndrome was/is. But I have all of the symptoms. \n\nI was born over 5 weeks premature, and all my siblings also had later development. So I attributed it to that. But one of my testes never descended. I do have some facial and pubic hair, but I do not get body hair. My ring fingers are noticeably shorter than my pointers. I could go on. The long arms. All of it. (A chiropractor told me at 17 that I had the growth plates of a 13 year old, and I have not grown since.)\n\nI now am pretty convinced that it is kallmann\u2019s. But I am 25 and have been able to build decent body mass through lifting, although my bones are frail. I guess I am just wondering if it is even worth getting treatment. Like would you guys recommend getting testosterone at 25? I just feel like at this age, the side effects might outweigh the positives that would come with making my body reliant on testosterone. Cause I have come to be pretty secure in who I am and just care to be as healthy as I can. If health is the only consideration, what would you suggest? \nWhat are your thoughts? Thanks guys! \n\nPs, I was in the doctor for digestive issues and they want to try to resolve that before they go on to anything else. Apparently my kidney does not function properly. I am wondering if they are linked. Hello, yes, if you do have Kallmann syndrome it is certainly worth getting a formal diagnosis and treatment.  \n\n\nStarting treatment at any age can help with your general overall health, especially in helping to avoid osteoporosis or diabetes.   \n\n\nWhen you say your kidneys do not function correctly, does this mean you are missing one of your kidneys ? This is a known symptom for a specific form of Kallmann syndrome.   \n\n\nDo you have a sense of smell ? I do have a sense of smell, but it is not strong at all. And I have both my kidneys but my doctor wants me to go to get them checked out because they do not function properly I think it is certainly worth seeing an endocrinologist, preferably a reproductive endocrinologist so you can get your hormone levels checked.\n\nLow FSH / LH can be cause low testosterone (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) (HH).\n\nKallmann syndrome is just a specific form of HH where the sense of smell is absent or greatly reduced. Yeah I got my thyroid checked and it is fine but my testosterone was at like 190. Did a lot of drinking with COVID and partying New Years fucked up my whole system. I am like 99 percent sure I have Kallmann\u2019s The levels of the hormones LH and FSH will give a good indication if it is Kallmann syndrome.\n\nYou can get partial Kallmann syndrome where puberty starts but seems to stop early which leaves you with lower testosterone levels.", "Receiving Testosterone I just got diagnosed with KS, I have a choice in the way I can receive testosterone (injections, gel, tablets, etc). What do you guys find is the best way? Ranking from my experiences: Implants, Gel, Injections, then patch.  No experience with tablets. My personal choice is the hCG injection, two or three times a week which allows us to make our own natural testosterone.\n\nSecond choice would be the long lasting (10 week) Nebido - testosterone undecanate injection.\n\nNext choice  would be the daily application of the gel.\n\nThe shorter lasting injections such as Sustanon or cyprionate are also good but have to be taken every 14 to 21 days to be effective. The implants are also good as they last so long but it does depend how well they are inserted.\n\nTablets are no good for us at all, the dose is far too low.\n\nYou can sometimes get testosterone capsules which I have never tried but other friends seem to like being on them. I personally use gel, it is less intrusive than the injections, but you do have to put it daily. Although the habit is formed pretty quickly. I had never heard of tablets before", "Has anyone had any genetic panels done and gotten worthwhile answers? Looking at this one, \n\nPretty frustrating you cannot order it yourself, my doctor says he does not even know how to do it. \n\nI know it is only ~50% likely that you might find an answer that is helpful.  Just wondering if people have had success. Thanks. I have not done a KS or HH panel specifically, as when I was diagnosed it was not reliable (and still is not to my knowledge). I was genotyped to make sure we went with the right treatment.\n\nI do have a 23 and me profile, and asked them about KS/HH testing, and was shot down as there was not \"sufficient demand\" and was not enough data for them to work with. I have only had genetic testing done through research centres and clinical trials. I have provided samples a number of times over the past 20 odd years. Recently they have told me they have found a new variation in the SEMA3A gene, this is an addition to variations in the ANOS-1 gene that I knew about already.   \n\n\nI am very wary of ever paying for any sort of genetic testing for KS / CHH, there are far too many variables and unknowns. With over 40 known genes which cover only 50% of cases it does make getting a clear cut answer difficult.  \n\n\nResearch centres are always happy to take samples from you but it may be years before you get any results, though one advantage is that they always retest samples when new genetic variations are found.

I could never understand all these years what was wrong but when I researched the signs of kallmann I figured I actually have some of the signs the only thing is I do actually have sense of smell so it may not be kallmann at all. You will probably want to see an Endocrinologist. Your physician should be able to refer you to one.

If you can produce semen yes it is possible to have child Most men with Kallmann syndrome do produce semen when they ejaculate, however due to the testicles being underdeveloped this semen normally does not produce any sperm so they are infertile.\n\nA very small percentage of men with milder forms of Kallmann syndrome have larger testicles and can produce sperm while on testosterone treatment.\n\nYou would need a sperm test to see if you were producing sperm within the semen.\n\nThe majority of men with Kallmann syndrome would require specialised treatment, known as gonadotropin therapy, in order to be able to produce sperm and become fertile.

Hello, im wondering if this levels are indicative of kallman syndrome ? FSH 1.61 mIU/ml, LH 3.09 mIU/ml and testosterone 426ng/dl.\nI also have a pretty bad sense of smell, i would say that i can barely smell stuff.\nIdk if this is relevant but on mri my testicle volume was 8ml, i even suspected Klinefelter syndrome but my gonadotrpin levels are way too low for klinefelter's, i think that my endocrinologist might order some sort of genetic testing to figure out what is going on Low FSH, LH, testosterone and a bad sense of smell was enough for my endocrinologist to say it is Kallmann. There are genetic tests, but since not all mutations are known it might not give a definitive answer as far as I know.\n\nOne way I think it is common to test is by stimulating hormone production with GnRH. If you get LH and FSH as reaction you\u2018d assume Kallmann. Not 100% sure.\n\nIn the end the therapy is the same for all. Important is to make sure it is not a tumor (I got a mrt of the brain) to safely start with testosterone substitution.\n\nEdit: I should add that I\u2018m not that familiar with the numbers regarding lh, fsh and testosteron. I assumed they are low for you. If you want to I could check what amounts I had before therapy. A mild or partial form of Kallmann syndrome is possible, especially with the lack of sense of smell. The testosterone, testicular volume and gonadotropin levels are all at the lower end of the normal range expected for adult male. They are all higher than you would expect in a severe case of Kallmann syndrome but the condition does come in different severities.\n\nFor comparison, my levels of LH and FSH are 0.5 IU/ml, testicle volume of 2-3ml and testosterone 50 ng/dl.\n\nA review by an endocrinologist would be a very good idea. They would probably still do a karotype to rule out Klinefelter but as you say, that would be very unlikely with those figures but not totally impossible. Genetic testing for Kallmann syndrome itself does not often give a clear cut answer because there are so many different genes &amp; variants to test for.   \n\n\nThe endocrinologist would have to check the rest of the hormones produced by the pituitary gland to see if there was a reason for the low levels of gonadotropins. Yes i would like to know what your levels were before therapy, thank you Yeah, i do not even know if my dr will order a karyotype for klinefelter's with this levels, what concerns me is that as you said i could have partial kallman syndrome or maybe even mosaic klinefelter's and that they might not be detected Ok, I looked them up. Testosterone 0.61 ug/l, LH &lt;0.1 IU/l, FSH 0,51 IU/l. At time of measurement I was 20 years old.\n\nSo less testosterone (61 ng/dl), LH and FSH than you got. With substitution I\u2018m at 421 ng/dl. So actually with those values I kind of have my doubts that you\u2018ve got Kallmann. Perhaps a very mild form, but still sounds strange. Your testicles seem to do their job more or less. Thanks for letting me know, yeah my T levels are not that low, they would still be expected to be more in the 600-800ng/dl for a healthy 20 year old though, specially since i would consider myself someone with a healthy lifestyle, i eat well and workout i mainly  lift weights. My fsh levels are quite low though and LH is still a little on the lower end so idk really what is going on, im still waiting for my sperm test results to come back, if i have no sperm or a small number i certainly have a problem. Wait for your results and talk to the right doctor. You need to visit an endocrinologist. He\u2018ll tell you what it might be and what you can do.\n\nAt least you got your puberty. You will find out what is going on, I\u2018m sure! With the right endocrinologist, hopefully one that specialises in reproductive endocrinology you should be able to get onto some form of testosterone therapy to boost your testosterone level.\n\nSome doctors, especially in America it seems, are getting more reluctant to prescribe testosterone even to patients such as ourselves who need it.\n\nWhile your testosterone level is higher than a standard case of Kallmann syndrome you might still benefit from testosterone, esepcially to help prevent osteoporosis. An appointment with a genetic counselor would be a good decision. It is hard to fully detect and self diagnose if you have not fully discussed the possibilities with a professional in the field. There are a variety of online telehealth companies that provide genetic consultations online with a professional in order for families and loved ones get the diagnosis that they are looking for. Diagnosis of ( Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and more have been successfully assisted by these telehealth forums. It is great that your endocrinologist is getting those tests run to hopefully get the answers you are looking for. I would highly suggest checking it out FDNA telehealth as well! Actually im a mexican, and live in mexico, but yeah pretty sure they are just as reluctant in here because my dr told me that 426 was normal and fine and hearing that honestly bothered me because it is not really true, im a 20yo male with a healthy lifestyle, it should definetly be higher than that, they might be a bit more open to the idea of hcg, specially if my sperm test comes back and my sperm count is low, do you think that with my gonadotropin levels i could see an improvement with just hcg ? Hey man, I am (17, male) in the same situation, my T levels are almost the very minimum and my endocrinologist says my T level is normal while it should clearly be higher. The average T level is way higher for someone at my age. Yeah i do not know why they pretend like low testosterone is normal, especially in young males like us, what i find even more stupid is that a lot of doctors it seems are more willing to prescribe trt to older men than to younger men, like wtf, if anything it should be younger men who should be getting trt since we are the ones who actually should have/Need high T Giving T to younger males can be an issue as it can cause the testicles to shrink and may even halt production as the body is receiving T from an outside source. For older men, it is given as production begins to slow down, in order to helps maintain levels. What does it matter if they are not producing enough anyways ?   Erectile dysfunction, lack of testosterone leads to it, and just like men with KS they out way too much emphasis on what is between their legs and in their pocket books.", "With testosterone injection treatment will everything grow and essentially be normal? I am 22. Recently started taking testosterone injections but previously was being prescribed gel sachets. I was just wondering if it would essentially make my body normal for this age or if I will forever be baby-faced, hairless and not particularly well endowed? It is the same as the patches in effect. Depending how long you have been taking it, you will start going through puberty which will deepen your voice and give you some body hair. But the effects of delayed puberty will always be with you. I have been mistaken for 10 years younger than i actually am since I was your age. It usually takes 3-4 months of treatment to see the first changes according to other people's experiences I read.    Your facial hair will probably appear much later, but that is different to everyone. If you are taking the right dose of testosterone and staying within normal range all the time then you should notice body changes over time. Normally for KS men weekly or fortnightly injections are far more effective than monthly injections.  \n\n\nChanges will take time though, but you should get hair growth, muscle growth and look closer to your correct age.   \n\n\nYou will not get any testicle growth while on testosterone therapy unfortunately.

I ignored that I looked way too young. Around 20 I think I really understood that something is wrong but I pushed it away. Being afraid that I failed in being a man.

I just cried and blocked any talk about this topic. I could not handle the confrontation of not being manly at such an age.\n\nFinally I went to a doctor but no one had an idea what illnesses/defect it could be. In the end I found out myself that it is Kallman based on the blood values and long online google sessions. Reading about the not smelling part was a revelation.

The doctors I went to were the wrong ones and failed to forward me to the right specialists. I was not capable of seeing my issues and pushing for a solution earlier.

Especially since a lot of the symptoms seem to be flipped depending on your sex/chromosome make-up/whatever you want to call it.\n\nI will also be tested for PCOS and other hormonal issues, but the anosmia part seems really specific to KS.\n\nThanks for reading, and for all the posts ya'll make here! I have learned a lot. Male here. I do not even know what I have but I call it KS because that is the easiest way to describe it. If it is not Kallmann's, hh might be a thing I have but I cannot be sure because there are so many things that can cause delayed/absent puberty.\n\nThe main thing (obviously) is that I have not started puberty at the age of 17 and other than that I might have lower sense of smell but I am not sure about that either, because I would say I can smell but I cannot smell things as strong as other people I guess.\n\nIt also confuses me that my hormone levels are actually way higher than most people's with KS but still not high enough. That is the result of a blood test that was 9 months ago so if everything was ok, puberty would have started since then. Which hormones were tested for? Adrenal glands produce a small amount of testosterone but if you have LH and FSH you probably are not KS.\n\nKS can exhibit partial anosmia as well as total anosmia and it can change through life! I was born total anosmic but now have a teeny tiny amount of smell. The anosmia is a very good indicator with the clincher being low LH and FSH levels.  41/M - My symptoms were more minimal. Did not go through puberty until after hormone replacement began at 17. Small penis and testes. Extremely low sperm count (was considered infertile, but surprise, we had a baby). I have always had a strong sense of smell. My endocrinologist only considered KS because I have a sister who exhibited more symptoms than myself. She is never been diagnosed (with KS), other than her doctor prescribed estrogen. I had genetic testing. After 24 years on testosterone replacement, most things are normal for me, other than smaller penis and testes. To me it just means I have to get shots every few weeks, while being somewhat socially awkward. That is how I could diagnose myself, because the doctors I went to did not knew what to do. Damn it took me some time, but once I stumbled over the anosmia part I knew I got it. Same here. My GP did the initial bloodwork, it came back with the low levels and I stumbled on the anosmia link in my research before my appointment with the specialist. The specialist was scratching his head cause he could not figure it out and I told him it was kallmans because of the anosmia. It was so clear when I read about it. Never actually admitted to me that I cannot smell. Always thought I\u2018m just really bad at differentiating smells.\n\nGlad we live in a time where such knowledge is easy accessible. 20 year old M by the time i wad 18 i still hadnt hit puberty and having a lesser sense of smell we went to the docter and he didnt diagnose me with it outright but we did a blood test and sure enough my testosterone was low so we did shot witch were ok but i guess due to my body type were pretty hard to do and right now i have to wait for covid to lighten up hopefully  to undergo a different treatment Interesting that your sister had signs of KS too! I have a younger sister who seems to have zero signs of it, AFAIK anyways, but it makes more sense now that I know all of these seemingly-unrelated \"deformities\" or irregularities are connected. If you have KS, there is a laundry-list of things you might have going on, but they are all tied together.\n\nInteresting about the fertility part. That is probably the biggest marker that does not apply to me either. My period is irregular as hell, yet I have been pregnant before. \n\nThanks for sharing :)", "KS Problems... I do not know what is worse, My doctor thinking I am a female or having osteoporosis as a 36-year-old male.  Both are just as bad perhaps.  \n\n\nThe can not even spell \"Kallmann\" correctly which is never a good sign.   \n\n\nI have been questioned when picking up gonadotropin injections from the pharmacy about whether I was sure the injections were for me as the pharmacist had never seen them prescribed to a male patient before.  \n\n\nOr on a pre-treatment blood test result where my testosterone level came back as virtually zero there was a lab note attached \"patient recorded as male, please check if correct\". I have osteopenia rather than osteoporosis and somehow it has remain unchanged for a while now. I do not take Vitamin D, which I should do but have a DEXA bone density scan every 3 years.

I cannot find much information for what I am specifically looking for, but I am sure you might have some resources or at least valuable insight. Thanks! Hello,\n\nWhat information in particular do you need. I should be able to provide some suitable references for you.\n\nI can help you with any questions you may have.\n\nRegards,\n\nNeil.  I sent you a PM. Hello! I live in Socal and I am a female teenager with Kallman Syndrome. Are you looking for patient accounts or anything? I am always excited and wanting to help in any way possible with any research that could possibly be done!  Hi! Sorry for the slow reply, I saw your message and thought I would write back from work, but work frequently makes me forget things as usual.\n\nI am definitely interested to hear your story if you are willing to share. I understand the basics behind Kallman, but I have been very curious to learn about cognitive development. I think cognitive development has been neglected in Kallman because everyone assumes the behavioral difficulties that can arise are due to psychosocial stressors of living through your teens while watching all of your peers maturing. While that certainly has an incredible impact, I wonder if there is not something deeper that has gone undetected. \n\nThe brain matures during puberty. This is when our cognitive abilities become finely tuned and we \"mature\" into adults. In particular, we learn to not be impulsive, we learn patience, empathy, etc. It only stands to reason that this development of maturity may also be slowed in Kallman, which is where I become very interested. \n\nThere is not much research into this that I have found. Maybe you would be able to shed some insight. \n\nThank you for writing!\n\n \n\n Hello,\n\nI am a 24 year old female with Kallmann's. I understand your thought process and would like to provide my two cents on it. Note: I did not know I had this disorder while growing up, as I was being assured I was likely just a \"late bloomer.\" I began taking a very low dose of estrogen at age 19 and am still in the process of increasing my dosage over time. \n\nI was always a precocious child, labeled \"mature\" and to this day called an \"old soul.\" I excelled in school, I was responsible, I was likely too logical and reserved and should have allowed myself to be more impulsive. Furthermore, I am also an actor and feel things very deeply. I would describe myself as an extremely empathetic person. All of my career tests in school told me to become a counselor or therapist, which I find ironic now considering how badly I need therapy to sort out the years of psychological damage this disorder has inflicted. \n\nI cried most nights throughout high school and into college. There are numerous journal entries describing how I felt like a mature woman on the inside but was being trapped by a child's body. It was a horrible, horrible feeling that lingers to this day.\n\nFrom what I understand, Kallmann's is connected to the hypothalamus and/or pituitary gland in the brain. While the endocrine system is related to MANY of the body's functions, I feel that the way we mature mentally is more connected with our environment than our hormones. (The good old \"nature vs nuture\" dilemma.) I credit my parents for raising me to be a considerate, intelligent person. We mature mentally during regular puberty (let us say ages 12-15) because we are changing and learning rapidly. I still grew taller, communicated more effectively, learned new things, had crushes, found new hobbies. I just was not going through sexual puberty. Thank you for taking the time to share your story with me. I have not had the opportunity to learn much about Kallmann's because the science is so sparse! Your story is telling though since your cognitive development sounds typical. I saw in another post that you said your mother said that she was a late bloomer, which is very interesting as well. I suspect there could be a wide range of severity, going off of what I know about the development of the neurons that fail to meet their connections. It also sounds like you have a great support system, which I think can effectively counteract the loss of input from puberty. But, when someone may not have a great support structure, it could lead to stunted cognitive development as well. I think generally that your story may be more typical in Kallmann's.  Important to note, this is all complete speculation right now. I have not run a single experiment yet and may not ever. But I am so glad to hear your account, thank you. ", "Question about labs Hi I have a question regarding my labs. I am 33 yo caucasian male.\n\nI have had symptoms of low testosterone/hypogonadism. My LH and FSH are both pretty low. Free testosterone is pretty much bottomed out.\n\nI cant grow really any facial hair. I can only grow a mustache and some chin hair and a handful cheek hairs. I have pretty light body hair too.\n\nI also look like I am in my 20s.\n\nI guess my question is has anyone here had normal total testosterone levels but with low fsh,lh and free testosterone.\n\n You do not have KS with a total test over 700 ng/dL.  Consider yourself lucky. The reason why I ask is  because my LH/FSH is so low along with my free T. Is not LH  a factor in testosterone production?\n\nThe T is pretty much all bound up. And like I said my body/facial hair seems to be pretty scarce.\n\nDo you think it is another issue them?", "HELP NEEDED URGENTLY 22 years old here reached puberty very late at 17 and only got some pubes till now. I didnt grow at all the last 3 years.....I look like a 15 year old. I went to a lot of doctors and no one figured out what I have. Never got an erection and currently looking into this problem with a urologist. Other than the erection problem......how can I finish my puberty ? I posted on the sub ask doctors and someone told me look into kallman syndrome and I found this sub. \n\nMy blood tests are normal. What could be the problem? A gene defect maybe ? How can I confirm a gene defect ? Well if you think it is a gene defect ask your doctor to schedule a blood test to check for a gene defect. I am in the same boat I did not start puberty till 19 but, Kallmanns syndrome is not a horrible life threatening disease. If you have Kallmanns syndrome the the least you will have to do is take a testosterone shot twice a month for the rest of your adult life. And on the worse end of it you will probably have to have 3 shots a month for the rest of your life. But for most people with \u201cKS\u201d are infertile so if you can try and freeze as much viable sperm as you can so if you want you can have kids. Do you have a sense of smell? Hi yes I can smell things.... however I cant breath from my nose due to an unknown reason. Also I had a problem which was that my teeth did not come out normally and I had to several operations to solve this. Hi I am currently not in my home country. For the gene test.... should I go to an endocrinologist or I must go to a human genetics doctor. Also are there types of genetic tests or its only one test ? Also do you know which doctor should I go to ? Endo? Human genetics doctor ? Also should I just do a DNA test or there are types of Genetics test? Hope you help me. You are likely going to need to go to a few different types of doctors from the sounds of it. If your hormones are normal, and you can smell, then it is unlikely to be Kallmann's Syndrome. I would suggest talking to your family doctor and getting some referrals to the appropriate specialists. Other than kallmanm syndrome... can it be a gene defect maybe ? It is entirely possible, I looked through your comments and found your blood panel, you definitely do not have KS with the numbers you reported. \n\nYou are also exactly average for height and weight for an adult male (at least in the US). So there is nothing to worry about there.\n\nThe other factors I am afraid I cannot help with. You will need to go to a general practitioner (as others have stated), and have them look you over and give recommendations. Okay however I look like a 15 year old and because of this my life is a misery... I cant do anything because of this. So I am really lost here. I appreciate that, and unfortunately some people do just legitimately have a \"baby face.\"\n\nGiven your other symptoms there may be an underlying cause but it will take a trained doctor to uncover what the issue is. What blood tests are normal ?  \n\n\nHave you had your levels of testosterone, LH and FSH checked.  \n\n\nGenetic testing for Kallmann syndrome is not really effective but you could ask for a karotype, which is a very simple test to count the number of chromosomes you have, see if you have a condition called Klinefelter syndrome which can produce similar symptoms.\n\nIt would probably be a good idea to see an endocrinologist, preferably a reproductive endocrinologist who can do a full hormone work up and testing. You could have normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism like I do.  Sense of smell is fine, but delayed or absent puberty.

I have diffused thinning and have been going through this since I was in grade 6. For almost 9 years doctors thought that my hair was normal and they did not realize it was thinning. But now I have gotten minoxidil for it and it is improving. If anyone else had any hormonal imbalance? Did you just use minoxidil or should I start spironolactone? \n\nI just wanted to know if other Kallman patients are going through this too. If not then I will go for a scalp biopsy and see what happens.\n\nI would ask my doctors about this but they did tell me there could be a connection but from what they listed are symptoms of Kallman's, hair loss was not one of them. I\u2018m 31 male and got a receding hair line. But I think it is just normal in my case. Without testosterone it might not have happened, but that discussion seems kind of futile.

I never started puberty, have a micropenis, and am currently taking testosterone. I also do not have a sense of smell at all. I have never been able to smell.  \n\n\nI guess the question is... should I care and does it matter? Nope if the blood work says you are clear then there is nothing to worry about There is no bloodwork for Kallmann.  There are genetic markers but there are numerous ones.  \n\nWhat is your LH and FSH and testosterone levels? I do not remember off the top of my head but I know that blood work is a major factor for identifying Kallmanns other than just physical signs The gonadotropins are what you would measure, LH and FSH.  I was asking OP anyway. Waardenburg and Kallmann's are not inclusive of each other (meaning having one does not automatically mean you have the other).\n\nIt is possible you have a genetic short straw, but until you doctor pulls blood samples and examines your FSH and LH levels it would be impossible for anyone to say with certainty.\n\nIf your Endocrinologist is not willing to check these, then talk with your primary care doctor. They will probably be willing to do the tests and can fill you in with the results, and if you have it, your endocrinologist. There is a genetic link between the two conditions, a gene defect in the SOX10 gene has been shown to cause both Kallmann syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome. You could have them at the same time. The fact you do not have a sense of smell would tend to suggest Kallmann syndrome as well.   \n\n\nThe fact you are on testosterone therapy is good, since that is the primary medication for Kallmann syndrome.   \n\n\nUltimately the treatment might be the same but I think it would be good to know yourself if you had both conditions. I would try to get a second opinion from another doctor if you can. It might be that you will have to find another endocrinologist, one who specialises in reproductive endocrinology.  \n\n\nIt would be useful to know your LH / FSH levels.

Coming up and down from changing hormone levels has immense side affects.\n\nThe solution would be to do an injection every 2 weeks instead of 1 per month and to possibly increase dosage amount so it lasts till the next shot.

I will be doing intramuscular injections monthly. I know it is not exactly Kallmann Syndrome, but it is basically the same thing. AFAIK Kallmann is just a subset of HH with anosmia, which occurs in about 2/3rds of CHH cases - well I am the other 1/3rd. I figured treatment should probably be the same for us.\n\nSo for those of you who have done testosterone therapy to induce puberty, may I know how long it takes to see results? Can you tell me a general timeline for when I expect things to happen?\n\nI am going to be starting university March next year, hopefully would have improved by then. I do not want to look like a 12 year old kid hanging out in the dorms. Honestly, my main concern is probably my voice, since there is a good chance I will be doing Uni online anyway, at least for the first semester. Plus, as someone who plays games online, it is really embarassing to be mistaken for a 12 year old when you are 18.\n\nAlso, can I expect to grow taller, or at least grow taller *faster*, during the testosterone therapy? I am about below average to average height, for my country at least, but I know I could be way taller since my dad is very tall and my 15 year old brother is way taller than me. Plus every male in my family, both paternal and maternal, are quite tall. The genetics should be on my side. It is a continuous process that will take far more than a few months, like normal puberty. I cannot really remember what changes came first and how long it took, but you might expect first results after those four months. Do not be too unhappy if it takes more time.\n\nI was the 12 year old kid over nearly my hole university life. I understand your fear quite well, but you are in a good position!\n\nRegarding height. I grew a lot during treatment. Was not exactly short to begin with, but I\u2018m 1.98m now. Maybe I already was 1.8m - not sure but I got a lot of comments because no one expected me to grow that much being that old. So I\u2018d say it is possible for you to get a growth spurt.  You are quite correct the treatment of CHH and Kallmann syndrome are the same, it is not possible to treat the anosmia at the moment so they are basically the same condition. The differences come with the gene defects involved. \n\nI got my growth spurt at 19-20, before diagnosis and treatment. The growth spurt is normally independant of testosterone levels and should occur even if we are on treatment or not. \n\nThe one thing to watch out for is starting full dose adult level treatment before you have your growth spurt as taking testosterone too early can stop the growth spurt too early.\n\nNormally doctors will start you on lower doses of testosterone before reaching maximum dose after 12 or 24 months once you have had the growth spurt.\n\nThe pyschological changes will occur before any physical ones, so you may feel the difference in energy levels, sleep patterns and sex drive before you see any physical signs. Normal puberty can sometimes take up to 5 years to fully complete so some of the physical changes will take a little longer to develop.\n\nI did not start treatment until I was 23, unfortunately I can not remember when my voice broke but I certainly remember feeling and looking more closer to my correct age within a year of starting treatment. Can relate to the part about being mistaken for a 12 year old when gaming, it is a struggle.\n\nProbably not much help, but I started taking Testosterone Gel in May, half a pump at first which is about 10.2mg of testosterone, and in September I started using a full pump. My voice has changed slightly, but still very young-sounding ( though I think my anxiety plays a heavy part ). I was already tall ( 6'2 ) before starting treatment so I cannot comment on that.", "Kallman Syndrome? Hey, \n\nSince last september I have been seeing docters about my mental and physical state. I am in my second year of university, and tired all the time. I litterly have no motivation to do productive things. I always thought I had a lower libido than others, but I did not see it as a problem. Till lately. That is why i began seeing docters, and next monday I will have my first appointment with an endocrinologist.  I  have development of almost all secondary sexual characteristics, except facial hair/chest/back hair. My voice got deeper, but not drastically. So that is the reason I never saw a problem, and just thought this mental feeling I had was normal. I lack a completely sense of smell since I can remember actually. So that is why I have this question. I have had 3 bloodtests so far. My fourth bloodwork will focuss on other hormones, like cortisol, prolactin, shbg as I saw on my reference. \n\nAge = 19\n\nTotal testosterone came in at 75, 77 and 93. (between 2.7 and 3.2 nmol/dl) \n\nFSH = 1.9\n\nLH =  2.1\n\nI read on the internet that low T can cause alot of negative symptoms, like a depressed feeling or moodiness and irritability. So is the change high I have this syndrome? Does anyone know?\n\nThanks for reading, \n\nMath. Hello,  \n\n\nThose results would certainly be in the range of having Kallmann syndrome. The LH / FSH levels can vary from person to person, depending on the severity of the condition.  \n\n\nIn my own case my FSH / LH would both be less than 0.5 IU/ml.   \n\n\nLow testosterone can certainly lead to a range of symptoms such as tiredness, irritability, problems with sleep &amp; concentration and low libido.   \n\n\nWith LH / FSH levels like that you might have had some pubertal development and testicle growth but certainly nothing like normal puberty.  Hopefully a full hormone work up with perhaps a GnRH or Kisspeptin challenge test will give a better idea.  \n\n\nI would certainly be asking about a DEXA bone density scan and checking on Vitamin D levels.  \n\n\nI think you would notice the difference if the endocrinologist puts you on testosterone therapy. Hey,\n\nIn all honesty I was actually pretty suprised I had these hormone levels, and I dont know if they have always been this low, that is the insecure part i feel. Like I mentioned, my libido was not always the highest, but I feel like it dropped more over the last year maybe two years. I used to workout alot, and saw pretty noticable progress. Which sounds weird to me with this low of a testosterone. I was around 16-17. I am 6'3, but my father is 6'5 and my mother is 6'. So a concern I have is that my testosterone may have been higher than it is today.\n\nI will take your tips with me in my appointment next week, thanks for the insights ;).\n\nMath", "AMA - Kallmann syndrome  I first did one of these three years ago, I thought I would do another one this weekend.\n\nThere have been a couple of other patients who have submitted AMA's.

I certainly do not watch it every day, but certainly at least once a week. \n\nWhen I was a teenager we did not have the internet. I do wonder sometimes how much different my life with KS would be now with the internet making accessing such images so easy. I remember seeing hard core porn pictures in a magazie for the first time when I was around 18. I can remember thinking to myself I look nothing like that guy and could never see myself being a \"normal\" male. It took me a long time to get more comfortable with my size and body image.  I cant speak to male experience but as a female with ks I  had to stop watching porn with women in it because I hated constantly noticing that their breasts were different than mine I can understand how that would be upsetting.  \n\n\nI think a lot of men like myself have the similar feeling when seeing the penis size and testicle size of people in porn.  \n\n\nFor both male and females with KS it can give a distorted view of what \"normal\" looks like.

It is a work in progress at the moment but I am hoping to bring together various sources of information, updating them where required, onto one website. ", "For those that have been medically diagnosed with Kallmans Syndrome, how did you go about getting diagnosed? I have been under the assumption that I have Kallmans Syndrome for awhile (1 or 2 months, I posted here about it but cannot remember the exact date). I have been putting off getting an appointment because currently I am only able to make an appointment for my medical centre by calling and I definitely do not have the confidence for that, I am a pretty anxious guy and phone calls with people I do not know turn me into a blubbering mess. So I am currently waiting to be able to book an appointment with the NHS app.  \n\n\nBut it got me thinking, how do you actually start the journey of getting diagnosed? When you booked an appointment, did you say that you think you had Kallmans Syndrome or did you say something else? I remember your post.\n\nI went to an urologist (wrong doctor for this) and he had no idea. I was send to the university clinic urology and they also had no idea. Made even an MRT (not of the brain ... duh).\n\nIn the end I took the blood results and put in a few hours myself to find out which condition might explain my symptoms. The not smelling part made it clear and I was immediately sure. Send an eMail with my assumption and doctor was sure I\u2018m right, too. He did send me to the endocrinology. There they knew what is going on and I was a (I think) common case.\n\nLater on visiting an other urologist and told my story. He was shocked that his colleagues were unable to diagnose this typical (beside Klinefelter) syndrome.\n\nSo I just went to the wrong doctor. If you visit an endocrinologist you should be fine. It is not that uncommon to have someone who needs testosterone treatment. In the end the 100% diagnosis is not that important because treatment for this type of condition is very similar.\n\nI would just go to an endocrinologist with testosterone issues. And in the dialogue you tell your symptoms and your suspicion. You could wait for his ideas first. You could also make a visit with Kallmann suspicion. In the end it is irrelevant- just start it.\n\nFor me the blood-values and the not smelling part was enough to get the diagnosis. We might do the genetic test but there is a lot of genetic variation for this syndrome and you might not get a clear yes no result (as far as I know). I was diagnosed at the age of 23 after spending years of being told I was just a \"late bloomer\"  \n\n\nMy diagnosis came through a piece of fortune. My first real job after leaving Uni was working in a haematology lab in a large hospital in London. At the time I was not even registered with a local doctor as I had basically given up with them. I obviously knew something was wrong. By this stage I had never seen an endocrinologist. \n\nI noticed there were four endocrinologists working at the hospital. One lunch time I walked up to one of their offices and talked to one of them. I gave him a brief summary, basically the lack of puberty.\n\nHe then asked \"Do you have a sense of smell ?\"\n\nHe was the first doctor ever I can remember asking me that question. I was so used to it I did not even mention it at appointments.\n\nFrom there, there was a brief examination, blood tests and it all went on from there.\n\nI got myself registered with my doctor so I could be referred to the endocrinologist officially and I have been with him ever since. That doctor, Dr Richard Quinton, just happened to be a specialist in reproductive disorders and is now a world leading expert in Kallmann syndrome. If can understand why you might be hesitant in making an appointment but it will be a first step to getting the diagnosis and treatment that will make your life better.\n\nUsing the NHS app might be the best way to make an appointment.\n\nThere are private test centres you can turn up and book blood tests. You may have to pay a fee but you can get a blood test to help start the diagnosis process without having to be examined or explain why you want a blood test. \n\nYou will need your testosterone level checked, plus the levels of FSH and LH. These can form the basis of a KS diagnosis along with the lack of sense of smell.   \n\n\nWhen you see the GP, explain the lack of puberty and the lack of sense of smell. You will need to see an endocrinologist in order to be diagnosed.  \n\n\nBefore the appointment, write down what you say to the doctor, it might help to refer to them if you get nervous before the injection. Make sure you mention the lack of sense of smell, you would be surprised how often people forget to mention it during appointments. I have not been diagnosed. I am in the process of finding out at the minute though.\n\nBack when I was 10 doctors realized I could not smell and told my parents Kallmann syndrome would be something to watch out for with puberty.\n\nThis did not happen, my parents did not follow through, but I always had the impression I had been tested. I found out this a few months ago and contacted my doctor. \n\nI was referred to some in network genetics people. Had to fill out family history and have a phone appointment. Then they asked for bloods. After the bloods get back they will arrange another appointment to discuss results Sorry to revive this, but I worded my question poorly so it was not answered\n\nWhen I ring up to organise an appointment, what should I say regarding why I want an appointment?

After spending the entirety of last night learning about Kallmans Syndrome, I have concluded that I most likely have it as I have nearly all the symptoms such as never having a sense of smell, having a cleft lip, high pitched voice, basically no facial or pubic hair and my Male private part is extremely underdeveloped.\n\nI am planning on making an appointment to find out if I actually have it or not - but does anyone know if the NHS covers treatment for it? \n\nI am not sure how much the treatment would cost normally, but as a 21 y/o student I doubt I could afford it. Would love to help, but I do not know the NHS.\n\nIn my country it was enough that a doctor saw the low hormone levels and the missing sense of smell to start treatment. You do not need a genetic diagnosis. Public insurance payed (nearly) everything over years without calling once or having a issue with it at all.\n\nThe testosterone costs around 140\u20ac for 3 month I think. I need to pay 10\u20ac myself (beside normal insurance costs). For the doctor visits I need nothing.\n\nHope you are covered. The symptoms look clear to me. Wish you the best! That is so insane no doctor picked that up! And you are 21!?  Wait for ndsmith on here to talk to you, he is from the UK I believe and knows what you are going through. I am from the UK and have been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for the past 7 years or so and it depends on what you mean by 'treatment'. If you mean the diagnostic process, then of course it is covered by the NHS - you will most likely go through a long process of tests and referrals, but it might be helpful that you have a suspicion of what your diagnosis might be as it might help them cut right down to the meat of everything. Mention that to your GP when you go for a visit. You will eventually be referred to an endocrinologist for case management. I do not know where you are based in the UK, but I would recommend the team at UCLH in London - I have been seeing them since I was 18. If you do go on HRT, like any prescription medication, you will have to pay for it unless you fall into the excepted groups (on Universal Credit - what used to be known as Jobseeker's, for example). Hope this helps. Me too - I originally thought that my lack of smell was because of the doctors messing up my Cleft Lip surgery when I was younger haha. This helps a lot!\n\nI live in Devon so UCLH probably would not be a viable option but thank you! I get a student loan every 3-4 months so I could probably use that to pay for the Treatment until I leave college and get a job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for the information! I checked the nhs guidlines and they decide treatment based on the testosterone level. The costs are not mentioned but in online stores it costs \u00a30.00 with nhs prescription.

Do not be afraid and talk to an endocrinologist. :)\n\n( Testosterone treatment for Kallmann syndrome is covered under the prescription exemption scheme in England. You do not have to pay for any of your testosterone medication.  \n\n\nYou will have to apply for a Medical Exemption Card, your GP signs the form and you get a card that exempts you from all prescription costs, not just Kallmann syndrome related. Ask your GP reception for form FP92A and fill out your details. \n\nWe are covered under the \"Diabetes Insipidius and Hypopituitary Conditions\".  \n\n\nKallmann syndrome is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism so falls under this category.

There is a good endocrinologist at Musgrove Park in Taunton who knows about Kallmann syndrome. No worries at all - and funny coincidence, I am quarantining in Devon as we speak. Good luck with everything! Yes of course covered by the NHS.

I have had to travel a bit to get to appointments but it has been worth it. It makes so much difference being able to see a doctor who knows about KS and treats other patients. It has also helped me keep up to date with information on the condition.   \n\n\nThere is more awareness of rare conditions these days I think and patients are becoming more informed as the internet helps in their research. You still get some doctors who do not like informed patients but hopefully these are becoming rarer. It should be a two way learning process.

I was reading a lot of the threads here and found comfort in the knowledge others have experienced similar experiences as me. I am hoping I find a bit of peace by writing this and maybe others can relate to it in some way. \n\nMy mother brought me to my doctor as a teenager as I seemed to have lumps in my chest. Fatty tissue which I later found out it was gynecomastia. The doctor checked for signs of puberty and I was sent for bone marrow tests. I am trying to recall back but my bone density levels was more a kin to a 12 year old and not the 16 year old I was. I was sent to an endocrinologist and after two meetings I was told due to a delayed puberty I would need to take injections to kick start puberty and that I would more than likely be infertile. I went back to school the day dejected. I had the mumps when I was 12. Maybe that is what caused the delayed puberty? My mother had thyroid problems during pregnancy. Maybe it was that? It was never set in stone. I do not remember doctors ever sticking to a reason. \n\nI remember starting college and looking like a 9 year old. I had put on a lot of weight too so I was in college looking like a fat 9 year old. I actually laugh and cringe when I look back at photos. Even though it was killing me on the inside, waiting to grow up, on the outside I put on a brave face. I had a good network of friends who were always supported of me but I remember feeling sick approaching bars or nightclubs. The bouncers just could not believe I was the legal age to drink. It used to give me anxiety. It probably gave me an unhealthy obsession with drink. \n\nI was taking Sustanon injections every three weeks but still was not feeling like I had fully finished puberty. I was not shaving yet. I struggled with intimacy as I did not want to take off my t-shirt in bed with girls. I had a girlfriend but I was so insecure which often led to us rowing. Id make excuses not to turn on the lights in bed. Or find excuses why I would not go swimming on holidays. After three years we broke up. It was semi mutual but it hit me hard. \n\nI went back to my endocrinologist and it was decided that I would have surgery to remove the gynecomastia. My health insurance covered it. I told my friends I was going for a routine operation and under the knife I went. That surgery was one of the best things to happen to me. It gave me confidence in my body and I felt a bit more 'normal'. I even went swimming. \n\nI kept my condition secret from everyone. My mother knew and some close friends. I always kept it a secret. I suppose I felt shame. I hated myself and felt sorry for myself at the same time. At least now I was shaving and had hair all over my body. At least that was something. However, I felt I had no in-between years or if that makes sense. I looked 16 for about 15 years then aged dramatically and quickly turned grey and my hair started to thin. I live with my current girlfriend with the last 4 years but unfortunately our relationship is on its last legs. I am taking anti depressant tablets with over a year and find myself repeating the same vicious cycle of drink and drugs binges to escape the present. \n\nI have it in my head that I want kids but not sure if I can have them. I went to a fertility expert who said I would need to come off Sustanon and then start a whole process which may take a year. I would love to just find out if I can produce sperm but I was advised to wait until I was actually trying as it will cost money and could take a year and no guarantee. My current girlfriend says she does not want kids right now or if at all. Maybe it is me she does not want to have kids with. I think I am going to go back to a fertility expert soon to explore my options. Im scared of starting again and trying to find someone new and explain my condition and potential fertility issues. In the blink of an eye I will be 40. I feel I have lost out on so many years being held hostage in my own body. A child wanting to grow up but now an adult who is obsessed with having kids. I realise I sound so melodramatic, ha. \n\nIm not sure what I wanted to get out of writing this. Maybe find some peace or new found motivation to get through 2021.

I do not actually have Kallmann syndrome myself, but a tumor on my pituitary gland that formed when I was about 14 led to a failure to fully develop. In 4 months I have noticed some changes such as the development of facial and some chest hair, deepening voice, prominence of my adam's apple, increase in penis size, and a much higher sex drive. I have been working out like crazy and am noticing some small gains in muscle mass and strength (not as much as I would like). \n\nMy sex drive in particular has gone through the roof. I masturbated my first time ever at age 27, about 3 weeks after starting TRT, and it has been a daily, or sometimes twice daily, activity since then. I am now at a point where I would actually like to be in a relationship and have sex, but I do not feel nearly developed enough right now for anyone around my age. \n\nAt what point in life did you begin TRT and what were the major changes you noticed? How did this affect your relationships and friendships? Were you able to connect with your peers in school, or did you never fit in with anyone? Hello! We already talked with each other in direct messages but I will share it here too.\n\nI am 16 years old. I have not started TRT yet but already went to an endocrinologist and had blood tests. I do not know the results yet but I probably get them in December.\n\nIn primary school, I had friends but it reduced my confidence that I was different althought I had some late bloomer classmates too. I also took too much attention on that I am very shy and I tried to be more extrovert instead of being there and enjoying primary school life. \nNow I am in highschool and I do not really enjoy it. Since I know what is wrong with myself I stress less about how different I am. Although that, I bet people talk less to me because they find me weird. Or idk to be honest, but I am sure highschool life would be much better without Kallmann syndrome. I have some peers to talk to but I spend the weekends in my house, alone.\nI think this condition makes me less interesting. Started in university around age 21-22. Did not fit in at all. I looked like a boy and missed the normal life there. I had a few people I could talk to and would learn with, but never did anything besides university related stuff. I tried to join a party once or twice but it was always really awkward.\n\nYour sex drive experience fits mine exactly. First time got a hard one after treatment start. No interest in girls before. And now with 31 still a virgin... the experience gap is hard to overcome. Wow, you sound just like me. I never went to university, but high school was certainly Hell for me. I was never able to make friends because I just could not relate to anybody. I had acquaintances with whom I would only discuss school-related topics. How long have you been on treatment, and what were some of the major changes you have experienced? Do you see positive changes for your future? I was diagnosed at 23 and started treatment soon after. I was seen as being a late developer until that point.\n\nI never achieved the totally normal development I had wanted but did feel a lot better while on treatment. I was over 30 however before I became confident enough for any physical relationships. I did not achieve the penile growth I wanted and it did take a while to gain confidence and be aware of my sexuality. My libido is high and I felt more confident as I got older. \n\nAt school and Uni I was seen as a bit of a loner and even know I am very content in my own company. I rarely feel totally relaxed in company apart from when I meet fellow KS friends. I hope it does not take me over 7 years to become confident enough for a physical relationship. I literally cannot focus on anything else right now. It is the only thing I want in life at the moment. It might be different for those with Kallmann syndrome, but having pubescence that is so delayed has a profound impact on one's life that people who developed normally just cannot understand. I assume we are both similar in that regard, despite having different conditions that led to our arrested development. I was far too late in starting. Looking back I had the chances to do stuff but automatically turned them down. It was only when I was older I realised just what I missed out on and should have been far more active when younger.\nEven with the development I had I could have made more of my younger years but I did ignore it for too long. That describes me to a T. I now feel like I completed wasted my adolescence and young adulthood. Having depression from such an early age caused me to not care about myself even though I knew that something was abnormal about me. It is easy to look back and say, \"if only I would have cared enough to get treatment when I was a lot younger, I would be in a much better place now.\" Unfortunately, this way of thinking only makes me feel worse about myself. Nearly 10 years now ... damn that is long. I\u2018m getting old.\n\nMajor changes - more or less all aspects. I think I look like a man now although I still have insecurities. Do not really know what others are thinking. I\u2018m quite large due to treatment most likely (1.98m). But slightly puffed breasts and perhaps a little wider hip are not that visible but I cannot forget them. And of course being more or less infertile and with small testicles I fear a more intimate relationship. Also nonphysical aspects changed. I had really issues to not cry when arguing with someone. With testosterone you take the confrontation and just make anger out of it. I\u2018m far from aggressive but it is great not to cry because of everything not going that well.\n\nThe no friends situation I compensated with staying closer to the family. I still live at home while finishing my phd. It is good to do not be lonely but it of course hinders you to get out and build up a own life. I think that late puberty let me skip the usual big confrontations with my parents. And not being a man at all I also stayed during university.\n\nIt is going to change. I\u2018ve got one year left for my phd and afterwards I\u2018ll finally leave. I ramped up sports to get a bit more attractive with mixed results but I\u2018m on the right way.\n\nThere are a few points which I bring up to keep it running like this currently - and the biggest is the fear of loneliness. I\u2018ll get this damn phd done and then I\u2018ll face it.\n\nWhat about you? Are you fine with your situation (besides the new desire for an intimate relationship)? Is the tumor still a risk? It is funny you talked about puffed breasts because I have severe gynecomastia and am having surgery at the end of next month to get them removed. As of right now, having large boobs is the biggest physical insecurity I have, so it will be nice to get that ameliorated. I also have severe issues with confrontation. At work one time, one of my co-workers got upset with me for some reason and became confrontational. I did not actually cry, but after it was over I had to go to the bathroom to compose myself because I was starting to tear up. This problem has led me to avoid almost all confrontation, much to my detriment. \n\nI am also still living at home, and like you, am about ready to move on my own for the first time. Living with a teenage sister who is, for all intents and purposes, living a normal adolescence, is harder to deal with than one can imagine. She has friends and a boyfriend. I will be honest, I am just too jealous to be around that constantly. Maybe the testosterone will eventually dampen my jealousy a bit, but I am still too emotionally immature in that regard right now. I am actually going to be looking at my first house tomorrow. I plan on being on my own by the end of this year or by early next year. \n\nCurrently, my goal is to try to put on some muscle so that I can start to look and feel like a full-grown man. I have been working out since I first began testosterone, but am not making the progress that I want. My dad commented the other day that my arms are starting to look bigger, and he is not the type to make a comment like that unless he really believes it, so maybe changes are happening. I think once I get my breasts taken care of and put on some muscle, I will be confident enough to at least consider dating. Life is a living hell right now though since I want a physical relationship, but I do not like who I am right now.\n\nAs far as the tumor goes, my prolactin levels are normal, but I will not know if it is shrunk until my next MRI. I have 2 endocrinologists who are both giving me conflicting opinions. One of them says since my prolactin levels are normal, the tumor has most certainly shrunk. The other doctor says that tumors that are my size usually will not shrink, and the best they can do is keep it from growing.\n\nIt sounds like things are going to turn around for you quite soon. I wish I had gone on to pursue post-secondary education. I was a 4.0 high school student, and I know I can succeed. Right now, I am working a dead-end retail job that I have had for 10 years now. I just do not really have any interests, and would not have the slightest idea what I would want to pursue. I went for 2 years to a community college a few years ago for computer programming, but I have not done anything with that, and do not really know if I want to. I was, more or less, using college as an excuse to cut my hours back at work. It is funny how similar our living situation is. My little sister is also still living with us. She is a bit older and has no boyfriend, though. Therefore we can stand each other most of the time. She got two sweet kittens in may. It is really too comfortable and friendly to live here...\n\nGreat for you to go on with your physical change. Wish you luck with your breast operation. I also thought about this, but they are too small to consider this right now. Maybe if I\u2018ve got defined muscles and it is very prominent I\u2018d risk it. But that is not in reach right now. I was running a lot this year but overstrained my knee a bit too much and stopped for a while. Quite happy with loosing 10kg this year. You should try to track your progress to stay motivated. Bicep circumference for example. I love tracking my runs and weight/muscle changes (when I\u2018m working on it xD).\n\nI can imagine having a tumor is a shit situation. On my long way for a diagnosis I had days where I thought I might have one myself- these days where not so fun. I hope you can handle it and live your life. Listen to the doctors and inform yourself but try to not let it dominate your life! Advice from an Internet stranger without own experience... I hope you\u2018ll manage. You sound like a nice guy. Would be a pity for your future girlfriend!\n\nThe level of education is not always that great. Sometimes you want to have a simpler job, too. Get rid of the chaos, stress and imposter/failing fear. But I hope it is worth it. In the end I like my work and it gives a certain financial security. Just not sure I\u2018ll finish my phd or I\u2018ll end up leaving university without one. Going on to study was the easy way for me. See the positive aspects of your job and try to do what you like.\n\nSomething with computers is great. I had a lot of fun in game development in my free time. Not the most compelling career path but there are so many possibilities. Currently I write fantasy in my free time. More or less just for me and it will tail off again. Maybe try to pick up a hobby that you could make a career in the long term. It will not be easy and risky but that is everything what is worthwhile to pursue. around 11 i was diagnosed started on trt around 12. i have a learning disability but there is no way you could tell unless i told you, i have never had trouble finding work (construction) . i have never really had any friends in my teens  had some in adult hood but did not stick around for long,  i guess i am a bit weird a little dark with a bit of a dry sense of humour. and never had a relationship  but been on a few dates here and there  from online dating. shit happen, cannot complain life goes on. How old are you now? 27 I am 40 and just now going through stage 4 of puberty.", "I have been diagnosed KS but I do not think that I have KS I am more or less just asking for what its like for anyone here who definitely has KS since I have too many problems with my diagnosis.\n\nI was diagnosed on the grounds of a weak sense of smell and low T (1.1nmol/L)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I remember clearly starting puberty, noticing girls and watching porn and all that. I put on muscle from 12-13 and still remember that happy feeling when I look down and notice I am stronger than I was a while ago. Right up until diagnosis I had sexual desire, just very small genitals. \n\nThen everything just died down at about 14yrs old. At this point I had severe stress problems, so severe and destructive I could write a book on my problems back then, and stress so unbelievably bad that I will not. \n\nAlso, I went off Testogel for a month during February to get an accurate blood test for something. By the forth week my testicles were noticeably bigger (still small), is this consistent with my diagnosis?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, is there anyone with KS out there who also started normally, but eventually waned and went to the Dr because of physical symptoms? Hello, I have Kallmann syndrome. I was diagnosed when I was 23, I am now 50.\n\nI would be happy to help with any questions you might have.  \n\n\nKallmann syndrome does have a broad spectrum of symptoms. Some people appear to start puberty and then suddenly stop, others never seem to start at all.  \n\n\nWe all have a low level of testosterone from our adrenal glands so even if you have Kallmann syndrome you often get a little bit of hair growth but not much. The fact your testicles grew when you were not on treatment might suggest that you do not have Kallmann syndrome and might be \"delayed\".  \n\n\nThere is a test an endocrinologist will do called the GnRH stimulation test, which would require a 12 hour stay at the hospital. This test can help to distinguish between Kallmann syndrome and delayed puberty.   \n\n\nIn severe Kallmann syndrome you would not get any testicle growth at all and they would stay small in size, normally less than 4ml. In milder forms of the condition you can get a little bit of testicle growth but they will not reach adult size and you might need to take testosterone gel or shots. GnRH Stim test sounds like a good idea, thank you\n\nWhat I know is that my testicles are far bigger than they were when I was diagnosed and started taking TRT, two years ago now. They were so small they could not be measured so I am certain I am not imagining things. I thought taking TRT or steroids would cause them to shrink\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn your comment about severe Kallmann Syndrome, do you mean its possible to have KS and see testicular growth? If so, then when I went back on TRT late February, would testicular pain for the days after going back on mean there was some function in the testes? I have asked the Endocrine doctor about this but have not gotten any information above \"oh that is interesting\" Yes, that is true. If you have Kallmann syndrome or CHH the testicles would stay the same size or even shrink while on TRT.\n\nThe fact they have grown in size might indicated the HPG axis, responsible for puberty and reproduction is still active.. The other possible test is the Kisspeptin test which is similar to the GnRH test, more accurate, but not widely known about yet. The GnRH test should be a good start. Some problems I have not been able to find info on are my hands, they were small all through secondary school still are to an extent. When I hold my hand out flat the thumb is level with my first finger's knuckle, making it hard to pick some things up. Would kallmann syndrome cause my hand and feet to be so small they make basic actions slight awkward? Or is this a sign of something else entirely being wrong?\n\nI am sorry if this sounds like nothing to do with KS, but for some reason I focus a lot on the small hands for some reason. I am not sure about the size of the hands, but what you describe there sounds identical to my own hands. There is a form of KS that does cause problems with the bones in the hand, normally it is a missing bone that makes one or two of the fingers shorter than they should be.\n\nDo you have any problems with your eyesight or hearing ?\n\nAlong with the GnRH stimulation test you could ask about genetic testing; especially the ANOS1 (KAL-1) gene, which is responsible for some forms of Kallmann syndrome.\n\nKallmann syndrome can come in a mild form or partial KS, where you get a sort of half way puberty with some testicle growth and a little sperm &amp; testosterone production, but not as much as would be expected as an adult. No missing bones in the hand (I think) just the bones that are there are shorter than I think they should be. The 1st finger and ring finger ratio thing is perfectly normal though, the ring finger being longer.\n\nHearing and eyesight are both perfect, but I have not had a genetics test, all I have had is Testosterone measurements which were used to diagnose, but my next visit to the Dr's was cancelled for now because of the lockdown. Thank you though The levels of the hormones LH, FSH and prolactin would be interesting to know at the next visit to your doctor.\n\nI hope you can get some answers.

I hope andrologist is the right word, if not I will edit this shortly.\nI hope this helps you.

Do not be afraid :-)\n\nWith a blood test you\u2018ll get a rough idea what it could be. No or little sense of smell is a good indication for Kallmann. Ask your regular doctor to send you to see an endocrinologist, preferably one that specialises in reproductive endocrinology.  \nAt 17 you are still of an age where puberty could start naturally at any time but it would be a good idea to get your hormone levels checked. It is possible that they can give you treatment to kick start normal puberty.\n\nIf you have no sense of smell, or problems with your hearing, make sure you mention this to your doctor as they can be linked to Kallmann syndrome.\n\nGyno, can be embarrassing at any age and is a sign of low testosterone.

I had another account but deleted it so most of my backstory is gone but I had posted the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism post on here recently.\n\nI had an incomplete puberty and almost 0 body hair besides pubic hair up until TRT (at 33) which has now given me a beard, chest hair, stomach hair, and under arm hair.  So, my receptors were there waiting for that sweet DHT, but I never produced enough.  I also have hyperhydrosis (maybe a hypothalamic issue?) \n\nI feel like a \"man\" finally and my body dysphoria is slowly going away.  Only literally been 5 months on TRT and I have lost 20+ pounds and had 2 girls who have known me forever ask me if I have been lifting and ask me on a date.\n\nI am super happy and internally horrified. At this age...I will come across as something being seriously wrong if I tell them the last time I had sex was when I lost my virginity to my girlfriend at 16.  Only had sex twice then she said she was leaving me for a \"real man\" so that just reinforced my body image of appearing like I was stuck in puberty my entire adult life.\n\nI have read Dr. Dwyer's papers on Psychosocial/psychosexual issues related to KS and nIHH and it is good to know others went through the same thing.

I know it can be done but it can be harder for us to find than others. That Is why i originally got off TRT at 26, didnt start back until 33.

Nothing to lose everything to gain!   \n\nFrustrated and angry was how I felt at 26 it took that long to finally find something as easy as Testosterone to \"fix\" everything.

So i saw that both of these hormones are used to teat hypogonadotropic hypogonadism but what are the diffrences, are they both used in people with HH or kallman syndrome at the same time, do they stimulate diffrent things or what is the deal ?\nAny info would be much appreciated GnRH - gonadotropin releasing hormone is the hormone that is normally produced by the hypothalamus within the brain. It is the non production or incorrect production of this hormone that is the root cause of Kallmann syndrome / HH.  \n\n\nGnRH stimulates the production of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH, from the pituitary gland. It is these two hormones that control puberty and fertility.  \n\n\nSo in Kallmann syndrome No GnRH means no LH / FSH which in turns means no puberty or fertility.  \n\n\nOne treatment method is to give GnRH, which would allow for natural production of LH and FSH from the pituitary. This can be a very effective treatment and can stimulate puberty and fertility. However it is not an easy treatment to take and requires wearing a pump virtually all day (a bit like some diabetics). Not many places offer GnRH therapy for KS / HH, the one exception being China where it is a very common treatment.   \n\n\nhCG is human chorionic gonadotropin, which is normally only found in females. It does exactly the same job as the the LH that should be produced by the pituitary gland. hCG injections can be given two or three times a week as part of fertility treatments or on its own to produce natural testosterone. It is a widely accepted form of treatment, it can be expensive, but it is also can be very effective.   \n\n\nIf GnRH therapy was available it would always be the best option, but hCG therapy can work just as well, just a bit slower.", "No puberty and NOT a late bloomer - Kallmann syndrome.

I understand that there are many conditions that are a lot worse than what I am going through and I keep telling myself that but when I do this I feel like I brush the problem away and never really face it for what it is. here are a few things I was hoping to get some recommendations on  \n\nany recommendations on working out I am taking testosterone gel but it is very hard for me to build muscle. \n\nI find myself having really bad intrusive thoughts I was wondering if anybody else experienced?\n\nalso women how did you guys work up the confidence to actually have sex this is something I have struggled with for almost my whole life at this point I am just about to try it and see what happens and find out how she reacts. \n\nLastly with no growth in Testicles there seems to be a mental block that I cant get past I find myself always coming back to my condition if anything is not going well in my life or if I am feeling lonely \n\nnot sure if anyone will read this but if you experienced any of the problems and want to help me out I would appreciate it. I can relate to almost all you have written as would most KS men I think.\n\nOne thing to remember is that you are not alone with this condition. Sometimes it can feel very isolating. We have people in our support groups who are happy just to know that they are liars if the group and that there are others out there.\n\nI have spoken to a good number of KS men about their first sexual experiences. It might seem daunting at first but If you are with the right partner it will go a lot better than you expect. Experience and technique will trump size every time. With a couple of notable exceptions the majority of KS men I have spoken to have wished they started earlier and said they should not have been so nervous.\n\nSize and lack of testicle size might be something that is difficult to  ignore totally but once you can prove you can enjoy sex and make your partner happy it will not be your major concern anymore. If you take hCG treatment rather than the gel you can produce your own natural testosterone. This can both give you a more steady level which can help when trying to build muscle.\n\nIf you stick on gel make sure your level is high enough. You might have to ask to increase the dose in order to be able to build muscle as long as you stay within normal range. Thanks for your reply I appreciate the support and input on the matter I will have to do more research on ach\n\n but I have an appointment coming up this month I will let my doctor know and see if I can get an increase in my prescription thank you", "Restarting hCG therapy again for natural testosterone production in Kallmann syndrome. I am looking forward to starting hCG treatment again.   \n\n\nPregnyl is not available in the UK any more so I have to use Ovitrelle. The syringe pen makes injecting a lot easier. The pen is 6,000 IU which is too high for me, so I inject 1/4 of the pen twice a week.   \n\n\nI seem to prefer having the natural testosterone production you get with using hCG rather than using the testosterone gel or injection. \n\n Cool. Always wondered how this treatment would look like. Thought you need a hormone pump or something like this.\n\nWhere do you inject this? I would hesitate to do it myself but it might just need time to get used to. It is a syringe pen that I inject into my waist. It is very easy to use, a very small, thin needle.\n\nThis is actually a pen designed for female fertility use but it can be used by males as well. Some younger KS men are prescribed a whole pen, twice a week. \n\nIt is only for testosterone production. I will not get any testicular growth or sperm production by using hCG on its own.\n\nThere is pump that can be used in Kallmann fertility treatment but it is very rarely used these days but can be very effective. After reading your post I did some further reading myself. I mixed it up with different treatments. It is more or less replacing LH hormone. So FSH for sperm production is still missing. (Might confuse LH for FSH - not sure)\n\nThanks a lot for sharing this. I was not aware of this. It might be great to get rid of the intramuscular injections which of course come with a certain risk. Yes, that is correct. \n\nThey can not make luteinisng hormone, LH (the hormone that produces testosterone) so they have to use the \"female\" hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) which has the same activity as LH. \n\nThere are some men with milder forms of Kallmann syndrome that can achieve sperm production just by using LH but most of us would have to take some form of FSH to achieve sperm production. I am in the UK, is this something I can ask my endo for? Instead of using gels? Yes, you can ask your endocrinologist to prescribe it for you. Once your endo agrees, you can get the repeat prescriptions from your local GP.\n\nSome GP's may not be used to prescribing hCG for male use but it is acceptable treatment for male KS patients. You can get Gonasi which is 1,500 IU per vial or the 6,000 IU Ovitrelle injection pen. Your endo will be able to tell you what dose to take. Cool, I will be seeing my endo in January I am 25 and have been gels for the past 4 years, I hope he allows it. Hope so. If he has experience in treating KS patients he should.\n\nI think I prefer having the natural testosterone production. Far better than using the gel. Yeah I think if he says no to that, then I will try injections which I assume will be nebido. Nebido is good. Would be my second choice behind hCG. Hello! I am 16 and planning to start the treatment. I would choose the gel for the therapy. I would like to ask some questions. \n\nFirstly, do you have full or mild KS (mild - you had some pubic hair even before the treatment \n\nfull - you did not even have pubic hair before the treatment)\n\nWhen did you see the very first changes?\n\nWhen did your facial hair start to grow?\n\nDid you/ Do you have mood swings after taking the gel? How long does it last, what is it like?\n\nDo you do exercises like weightlifting? If yes, is it hard to build muscle?\n\nWeird questions:\n\nHow big is your penis now? (Is it averange or below averange)\n\nWhen did your penis started to grow? How long did you need to take the gels for the development of your genital??\n\n\nI know there are a lots of weird questions but you help a lot by answering them! Hey, started my treatment around 17/18 on Sustanon.\n\n\n&gt;Firstly, do you have full or mild KS (mild - you had some pubic hair even before the treatment\n\nfull - you did not even have pubic hair before the treatment)\n\n\nWas not aware there was a mild KS but I had little armpit hair and pubic hair which apparently according to my endo is due to my kidney or livers.\n\n&gt;When did you see the very first changes?\n\n\nQuite rapidly, first changes from what I can remember were growth in penis and my voice deepening\n\n&gt;When did your facial hair start to grow?\n\n\nI did not really see much facial hair until I went on the gels 4 years ago and its only in the past year that I have had a full beard.\n\n&gt;Did you/ Do you have mood swings after taking the gel? How long does it last, what is it like?\n\nI havn't really noticed that.\n\n&gt;How big is your penis now? (Is it averange or below averange)\n\nI suppose its average to slighty above average. Just over six inches in length, I think my girth is below average but I havn't measured.\n\n&gt;When did your penis started to grow? How long did you need to take the gels for the development of your genital??\n\nPenis growth was one of the very first changes. I think I reached my current length in the first couple of months? &gt; Do you do exercises like weightlifting? If yes, is it hard to build muscle?\n\nYes, its one of my main hobbies. I would strongly recommend that you pick it up. Its been hard to build muscle and I have made OK progress but I am not sure if its due to hormones or due to poor diet/sleep/training.

I am a 22 year old woman and I got diagnosed with Kallmann\u2019s yesterday!! \n\nI have struggles the past 6 years to find out what is wrong with me and why I am so far behind other women my age physically so I am very happy about the diagnosis, especially as I am already on a HRT treatment plan (have been since March). \n\nNow my treatment plan is taking course over the next 2 years also, but I have a few questions for the women out there that also have this condition. \n\n1. Once treatment started how long did it take for you to get periods? \n2. Once treatment started, when did the physical changes begin? (For example, boobs. I really want to know cause it is my biggest insecurity) \n3. Do you have any issues with sexual activity/dryness? \n\nAnything will help me as I am clueless!!! \n\nThank you! So sadly I cannot give you any advice (male perspective only), but congratulations for a diagnosis! For a lot of us it was hard to get to this point. With knowing what going on it can go forward! Hi there! I am a 25 year old women and in the process of getting diagnosed with Kallmann's. I have anosmia in addition to the standard symptoms so I feel pretty confident in receiving the diagnosis (I have done a lot of tests and blood work over the last two years to rule out the majority of any other possible issues). I submitted my saliva for genetic testing and will hear back in 5 weeks, so I might check back in with you then. I actually started my period/other aspects of puberty on time, but then I did not have a period for around 10 years. I am currently taking birth control with estradiol (previous blood work showed I had essentially pre-puberty levels of estradiol) and I actually got my first period today since junior high! I can keep you updated on any other physical changes. My period brought on a lot of breast tenderness so we shall see! To answer your final question, yes I have had a lot of issues with vaginal dryness. Hopefully that will fade as my hormone levels stabilize. Please please keep me updated!!! Congratulations on your discovery! There is a kallmann syndrome support group on facebook for women that will be very helpful for you. I was diagnosed about a month ago as well. But I am 35 years old. Female. I have never had a period. Zero breast/nipple growth, so completely flat chested. It was a mystery since I was a teenager. I have been untreated this whole time as well and have been suffering with various physical issues since teenage and early adult years which I now believe were a result of such low estrogen levels. Certain ones getting worse over time. I have a bone density scan in a couple days to see if I have osteoporosis or anything. I started on a 0.1mg bioidentical estrogen patch, 2 and 1/2 weeks ago. I change the patch out for a new one once a week (every Friday). Went through a lot of physical adjustment to the estrogen, it is mellowed out though but still getting side effects. I will be starting on progesterone at some point possibly soon, still looking through data to decide when, what form, and how much to take.\n\nMy gynocologist said not to get my hopes up about my breasts growing at all because I am 35 years old and not a teenager anymore but he said he honestly does not know and anyway he has practically no experience treating this condition.. but I will tell you what, I know that I can, I do not know how big but I know they will grow to some extent. Annnd what do yah know, I am having noticable growth so far :) My nipples have gotten larger, particularly the tips. That was surprising to me lol. The growth is not much yet but it is enough to where my breasts are not completely flat on my chest anymore and actually poof/poke out, mostly the nipples but I can also see that the sides of the breast are slightly protruding out now. I am stoked! My breasts have been tender and at times very sensitive and have to be careful not to hit or brush against them cuz it hurts like a mofo. Oh also note that I am around 114lbs. 5'8\" tall. So to be underweight and be getting some noticeable growth when it has not even been 1 month yet, has been surprising.\n\nI have have issues with vaginal dryness since late teenager/early adult. I did not realize how dry it was as that is always how I would known it to be but sex was almost always painful and I always needed lube. Since I have been on this patch, have not had any problems with lubrication and it is been amazing!\n\nThere is more good stuff to share but it is late and I need to sleep so I will have to add more later :) Definitely check out the facebook groups if you have not yet and welcome to this new journey! Congrats! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a", "Hey there. I am 21 and was diagnosed with Kallmanns at around the age of 16. It is been a struggle, knowing that I do not look my age and people\u2019s reactions has been a real confidence knock. \n\nI do not know anyone else who has this, it is made me feel pretty alone at times. But seeing this sub has made me feel less alone and has reassured me that I am not going through this alone. \n\nSo, thanks. Hello, welcome.\n\nAlways good to hear from fellow KS friends. Always happy to talk or answer questions. Exactly the same here. I am 20 and was diagnosed last year.  Also nice to know that I am not the only one going trough this. \n\nForums and others experiences really help. i wish i could be told i look younger i have been on T since my early teens, i am in my mid 20's now and i get told i am about 10 years older than what i am. enjoy it well you are because T will do it to you. You are right, getting cheaper tickets for younger people at cinemas and museums has been a perk. totally. it could also be from drinking alcohol too I got diagnosed at 18 (36 now) and it sucks. It did suck, it still sucks, and it always will suck. But one thing I wish I knew back then, was that is it is always going to be a bigger deal to you than it is to other people. This kind of sucks too because it is hard to find empathy for something that was really distressing to me when nobody else thinks it is a big deal.\n\nWhen I graduated high school I was a chubby 5'3 kid with boobs that often got mistaken for 14 year old girl. Once I started hrt though things changed quickly for the better. It sucks having to play catch up. I did not have pubic hair until I was almost twenty or ejaculate until about the same time. But I had so many friends and my life was so much better than high school and I was my own harshest critic.\n\nNow I am 5'9, not chubby and can grow a full beard. I still have more breast tissue than I would like, but they are not boobs and I have more or less come to terms with it. But even in those good years after starting hrt I was still so self conscious and did not go for awesome opportunities because I was ashamed of myself. Nobody I have ever told has thought it was a big deal or thought less of me for it. I am the only one that does that. Go out there and be bold, seize every opportunity!
