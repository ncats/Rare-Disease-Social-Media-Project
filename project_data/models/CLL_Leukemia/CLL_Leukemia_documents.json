Has anyone heard of/experienced a Moderna vaccine reaction of platelet counts dropping? I am the same due to my prostate problem I have to blood tests regularly.  Never had a problem with low platelets before.  All of sudden since the AZ jab my levels have dropped right down - below 100.   This is not a coincidence in my opinion.  I have to wait another 30 days to be retested.   My doctor has told me nothing about this! I am sorry to hear you are experiencing the same issue. My Dad's Drs did not know anything about that possible reaction either. Since nothing but the vaccine had occurred, it must have been a reaction to the jab. \nHowever, I am happy to share this remedy info with you: My Dad's Dr ordered a series of 4 Rituximab infusions -- one per week for 4 weeks. After only ONE infusion, his platelet count jumped from (original #) 58 to a normal level of 158 and it continued to rise with each treatment. After a few months, the response to the infusion held on with only a slight decrease in number drop. Since there has been a decrease, Dr has ordered an infusion 1x every 3 months. This would be valuable info for anyone who is experiencing the same effect from the vaccine. If you do not already do so, sign up for the CLL Society e-newletter.

What is JINXING capsule, is it anti-aging and relieve fatigue? Today, we are bearking the mysterious ingredients of JINXING capsule.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJINXING capsule ingredients\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirstly, I think JINXING capsule must has special ingredients and complex composition. After reading the product introduction, which is a low-key and simple ingredient. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJINXING capsule ingredient is ginsenoside Rh2 and starch, one capsule is 125mg, ginsenoside rh2 content is 20.25mg per capsule, content percent is 16.2% or more. It is in the line with best absorption content of ginsenoside Rh2.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDoing a research of ginsenoside Rh2 in Chinese market, JINXING capsule is a Unilateral product only, others are compound products. Except ginsenoside Rh2, compound products contains other ingredients or other ginsenosides. Whatever of unilateral products and compound products, they have its own merits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRegardless of the dosage form(injections, capsules, powders and others), JINXING capsule is A single measurable ingredients, function is determined and full play the effect of ginsenoside Rh2. There is no intestinal load which caused by ingredients during absorption, thereby affecting absorption effect.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nGinsenoside Rh2 compound product contains other ingredient except ginsenoside Rh2, which is no rigorously verified, Absorption and utilization rate will be low, the effect of adjuvant therapy remains to be seen.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat is function of ginsenoside Rh2\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJINXING capsule mysterious ingredients is ginsenoside Rh2, which efficacy is reflect by ginsenoside Rh2. What is function of ginsenoside Rh2? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1.Enhance immunity\nMany people know the side effect of low immunity. Ginsenoside Rh2 can enhance immunity is by enhancing immune cell activity, such as the killing activity of Lymphocytes, T cells, macrophages and others, enhance the monitoring of the immune system to prevent the invasion of harmful substances and bacteria. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2.Relieve fatigue\nFatigue is due to the accumulation of human lactic acid and other metabolites, which leads to muscle tension and exercise durability decreased. At the same time, due to the accumulation of carbon dioxide and stimulate the nerve center, which leads to sleepy, yawning, sluggish and other performance. Ginsenoside Rh2 has relieve fatigue function is by increasing the body's glycogen reserves, reducing the consumption of glycogen, reducing serum urea levels after exercise and inhibitting the increase in blood lactate levels after exercise. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3.Anti-tumor\nThe reason of ginsenoside Rh2 caused by scholars attention is anti-tumor effect. Many literature and experiments have prove it. But now, there is no ginsenoside Rh2 products for medicine use.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4.Other effects\nGinsenoside Rh2 also has health care functions, such as antibacterial, improve cardiovascular and cerebrovascular insufficiency, regulate the central nervous system, enhance memory, anti-aging and so on. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nJINXING capsule mysterious ingredient is ginsenoside Rh2. Just look at it, ginsenoside Rh2 is indeed a good thing and a modern Chinese medicine molecular medicine, which is a small molecule structure and should be able to play the above effects. At the same time hope that the friends who take this JINXING capsule can have good effect and longevity. \n\n\n

But most clinical trials do not reflect that reality; thus, treatments and prognoses are based on younger patients\u2019 experiences. Researchers from University of Pennsylvania, Emory University in Georgia, NorthShore University HealthSystem in Illinois, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, Thomas Jefferson University in Pennsylvania, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Massachusetts, conducted the largest comprehensive prospective evaluation of this patient population published to date to their knowledge to examine treatment patterns, outcomes, and disease-related mortality in CLL patients aged  \u2265 75 years in a real-world setting.\n\nRelated: The Link Between Low-Density Lipoproteins and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n\nMD-IQ QUIZ: Cardiometabolic mortality &amp; diet among US patients\nDrug &amp; Dosing Information\nThe researchers analyzed data from patients in the Connect\u00ae CLL registry, a prospective observational cohort study that took place between 2010 and 2014 at 199 U.S. sites. Of 1,494 patients enrolled in the registry, 259 patients aged  \u2265 75 years were enrolled within 2 months of starting first- line of therapy (LOT1), and 196 were enrolled in a subsequent line of therapy (LOT \u2265 2). The patients were almost entirely enrolled prior to the introduction of novel B-cell receptor-targeted therapies. The researchers say they aimed to establish a benchmark for outcomes in elderly patients with CLL who were treated before those therapies to help properly position newer agents in the treatment paradigm.\n\nThey found that elderly patients with CLL were more likely than were younger patients to receive rituximab monotherapy. In LOT \u2265 2 they were significantly less likely to receive bendamustine/rituximab. Only 6.9% of patients aged &gt; 75 years received fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab, vs 33.7% of patients aged &lt; 75 years. Interestingly, the researchers add, older patients were significantly more likely than were younger patients to receive chemotherapy alone without anti-CD20 antibody therapy.\n\nRelated: Novel Treatment Shows Promise for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\n\nSerious adverse events were more common in the elderly patients. Pneumonia was more common in elderly patients in LOT1; in LOT \u2265 2, rates of pneumonia were similar in both groups. In the follow-up with a median of 32.6 months, 433 of the 1,494 patients had died. Only 5% of patients aged &lt; 75 years in LOT1 died of CLL, compared with 13% of elderly patients. Time to death from CLL or infection was also significantly shorter in patients aged &gt; 75 years, compared with patients aged &lt; 75 years. When stratified by risk, mortality due to CLL or infection was 10.3% in the lower risk group compared with 30.6% in the higher risk group.\n\nThe researchers identified 3 prognostic indicators: &lt; 3 months from diagnosis to first treatment, enrollment therapy other than bendamustine/rituximab, and anemia. The researchers say the higher risk of CLL- or infection-related death has not, to their knowledge, been reported previously. This finding, they say, \u201chighlights the urgent need for therapies tailored to this population.\u201d Current therapies and strategies, they note, \u201cappear suboptimal.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pneumatic Tube-Induced Reverse Pseudohyperkalemia in a Patient With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n\nSource:\nNabhan C, Mato A, Flowers CR, et al.
