["I dont talk anymore,...... Like i used to do ooooooo ", "I developed Bell\u2019s palsy palsy 18 minutes after receiving the pfizer vaccine. Doctor claims this was not vaccine related and to get the second dose. So I recently was hired at a new job. They require me to get vaccinated or show proof of exemption. Mind you I have been totally against the vaccine and have refused to get it but I have been without work for fourth months. So even though I felt sick and nervous and something bad was going to happen I chose to get my shot yesterday 8/9/21. \n\n10 minutes after my shot in my left arm I started to feel dizzy. The lady seemed concerned and told me to wait another 15 but I said I will be fine and walked out. 9 minutes later the left side of my mouth started to droop to the left and my tongue fell to the left side of my mouth. I called the advice nurse and became confused, not being able to tell her basic information about myself. \n\nI stuttered, slurred my words, and felt literally intoxicated. She said get somewhere safe and wait three minutes she needs to talk her doctor. Answers the phone again panicked and says call 911 we think you are having a stroke. \n\nI call 911 and the ambulance shows up I tell them I just got my vaccine. They tell me I am not having a stroke and says I am just having a panic attack. They told me the hospital will not be able to do anything for me and to go back in my house , lay down, and watch a movie. \n\nI decided to drive myself to the ER. I told the doctor I was happy, healthy, and fine before getting my shot. He performed multiple tests and diagnosed me with Bell\u2019s palsy. At that point I could no longer blink my left eye, and I am biting the left side of my tongue because it is falling to the side, and I cannot smile correctly. \n\nHe claims this was not from the shot and says it is just a coincidence even tells me to go ahead and get the second dose in a few weeks. I now have to take six prednisone pills twice a day, and five viral pills twice a day which causes insomnia and weight gain and a shit ton of other things. I do not feel like myself, I am stuttering, confused, cannot find the words.\n\nI am traumatized and I will do whatever I have to do to warn others of this. How ironic I get the shot on my left side and my Bell\u2019s palsy is on the left side. I will never get the second dose.\n\nEdit: link to my Walgreens receipt, vaccine card, and Bells palsy diagnosis. 8/9/21 \n( ( I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy around the 3rd week from my first Pfizer shot. I received the shot on my left arm and about 2.5 weeks later I had severe left shoulder pain, neck pain and pain behind my left ear. I was rushed to the ER and they told me I have Bell\u2019s Palsy. They said it is not Covid vaccine related, they said it is more like pregnancy related (I was 27 weeks pregnant) mixed with very high anxiety, excessive stress, lack of sleep and low immunity. I am on my 4th week now with good improvement. Taking meds on time, relaxing and acupuncture helped me a lot.  I am sorry that this happened! I hope the condition resolves itself. I read that it usually does.\n\nOthers have also had the same thing happen after this shot.\n\n\nI did not exactly get Bell's palsy after my Pfizer vaccine dose, but I did get like a tiny version of it. Within five minutes of taking the shot, the left corner of my mouth began to tingle and went numb. It stayed numb for about 5 days, then suddenly thawed out. (I also took the shot in the left arm.) \n\nAt the same time as the facial symptoms were going on, I had a super rapid heartbeat that lasted for 10 minutes. I have not taken the second shot. However, I may have to for work. I am considering taking the J&amp;J vaccine. I am so sorry you experienced this as well! This was my first dose. I am on six pills a day of prednisone and 1 anti viral pill five times a day :( I have gained movement in my mouth but it is not completely straight and my left eye is still weaker! Was your Bell\u2019s palsy also on your left side?? I am so sorry Yes, on the left side. I empathize with you, bells palsy sucks. \n\nI used to have bells palsy on my right side and 11 years later(1.5 months ago) I had a reoccurrence on my left side but it was 2 months later (also the side I got my vaccine). I think I read somewhere that you typically will not get bells palsy twice unless it is within the first two years.  My theory is that the covid shot mimics a viral infection  - this bells palsy doctor I talked to said I probably had a virus that was dormant in my body and the stress triggered the bells palsy. \n\nNot a lot of people talk about synkinesis (and I did not know about it until this year) and it is a thing. My right side has a lot of involuntary movement since I did not know how to take care of it when I was 14. \n\nI actually just had a 1:1 session with meghana davis an hour ago (under ( on Youtube) and she knows a lot about bells palsy and synkinesis. She is super affordable (like $22 USD) and was really helpful. I did not get a lot of help from Western doctors and she teaches massages and exercises based on your current situation).  I linked a video to the one I was watching\n\nAcupuncture also helped me a ton! If you are looking for one, I would recommend asking the acupuncturist if they have specifically worked on people with Bells Palsy. I am seeing tiny movements and it is definitely a slower process, but the quicker you start the better. It also just feels relaxing\n\nBest of luck to you and your healing journey (and anyone else that is also healing) Look into treatments involving a chiropractor and acupuncture. Steroids and antivirals help, but pursuing other treatments is a good idea. I am 4 years into Bell\u2019s and I am about 85% recovered. I should have pursued other treatments, but the doctor assured me I would be OK in a month or two. both Pfizer and Moderna have amended their information to list Bell's Palsy as a rare side effect of the vaccine. \n\nI got a reoccurrence of Bell's after the vaccine, about 5 days. Go to another doctor who will take you a bit more seriously. The doctors will not often say it is a direct cause, but there is a correlation, so it is likely.\n\nCall Pfizer's side effect line and report your situation. It is important for them to know. They will ask to talk to your doctor to access medical reports.\n\nDoctors have recommended I do not get the second vaccine until I am completely healed, and Pfizer said that was good advice (they will not give direct medical advice). \n\nDo not take the next vaccine until you have more info from another doctor, especially since the reaction was immediate. Sorry they have been so dismissive. Same thing happened to me except my first time was on the left side and reoccured on the right side. I had my first bout 11 years ago, and I also have synkinesis. \n\nHas the person you worked with been able to help people who have had synkinesis for a decade? I am going to watch her videos! Thanks for the recommendation.\n\nI agree with you about the dormant virus activation. That is what my nurse friend thinks too. I received my shots of Pfizer on Dec 23rd and January 14th and then about 5 months later I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy on my Left side. It was mild and I recovered after about 3 weeks. I did not have much drooping, but my eye watered and my smile on the left side was not there.\n\nYou ever get that feeling that doctors are told to simply brush off any connection to the vaccine? Like if they dont keep track of how many get Bells Palsy after the vaccine then how can they say scientifically there is any connection? Like a dont ask dont tell if you want to keep your license to practice. I am sorry you did not get the immediate support you needed. Steroids for 5days is the standard treatment. I am about 10ish days into mine and have noticed improvement but that first week was rough. Get allll the rest you can. \nDo not be scared of the steroids. I have had to take them for months for another issue and it is only in that longer term that you have to worry about it is side effects. Just the insomnia is the short term stuff so take pills in the morning. \nLike others have said it is because of the viral effect/load and an already probably stressed/compromised body has resulted in bells. You have done the right thing in getting the vax. Bells is not permanent, hang into that, as scary and distressing as it is right now. The shock and lack of care you received is traumatic, I feel for you. I had bells palsy also on my left side. I was vaccinated but it was not until more then a month after I had been diagnosed. I recovered quickly from my paralysis and had full movement on the left side with in 2 weeks of the start of symptoms. Both doses of the vaccine went well. I had some slight soreness in my left arm which is the one I had the injection as well as some fatigue. Is not Bell\u2019s Palsy as a side effect less common than in the general population? Sorry that happened to you\n\nEdit: the first thing you did was post to NoNewNormal. Yikes Where does Pfizer and moderna list bp as a side effect?   \n Do u have a link to Pfizer or moderna saying that bp is a possible side effect? That globeandmail site gives no sources This is a Health Canada amendment (that is our equivalent of the FDA)\n\n(\n\nThe Globe and Mail is one of our main national newspapers, fyi, so they are considered a legit news source. I will add that I am very much pro vax and do not think people should avoid the vaccine because they are scared of BP. But like all vaccines, there are some people who experience side effects. That is just life. I just consider myself unlucky. I have had Bell's before. Some medical professionals think that the vaccine can cause a dormant virus to re emerge. Not quite sure yet about the exact mechanism.\n\nOf course, the vaccine is 99.9999% safe. I will get the second dose when I recover from this bout of BP Glad I did not get the vax.   At least if I get Bells Palsy again the mods might let me post about it. You had a stroke.  Bells palsy takes longer than a few minutes to happen and you do not start getting better in less than 5 days.", "Doctors are now seeing that there is connection between Bell's Palsy and Covid-19  The second time I got Bells (pre-covid), it was preceded by a pretty bad respiratory illness, though tests came back negative for influenza.  The doctor seemed to think that it is likely my immune system was dealing with that sickness, which allowed the latent virus or whatever inflame my facial nerve. \n\nI wonder if it is just people getting really sick and the immune system not able to cope with two infections or something? I have been wondering about this since I got my diagnosis but could not find anything on it. I was not tested for COVID and had no other COVID symptoms, but now I am wondering. It would not surprise me.  I was COVID negative, but Influenza B positive...  Almost to month #4, and 0% improvement. Been digging up journal studies myself. I was at the end of quarantine after close contact with someone who tested positive when my Bell's popped up. I had four negative tests and one positive that no one could explain. Seemed like a possible explanation. I was covid positive early this year. Been suffering from Bells Palsy the past month.. going to look further into this.. This is my first time suffering from Bell Palsy. Symptom began September 22nd. I did test positive for Co-Vid around August 9th. I am not fully recovered from the paralysis, but I would say I am about 90% recovered. I woke up literally yesterday nov 28 to the feeling my face went to the dentist for a cavity.  I have not gone to a doctor because my insurance does not kick in til dec 1st which is tomorrow.  \n\nBut right now reading the symptoms of bells palsy being due to a virus kind of freaking me out. I get cold sores from herpes 1. And apparently there is a correlation of that with bells palsy.  I was diagnosed pre diabetic couple years ago and again there is a correlation with that and bells palsy. And now I am reading bells palsy could be a symptom of covid-19 ?  \n\nI do not have breathing problems, do not cough, no fever, not under stress that I can think of. Just one day my left side of my face went to sleep and now I am wearing an eye patch because I cannot blink anymore on my left side.  Stupid human bodies. The redeeming thing is it is supposed to be a temporary situation. It can reoccur, though. I experienced an episode when I was 18. Now, many years later, it happened again. \nI am taking supplements and vitamins ---B- Complex, CBD and a daily multiple vitamin. \nMy doctor was miffed because aside from this happening,  I am perfectly healthy and young. \nPlease consider acupunture. It may speed your recovery by awakening those nerves. Many doctors give free consultations.\nI visit chapel frequently and you are on my radar. Blessings, dear friend. the over the counter antolovirals I use daily are essentially vitamin D, zinc, monolaurin, and lysine. I used to have palsy but not anymore. In attempt to stave off a second bells palsy event I have done this, and would not ya know, for the last 4 years I have not gotten a cold, a flu, etc.... hopefully these protect me from infections so I never get viral induced palsy again I tested positive for Covid in November 10th. As soon as I was recovering I noticed my right eye start to twitch. Fast forward to this weekend where I noticed my right ear starting to ache and half of my tongue feeling numb. I woke up with Bells Palsy today. I am convinced it was due to the Covid virus. Any kind of virus can cause your facial nerve to swell up. This is my 4th time with BP only this time the right side is affected. \ud83d\ude31 I am sorry this has happened to you.\nHave you ever tried acupunture to speed recovery? I am seriously considering it this go round! I have heard that it helps with the recovery. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "On the plus side it is like having half a face of Botox  Told myself the same thing! Good luck with your recovery, it looks like you have a pretty mild case  Thanks. It is on the mend. 5 months later back to about 80%, only my bottom lip has not has some significant improvement. ", "It is starting, for the second time I had bell's palsy 2 years ago. Never recovered completely, let us say 90% and here it goes again. I had the pain radiating from my hear since a few days. Today my left side got numb, difficulty to speak, my smile is uneven and now my eye does not close properly.\n\nI right away got prednisolone and auro valacyclovir prescribed. \n\nLast time I had medication when my left side was fully paralyzed for at least 12 hours. I take pictures every hour to document the progression and I wish that taking the medication earlier will stop the progression. Best of luck Thank you At the end of the day, I cannot whistle or keep air while puffing my cheeks. It is getting harder to close my left eye without closing both eyes. Hi, symptoms peaks 2-3 days in and you will start getting better maybe after a week. In the mean time you can read my other comments for reference. \nIt is my first time getting it and I am on the 19th day since onset. First two weeks were slow and almost no progress but the previous days were amazing. I can laugh normally while showing my teeth now. Be sure to relax and comparing results every hour does not really sound very effective. You may just stress yourself even further. \n\nGood luck and I wish you will recover 100% this time! Thanks for your advices. You are right, comparing results every hour is not a great way to relax, I will try to take it easy for the next few days.\n\nI am glad I woke up today with still some control of my left side, it seems my face did not completely collapse this time and I still can control my eyelid a bit.\n\nI will gladly read your contribution to this sub. Good recovery!", "Pain after healing? Hello all,  \nI was diagnosed with bell's palsy a few months ago, and now i have gained motion back in my face, probably 98%. I still notice some weakness in my movements. However I also have a lot of pain in my jaw and left side of my face. I did not have this pain beforehand so I think it may be released to BP. Has anyone else experienced anything like this after recovery? Yepp! A few months after i was 'healed' and now it happens from time to time only. Also my face hurts if I force myself to smile for pictures and I can only hold it for like 10 seconds or so before it starts to get uncomfortable. Yes, my muscles are still sore on the affected side. I only really feel it when I massage them, but I definitely notice a difference between that and my non-affected side. I have noticed pain too when I smile for pictures/etc. too! I am glad I am not the only one :( Really hoping it eventually gets better soon, for the both of us. Thank you for sharing with me. I have been coming off my work accommodations so I have been speaking a lot more which might also be causing more pain, since i am moving my face more. My left side is so horribly sore after work especially. Thank you for sharing with me as well. it is been 8 years since i last got bell\u2019s palsy and it is really weird because the OPPOSITE side where i got bell\u2019s palsy is starting to hurt.. does this mean anything or? it is been 8 years since i last got bell\u2019s palsy and it is really weird because the OPPOSITE side where i got bell\u2019s palsy is starting to hurt.. does this mean anything or?", "First round with Bells Palsy Hey all, was diagnosed with BP on Thursday and just have a few questions. I can hardly move anything at all on my left side of face, looks like people here refer to it as 10-20%. I have resorted to only eating soups and such right now that do not require much chewing and taking my meds ( prednisone and valtrex) and luckily I already take daily vitamins which contain B12 which I have seen many people suggest. But these are the few questions I have so far: Today my right side of face feels weak. I am thinking maybe because its having to do more work with my left being pretty well unusable? Talking with my fiance and looking in the mirror everything is still working but just kind of worried. Another thing I have noticed is I am having a lot of pain behind my left eye, more like a tension headache or something. It was bad enough last night I just gave up taped my eye shut and went to bed so I did not have to deal with it. If those headaches are common, how are you guys dealing with them? ASorry for wall of text phone does not work well with formatting. Wed will be my 2 week since diagnosis and everything is starting to fade. My mouth is still kind of dumb but that is it. I also had pain behind my eye and I feel like it was because of the inability to squint in the sun and it was causing migraines. My eye was by far the worst part of the whole experience. I suggest an eye patch and eye lubrication. Esp when you sleep. I wish you luck and hopefully everything straightens out soon. The eye patch sounded good and I have one but the pressure from the band around my head makes the headaches more pronounced. Looking into getting one with no strap, but is a pain as I wear glasses to see anything. Good to hear you had a seemingly quick turn around! I have had palsy for awhile and as various muscles started coming back, I realized that certain muscles were so tight that they were causing headache-like sensations. At that point I was already able to stretch those muscles and lose the headache... but being at the point you are at, maybe just rest and applying some warmth to your face will help soothe some of the muscle tension. I have tried freezer packs wrapped in towels and that did not do very much so will go the other route and give the heating pad a go, thanks for the advice! Yeah I was wearing sunglasses when I drive to stop the sun but then I couldnt blink my eye when i needed. I would definitely avoid cold for sure, even now, just a little bit of cold causes my face to tighten up significantly so I am super careful to make sure it is protected on cold and/or windy days. \n\nI really hope that it is a quick and full recovery for you :) I was diagnosed on 5/4. I was on the same rx as you, but was also prescribed naproxen .  That helped A LOT with ear and eye pain.\n\nI also have been seeing an acupuncturist and am back about 85%.  I highly recommend it. And start sooner rather than later. \n\nMy face was completely useless on the left side and very swollen most of the time.  But it is much much better now.  Not sure if you are experiencing swollen face as well.\n\nAlso, an anti inflammatory diet has helped.", "My experience I was diagnosed with bells parsley about 1 1/2-2 weeks ago. Currently my face is somewhat completely back to normal (somewhat meaning when I drink water my lips do not fully close so water sometimes squirts out). The first day I actually realized I could not move my face I panicked A LOT. The next day my dad made me go to the Urgent care thinking I had a stroke or something. Turns out I had Bell\u2019s palsy on the left side of my face. They gave me steroid medication, antiviral pills, artificial tears, and this ointment thingy for my eyes. The 2 weeks on the medication was suppose to speed up the healing process, but by the time I was done with the medication my face was back to normal. I thought my face would actually stay paralyzed for months but thankfully it healed quickly. I believe this is because I am a younger patient, typically younger people have faster recover times/ they are nerves heals faster? I am not sure if any of this is actuate but I hope this helps someone.", "Had bell palsy for almost 3 years Sadly given up hope on ever getting my smile back, hate this damn thing, ruined my life completely. Do not wish this on anyone, my life been getting worst every damn day because of this crap, do not know how I did not kill myself yet.\n\nIs there any surgery to fix this and would it be covered with your health insurance ?", "I was not expecting so much pain. How do uou deal? I am just shy of 2 weeks from my first symptoms. In all the research I have done it only mentions some pain in passing as a sentence or two. Most sources say the pain passes within a few days. Mine continues to get worse and I cannot concentrate on my job or get more than 45 mins of sleep in one go. I have noticed I have 4 different types of pain\n\n1. Sharp pain in the back of my neck that comes and goes.\n2. Ear pain that comes and goes as if someone is digging a knuckle into it. This is the worst.\n3. Tenderness in the jaw and neck.\n4. Pressure in the front of my cheek.\n\nWhat is your story with BP pain? How did you manage it? Acupuncture really helped for the pain, and seem to help with progress (a tiny bit) as well. I had horrible pain around the same time. It is awful. I am so sorry you are dealing with this.\n\nAfter the fact, I heard that gabapentin is helpful for that kind of pain.\n\nAcupuncture is also supposed to be helpful, but I was in too much pain to even consider making an appointment.\n\nHope it subsides soon! When did your pain start to subside? I will look into booking an appointment  Thanks If you are off steroids ibuprofen helped me a lot. Was taking tje max dosage. Plus hot compresses on the affected side. I could not sleep because of tje pain. So I made sure to take some right before bed Taking max doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Worried about hot compresses due to how sensitive my jaw and neck seem to be I use Gentle KT Tape cut down to strips of whatever size fits. You can look up on Google how to apply it for BP. There is no one way to use it, so I suggest trying a few to see what works for you. Be sure to use \u201cgentle\u201d KT Tape as it does not have as strong adhesive as the regular kind. I also use this under my eye to help with blinking.\n\nRepeat / Constant BP for over 20 years I am coming up on three weeks and the ear, neck, and jaw pain are varied from 2/10 to 7/10. The ear pain comes in waves, but the other two are constant, as well as a headache. I am not able to wear my glasses because of the amount of pain they cause behind my ears. Heat has helped, and I am using ibuprofen and acetaminophen.\n\nThe blurred vision has improved and I have regained some function - I can do a closed smile and look symmetrical, and I can show my teeth and be about 80% normal. Still cannot puff out my cheeks and winking is not very good yet, and still have loss of taste.\n\nI am lucky I am able to work from home and at my own pace. My bosses have been very supportive and understanding an I am very grateful for that. It was really bad for about two weeks. I had to use pain killers and cannabis, but the pain still broke through. wrapping my face helped a little. Prednisone worked for me. When the pain kept up after the script ran out I asked the doctor for another. The second round did it. No more pain. I have a heated stuffed animal, Advil, and CBD balm. That is helped a lot. I had bad pain too. I had to ask for a second course of steroids as pain relief, which helped. Once I finished those I was ok. Gabapentin I did not scroll though the comments before I posted but Gabapentin was a LIFE SAVER. I could not sleep for over a week before I started taking it and it was an almost immediate difference. Prednisone for the first week or so, followed by gabapentin. Also, get a gua sha massage stone and follow youtube videos for facial message. That helped my pain tremendously combined with the meds.", "Diagnosed Monday, this sucks. Just found this group. Thought it would be helpful to join and speak with other people about going this. Left side paralysis cannot move anything on my face. I have been given from what I can tell is the typical medicine regimen.\n\nPrednisone and Valacyclovir and trying to keep moisture in my left eye. Also started taking B12 vitamins as I have read that can sometimes help. \n\nI guess me question is, has anyone else here dealt with pretty intense pain when trying to sleep at night and laying on the affected side? It radiates from my ear out into my jaw.  Ugh, yes.  The pain was awful.  I tried ice and heat... neither worked, unfortunately.  Wish I had a resolution for you.  The pain was the first thing to go away once I started (strong enough) meds though! Yeah it is been pretty painful for me! The entire affected side of my face (left also for me) feels like one big bruise so if I apply pressure anywhere it hurts. I will say this peaked between week one and two and is a bit less painful now, but still tender. I am about 2.5 weeks in and no improvement so far. I was also on prednisone and some antiviral drugs the name of which I cannot recall but have finished both. Now I just wait and see. Yes - the pain sucks.  It is like you were punched in the face a few times.  Try CBDs, also I noticed the pain went away with basic over the counter pain receivers like IB Profin (sp).\n\nAlso, that pain still exists for me nearly 2 years later.  I have about 90% control of my face back... but my face still hurts at times and definitely when pressure is applied.  It is not nearly as bad as it was initially though. I have actually had it 5 times and yes, every time. \n\nI was recently diagnosed in December. CBD is the only thing that helps me. It is nerve pain, so traditional pain relievers just are not effected. \n\nReach out anytime for questions and support.  Yep it sucks. But the pain goes away pretty quickly in comparisons to the rest of the symptoms. Hang in there, and ask any questions that will help you get through it.  I have some tenderness to the touch, but not a lot of noticeable pain when I lie down to sleep. Usually, because of facial and eye fatigue, I fall asleep earlier and quicker than I did pre-Bell's Palsy, and I stay asleep better. I hope you figure the pain part out!\n\nI also tried CBD oil and had Valtrex and Prednisone like you. Nothing has made any difference. This does, indeed, suck. Hope we all get better quickly. yes...painful for me too. and mine segued into an ear ache at the same time.  not fun. hang in there. it will get better. For me the jaw and eye area pain peaked around two-three weeks after diagnosis. It got better once I started getting some movement back. I am 7 weeks post diagnosis now and at about 90% recovered, pain has been gone for a few weeks. It gets better! Hang in there! When people asked if it felt like after being frozen at the dentist that is what I would tell them- nope, it feels like I was punched in the face. A lot. I was diagnosed on Jan 24th.\n It is now Feb 10th and  I am 85 percent recovered. I think the worst part is that first two weeks when you do not see much progress.  Makes you feel like you will never look the same again.  Give it some time,  take care of yourself.  Eat lots of healthy foods and drink plenty of water.  I took vitamin B6 and 12 also took magnesium and CBD oil. Everyday I used a CBD bath bomb and lightly massaged my face/neck. I did a scalp massage with peppermint oil and placed a heating pad on the effected side.  \n", "Bell's Palsy cases after Covid Vaccine I have not taken the vaccine yet since i am being cautious about the bell's palsy side effect. I have had bell's palsy in a mild form three years ago and I am wondering about the recurrence rates from the vaccines.\n\nHas anyone had bell's palsy in the past and had a recurrence from the vaccine? Could you also mention which vaccine did you take? Diagnosed in March of 2019.  Got Pfizer vaccine, both doses, in March/April 2021.  No noticeable change in my BP. Follow. I am in the same boat. had bells in 2011. 75% recovered. and I have delayed my vaccine. I actually just booked my first jab for later in the week. but think I might cancel \ud83d\ude2c\n\nI read some studies have said there is a slight link to the vaccine. \nand I do understand the benefits of the vaccine. \n\nbut for someone that hasnt fully recovered I feel it a harder decision to make!", "Bell\u2019s palsy I had Bell\u2019s palsy since 6th grade and now I am in 9th I want to ask my mom to take me to the doctors and in 7th grade do not know if it has anything to do with it but my right leg gave out 3 times and the right side of my face my eye lips and face are lower than my left Do some facial exercises you can find them on the Internet I tried a lot and it did not work but I do not think facial exercises would help your eyes being uneven or really your whole face cause I did facial exercises for 3 weeks and had no results so I quit You really only have the first two months once you get bells palsy to take the steroids and do the facial exercises to get the best results. After that whatever state your face is in it is pretty much like that. I got Bell\u2019s palsy my freshman year and it only returned to about 85% normal. It is what it is I still had a normal life and got with hot chicks. Your personality will carry you through  Yea true true live up the high school life while you can lamo I use to talk to a lot of people know I only talk to like 6", "8 weeks in, no improvement Hey everyone, I wanted to ask how long after being diagnosed with bell\u2019s palsy did you regain signs of movement? I am currently at my 8th week and I have not regained any movement at all. Been trying to keep a good morale about it, but after such a long time with no improvement i think it is doing some damage to my mental health. Took me 3+ months to even start to see any improvement. I noticed I could move a tiny bit of my mouth and forehead on that side a couple weeks ago, and it seems to be getting better little by little each day. I would say its 30-40%ish now, I think it was July that it happened. Hi, I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy on November 9th, just 2 weeks ago. I went to the ER the same day it started, so I got medication quick. I was prescribed with a 50mg of steroids for 5 days plus antibiotics 7 days worth. \n\nI started acupuncture on the 11th and have been going every 3 days (4 times so far). I hit my peak when I went full on paralyzed right after I finished my steroids (5th day) and had no movement whatsoever. \n\nI had my 2nd acupuncture on the 6th day and by the next day, I had noticed more movement on my paralyzed side. \n\nI can say it is been exactly 2 week and I am about 70% recovered. I still feel tense on my mouth, blinking is still slower on one side; but other than that, I can smile again, talk better and flare my nostrils and eyebrows better. \n\nI really believe acupuncture helped me recover faster. I also started to vitamin b12 (1000mg) \n\n\nI really hope you consider this &amp; see improvement. Best of luck to you \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd I am 4 months in and starting to regain movement. I really thought one day I would wake up and start to smile normally. It is such a long process. \n\nThere are days I forget I have it and then there are days I am depressed about it. But it does get better. \n\nMake sure you rest ALOT, and do nice things for yourself. Acceptance of how long recovery takes is really important too.", "I think it is back I think the bell's palsy is back, except on the right side of my face, it is not as bad as the last time i got it, but its still concerning, is it going away on its own? You should try and get steroids again. I have had it twice as well Alright ill try, its a bit hard to aquire that rn tbh, can my bell's palsy still go away despite of that? Did you get vaccinated recently? Like within the last 5-6 weeks? Maybe? Idk from what I heard it definitely increases your chances of healing better and faster. \n\nI am sure people have healed without it but I am not a doctor. \n\nThe comment below explained well the role of prednisone in the healing process. \n\n No i didnt, why? I think they asked because you are not allowed to get vaccinated while you are on steroids (if you would be needing it) I asked because I also am recovering from Bell's palsy and I am afraid to get it again and there are people who are getting it within a few weeks of getting the vaccine. I am trying to find out about other people's experiences so I can make a decision for my own specific case. I just seen my neurologist for the Bell Palsy I had which thankfully was mild and is gone. \n\nHe mentioned also that it could be from a viral infection. I have also read from others that they do the steroids, but also take a anti viral medication as well.\n\nWith that i would say to go see your doctor and have them verify it.", "Some words of encouragement: 3 weeks into Bell's Palsy Persist with your treatment! It is exactly 3 weeks since I was diagnosed with Bell's and I recognize how lucky I am that I managed to get diagnosed on the day it came on. \n\nIt is been a roller coaster of emotions from relief that it was not a stroke, depression and fear that I would not improve (especially on days 3 - 10), hope whenever I felt a tingling or twitching feeling on my affected side, to determination to get better. \n\nI had some improvement after day 10 but at 2 weeks in, felt that my improvements were minor (~30%). Happily, as of yesterday, my smile is somewhat back to normal-ish (~85%) and I can actually feel less weakness in the muscles on my affected side. My jaw does feel achy, and when I massage the inside of my lips and cheek, my cheek feels thicker than the other side. \n\nThings I have done: steroids, anti-viral (30 days), acupuncture with Chinese herbs and gua sha, Vitamins B12 (sublingual and shots), C, D, zinc, anti-inflammation supplements, lysine, an anti-inflammation diet and switching to 60% plant-based and taking more fish, jade roller for daily face massages, abstaining from alcohol, applying an anti-inflammation cream and OTC arthritis cream and CBD balm on my affected side, face exercises from YouTube, vocalizing vowels to exercise my lips/mouth as it was the slowest to improve, chewing gum on my affected side and forcing myself to chew on the affected side more, taking a lot of time off work to reduce my stress levels, getting ample sleep and water, massaging the inside of my lips and cheek, using a lot more sheet masks and gel eye masks just because they were cooling and smelled great when my affected side felt swollen and achy from days 5-7. \n\nSo hang in there, it might see frustrating as time progresses and the improvements are slow but the improvements do come!", "After 6 months it is what it is? Yesterday I just hit the 6 month mark since onset and I have been sitting at about 80% recovery for about 5 months. Nothing has changed in a long time and I fear that recovery has ended and the damage is permanent. \n\nI was told by a neurologist that my case was very mild, and I saw dramatic improvement early on, however I have completely stagnated since then, and have now missed a major milestone with no improvement. \n\nI keep reading BP lasts up to 6 months for most people, but I cannot find any info on what to do after then. What is my outlook from here on? \n\nThanks Everyone is recovery is completely individual. There is no answer on when your nerves will calm down and if there is permanent damage. I am 15 months out now, and did not start improvement until I was 6 months in. I would say I am around 90% now and do not foresee any further improvement from here. My eye and upper lip are still wonkey. My eye closes when I pucker my lips. I also have muted sound and sensitivity in my ear. My jaw is also weak, but overall it is much better than it was. I am about 18 months in and I am still slowly recovering below my eyebrow...above my eyebrow is totally dead. I did not start recovering at all for about 4 months so everyone is time frame is different. It is been 20 years since my onset of BP. I started to get movement back after 3 months and got to about 70% recovery within a year. Only had very little improvement since, other than calming the synkinesis a bit. I am three years in and did not see much change til about six months. I am about 70% and am still seeing recovery in approximately 3 month gaps. Lots of rest and keep trying new things to enhance recovery.", "I was diagnosed today. Idk why I am posting in here, I am kind of bummed out. I lost taste a few days ago on exactly 1/2 my tongue and now everything tastes like soapy. Half of my head and my left ear is screaming in pain... I feel like I look stupid when I smile, and simple things like closing my eye is next to impossible. I joined the Facebook support groups but there are SO many posts of people who have had it for years or who have not gotten better I am scared to go look again. My husband is being super encouraging and optimistic, but it is just scary I guess. The dr has me on a steroid and an anti-viral. I was a prime candidate for it apparently since I had a face injury last summer, suffer from sciatica, ear ringing, cold sores, and I just got over a sinus infection/upper respiratory infection. \nDo not know really what else to say, it is awkward telling people I know who I know I will be supportive/would want to know what is going on in my life but it is weird telling them without feeling like you just expect pity. \nAny advice would be great, I feel really shitty since it happened 3 days before my birthday.  I am so sorry you are going through this. It really is terrible. The best advice I can give you is to rest as much as possible and take care of your eye. Chances are good that you will recover completely within a few months, so try not to worry- stress never helps.  Thank you, I really just want to taste things again. Eating yogurt feels like I am eating refrigerated hand cream... I can handle looking like a derp... I always have. Lol I agree 100%! You need to give yourself grace and time to allow your nerve to heal. It takes time. And find eye drops/lubricant that works for you. There are a lot out there :)  And wear dark glasses when/if it is sunny! Squinting is so hard. And everybody is different. 85% of people w BP recovery quickly and without any lasting effects. (I am part of the 15%. Who knows why?! My onset happened when I was being induced with my first child. Was not able to take any of the meds most people take, maybe that would have made the difference in my recovery?) But know that regardless there is a community here to support you/answer questions/or listen to your challenges. It is a crummy condition. :( Self care and rest is essential to recovery! I am 3 months in. \nThe pain stops. You get used to looking a bit funky. For me recovery started after 2 months and while I am still wonky I at least have expression in my face. \nRest. Rest. Rest. Let your body start recovering.  \nIt is crappy and it is hard but you can handle it.  \nI got angry, upset and frustrated. \nI do not even think about it now.  I have got 70% back in my forehead, about 25% back in my mouth my eye is improving as well. All of that in the last month so I am hoping that in 2 more months I will be back close to normal. ", "Experienced symptoms 3 weeks after first Pfizer shot, then got second shot before being diagnosed by ER doctor. Scared of what else will happen. Need advice. I noticed the symptoms almost 2 weeks ago. I cannot purse my lips without it looking odd &amp; feeling uncomfortable. My left eyebrow and lid and have drooped. Left side of my mouth goes off to the side. It is not very noticeable (unless I furrow my brows) but it is definitely there and not my usual face. \n\nIve yet to be prescribed antibiotics or steroids. Even though I got the second shot, is there still time to prevent that from making it worse? Will taking medicine now, help? How has b12 and CBD helped you if you have tried it? I really cannot for the life of me have my eyebrows match. I am worried my mouth will become obvious etc. I have diagnosed body dysmorphia and I have cried a lot about this. I am worried. \n\nI just really need some hope and advice right now. It is a waiting game and I am impatient. :/ Symptoms should not get worse after 3 days in most cases. Make sure you get on the steroids as soon as possible to help with the recovery process. I never took b12 nor cbd when I had my little episode, though people swear by it. Never used eye patches or did much facial exercises. Just take it easy and start taking care of yourself. \n\nIt took me 3 weeks to recover, some take a longer time. It can be a bit of a shock but you will be okay.\n\nEdit: my case was not vaccine related. Shit sort of just happened, as shit usually does. It sounds like a mild case from the way you describe it.  I would not be worried too much.  If your unable to completely close your eye and it is getting dry then use a gel drop and tape it closed or use a patch - particularly at night.\n\nWithin a couple of weeks I am sure you will start to see more movement gradually return.  Do the facial exercises and I also used acupuncture.  \n\nI know it is scary and it was such a hit to my vanity, but odds are you will be fine. Mine hit me 1 day before my 2nd shot. Still went and got it. I went on Prednisone a few days later. I started taking B12 (inflammation) and acetaminophen (pain) after going off of the Prednisone after 9 days. About 2 weeks after getting BP, I started feeling tingling and slowly everything has been returning to normal and the pain has mostly gone away. My eye is still a little jacked up but I am far better now than I was when it started. I attribute it to the B12 and massive amounts of sleep. I got BP after second Pfizer vaccine. Went to dr. And got steroid pack and am back to normal. Do you think I will go back to normal after almost 2 weeks? Did you get medications? Did they give you face exercises and tell you to massage your face? Nope... they did not. I am going to urgent care today and hoping they do something Yeah get a steroid pack. The exercise they gave me was to pretend to blow up a balloon, so make your cheeks puffy. What does that exercise? I am worried they will not believe me and give me nothing. They gave me paperwork and Bells palsy was not even on it What were your symptoms? It exercises cheek muscles..  I did PT after my attack, they had me do things like furrow my brows, smile, frown, close my eyes, open my eyes, flare my nostrils, pout, stick out my tongue.   For all of these I was supposed to use my hand to move the side that was paralyzed. How are you now? I have recovered.  My attack was not vaccine related-  I got it back in early January.  By early March I was nearly fully recovered.  Now I would say I am back to normal.  Maybe 1 side of my forehead furrows a bit more, or maybe it was always slightly asymmetric.  In any case its close enough for me not to care. The usual? \n\nWoke up on a Monday, took a shower, and went for a smoke on the patio. I noticed that I could not pucker up and that everytime I took a drag from my cigarette I was making farty noises with my lips. There was also a slight pulsing pain behind my ear, on the bone.\n\nI figured this would pass and that I, perhaps, got bit by an insect during the night. (I live in Australia) a few hours late my eye started getting irritated and i noticed that blinking was an issue. I then realised that my whole left side of the face was immobile.\n\nFigured I might have had a stroke or something so I made an appointment with a GP for the next day. He put me on steroids and I gradually started regaining movement after about 1-2 weeks. Sorry I just know that everyone is symptoms are different. I hope to gain movement back too. I just got the steroids from the doc! Possibly. When I was freaking out about having it, I did my own research and noticed I was having the same issues as everyone else, though the severity was different.\n\nThe steroids will help. It was all that I needed, and perhaps a change in lifestyle. I quit smoking soon after i was diagnosed. Did you get on three 20mg of prednisone a day? I feel like that is really excessive.... I got prescribed that for 7 days. That is 60mg a day. I get worried for health risks. What was your dosage? 60 for 5 days , then 40 for 2, after 20 for 2, and finally half a pill for 2days.\n\n60mg for 5 days is the official guideline that most doctors will follow. Girl get some B12. I wish i took it earlier so my recovery would be quicker. All the best Did the drooping side of your face ever ache? Like when you smiled? I am experiencing that currently and now my smile is uneven... Yes. It hurt when I tried to smile or wink. I would have to use a lot of effort and it would ache. I would wait until you have some good movement before straining yourself. Took a few weeks but I can smile (90%) wink (75%) and drink without dribbling on myself (95%).\n\nMy smile is uneven too. It is not noticeable and I do not really smile much anyways. How long has this healing process been for you so far? I was just given 60mg/day of prednisone for 7 days, but no antibiotics. I am also taking b12... This is my 4th week. I am doing much better than the first 2 weeks. My face is so much better but I am still dealing with a bit of ear pain and some headaches. I am at about 80% for blinking and 90% for smiling and drinking liquid. But those are getting better and better every day. Hi - if you still cannot keep eye lid closed - put eye gel in at night and tape your eye closed - white or clear medical tape (over thin tissue or cotton strip so tape only sticks at two ends) works. You need to keep dust out and moisture in. Scotch tape will work in a pinch. Plan on doing this until you can consistently keep your eye closed tight at night. It will prevent the eye from drying out. An eye patch during the day is essential. Also -  Gently stimulate the muscles in your face and behind your ear with your fingertips - frequently throughout the day. You need to wake up the nerves originating behind your ear that fan out across your face on whatever side has BP. Today, it might hurt to put soft touch behind your ear but as time progresses you will want to daily have someone - a professional or friend or family - reinvigorate the nerves in your face with touch, massage and acupuncture. Identify the places on your head where nerves exit bone plates and gently tap, with clean fingers, along the route of the nerve. After a few weeks (Do not do this too early) you will want to have mirror time to watch your face move and imagine it move where it cannot and should. You can get muscle tone back if you are patient and diligent and spend months (depending on case severity) doing daily mirror facial movements - again wait a few weeks on facial exercise - but do massage now... Hey so I stopped taking the 60mg/day after the 5th day.... and now I am worried that I am having withdrawal symptoms. Is that even possible? I was not even advised to taper off... i started having horrible upper body/neck aches and have not been able to sleep at all. I feel wired. Have you experienced that with prednisone before? I never had any issues nor did I feel any different during or after taking the steroid. I was advised to reduce my daily intake, gradually. I also got my Pfizer shot a week ago, BP started two days ago.\n\nI am sorry you are going through this. I had it a decade ago, and it is scary, but it does get better. I got both doses of pfizer in March and got BP a week ago. I caught it pretty early (like first 24 hrs) and started steroids and anti virals. I am having excruciating pain all across the paralyzed section of my face though, which does not seem to be a common side effect for others. Thinking I may have had Ramsey Hunt Syndrome instead but without the rash. What were your first symptoms because I got my shot a week ago and the right side of my face is tense and I am wondering if I am going to get it Did you have a previous history Of BP? Nope never, first time ever.", "Healing surprisingly well. Should I be worried? Contracted and diagnosed on the 12th of January and now on the 3rd of February I am feeling much better. Still cannot wink or fully grin on the affected side but not having trouble with my P\u2019s and B\u2019s anymore (Jerk move from the person who named it Bells Palsy BTW. Is this some sort of \u201cbetter before it gets worse\u201d or am I extremely lucky? \n I work in a refinery so obviously lack of proper eyelid control is a huge hazard and I do not want to tell them I am okay to go back to work if it is the first scenario.", "Swimming 5 weeks after Bell\u2019s Diagnosis? I was diagnosed on May 6th and took all prescribed meds and I would say I am about 98% healed, just a few residual effects like eye twitching and reduced muscle strength on affected side. I was all in my head saying to myself that swimming in a cool pool would not be good just because I would say I am still in recovery.\n\nAny thoughts on this topic? Would it be ok to go swimming? Going through a small heat wave and my pool just looks so refreshing. I mean... nothing in the pool will effect you. BP is caused by head/neck trauma or a virus in your nervous system. Swimming is just fine. You can even go under water if you would like! Swimming should be fine. I would wear googles or do not put your head under water if your eye does not close all the way. I went to the beach one week after my diagnosis. I had complete paralysis and my eye did not close all the way. I wore an eye patch at the beach and goggles in the pool.\n\nThe lifeguard asked me what is wrong with my face. Just like that. I brushed it off as maybe she thought I was having a medical emergency. That was the only unpleasant part. \n\nSwimming in a pool was heavenly. \n\nEnjoy! If your eye is closing without an eyepatch then you should be fine! If you are still having eye issues the sand at the beach could fly in and scratch your cornea. But a pool should be good, use goggles to protect your eye Thanks everyone for all your input! Took that plunge and went swimming and it was great \ud83d\ude0a", "One week in I started having this head/neck ache on the left side of my head. Decided to schedule a visit to the immediate clinic after work the day after I lost control of the left side of my face. The lady directed me to the er because she said that the headaches could mean something else and that they would probably get me a cat scan or whatever to rule out anything else.\n\nThe weird thing is I had the quickest er experience of my life, even the lady at the front was shocked and said \u201cyou may have set a record\u201d. They did not even register me in the system, so I had to do it there at the front desk. After I checked in and they got my blood pressure and what not they led me back to a room where the doctor saw me. He listened to what I said about the headaches and not being able to control my face. He felt around my head and asked me to move my face squeeze his hand etc. I feel like it barely took a minute and he said it is Bell\u2019s palsy.  \n\nI was like okay that is what immediate clinic girl told me. He said it was a textbook case and then told me around how long it could take to recover and how much it could or could not recover. And that is it\nHe talked about the antiviral and steroid he was going to prescribe me and that is it. He briefly mentioned some other ways people try and solve it and that is it. Some girl came in gave me my prescription and said I could go. \n\nI am freaking myself out by looking online and now I am curious. It is only a week in and i get headaches every day varying in intensity. Not to mention the one I have right now is pretty bad. Not only that but it feels like someone had just got done punching the crap out of the left side of my face. I am scheduling an appointment with my doctor soon to talk about it more to see if I can do anything about the pain and terrible headaches I am having . Anyone else experience this or anything similar?\n\n They would have been checking was not a stroke.  3 months in myself. The head aches stop soon.  I am about 60% recovered, every week I get improvement but that did not start until 4-5 weeks in. \nRest up if you can. \nI got angry and frustrated and still are not overly happy about meeting new people as my face is not necessarily making the impression that I am hoping, my friendly smile is more a grimace but have movement in my top lip so that is improving. \nHang on in there, it is not a fun ride but you will get through it.  Thank you the reassurance helps a lot. I am lucky that enough that my eye movement is not too stilted so I can almost close my eye all the way with a little effort. I am trying to get as much rest as I can but it is a little hard being in school but I am trying\nHave you done anything other than take the prescriptions?  My eye has been the most annoying bit do you are lucky and I reckon that will get back to normal quickly. I just took the medication and I have done a little bit of massage on myself.

", "Face feels stiff Hi guys! \nI was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy in (2019) November. I am about 95% back to my own self but recently I noticed the affected side feel stiff. At first I thought it was coming back for round two but it is been a week and I have not noticed any difference in my simile like when I was diagnosed. Has anyone experienced this? Could you explain what you mean by \"stiff\"? Like, is the skin taut? Yes, taut. I have to put more effort in moving it. I have felt the same symptom off and on.\nI had two bouts of BP six months apart last year. I am about two months past the last bout.\nThe facial stiffness started about a month ago. \nThe first symptom of both bouts was feeling like I had burned the middle of my tongue. When the facial stiffness started I also felt like my tongue had been burned. I felt like the BP was starting again. But I am happy to report that did not happen. I still feel the stiffness on one side of my face and the feeling like I burned the middle of my tongue but no other BP-like symptoms. Thank goodness!\nI hope you continue to improve and feel more like yourself. Thank you for sharing. I am glad it is not a symptom of the Bell\u2019s palsy coming back, I was worried. I am glad it has not occurred again for neither of us.  I hope the same to you! Than you did before, after it started repairing? After the repairing started.", "Idk if this is Bells or not. This morning I woke up feeling weird. My face would not move the way it used to, and I have a slight pang of pain on my jaw. I cannot close my right eye completely, and I have tried to move my lips only for it to work on one side. I feel sad and ashamed and I have only my mom to confide to. Right now is my 1st night with this condition and tomorrow I have already scheduled a checkup with a neurologist. I just know that half of my face are not working and it is really troubling me. Any advice or words of encouragement for me? Again, I do not know if this is bells  palsy but if it is, how did you deal with it? Sounds like it, but you will get confirmation from your doctor. I am sorry! It can be pretty upsetting.\n\nThe most important thing right now is to get an eye patch to protect your eye when you sleep. \n\nIt will pass. The doctor will give you some anti virals and prednisone (a steroid) to take for a short amount of time. It can take some time to recover, but most people recover completely. \n\nMake sure to rest and relax all you can. Hang in there! Its sounds like what my mum experienced. She woke up feeling \u201cweird\u201d and weak and went back to bed. An hr later she realised her face was paralised and went to the hospital. Her left shoulder and left side of her neck hurt for a few days before though so it was not completely sudden. \n\nI hope you find out what it is and i wish you all the best! Even if it is BP, im most cases a full recover is possible. My mum is in her late 40\u2019s and she revovered about 95%. Make sure to go to urgent care just to get some steroids and anti-virals. It is important to get those as early as you possibly can Go to the doctor immediately. Get on prednisone right away is your best option. Get some cbd topicals or cbd if available. Look up facial exercises, try not to stress and eat good. B vitamins too. I had the slight pain on my jaw still do but for me it was not bells but paresthesia. My kind words that I can give you is you will be okay. I had bells when I was 15 and just started high school. I got bullied so badly. But it is okay. You will be okay. Ask your doctors if you can do facial exercises and they will most likely say yes. Do them everyday and chew gum to help exercise your facial muscles. Practice smiling. It is going to be alright", "Does anyone else who has recovered get really nervous when their eye twitches? I had Bells Palsy about 6 years ago, and recovered about 95%. Nothing super noticeable as a lasting effect, just issues with closing my eye tight enough to not get water/soap in it during showers, and a few other minor issues. \n\nNow, every time my eye twitches, it makes me really nervous. The last week or so, my left eye (opposite as my BP side) has been twitching like crazy when I am at work. It has me really freaked out, as my eye did this before I had BP. \n\nAnyone know what causes an eye to twitch? It is pretty constant, and pretty significant spasms. It is ANNOYING. Anyone else experience this feeling when dealing with a twitching eye? I am only about 1.5 years out, and my healing stalled at approximately 85% or so....\n\nBut any time I get an eye twitch, lip twitch, any sort of facial tic or twitch....on either side...Hell if I even get a twitch in my neck or shoulder...I am practically out the door looking for valtrex and prednisone.\n\nI totally get it.  It is awful! SAME. Have you had any dental work since? That is also an awful feeling - having half of your face numb again, and not being able to smile on one side again. I always worry it will not wear off, even thought I know it will. I have. In fact, I had a wisdom tooth pulled right after I had \"recovered\" as well as having some fillings done.  I was not concerned about the numbness then, but now that you mention it, I guess it could have been very scary if I had thought about it! Yep. My left eye was twitching daily for 9 months back in 2018, in conjunction with random facial muscle twitches - 5 years after my first BP. I have been to a couple of ENT and neurologists but they did not find anything.\n\nOne neurologist did say it could be related to Incomplete BP recovery and told me not to worry about it (unless it progresses of course) Yes Yep. Debated on going to the ER a few times for it. Yup eye twitching or earache scares me it is been 10 years since still cannot eat without eye watering days and  when I am tired my one eye does not open all the way. Were you prescribed valtrex for your BP? I had an antiviral, I do not recall what it was though.  I just threw \"Valtrex\" out there because it was the only one I could remember off the top of my head.\n\nEdit: looked up my records and I was prescribed famciclovir Same here. I have noticed I can tell when I was tired when a picture was taken. You could tell by the end of my wedding day since my face was strained from smiling for so many pictures. \n\nI also randomly notice I still have food in the back corner of my mouth on my affected side. I do not feel it there sometimes. I was also prescribed a small valtrex dosage. They tested me for hsv and gave it to me to take until my results came back negative, then called me and told me to stop taking it.", "Mystery Facial Nerve Issue- Please Help Hello Everyone! I had Lyme disease for 10 years and recently cured it! Hallelujah! But... I am left with some facial nerves issues that all of my doctors believe is Bells Palsy. I do not have facial drooping, though, so this confuses everyone and myself. I do know the issue extends from right below the left side of my lips, and my right eye. I often have no feeling in either of these areas... which is very frustrating and makes day to day life harder to operate in. I also must add the following:\n\n\\- The numbness makes it feel like my face is drooping when it actually is not \n\n\\- The only visible issues I notice are: the muscle right ABOVE the left side of my mouth seems to have caved in (not noticeable to anyone unless carefully observed) And my right eye tends to get bigger when I have bad episodes of this - so it seems my lower eyelid starts to drop- this is very visible\n\n\\- I take stimulants (adder all, Vyvanse) because I have ADHD and these definitely contributed to causing the episodes\n\n\\-The episodes subside completely when I take Clonazepamn but otherwise once they have begun, they persist for hours\n\n\\-Anxiety definitely contributes to catalyzing the episodes\n\nSo, I know what you are thinking: these episodes must be panic attacks, and you know, that could be true... but I usually do not have any other symptoms of panic attacks, AND I just find the visible alterations in my face odd when these episodes occur. I believe I have nerve damage.\n\nSo, I am posting on Reddit because, first of all, I love these communities- I think we all are often more knowledgable than some doctors because we haven so much experience with our conditions and because we do not ever stop trying to find solutions to our issues, and second, because I am seeking any advice on where the best doctors might be located to investigate my nerve issues. Do any of you have any recommendations for doctors that you have had good experiences with? (I will travel anywhere). Also, has anyone experienced anything that sounds like what I am experiencing? Thanks so much! So sorry for what you are dealing with. This reddit community is rather small and inactive compared to the Facebook group that has something like 8k members posting every few minutes. I would put this there, you are much more likely to find similar experiences and references. Best of luck to you I am perplexed by you saying you have loss of sensation, as this is not a characteristic of Bell\u2019s palsy. I am a speech pathologist, and have taken neuroanatomy/extensive study of the cranial nerves in school. As you have mentioned, Bell\u2019s palsy is caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which is cranial nerve (CN VII). The facial nerve is responsible for the motor movement of the facial muscles, but not the sensation. Facial sensation is provided by the trigeminal nerve, CN V. So, the loss of sensation of your face tells me that more than the facial nerve is involved, and worries me about the function of the trigeminal nerve as well. I would mention this to your doctor. Bell\u2019s palsy should only cause motor control/movement issues, and not sensation issues unless there is a lesion of another cranial nerve involved. This was completely true of my Bell\u2019s. Could feel everything normally, just could not move it. Now, the facial nerve is also a sensory nerve, but for taste and hearing. Not facial sensation. I hope that makes sense. I would see a neurologist if you have not already. Also, I would like to add that I am so glad you have recovered from Lymes, that is great!! I also have a panic disorder and anxiety disorder, and experience physical symptoms that are the result of psychological distress. For example, chest pain and heart palpitations that feel like a heart attack, but are from tension and emotional distress. They go away when I take Xanax. I have had an EKG that was normal, and the fact that they go away with meds tells me they are psychological. I am not saying you are making it up at all, but only that psychological distress can come out in your body. I think it is interesting that they go away when you take Clonazepamn. Very relevant to share with a doctor. Sending prayers for answers and healing!! I empathize with you. Hey! I am looking into seeing multiple neurologists for different opinions.. this makes complete sense and is actually a huge relief to me.. even though you kind of made it sound like a serious issue If the trigeminal nerve is damaged (could just be me reading your response incorrectly)... does the trigeminal nerve extend to the sides of your head? Cause I notice when I wear head bands the numbness increases and even when I wear my glasses for too long.. when this first started I felt like I had to hold the left side of my face up from around my temple and into my hair.. thanks so much for your response! Very informative I am sorry you are going through something similar! I have definitely often been to the ER cause I thought I was having a heart attack or stroke when I was having a panic attack myself.. terrifying stuff. Yes I am very excited about being done with my ten decades of Lyme!! Haha it is been awesome but the remnants left behind are pretty difficult too: thanks for the prayers! I wish you the best, too! Hey! What is the Facebook group called? Thanks so much! \u201c Bells Palsy &amp; Facial Paralysis Support (Group Page) \u201c Hello, I am currently a nursing student who has been displaced due to COVID-19. I am not a doctor so the things I write should not replace advice from your doctor or give a diagnosis, but hopefully I can still be of some help. According to Lewis\u2019s Medical Surgical Nursing textbook, Bell\u2019s Palsy is an \u201cacute, usually temporary, facial paresis resulting from damage or trauma of the facial nerve\u201d (Harding, Kwong, Hagler, Reinsch, pg. 1423, 2020). Unfortunately, there are theories on how this occurs but there is no exact cause that indicates how this occurs. One of the theories that exist on the occurrence of Bell\u2019s Palsy is that reactivation of herpes simplex virus which is a viral infection that causes inflammation that leads to nerve compression. Some signs and symptoms are but not limited to difficulty eating, swallowing, speech, and taste due to nerve damage. Other signs that could occur are facial numbness, facial twitching, and dryness of the eye or mouth. Just like the cause of Bell\u2019s Palsy, diagnostic tests as well not definitive. Given that it is a clinical diagnosis, clinical examination is required and so is observing typical onset patterns of the condition. MRI and CT scans are used as well to see what nerves are damaged. Patients who have this condition should see a neurologist or otolaryngologist in order to exclude neurological conditions that can be caused by nerve damage. In terms of treatments patients who have Bell\u2019s Palsy are treated as outpatient patients and treatments are to prevent further damage and complications as well as minimizing symptoms. Certain medications such as oral corticosteroid therapy would be given to reduce inflammation and swelling.  Management of care is as follows protecting the eye, maintaining a good nutrition, and talking mild analgesics to relieve pain. It is important to note that most people recover within 3 to 6 months after onset of symptoms. I recommend speaking with your health care provider to find the best plan that fits your needs. \n\nReference: \n\nHarding, M., Kwong, J., Roberts, D., Hagler, D., \\&amp;amp; Reinisch, C. (2020). Lewis's Medical-  surgical nursing: Assessment and management of clinical problems. St. Louis, MO:   Elsevier I have the same thing as the author who wrote this post and I have told my doctor about this and even made them do an MRI and they said they found nothing. I had bells 3 years ago and I still have days where I cannot feel spots and my motor skills in my face become tight and absent. It is crazy.", "Just given dire prognosis I was just told at 15 days into Bells Palsy that due to medicine mismanagement and poor advice by several doctors, that I am likely to be stuck with this condition for life. I was given a less than 30% chance of recovery and do not know what to do.\n\nFeb 16: Inner ear pain, small blister at bottom of ear, swelling around nerve\nFeb 18: Loss of taste and facial drooping began overnight\nFeb 19: Saw GP - put on 5 days x 60mg of prednisolone (given 1 extra day of 50mg in case follow up appointment missed). Diagnosed as Bells Palsy - doc mentioned Ramsey Hunt but decides against prescribing anti-virals.\n\nFeb 21 evening: Read about Ramsey Hunt. Even though my GP ruled it out, I read about symptoms and the way it affects recovery odds. I visit A&amp;E and get a 5 day course of Aciclovir (400mg x 5 daily).\n\nFeb 24: Follow up with GP. Gives 3 more days of prednisolone, and asks me to visit different hospital for further checks.\nFeb 24 (same day): Visit hospital. First doctor suspects Ramsey Hunt, refers me to ENT specialist. ENT specialist says not Ramsey Hunt, advises I cease prednisolone at 7 day marker and Aciclovir at the end of the 5 day course. Says I am a 3 out of 5 on their palsy scale. Today I have first twitches in face\n\nFeb 26: Finish Aciclovir. Meant to finish steroids but I had that spare day. Some more slight twitches in face.\nFeb 27: Finish Prednisolone. I took the spare 50mg day on this day. Can slightly squint, move mouth 1mm.\nFeb 28 (Fri evening): Extreme pain returns to nerve area. \n\nFeb 29/Mar 1st (weekend): Extreme pain intermittently around nerve area. Rolls in with a stabbing sensation.\n\nMar 2nd: Call GP, get pain killers (Amitriptyline). GP decides to restart me on prednisolone (60mg) and Aciclovir (now 800mg x 5 daily). Sets up another ENT specialist appointment\n\nMar 5th: ENT tells me that I am a 4 to 5 on their scale of Facial Palsy. Given no movement returning, gives me brutal prognosis. Thinks I am less than 30% likely to recover. They are worried the nerve may be completely severed - if that is the case apparently things will not go ever back to normal. Wants me to continue steroids up until I hit 14 days consecutively and, prescribes Variciclovir, to be taken for 7 days.\n\nCurrently, I cannot move my left side of mouth at all, nor my left eye brows at all. My left eye blinks around 60% down. My left ear has become hyper sensitive to loud sounds. I cannot taste on the left side either.\n\nAt this point I am feeling totally hopeless, panicked and shocked at the downturn in my prognosis. They are warning me if things do not change by 6 weeks we will be talking about facial reanimation, incl things like electrical stimuli and Botox. Basically never get taste, normal hearing or movement back.\n\nFew quick questions: Can Ramsey Hunt be definitively diagnosed by blood test / other means?\n\nCan nerve damage / inflammation / severed be diagnosed with any machines? MRI scan?\n\nI have also been taking Vitamin B-Complex (incl B12), multivitamins and Lysine since this began.\n\n\nAnything else anyone advise I do at this point?? Go see a neurologist ASAP. He/she will send you to get an MRI. I just had one Thank you. I am going to see my GP first thing tomorrow and will try to arrange that. Are you thinking about surgical options? No. Skip your GP and go to Neurologist. They are the ones that specialize in BP. You could also try massage and acupuncture Hi, definitely get an MRI, that will confirm your inflammation of the cranial nerve, as well as rule out anything else (like a tumor or something).\n\nThen I would request an EMG, this will let you know if your cranial nerve has any \u201clife\u201d in it. When I did this it showed that my top two branches were 90% paralyzed and the lower one is 100% paralyzed. Sounds terrible, which it is, but what it also showed as that since they were not all 100% that my cranial nerve is still in tact on some level and is ever so slowly regenerating. This is the kind of hope I needed and you deserve to get too. \n\nMy neurologist said even though I am a level 5 paralyzed and it is been a month with zero progress, that he still expects me to make a recovery (maybe not full). Do not lost hope, our positive outlook is crucial for our success in healing. Good luck! Thank you for this. I did see a neurologist and am trying to get an MRI, but so far have been told literally everywhere in the UK is unavailable due to coronavirus, so now I just have to wait and hope. I am nearly at 2 months now with no improvements. \n\nIn the last week my ear has started annoying me when I open my jaw / eat. Hard to describe, it is like a rumbling noise that I have always been able to hear internally if I swallow hard. On one hand I am viewing this tiny change as potentially good, a sign of repair/regrowth, on the other it is super uncomfortable and might be synkenesis. Perhaps a bit early for that tho.  \n\nTrying to hold onto hope. Good luck to you too! Thank you!", "Over 4 months Hey yall. I have been dealing with the ups and down, the two steps forward and three steps back recovery over 4 months now. What are some of the things that irk you the most about having BP? I never ever heard of it before and I am convinced the doctor that diagnosed me had little to no clue either. I agree - that was almost as challenging as the physical appearance.\nI also continued to have issues hearing and eye tiredness for months after the paralysis dissipated.  It certainly helped to focus on relaxation, however, I also took anti inflammatory meds, drank gallons of water and did light exercise.  I fully support the use of med. mj to help with calmness. I cant say it enough. It is a blessing to have people with/had BP to relate, discuss and get advice from. Thank you. Totally get it - I felt \u201cseparated\u201d from my community when it happened, and the people here and on the Facebook site for BP helped me get through it.  I also was fortunate to have family around me telling me that I was just as obnoxious with a funny-looking face as I was with a normal one, which helped.  Over time, I found that the people who interacted with me seemed to get used to my looks, so that also helped.\n\nYou will recover one way or the other-we just have to relax and live our lives.  You have got this. The hardest part about Bells was how hard it was to smoke weed because it helped me feel sooo much better especially when I used the topical CBD oil on my face after smoking. And I used a quartz stone facial roller to gently rub in the CBD. The first time I used both was the first time my face actually did not hurt after onset. I would get paranoid when I smoked and spent hours staring in the mirror desperately trying to move my face. Thank God mine only lasted 3 months before I was fully recovered but even now whether I smoke or not, I am still worried that one day I will wake up with a frozen face again", "BellsPalsy Hello,  \n\n\nI have been diagnosed with bells palsy last year. Went to a neurologist where they confirmed this and gave me a lot of meds  like prednisone and Acylovir and I got better. \n\nI mention that I had this on my left side of the face, it was really severe, I could not close my eye, slept with eye patch and could not smile.   \n\n\nOn 02.01.2020 I went again to a neurologist because the Palsy came back this time on my right side, it is not so severe like the first time, again on prednisone etc etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA nurse told me that bad teeth, puss infection had caused me this problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It is true, can bad teeth create such nasty problems?", "Vertigo Has anyone experienced vertigo with their Bell's Palsy? I have fleeting moments of subjective vertigo where I feel the swaying, floating motion. I can walk around fine but sometimes I can feel it quite strong and have to slow myself down. I will be following up with my ENT soon. Yes! I did! I actually had the vertigo type feeling more leading into the days before my face drooped! I got to the ER fast though and caught it early and once I was on steroids did not notice it after a day or two Not vertigo but temporary dizziness doing simple things like bending over to pick something up.", "I think I have Bell\u2019s Palsy, what is the first step? Hello, \nOn the night of December 23-24, I was working on my laptop and I started feeling some tingling and swelling. I thought it could be Herpes, or allergies, or both. I pushed through, then slept. Fast forward to now, I look like the picture on the wikipedia article when I smile. Drinking and eating is tough. I feel like like the right part of my face is crunched and exhausted while the left is hardly moving at all. \nI will try to get hold of a doctor tomorrow morning at a walk-in clinic.\nCould you please tell me if there is anything I can do meanwhile. Thank you so much in advance for the help and comfort.", "The little things we take for granted I was thinking earlier today, while attempting to eat a granola bar, about how I might miss the little things about a properly functioning face more than the larger movements.\n\nIt is obvious to sufferers and non-sufferers alike that being unable to blink, speak clearly, eat or drink easily, or perhaps even sleep is something terrible to endure.  However, I am utterly fascinated by all of the minor abilities my face has (had?) which I took for granted when I was healthy.  Or things I did not even know my face did!\n\nFor example: the granola bar.  I never really thought about how much work your CHEEK does when eating.  Tongue, lips, jaw--those are obvious.  But my cheek? OF COURSE, you use your cheek to keep the food between your teeth.  You do it without thinking, and it is effortless. With Bell's, it really sucks when you have to use your fingers to push your cheek in just the right spot to slide that piece of potato back onto your molars.  \n\nSpeaking of the cheek, if I talk when I bend over to tie my shoes, or even if I look down at something, I now sound like I am about 12 beers into a bender.  Your cheek muscles are CONSTANTLY working and you never even know it.  I certainly did not know how important the cheek was for speech.  Not as compared to the lips and tongue.  \"B\" and \"P\" sounds utilize your cheek so much more than you realize.  I learned how to point my index finger into my cheek just below the cheekbone, and now I can sound almost normal (even if I look like a psycho)!\n\nAnd, that little muscle which flares your nostril!!! I miss it so much.  My nostril is collapsed, but it does not look odd.  However, when I go to sniff (probably some of the tears my eye is constantly producing now draining into my nose) that side just sucks shut.  It is so annoying.  I also learned where to poke my index finger to replicate that little muscle.  Again, look like a psycho, but it is better than earlier when I was holding nostril open with my thumb. Because, when I sniffed tears like that, it probably looked like I was doing bumps of coke in public.  I never knew how much work that little muscle did to hold my nose open...24 hours a day! \n\nNever thought I would miss whistling.  I miss it a lot! Try trimming your moustache when you cannot purse your lips - it is nearly impossible! \n\nWhat are some other, less obvious things you guys missed or are missing? It was incredibly difficult to do my eyebrow makeup without being able to use my brow muscle to lift my brow. And my finger just got in the way. Actually doing makeup in general was the hardest thing. Especially mascara. Even if you do not necessarily blink to put it on, you still need that muscle to keep your eyelid from moving when you are applying it. \n\nI definitely agree that the small things were the hardest part about BP. I am 11 months post diagnoses and am 100% recovered. But I still get twinges that I am constantly worried is BP coming back! See? I never would have considered that daily struggle.  I am glad you are better. I miss eating a sandwich or apple without having to cut it into pieces because I cannot open my mouth wide enough to take a bite. I finally decided \"screw it,\" and just started shoving sandwiches into my mouth, BP be damned. Messy and I have to be careful not to bite my lip, but I was getting really tired of soup!\n\nHave not had an apple in over two months, though.  Sure does suck! I stopped wearing mascara altogether when I got BP, was constantly getting it in my eye and now am crying a lot (apparently side effect of methylprednisolone) so useless. I miss being able to beatbox somewhat competently. Now I do it without a lot of sounds I used to do. That sucks!  Not something I would have thought of. Hope you can get back to form ASAP. Drinking from a straw without dribbling down your shirt. I actually did not take any steroids at all. I took the antivirals and did acupuncture. It might have taken me a little longer (100% at 15 weeks) to recover without the steroids, but I feel good about not putting them into my body. \n\nAlso because I did not have to worry about crying or watery eyes (my blinking came back first) I opted for strip lashes. They were much easier to put on than mascara lol. Hi.  5 months in, and a little control coming back in my cheek.  Otherwise a complete lack of control everywhere else on my right side.  If you crane your chin forward and tighten the tendons in your neck? Nothing on that side.  My neurologist pointed it out to me. Hmmm.  Not sure what you mean? With my BP, when I stretch the muscles in my neck,  the tendons or muscles on the unaffected side stand out as normal, but there is nothing on the afflicted side..yet.  I am still hopeful.", "What is your eye patching technique? We all have to do it right?  The first couple of days i taped my eye with gauze over it. Then I got the eye patch Band-Aids, which were much easier to use. They fit well and stayed on easily. I used Press and Seal Wrap. It was a lifesaver! I would then pace gauze on top of the press wrap and use a eye mask at night. I use the nexcare gentle tape, but I put it on the back of my hand first and take it off (sometimes twice) so it is not going to be super sticky on my eyelid. I have to criss cross the tape because my eyelid likes to pop up in the corner by my nose. Sexy stuff, but it will keep your eye safe. During the day I will tape it too if I am really tired and need a break. Eye mask at night is the best. Please do it. I was lax with it and ended up losing a bit of vision on my left side. It is not much, but if I close my right eye I have trouble reading stuff from a distance. I used to have 20/20, now not so much I use nexcare waterproof tape. It has kind of a foam like texture and the adhesive is not too strong. For the night I would use those eye patch tapes with a standard eyepatch over it for extra protection I used Genteel severe gel and medical tape for sensitive skin. I put in the gel, put the tape on my cheek, squinted as much as I could, and pulled the tape up until my eye was fully closed, and secured the tape to my forehead. Cleaning my skin with alcohol (I have oily skin) helps the tape stay in place all night. Should I be doing this during the day at all or just at night? That is up to you. I only do it at night now but the first week or so I did it in the evenings also.", "Prescribed Corticosteroids for Bells Palsy I was just wondering for how long people took their corticosteroids for. I have been diagnosed with Bell's Palsy a week and a bit ago and I am starting to run out of the steroids. I am not really seeing much improvement and I have not been given any physiotherapy, I was mostly told by my doctor to remain positive and keep taking the steroids and the eye drops. I was wondering if perhaps I should phone up to ask for more or if there was a specific course/amount you are supposed to take - and that I have already had my lot when this ends.\n\nThank you! I was given a 6 day supply of prednisone, first 2 days I took 5 pills/day, then taper off with 4,3,2,1 pills each day. Also was given an anti-viral for 7 days. Eye drops as well. \n\nAfter taking all the drugs, I had zero improvement, but my Bells Palsy did not get worse. It took 35 days before I started to slowly regain muscle movement in my face. It was another 45 days before I was 90% recovered. \n\nSo 80 days later and 90% recovered, and another 10 days before I felt I was 100% cured. So do not expect to wake up one day and be fully recovered, it is a slow recovery for most people. You mileage will vary of course. \n\nSteroids from what I was told is not good to be on for long periods of time. Doctors are very hesitant to prescribe more steroids. If you have any questions, call or visit your doctor. As far as I know, the steroids are purely for anti-inflammatory purposes (inflammation in our eustachian tubes gave us BP).  To stop further damage from happening. I was also prescribed prednisone for 2 weeks but the doc said to moderate the intake by the 2nd week. I also attended physical therapy for atleast 2 weeks, I only healed up to 90% I believe. I had BP 6 months ago and sometimes I can still feel a bit of paralysis from the affected part of my face.\n\nSo yeah, my take is that you just have to remain positive and to follow your neuro's diagnosis. For some they heal fast, others took a bit longer but generally BP patients heal with time. Take eyedrops when you are having trouble with sleep and get an eyepatch for the eyes if it is hard to close. the less prednisone, the better. it is great, but it also has a lot of side effects. you do not want to be on it long term. Steroid prescriptions range from a few days to a couple of weeks. They do their job best the sooner you start taking them, with diminishing returns after some few days and outright negative side-effects with prolonged usage.\n\nSteroids work by diminishing the functionality of your immune system, so it will stop sending resources to the tissues around the pinched nerve. Your immune system does not know that in this one case, its efforts are actually making things worse. A few days of steroids calms it down, hopefully. But in general a well-functioning immune system is a *good* thing, so continued steroids can open you up to all sorts of other problems. I was given 1 week's worth of meds.\n\nAlso, self-prescribed vitamins that I know work for nerve pain. (I have posted about that in another thread).\n\nI am on week 4 tomorrow. I have very, very minor movement back in my eyebrows, nose, lips and neck, so far.", "Invite the joker to lunch I just found out that putting my finger in my weak cheek and pulling it out and back, similar to the joker, while eating, prevents me from biting the inside of my mouth and allows for a better bite of whatever I am eating. Nice hack! Pressing on the outside of the affected cheek also helped me pronounce certain sounds better, mostly the plosives.", "Returning to training after bell's palsy I (f36) am 5 weeks in to my 4th round of bell's palsy. I returned to exercising after week 2 but mostly long walks and HIIT training. I must have hurt myself the last session somehow, because I have a very tight shoulder and neck on the side affected by BP. \n\n Today when I went to visit my physio therapist to work on my face, I asked if she could check my neck and shoulder and she advised me to stop training for the next few weeks or until my face settles a bit? \n\nSide note: I see an acupuncturist for the BP that also asked that I do not go out into wind and I also see a chiro who asked that I only train after week 2 of BP. \nI train for mental health reasons and am not at all a \"gym-rat\" so I am a bit worried about the impact it would have on me. \n\nAnyone else been advised similar?", "Round two. Disappointingly I have had a second bout of Bell\u2019s Palsy in the last 10 months. The first time I had 95% recovery in three weeks with the rest clearing up in subsequent months.\n\nThis second time is on the opposite side and I am gutted that I need to go through this all over again. \n\nAny other two timers want to share your recovery stories? I am about 98% recovered from my first bout. I am terribly sorry you have to deal with this again. Best of luck. Wow I am so sorry, how upsetting! I just recovered from my first episode. Sending you hope for recovery, and peace. Can you link either of your bouts to anything? Mine was immediately following a cluster of cold sores on my tongue. The virus triggered the BP. Or were both just random? Interesting it is your opposite side too. This second time I got really sick five days before with some kind of virus, but tested negative for Flu, Covid and Rhinovirus and it developed after those symptoms went.  \n\nThe first time, I do not remember being sick at all. \n\nBoth came with a horrible earache, which is persisting currently. \n\nI am gutted haha. Jeez I am so sorry! I have been there and empathize with you. I had the ear ache too. The nerve passed through your skull right behind your ear, and that is where the swelling is. That is the cause of those horrid ear aches. How close together were your episodes? Good to know about the reason behind the earaches. Did you get the dull aching pain in your face too?\n\nEpisodes were 10 months apart :( It is happening for me right now for the second time too, on the same side though. (   \nGood luck. Sorry to hear that I really am. I wish you the best with your recovery. Take care of yourself and be kind to yourself. Thank you!", "I need some help My 9 year old sister cannot smile on one side of her face and when she try\u2019s closing her eyes only one closes she is being taken to the doctors right now um ig I am just asking if you guys think she has it or is it serious and if so to what extent. Thank you", "How long does it take for the affected eye to become the same size as the other side my affected side is noticeably much smaller especially when squinting how long did it take for you guys for it to return to its regular size? ", "So it is a six weeks later and I am very nearly over it. I made a few posts in June about my Bell's and ending up in hospital after it spread to both sides of my face. This is just an update on my progression.\n\n After hospital I was on a major course of antibiotics in case it had been Lyme disease but there never seemed to be any consensus as to what actually caused it and I was treated for more than one possible condition. The left side of my face where it started is fully recovered now, the right is still a bit weak. I still cannot blow out my cheeks fully because my lips will not compress fully on that side. And my right eye still tends to be very watery.\n\nBut still hugely improved. I doubt anyone could notice a problem at this point. Certainly I have met some friends lately and no one has commented. Masks do hide the effects of Bell's excellently though. I have a follow-up scheduled with my neurologist next month and I am sure that by then I will be completely recovered. \n\nThanks for all the advice and support and good luck to anyone struggling at the moment. It does get better. Congrats on the progress! That is great news! \n\nI know I felt like it would never end.  When I finally had some control I was so happy. \n\nHope it keeps getting better. So I got it in February and it was not till now, mid July, that people started noticing how much better it is.  My smile is getting much better, still crooked, but not as much.  My dr told me 6 months to a year. I kept seeing people were healed in weeks ... I was depressed because my was not as quick,  and is still going. Do your facial exercises multiple times a day. My dr told me that because I am diabetic it will take longer. \n\nDid you go to the dr immediately? I was at the doc within 24 hours of onset so that definitely helped, although they quickly decided it was not standard Bell's when it went to both sides of my face. I feel like the immunoglobulin treatment is what turned it around for me.\n\nReally sorry to hear things are going so slowly for you. I am T2 myself so I know how much it can mess up the healing process. You are definitely not alone. I have read quite a few stories from people who were very slow to recover. Also I suffer from depression too so it is my default to put a positive spin on everything to try to add a bulwark against it. In my darker times I wonder if I am ever going to be 100% again but I do not think if helps me to indulge that train of thought.\n\nAs long as there is improvement it does not matter if it is slow. Count all your victories no matter how small, let go of your defeats no matter how big. Wishing you the best and sending you a smile to combine with yours. :)", "Bell's Palsy appears to effects the Red area showed in the chart. Does anyone have any speech therapy recommendations to help that particular area?  I do not know much about speech therapy, but during my recovery I would go through the alphabet two or three times a day, and when I came across a letter I struggled with, I would practice five or six words that begin with that letter, then continue through the alphabet. For example:\n\u201cA, B (struggle letter), balloon, bike, Barbie, banana, bite, C, D, E... (etc.)\u201d I pressed send too early, but I found over-emphasizing struggle letters in day to day speech helped quite a bit too. Acupuncture really helped me with this.  I had issues and had to fishhook my mouth when talking on the phone.  Good luck!  I hope you heal quickly!! I have scheduled an appointment this weekend.  \n\nAnything I should look for or have an head up about?\nHow often did you do acupuncture? I am not sure shy I didnt think to do that from the jump.  I have been practicing by saying wacky waveable inflatable arm flailing tube man 10 times. The sooner the better and I was doing it 3 times a week.  He was specific with Bell's.  He had me buy a tens unit that I would use twice a day.  Of course everyone is different, but I was back to normal within 6 weeks. Hmm that sounds a bit on the pricey side. Lol I hope my insurance covers it. I just want to acknowledge how cruel if is to name it B ell\u2019s P alsy, when B and P are the first two letters listed as being difficult to say! Facial exercises in general helps a lot. Blow up your cheeks and try to keep the air in. Help with your fingers on the side that is affected, but try your hardest on the affected side to move it by itself, even if nothing is happening. Hold it for 3-4 seconds and then relax for 3-4 seconds. Making a kissing mouth exercise is also good for these sounds.", "To those who have recovered completely or almost completely\u2014what function took the longest to get back to normal? I am 9 weeks in and almost completely recovered. I still notice a few things that are not completely back to normal. My smile looks a little forced but is mostly back lacking a few smile lines. But, I mostly notice my eye is taking a while to get back to normal. It blinks but cannot seem to keep up with the other. Everyone says they cannot even notice although, I was wondering if anyone else has problems with this taking the longest to return to its normal function.  My recovery was the opposite of yours - my eye came back faster than my smile. That being said, my eye did not start blinking all the way again until about 12 weeks. Plus, when I am tired, I can still feel my one eye blinking a little slower than the other.  Oh interesting! So strange to me how everyone recoverers a little different and at different speeds ", "Any NF2ers on here? I had a acoustic neuroma resection (5cm) 2 months ago. As a result, the right side of my face was paralyzed. No drooping but I cannot move it \ud83d\ude22 I also lost all of my hearing in BOTH ears after the course of post-operation dexamethasone was finished (3weeks). Corrective surgery with the plastic surgeon was cancelled (till who knows when) and I am losing hope lol. Is there anything I can do at home to possibly help my situation?", "Fun with Bell's Palsy 1. Brushing your teeth and holding your mouth closed so you do not inadvertently spit everywhere.  \n2. When conducting number 1 successfully before bedtime, something you ate for lunch comes out whole and untouched from somewhere in your mouth.\n3. Absolutely crushing staring contests with your kids when you put the pirate patch over your \"good\" eye. They never remember which one.\n4. Deadpan reactions to almost every atrocity on the news.\n5. Pretending you are Joseph Merick from the Elephant Man and reciting his lines. \"I am not an animal, I am a man.\"\n6. and Lastly, impersonating the Terminator (1984) fixing his eye at the sink when you are taping it up before bedtime, then also Terminator 2 when he calls Johns foster parents: \"Your facial nerves are dead\"\n\nThat concludes the amount of fun you can have with Bell's palsy. Been diagnosed about two weeks, this is, in fact, my first rodeo with it. You forgot cosplaying Two Face. I told people I was Earl the bug man from Men in Black during my early days haha I wish you a quick recovery. Rest a lot. Earl the bug man walks like that because he did not skip leg day. I tried some makeshift squats at home the other day and have been waking like him for three days. I am sure I will get some percentage back, but resigned to it now. It is a nuisance, for sure, but it is happening and it is happening to me. Thank you. My husband has coronavirus. I have been so preoccupied with that I did not realise my face is 99% back to normal now until he pointed it out. Glad you are seeing the fun side, hope you are healed soon. Good luck to you also. I have not left the house because of being afraid of not being able to use half my face. Hoping you get the mother Theresa immunity when caring for him. I hope both you and your husband recover fully, and quickly. 7. The awesome amounts of weight you will lose because you are stuck eating soft food because you cannot open your mouth all the way to eat normal food... (as was my case with bilateral bells palsy)... and the steroids  helped too. I was jacked on steroids for a week, lost seven pounds and looked great, now after being off them and stuck looking at the fridge all the time,not so much. yeah it was great... until it was not LOL. Also, im still doing #1 and #2 on your list for the most part. I also get the 'crocodile tears\" really bad so I basically look like im sobbing whenever i eat", "Is it possible to prevent the worst? On my second bout here (I will post about my first in a comment for some history). Yesterday I recognised the pins &amp; needles feeling in my cheek, and coffee got THAT TASTE, so I scurried off to my GP to start prednisolone asap.\n\nToday maybe feels a little less painful, and I still have no obvious paralysis (just weakness)... is it possible to get on treatment quickly enough that the paralysis will not come on? Or am I dreaming? I guess I will probably know by tomorrow but I am hoping somebody might have a similar experience. So my first episode of BP was almost exactly a year ago (clearly February/March is a stressful time!), and I had no clue what was happening to me. Started with an irritated eye, a feeling like a coating on my tongue and then boom, paralysis. I was on prednisolone within a day of the paralysis and I healed very quickly - back to near full function within a few miserable weeks. \n\nI vividly remember the painful pins and needles as the function started returning, and that is what I have had yesterday and today. I have read that if steroid treatment is started early it can reduce the level of paralysis experienced. No idea if that is anecdotal or an actual study. Seems to make sense in your case though. If you started steroid treatment before being fully symptomatic, it is probably either delayed the onset of paralysis or reduced the severity of it. Good looking out!  So far so good. The nerve appears to be pinched enough to be causing pain/pins and needles but not drooping or paralysis (although my face just FEELS weak).\n\nI am feeling very lucky and a bit less embarrassed about charging off to my GP so quickly. There is no point in taking the risk really. Always worth checking when your body's doing something weird! ", "10% club? Where is the 10% that will never fully recover? Just went for a three year follow up with my neurologist ( I do this yearly), and have been officially declared in the 10%. Where are you friends? Holla! Going on five years and at about 85% healed. I have resting symmetry, but boy oh boy, nothing else really does what it is supposed to. Hey amigo I only recovered about 85-90%\n\nI got BP When I was a sophomore in high school. Oh my god was that a blow to my self esteem . I am in my mid-30s now and thank God I had a normal dating life. Sometimes people point out my squinty eye but it could always be worse 18 month but no change for 9 so reckon I am with you. Talk out the side of my mouth, close an eye when I smile and eye does not open as much as the other. \nI hate it. No worries I seen improvements almost 10+ years 16 months out for me. I am 95ish percent healed. My eye is still weak and droops more when I am stressed or tired. As for my mouth, I am pretty good until I have to smile for pictures. I cannot hold a balanced smile for very long. My ENT said he does not believe I have Bell\u2019s, he believes it is basic facial palsy due to damages to the nerves from a massive ear and sinus infection (had the infection and palsy at the same time and had to be hospitalized for a week).  The eye is the worst part for me. ENT said not to expect anymore improvement after 18 months. I am staying positive though and I am lucky because most people say they do not notice until I mention it. We are here. 18 months in and probably 90% better, except, my eye on the affected side is still a struggle.  Have to keep using Lotemax or it gets all red and inflamed.  It is actually a problem with the function of the gland that produces/secretes tears. Got mine in 2014 and probably 90% healed. Resting symmetry but eye cannot open like my other when I smile, which makes me not want to smile. I also can not get a full mouth smile on that side. I feel this 100%. My eyelid on my effective side looks \"lazy\" so to speak and just forget it with smiling. Does not work at all My eye only makes tears if I chew food... Man I hope that gland issue can be fixed. That must be annoying. About a week out from 1 yr. No real improvement since about 4 or 5 months ago. I am about 80% healed and would do LITERALLY anything for normal mouth function back. I feel that on so many levels. Hello! I am about 75 percent recovered after 5 years. So sad. I am in that group too. Five years in, probably 75% recovered with synkinesis. Synkinesis is the worst part in my opinion. I would love to get rid of it. 10 years later or over the course of 10 years? We are a special group I feel. Definitely. I feel your pain. It really sucks to smile in pictures....I am super self-conscious. Agreed. It sucks to smile in pictures. I am still super self-conscious. \ud83d\ude2d I refuse pictures. \ud83d\ude41 That makes me sad I seen improve 10 years later heyooo that would be me. got bell's in october of 2015 and i would say i am 60-70% recovered. my eye does not close all the way. my smile is nowhere near what it used to be. i will probably never taste on the right side of my mouth again. but i am an advocate for palsy-tivity! (yes i know it is corny but bear with me). i am a practicer of radical acceptance and am happy with who i am and how i look. I get major crocodile tears when I eat anything and constantly have to pay my eye with a napkins. It literally looks like I am balling \ud83d\ude02 I am hoping it can be fixed though bc it is so frustrating sometimes. If you find a fix, let me know. I am down to get my eye fixed too. I feel you, someone I love very much in the same situation, I wish I could split or take it for them. Hang in there, sometimes the universe opens new does for us in what seems like very strange ways. Peace out.", "30m diagnosed a week ago Last week I started out with burning eyes and some loss of taste. The next morning rather rapidly my mouth was drooping and my eye would not close. After some back and forth I was admitted to the hospital by night time and started a cortisol treatment. After two days I was discharged with a cortisol program for at home, a sheet of exercises, some watch glass bandages and artificial tears.\n\nApart from the usual eating, drinking and talking issues my main problem is my eye. I had it checked out, no damage, but I wear the watch glass basically all day and night as my eye starts hurting sooner or later otherwise, no matter how much or often I apply the gel. Right now I am mostly looking forward to my eye improving, but I am only one week in so it might still be a while (as long as it does happen!).\n\nIt is definitely something that affects you psychologically and emotionally, I am glad to have my girlfriend for support. The additional downside for me is that my dad has just come home after months of hospitalization (during which I was not allowed to visit) following multiple strokes while battling an aggressive, rare disease. I do not want him to see me like that, though, to not frighten him as the symptoms are so much alike and I do not want him to think I had a stroke as well (unfortunately I cannot just \"tell him\", he might not fully comprehend).\n\nAll of this of course right before planned vacation, but since the hospital did not want to write me sick for work I guess that was not so bad after all, even if we had to cancel our plans.\n\nTrying to be positive now, doing my exercises, doing the gels and all that stuff. Accompanied by any research gathering I can do, I have read anything from studies to dissertations on it now.\n\nOne week in, here is to keeping it a short of a recovery as possible, but hopefully at least an actual recovery. Over 10 years into it still have eye issues everything else came back within 6 months About a month and a half in only 2 weeks of steroid pills and my only problems are my right eye and the corner of my lip it seems the eye has the hardest time healing so idk I had a similar problem with my eye i used homemade heat compress for the affected side for the pain along with pain medicine and a few weeks the pain subsided but im still recovering i find doing video diaries helped me see that i am getting improvements I am glad to hear that you have got support. It is definitely not fun times. I was diagnosed just shy of two months ago. Just wanted to share, in case time is passing and you are starting to worry about all the potential permanent effects (I definitely did). It took about 5 weeks for my face (other than my eye) to be almost back to normal. My eye however did not start improving in any significant way until about four days ago (7 weeks in) and I was starting to worry it would be permanently affected. Thankfully, over the last four days it is gone from half-hearted twitches to shutting almost completely and blinking most of the way. Relative to some other stories on here, 7 weeks is not long at all, but it is easy to start worrying. Eyedrops are your friend. Nighttime eye ointment is where it is at. Sleeping masks are decent at holding an eye shut if taping it is not working for you. I hope you have a speedy recovery! Thanks, I appreciate that message and I am glad to hear you are improving, that is awesome! It is definitely tough to stay positive when there is virtually no progress as the days go by, even though I have read many times over that recovery usually \"suddenly starts\" at some point.\n\nI think my eye irritation when not wearing a watch glass during the day has started getting better. I still wear it a lot to give my eye all the rest I can. Ointment and exercises are my frequent companion right now. Well I am back in the emergency room and now hospital after I called in for my serology results and my ENT did not quite like them. The neurologist in the ER was less concerned with those however and more with no improvement after a bit over a week, so now I am here for a lumbar puncture... Hi. I hope it all ends up well. Best wishes.", "HELPPPP trouble swallowing So I have started having left facial droop since last year around July, it was very mild but has gotten worse to the point where my throat muscles spasms n contract however my eye is not affected at all. The dr. Said I have Bell\u2019s palsy and I will be starting physical therapy. However I have trouble swallowing on the left side of my throat has anyone else experienced this symptom from Bell\u2019s palsy not sure if it is apart of Bell\u2019s palsy symptoms. I only have trouble swallowing when it is acting up Are you still having issues with this? Surprisingly it has subside a bit on its own since then. It only acts up when I eat or talk? And I thought Bell\u2019s palsy is constant so I feel it may not even be that I would try to get that looked at if you can, maybe an ENT would be best.  If it is getting better though, I would not worry about it. Yea I went to the dr and he said it is Bell\u2019s palsy and I am supposed to start physical therapy soon", "Does the sleeping ever get easier? It is been a few days since I developed Bell\u2019s Palsy, and mostly I have not been too bothered by it. My friends and family are much more concerned than I am, and they say I am a little too nonchalant about the whole thing. But truthfully, I really do not mind, except for one thing.\n\nThe lack of sleep just kills me. When I tape my eye shut, it always opens, or it hurts, and it takes forever to fall asleep.\n\nLast night, I fell asleep around 1, woke up around 5. I often work very late into the night and do not want to show up tired already. \n\nI am not sure how alive this sub is, or if anyone will see this post, but I just needed somewhere to get this out. Sorry you are going through this. I recovered from BP years ago and I do not think I ever had trouble sleeping \u2014 my eye could close at about 80% and I could easily close the rest manually, so I cannot say I have experience in the matter. Is there any possibility of you getting an eyepatch to help you sleep? Or even one of those night masks that cover both eyes? Maybe that can help. \n\nAlso, I cannot stress this enough: Please take prednisone, it is the only thing that is been proved to work besides facial exercises. Vitamin B may also help. This video helped me learn how to tape the eye so it stays closed and some eye care tips  I used an eye salve, and a padded down eyepatch. I would of course sometimes wake up with the eyepatch somewhat off, but it worked better for me than taping my eye shut. I have experimented with different things until my eye is comfy enough to sleep\u2026 so bear with me of this gets long winded. \n1) Try Nexcare tape for DELICATE skin. It is more gummy than sticky and it does not hurt taking it off. \n2) If you do have irritated skin, use Aquafor without sunscreen. Just be careful not to get it in your eyes. \n3) You can also cover the tape with an eyepatch or Reynold\u2019s press and seal to make it more secure. \n4) If it hurts or is uncomfortable, take it off and try again. You can use the same tape or patches, it does not have to be sticky. \n\nTaping your eye\u2026\n1) take 2 inch long strips and stick them to the back of your (clean) hand. Take them off and put them back on your hand so it is not super sticky. Your eye area is super delicate so you do not need it to have the full amount of adhesive. \n2) take one piece and put it horizontally across your top eyelid. If you are droopy like me, use your other hand to hold that part up. \n3) keep it on your top eyelid ONLY at first. Close your eyelid (with your hand if you have to) naturally so it is comfy. This is important because you want it in a comfy position and not crammed closed with your eyelashes all mangled. \n4) once your eye is closed comfortably, press it along the bottom. The second piece goes horizontally like a cross-cross in case your eye tends to still pop open like mine does. \n5) Then place the patch or the press and seal on top. If you are using a patch, stick that to the back of your hand too so it does not have a lot of stick. (Because\u2026 eyebrows\u2026)\n\nI hope that helps! Do not tape it, just use an eye patch. I got the disposable type of eye patches at CVS.. looks like what would be used after eye surgery but it is worked really well for me for the last few days! I have had a hard time falling asleep due to prednisone but stay asleep once I do fall asleep. I do not know if you can, but if your work can let you off at a decent hour so you get more rest, it helps A LOT with the healing process. Bell's is a sign that the immune system is stressed out so rest is important. \n\nLike everyone has mentioned, eye patch. I initially use a cotton pad over my eye followed by tape over it (an X-pattern then a horizontal strip across). Some days I threw on a self-heating eye mask too as added weight to keep my eyelid closed. \n\nIf you have difficulty staying asleep, try some melatonin too. There is a technique to taping your eye shut that someone else posted here. Once you get that sorted, it is much easier.  Also use those thick eye drops that make your vision blurry before bed, as they will keep your eye from drying out. \n\nOtherwise, you will be waking up feeling like someone put sand in your eye! Sleeping has been my real problem as well.  My doctor told me not to use any patches and only use tape on my eye but that is taking the skin off my eyelid and around my eye.  Could anyone recommend any good patches ?  I am in the UK.", "3 weeks in and still at full paralysis. Will it get better? When I first got diagnosed, I was hopeful and glad to hear that many people start to heal within 2-3 weeks. Tomorrow will be three weeks since my diagnosis and I am just feeling discouraged. The pain and tenderness has gotten significantly better, thankfully, but the affected side of my face is still 100% paralyzed. I get twitches occasionally, but zero control. Have any others started to notice the first signs of improvement in facial movement after the 3 week mark? Stick in there, I know it sucks but It will get better, just take the B vitamins and be generally healthy I did not get movement back until around 3 months. It was in my lower lip/chin area. But I only got about 75% movement back overall. I hope you start to feel some movement soon! yes, I was definitely in the same position. very slow recovery. almost fully paralyzed 5-6 weeks in. \n\nI started going to acupuncture (cannot say for sure if this is what helped, but it seemed to) and started getting some movement.\n\nI am now almost 6 months out and still waiting to be able to fully move my eyebrow, but it does improve. \n\nI am sorry, but be patient and you will get there. But do go to the doctor and acupuncturist and make sure you massage your face (check out some youtube videos). I am 3 months in and I am seeing some movement in my lower face. It is REALLY slow, but it is happening. From what I am gathering, average time is definitely months, not weeks. \n\nI was so discouraged around 3 weeks, but it gets better. I forget I have it most days and I do not have any pain anymore. \n\nStick with the facial exercises, get lots of rest, find a person who will listen to your fears and frustrations. \n\nI was in your shoes in July where people were telling me this\u2026 I hated hearing that it was not going to change overnight. I coped with it better when you think about the biology of it. Nerves regenerate super slow, like 1mm a day. Once I understood that I was not so scared that it would not come back. \n\nHang in there. To the OP:\n\nDid you get any drugs like steroids and anti-viral drug like Valtrex?  \n\nBell\u2019s palsy came up fast, within days. First few days I lost most of my taste, then I noticed on day 3 I noticed my face was paralyzed. Quick check online was either I had a stroke or Bells Palsy. I was feeling perfect fine, so I took a fast drive to the ER. Told the admitting staff I am having either a stroke or Bells Palsy. After blood tests and MRI, it turned out to be BP. \n\n3 weeks later after taking all the drugs, I got my first twitch.  Just a few twitches a day for a week, but right side was still paralyzed. Week 5 I noticed some movement!  Week 6-8, every day I got a little movement each day!   It felt good to be able to blink my eyes.  After 9 weeks I was back to normal. \n\nFrom my experience, a twitch or two a day means you most likely on your way to recovery. It is just not going to be cured overnight. \n\nBest of luck, BP is not fun, but I have a feeling your on the way to recovery. It is just going to take some more time. Follow up with your doctor. I took prednisone for the first week, no anti-virals. The ER doctor that I saw did not mention them and I did not know any better to ask at the time. I was still in a lot of pain on week 2 so I was taking gabapentin, but now I am off all meds and the pain has almost completely subsided. Now I am trying acupuncture and just trying to rest as much as I can.\n\nYour onset story is identical to mine. It came up very fast for me too, and my taste feeling off was also the precursor to my face getting paralyzed.\n\nThanks for the kind words! Being able to blink again would be amazing. yes it will. Hi there, I was in the exact same situation when I was three weeks in. I had also heard of people who had fully recovered within three weeks and I only started getting very tiny (and i mean) tiny movement back three weeks in. Easier said than done (and believe me, I know) but give it time. I am now 2,5 months in and have healed around 85-90% and I am optimistic I will recover 100% (I was not optimistic at all when I was three weeks in). You got this! Wishing you a speedy recovery :) I would recommend taking pictures of yourself smiling (or any other movement). That way I noticed tiny improvements that I would not have noticed just looking at the mirror - it can definitely help with motivation! I really think your on the road to recovery, but it is going to take a little more time. You mentioned \u201ctwitching\u201d, which I had just like your having.  A twitch here and there (looking back) was the first sign of my total recovery, albeit slow weeks. \n\nYou WILL recover!  I was embarrassed to go to stores, so I just wore a mask and that hide my Bells Palsy. \n\nIf you want to talk, DM me and I will give you my phone number. \n\nI am sending you positive vibes, as Bells Palsy is not fun. Thank you for the kind words!", "BP diagnosis but very confused?? Hi all. A couple days ago I got twitched under my right eye, and I woke up this morning and could not move half of my face, but had no cognitive symptoms so did not assume stroke. It lasted for about a half hour, with the right side of my face dropping and looking swollen and like 90% paralyzed. I went to the ER because why not, but as soon as I got there it stopped? They are telling me I have BP and very occasionally, apparently, it can start and then resolve itself and then come back the next day or so. They started me on antivirals. Has a delayed onset happened to anyone? I have never heard of this happening with BP before. My moms had a bunch of times and did not seem like this at all. In the few years that I have been reading the posts here, there have been a few - a dozen, maybe - people who have described having false-start BP events followed by a more traditional BP event. But others were followed by nothing, or by something unrelated. Individual experience of BP is all over the map. Some people have really short BP events, some lifelong.\n\nBut most people do not describe their face as swollen during the paralysis phase. The muscles go slack, the face droops, it usually looks more deflated than swollen.\n\nBP is thought to result from inflammation of the facial nerve due to a virus like herpes simplex (\"cold sores\") or Varicella zoster (\"shingles\"), which like to camp out along nerves, take long naps, then flare up every so often, on a scale from months to decades. Herpes simplex often gives little warning signs when it wakes up - a twitch in the eyelid or lip; a 'scraped' feeling across forehead, eyelid, cheek; or diminished sensation in those areas. It sometimes does this without ever 'breaking out': sometimes it just fades away, but sometimes it causes the affected area to swell up. It can look like a fat lip or swollen eye from a fight, minus the discoloration from bruising or other trauma, and when the whole face is affected it can look like a reaction to a bee-sting (again minus the discoloration). The swelling can last anywhere from a few hours to a few days.\n\nIf the nerves the virus has been camping out on become inflamed, the facial nerve can become constricted in the tiny corridor where it passes through bone to reach your face, and you have got Bell's Palsy. This is why doctors usually prescribe antivirals (though something often seen here is that doctors in different areas, of different ages, or just of differing opinions, have different ways of treating BP). Since the inflamed nerve and the surrounding tissues swell up as your body sends resources to the area to fight the virus, doctors usually prescribe anti-inflammatories as well (with the same caveats about differing perspectives among doctors).\n\nSo if you had that sort of swelling, it could have affected you for however many hours you slept; you just noticed it when you woke up. And if it was the kind of swelling that disappears within a few hours, it is *possible* that this only caused a small amount of inflammation, which triggered a minor case of BP.\n\nIt is also possible that you have as yet only experienced the beginning of a larger BP event. Perhaps when you woke, your immune system was able to fight the cause of the inflammation to a standstill. Perhaps the virus is waking up a little at a time. Whether you will or will not have continued BP, nobody without a time machine can say. Unfortunately, as with every other aspect of this spectacularly annoying disorder, you just have to wait and see.\n\n(There are things you can do that *might* give you better odds: eat right, sleep right, take vitamins and electrolytes, lightly massage the area, put heat on it... you want your body to have all the resources it needs to deal with *whatever* it turns out to be.)\n\n(Edit: spleling, s pac ing) Thank you for your response! That makes sense. I woke up this morning, face is still normal, but now my ear on the opposite side aches lol we will see where this goes I guess Bell's palsy has nothing to do with eye twitching. The eye on the afflicted side of the face will not blink due to paralysis which will result in extreme discomfort and pressure buildup due to extreme dryness. That is the unbearable part of bell's palsy -- the not being able to blink or close your eyes. It makes sleeping difficult, I did not even like walking  outside when I was at my worst because it increased airflow and discomfort in my right eye. Bicycling at even 10 mph was unbearable.", "Life with Bells Palsy I had Bells Palsy three or four years ago, and my movement in my face has returned to i would say 80 percent or 90 percent better. physically I know i am fine and people that i meet tell me that its not noticeable at all, but for me i feel like i still have Bells Palsy, i am self consensus of it, I miss raising my right eyebrow, I miss be able to whistle, I miss my old smile. I find it funny that its the small things that i miss since I got Bells Palsy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions that can help. I guess i am just venting but since I got Bells Palsy I noticed that i even avoid going out and doing stuff (like be with friends, meet new people, being social) because i am worried someone will notice my face, and say something. Same scenario for me. I got Bell\u2019s palsy sept 9th 2016 and I have about 80% recovery. My eye closes when I smile and my right side does not fully respond when I smile. I get big crocodile tears when I eat and I cannot whistle anymore either. \n\nWith that said, I used the Bell\u2019s palsy to appreciate life more fully. It was a wake up call on just how quickly things can change for the better or worse. I started working out a lot more, doing challenging things that kept my focus, and spent more time with my family.\n\nBell\u2019s palsy was a scary thing, and mentally pretty upsetting. But now that I am semi recovered, I am grateful it happened. It taught me what is important in life. It gave me perspective and forced me to make changes that I should have made ages ago. \n\nWhat superficial negative changes it caused in my face, I made up by eating healthy and hitting the gym. I focused on getting fit and in shape and feel like I look better now, despite my slightly crooked face, goofy smile, and leaky eye when I eat. \n\nI guess the advice I would give is change your perspective on what has occurred. It is a superficial change, not a life ending health condition. Understand that for whatever insecurity you have about your face, you can make up for it with mental and physical strength. It sucks, but it could be a whole lot worse. Not sure if that helps, but I hope it does.  I am pretty much in the same situation. Jan 1 2015 I got bells Nd I am about 80 percent recovered at well. When i smile it isnt full smile. The right upper lip wont pull up and the botton right looks almost swollen. Also, my eye closes when I try to smile. When I make a surprised face my right eye doesnt open all the way. Ive tried practically everything. Acupuncture, massages, physical therepy. Even essential oils. I pray it slowly gets better. I just plan to keep doing the exercises and oils. Also. When I clinch my face real hard, I get an unbearable amount of pain on the right side of my neck and face, much like a muscle spasm. But I kind of feel as if it helps and if do anything to be full again. I often get red eye in the morning after i sleep as if it stays a little open at night  2 years out with Bell\u2019s palsy now. Only me and my mom can tell anything is still off. I can entertain my niece with the way my right eye seems to be connected to my upper lip. I started looking at all the celebrities with naturally crooked faces such as milo ventimiglia ( positive I misspelled that), many folks are not symmetrical and no one notices unless it is pointed out. My issue is that I now have Trigeminal neuralgia and whenever it flares I fear a reoccurrence. If I had to start from square 1 all over again, well, I just cannot fathom it  I am almost exactly at the same point. 3/6/16 about 80-85% recovered.\n\nI can tell you that I had very little recovery for my first two years and most of it has come in year three.\n\nAlthough it could be coincidence my late stage recovery began almost immediately (about 10 days) after I began intermittent fasting (16:8) and I believe that this is more than coincidence.\n\nWishing you (and all of us) a full recovery. If you had no recovery after two years and then spontaneously started recovering 10 days after beginning intermittent fasting I would say that is the furthest thing from coincidence I have ever heard. \n\nI got facial nerve paralysis from a motorcycle accident back in September and actually did intermittent fasting for the last 4 weeks for gym gains. Now that I think about it, my recovery has been a little bit more pronounced since then. \n\nAlso, I have read studies that IF helps your body\u2019s immune system clean up waste and also affects your hormones. So I do not think it is far fetched to say that it has an affect on nerve recovery. I had some recovery before but a significant part came after IF. That said I have worked with numbers my entire life and though I do believe that this is the result of IF a sample size of one is not enough to convince me conclusively.", "Is visiting a neurologist crucial to recovery? I have already gotten my steroids prescription from when I was diagnosed at an urgent care clinic. I will not be able to see a neurologist without an referral from my PCP, but the earliest appointment date that I can make with my PCP is in mid-April. I did not do anything besides the steroids and anti viral as far as doctors go. I did use CBD oil and feel like that did help. (After each dose I would feel nerves twitching on my affected side) but I did not do acupuncture or see a neurologist and I was fully recovered in about 6-8 weeks. Best of luck! I know it sucks, try to hang in there! I did not see a neurologist for my Bell\u2019s Palsy. I was also diagnosed at an urgent care clinic and given steroids. Saw my PCP a few months later (if I remember correctly). Neither place mentioned seeing a neurologist. I would recommend making that appointment with your PCP to get their opinion. Good luck with your recovery! Good to know. Thanks! I have never used CBD before, but have always wanted to try. Did you purchase it online or from a local store? If you did purchased them online, do you have a store that you would recommend? My friend actually gave it to me, she purchased it online, the brand is called Tonic, the logo is a triangle. I used the oral kind that you put under your tongue. I know it is not cheap, and once I ran out of that I bought some from my local pharmacist. I as well did not see a neurologist, my doctor said he was going to contact the neuro but it all went well at the end. If you are noticing new side effects later that are foreign then I definitely recommend talking alking you doctor again", "Ramsay hunt recovery?

A sort of tight/numb feeling all over the right side of my jaw, below my right eye and cheek and the right side of my neck and the top of the right side of my head. It is most prominent on my right ear currently. I have bad anxiety so I figured it is just a symptom but it is such a different symptom I usually get it is getting me nervous. After some time calming myself down it seems to be not as harsh as it was before but I can still somewhat feel it and it is still strong specifically on my right ear. I am incredibly anxious now and not sure what to do :( Do you have any pain on your right side? No not really. My right ear still feels kind of stuffy/numb and my bottom right jaw feels slightly numb but that is it. It was much worse when I woke up Can you smile, pucker, move your mouth around? Yes I can Normally, with Bells, you have a headache or really bad pain in one side of your head before the paralysis kicks in. Like days before or even a week. If you can still move your face by the end of the day, then I doubt it is Bell\u2019s palsy. It might be something else. And if it is, you need to make an appointment. Normally, people recover in a month. It took me 4 months to fully recover. But, judging by your post, I doubt you even have Bells if you had no pain. Okay thank you! I really appreciate the fast responses I would say go to the ER just to make sure it is not a stroke How long has it been since you got the shot? Go to a dcotor If it helps my Bell\u2019s Palsy started off as pain and muffled hearing in my right ear. Then 12 hours later I could not taste food on the right side of my mouth. Then 24 hours later I could no longer blink my right eye properly. This was my experience but I would definitely recommend you refer to a doctor to make sure if you have Bell\u2019s Palsy you start on the medication course ASAP Any update?", "Be very careful.....concerning diagnosis Over the course of about one year I was diagnosed by three doctors with BP......none of the doctors ordered an MRI and the last doctor I saw a neurologist told me I needed to \u201cjust learn to live with it\u201d.  This was unacceptable and I got an appointment at the state medical school with a facial paralysis doctor...he told me after 5 minutes I did not have BP and ordered an MRI.  I had a cancerous tumor in my right side salivary gland.  I have since had surgery and chemo/radiation treatments and will live many more years....thankfully I questioned those diagnoses or I would not be writing this.  My surgeon told me he does 3-4 surgery\u2019s a year for misdiagnosed BP .....hard to say how many just try to life with it!  My advise insist on an MRI to rule out a tumor.....many doctors are so reluctant to order an MRI I am guessing because of  insurance pressure to not have to pay for it.  Our system needs a complete redo.  It is a train wreck.  Be safe\ud83d\ude4f What made you question the diagnosis? Thank you for sharing this cautionary tale. I insisted on imaging to exhaust every diagnostic option, and recommend that anyone with access do the same. We know what causes the paralysis - an injury to the 7th cranial nerve, but there are several ways the injury can occur. We must always remember that, in the US at least, medical practitioners have a profit motive. This means a very limited time per patient that can lead to diagnostic shortcuts. I groaned when my first neurologist asked about my cerebral palsy and fired him on the spot so I could find one that would actually read my chart, as I am lucky enough to live in a metropolitan area. If you do not have that fortunate situation, insist on digging until all possibilities are eliminated before simply accepting the outcome as fate. I am glad you stuck to your guns and got the right diagnosis in the end. Wow! I feel good about the $724 MRI bill I just got. Better safe than sorry. Bell's Palsy is usually diagnosed after every other possibility is ruled out, which is why doctors are supposed to order an MRI with any facial paralysis. Just to make sure there are no tumors or anything else causing the nerve damage. It is strange to be diagnosed with BP without that type of imaging. I would have questioned it too! The doctor i saw made some physical test but aside from that, nothing really. Got a blood test to do in like a week to see if it is lyme, and my doc wants to do a follow up in like a month. \nBut i just now realised that i didnt get the progressive withdraw of one the med, and the area around my ear is a bitch since yesterday, so im calling them first thing monday. A frightening tale. \nWhen I went to my doc with my symptoms I already had a pretty good idea it was BP and he said \u201cI am 95% sure this is Bells Palsy but I want you to go to A&amp;E for a CT scan right now to be sure\u201d. Here in N.Ireland A&amp;E wait times can be 8 plus hours. I was triaged, doctor assessed, CT scanned, assessed by another doctor and consultant in the space of 2.5 hours. They all were very sure it was BP but gosh did they want to make sure before sending me home. Mainly because they all 3 really seemed unfamiliar with Bells Palsy and were just making a best guess but doing this without really gathering more information such as an MRI.....and my symptoms seemed to be getting more pronounced. That is probably a good idea. I saw in your profile you mentioned a swallowing issue - it could be totally unrelated but maybe good to get more imaging done to rule out anything else. I actually went bback to the hospital for facial pain, and they just told me i might have something else related to the 5th nerve. I just now woke up at 3 30 am because of said pain and its actually unberable. Im suppoae to get med first thing in the morning and see a neurologiat this week but god damn i wish it could all happen in the next minutes. \nRelated to my swallowing issue, i am hoping it was a nerve problem all these year and that this will finally fix it. Unfortunately that is not the practice here in the United States....our health care system is designed for profit not best health care practice.  We literally have tens of thousands of our fellow citizens die each year because of this lack of health focus!! Good luck! I hope you are able to get it resolved quickly. Your story is hitting home with me. Can I ask what stage of BP you were at when seeking these medical opinions? Were you recently diagnosed, partially healed, or experiencing a relapse later? I am in a bit of a relapse period myself after thinking I was in the clear and now I am getting brushed off by Neurologists and wondering if something more sinister is happening as well. Hope everything turned out OK. On my experience getting the pain was actually when I started to get functionality back. Ended up being a \"good pain\" even though it kept me up for a few days! I was 9 months past my initial diagnosis with my condition progressively getting worse when I sought a appointment with a neurologist.  She was rather dismissive and did a very causal observation with no further testing (I wanted an MRI).  I then sought an appointment with a facial paralysis doctor who immediately ordered an MRI and I found I did not have BP but a cancerous facial tumor.  Thank goodness I found someone willing to seek more information.....or I literally would not be writing this reply to you.  Good luck. So glad to hear you were saved by taking this action! I actually made a 95% recovery initially and about 4 months later started to get some nerve activty/synkinesis that I am now dealing with. So my nerve is not done yet.\n\nMy understanding is that tumors generally get worse over time and there is not that recovery period at all. Was that the case with you or did you recover somewhat and then get worse again? No just progressively worse.....but I am good now though I had a bumpy ride with major facial surgery then Chemo/radiation treatments.....learned a lot ...certainly treasure each day more.  Stay safe. Thank you so much for sharing your experience. It is helpful to compare with. Take care!

I recovered like 98% after about 4 weeks (just lingering face twitches) and I would say I am pretty much 100% recovered now. \n\nFacial twitching was pretty bad at the start of 2021 and I was worried I was going to have a full blown recurrence which made me very hesitant about getting the vaccine. I decided I would rather take the risk and get the vaccine in April and got my second dose in May. Since then not only have I not had a recurrence but my face twitch has gone away (nearly) completely. \n\nI would say at this point if I do get a recurrence I doubt it would have been vaccine related. Just want to give my experience and maybe help someone! Also, if you are still wary about the vaccine, I do NOT mean this post to pressure you at all. This is just for people like me who really want the vaccine due to living with high risk individuals but were hesitant due to Bell\u2019s palsy. Do what is best FOR YOU in your own situation! Thank you so much. I was also hesitant at first to get my vaccine due to BP. I will have my second dose this Friday and I am still a little afraid that I would get BP again.

", "Recurring Bells Palsy I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy in November and regained full movement within 4 weeks. I suffered with a lot of facial twitching even after my face had gone back to normal and the affected side often felt bruised to the touch for about another month. I have been feeling quite run down over the last week, I have had a mouth full of ulcers and I have had a dull but not constant ear ache in the previously affected side. These symptoms are consistent with how I felt in the two weeks before getting it in November. I do not know whether I am simply run down and what I am experiencing could be some after effects with the nerve still repairing itself or whether this could potentially be the start of a recurrence. \n\nI am just totally paranoid that I am going to wake up one more in the near future and have to go through it all again, but at the same time I know there is absolutely nothing I can do about it anyway so what is the point in worrying? Did anybody else get similar pains afterwards?  From what I have read, it is rare to get Bell's Palsy twice. I just pulled a study that said 4%-7%.\n\n(\n\nIt probably would not hurt to see a doctor since you are having worrisome symptoms. There is prophylaxis you can take (acyclovir + steroids), which may improve the prognosis. But maybe not. \n\nPersonally, I only got it once but it was severe case and I only partially recovered. I had a lot of symptoms like synkinesia, contracted muscles and facial soreness. I do not think I ever had that awful ear pain again though. \n\nI met someone in a store who told me he had it twice, but it was years apart. He had a full recovery both times, if it is any comfort. \n\n My doctor told me I needed to purchase a lotto ticket because getting BP twice was rare.  My first BP was in 2011 and it happened a second time (to the same side) in 2017.  \n\nOn a side note, the first time was devastating.  The doctor estimated that only 85% functionally returned after the first time.  After the second time it was estimated at closer to 95% (so I improved).   I have had Bell\u2019s Palsy twice.  The first time when I was 12 and the second time when I was 24.  I was always told by my doctor that it was no use being paranoid about getting it again because no one gets it multiple times.  But I had pain prior to the first instance, and then over the years the pain stuck around, every time I was stressed it would hit me hard.  One day at work I just knew it was coming, my tongue/taste started to go and before the end of my work day I had full on Bell\u2019s palsy again.  \n\nI still have pain, pretty consistently, and I do worry a little bit about a third occurrence.  But the good thing about the second time around is that you have done it before, so you can be a little more calm about what is happening to you.  \n\nIt is been six years since I had my second Bell\u2019s palsy episode.  I would say I am 80% recovered, and I think that is probably as good as it is going to get.  Twice here as well. First time in 2003, lasted about two weeks. Second time was around 2006 while in college on the other side of my face. Again lasted about two weeks before full recovery.  I have actually had a total of 5 times in my 32 years of life. \n\nI have known every time and it is a literal overnight thing. During the years I did not have it, stress just made \u201csymptoms\u201d flare up but never a full blown episode.  I had it 5 years apart, not mentioning age because it is irrelevant haha. First time was minimal, second time was a long-term recovery. I am about 95% recovered, there is no physical differences people can notice but I notice them.", "Cheeks twitching and teeth chittering Hi peeps!

Bell's on the left side is not typical from what I understand, but it does happen. I would post this there and see if anyone could relate.

By 9am I was asked to smile for a photo and it was not happening. \n\nA quick trip to the ER, prednisone and valtrex in hand and home I went. I was probably at 50% loss on Monday. I figured getting on meds early would put a freeze on progression. Each day through Thursday got worse though, until I lost it all. Taste on that side of my mouth went as well. \n\nIt is now the following Monday, 7days since the beginning of facial decline, and I am still at 0. Done with meds. Worried this is my new normal. \n\nYesterday I felt a lot of twitching of brows and eye and forehead and was hopeful, but today nothing. I am wondering if twitching was a good sign or just a sign of unused muscles? \n\nI appreciate reading all the posts here and realizing I am not alone. Everyone I talk to shrugs it off and says \u201cyou are 30, you will recover\u201d. Im just a bit down on it today. I was in the same place for a bit. It is scary stuff thinking it might last forever. It happened to me 1 month after my 30th birthday. I got on the meds within 24 hours when it started feeling off and mine also worsened. It actually worsened pretty consistently for 10 days. It was only after I finished the meds that I started feeling something and it wasnt really until day 14 that I was able to get some movement back. After that it happened pretty quickly. It started with tingling and nerve pain on my face with the worse earache ever. \n\nI know it is hard but take some time off work if you can. Rest up, stay hydrated, take some b12 vitamins if you can. You are still early in the process, try not to think too much about the future. Statistically you will be ok but there is no way of knowing that right now so if you can try and just take it one day at a time I had roughly the same progression as you at the start. I am 4 1/2 months in and about 95% recovered. I started getting some motion back at around 2 weeks, steadily getting more and more back until about 6 weeks in, to about 75%. The rest has been slower, and progress is still happening.\n\nJust settle in for a marathon - and hey, it may go way faster for you. I am there in that feeling. \n\nThis is my second time with BP (last was a decade ago). \n\nI am almost two weeks in. No progress at all. Last time it took 4-6 weeks for anything to happen. Hang in there. \n\nIt feels like forever and it is a long time, but it will get better. The twitches are a good sign. Remember that it is a waiting game. The nerves have to heal/grow back and that just takes a while. Do not try to do too much. Those facial exercises might do more harm than good. 32. Diagnosed January 25th 2021. I have had zero progress and have not had movement in the right side of my face since. \n\nWas prescribed Prednisone, been doing exercises, using B12, etc. with no progression. But do not let that discourage you. Since I have been on this subreddit, many people have came as newbies and recovered in no time. You will see some people recover in as little as 10 days, some at a few months and some for much longer. \n\nJust try to stay positive. Get yourself some Systane ointment for sleeping. If you need someone to reach out to, feel free to reach out to me. Just keep in mind that most people recover in a short amount of time - I know at the beginning it can be incredibly overwhelming. Got To stay positive as difficult as it is. I am on day 5, same symptoms you got. Saw my primary care doc today after getting diagnosed at the ER. I love my doc and he decided that it would not hurt to extend the prescription of anti viral for me past the 7 days the ER prescribed. He said he has had good results with his patients where he threw a steady course of anti-viral and most of them see improvement by 30 days. \n\nHe also said to get B12, Vit C and zinc. At least 100% of the daily recommended value. If you have not already tried these, I would say just take them if you can.\n\nMost folks I have spoken to say 14 days before you see any change at all so it is still early days. Physical therapy, vitamins, checking in with your doc to see if your valtrex should be extended could help with this \"forever\" feeling. \n\nCannot say I have been a bout of sunshine but talking to friends, finding out that people I know have been through BP and recovered (all without me knowing) helps a lot with coping. If I may ask are you fully vaccinated? I am. Second dose a month before onset. Yikes.im sorry to hear. I wish you a speedy recovery Can I ask which one you got? Pfizer", "Spoke to soon About a week ago I said I was post BP, then yesterday I woke up with it on the opposite of my face this time. Anyone else been here? People have been known to have this happen.  One person on FB had it on both sides at the same time. Do you mean you had BP only for a week before you got it again, or you made a full recovery after a while and then got it again from the start recently? No I had it for about 3 weeks, In February andMarch. then it came back. And is this year the first time you have ever had it? Is it mild or severe? Thankfully it is mild this time around, last time was pretty intense Do you have a link to a post or thread explaining your previous experience?", "Facial Massage/Exercises for Bell\u2019s\u2014came across this online and thought I would share! (hope it can help someone!) ", "Ear clogged Hi! So I had moderate/mild Bell\u2019s palsy, it is been about two weeks and I am like 90% better. Finally off of steroids today, have not done anything but rest and take medication, you can only tell when I smile it is just slightly crooked. \nHowever, I just woke up and my ear feels slightly clogged. I got Bell\u2019s palsy in the first place from having an ear infection that traveled to my facial nerves so I am probably being paranoid about it? It is not painful or extreme just light clogging feeling. I have had that feeling off and on while having bells. Any advice/tips? \nI JUST went to the doctor yesterday (I also have a popped rib) so I cannot really go back just bc my ear is clogged Hi, glad to hear you are recovering fast. \n\nFor a few days my ear on the affected side feels clogged randomly - each time it only lasts a few seconds though. I am assuming it is muscle spasms inside the ear - eventually it went away. I still get fleeting ringing in one ear sometimes but my doctor told me not to worry.\n\nHowever,I would recommend going to the doctor's again if it lasts. I had to scroll back in my calendar to remember. About 3 weeks after my diagnosis, I am about 90% recovered and I have this clogged feeling in my ear (same side) with a prominent heart beat. About a week after that, I have a painful ear infection that lasts for about a week, but subsides with meds. About a month after that, I still have this pulsing/clogged feeling in my ear, my doctor cannot be bothered to see me, so I see a nurse who does not see anything of note. And that was the last of it.\n\nHere I am, 3 years 4 months later, I am probably 97% recovered, but I still have the same clogged feeling. I guess I just learned to live with it. I have switched doctors recently, so I intend to mention it next time I am in for a check up. Curious to hear if you make any progress. Good luck to you.", "Diagnosed feb 19th  Do not know much about this disease. Was depressed for first few days but I quickly got use to it. I think I rock this eye patch even being two faced lol. Do the mindgrains and neck pain ever go away. I cannot sleep at night as my left neck and back of head hurt so much. Some worst pain ever. Hope you get well soon... I am myself on day 23... maybe 30% recovered now. \n\n&amp;#x200B; Everyone is different. It will most likely lessen in severity, some have it disappear but most have some degree of discomfort when stressed. Heating pads work for a lot of folks. Cannabis does at well if that is something you are able to or wish to try. It only took me about 2 months to get my blink back so I also learned to rock the patch and always carry eye drops. No one can predict the amount of healing but it should get much better than your current state. Try to keep positivity around you like an upbeat playlist or lighthearted tv, stress makes this worse.  You TOTALLY rock that eye patch! .... Its way cuter than mine was :P\n\nI had/have a LOT of pain with mine as well. Mine started with a month long headache prior to the facial paralysis. I have regained facial function (diagnosed early january) but still have bouts of pain from it pop back up. \n\nMy guess is its the nerve healing??? The crazy ass wind we are getting today def irrates the ear and Im in pain today. Also had the headache again super bad last week and got worried thinking the BP was returning.\n\nThe pain WILL go away, once the nerves start to heal. Until then best of luck catching some Zzz's. ", "I do not think we would care as much if BP did not affect the mouth/smiling. I was talking to my sister today about my bells palsy episode and she said to me \"I do not think you would even care if it did not affect your lips/smile\".\n\nAre we all on the same page here or no? I do not think I would give a toss if my smile stayed the same and everything else was paralyzed. \n\nThoughts on this? Lmk \ud83d\udc9e At first I thought the same, but...I have not blinked in 5 months. I just...Want. To. Blink. Definitely agree with you. I miss my old smile!! Hang in there. Mine finally came back around 6-7 months. agree! and my laugh. but it would also nice to blink :) Blinking normally so I did not have to worry about my eye, being able to eat without using my hand to hold my mouth shut, and regaining normal taste was a tiny bit higher on my priorities tbh. Smiling for me is my biggest issue. I have suffered from this problem for years - over 20 years now. I was not diagnosed until about 2 years ago, and by then my doctor said it was too late to really do anything. \n\nI feel happy a lot of the time, but people often think I am sad or depressed. During university I often felt like a social pariah because people would think I was a bit of a downer to be around. It is not fun.\n\nEven starting a new job recently - 100% remote even after covid, and when starting out they asked for a picture of my face with a \"nice smile\", and I cannot do that. I feel awkward and do not want to say anything to people. I feel like it is exhausting having to explain it, so I basically do not.\n\nBut then people often think I am just not a fun person.\n\nI make up for it though with a very dry, deadpan style of humour. I have a theory that this humour was a coping mechanism that kept my sanity over the years. People who actually spend time with me tend to like me and get my humour, but I rarely make a good first impression on people because of this smiling thing.\n\nThe worst thing is I have two young children and there are no nice pics of me smiling with them :-( Oh god, that is so sad to hear! I am so sorry! \n\nHave you tried massaging around your mouth to encourage blood flow? That helped me a ton and had it back in no time! Dont lose hope \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9exxx I have not really tried much. My doctor told me when I spoke to him a couple of years ago that I could try some exercises, so I tried some after googling and youtubing, but I did not really persevere too much.\n\nTo be honest I never knew about bells palsy and hand't really paid much attention to the whole thing for years, except that I knew I could not smile nicely and my mouth could not move much and was always quite small.\n\nI even only mentioned this in passing when I was at the doctors. He told me though it was probably too late to do anything so I just left it. I think I am so used to it that I never really thought about it that much.\n\nMaybe I could try the massaging technique. I should look into it more. I would feel so much better if I had a nice smile. It really sucks when you are in a good mood and feel positive, but everyone around you thinks you are depressing to be around because your face does not reflect how you feel!", "2 months, still no blinking. Could use some encouragement. Hey Bell\u2019s friends, I am almost 2 months into healing, and I would say I am maybe 60-70% recovered. What is weird is I can almost close my eye when I try, but I have very little movement with blinking. Doing facial exercises daily and starting a higher dose b12. Was anyone else also pretty slow to heal? I am starting to feel discouraged :/ I had it in April 2013 and around August I started to see some changes but no real improvement until about October. I developed Synkinesis and I still have some issues but most people cannot tell any difference unless I point it out. Have faith, it gets better! I was in a similar situation. Took three months to  able to blink fully. On my fifth month now and still not 100% back to normal, but it is not really noticable.  \n\nJust remember it can take longer than two months to recover. and you will see improvement. i had BP in 1999 and have only recovered about 85%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit sucks but i ended up living a normal life and still got with chicks. you WILL recover. in the mean time dont forget to love yourself. sending good vibes your way You are absolutely not alone. I am now 5 months in and I have only just recently become able to close my eye.\n\nKeep up the exercises. Apply heat as often as you can. Do not feel down - you are totally on track!\n\nAnd consider getting acupuncture. I would hit a lull, but starting that helped the improvement kick back in. Took me 3 months before I had ANY improvement.  The eyelid came back basically overnight once healing began. Hang in there, it will get better May I ask.. did you take the steroid and antiviral combo prescribed to treat bells? \n\nI was diagnosed feb 13th and now has been a little\nOver 2 and a half weeks and I am almost healed. However mine was very mild to begin with. Some cases are longer than others. 2 months is still very normal! Have you seen any improvement? Facial exercises 1-2 times a day helped me a lot. \n\nAlso, have you looked into acupuncture? I am only 3 weeks into having bells, have seen a lot of improvement in my mouth but not so much my eye....I was at the gp last week, I am having terrible nerve pain headaches, anyways the gp reassured me, she told me if there is any sort of recovery the chances are it will all return to normal eventually! I know of a lady who took a year to recover fully! I was diagnosed with bp(it was mild and i detected it pretty early on) around august or september last year. By october i was already fully heal. Im lucky that it healed completely. Hopefully it does for you too! Just keep taking your meds and with time it will get better! Thank you for sharing! Thank you! I had some acupuncture at the start, but the lady was super pushy. I should find another and give it a shot again. Appreciate the encouragement. I did take the meds, and tried acupuncture 6 times. The lady I saw was pushy and stressed me out, so I stopped going. I have been doing exercises, but not a lot of massage. Good to know I am normal and on track :) It may not be possible for you, however on top of bells palsey I am HSV+ (cold sores) and often times bells palsey is linked to HSV or shingles, flu etc. ...\n\nSo after I finished my meds for the bells palsey I asked my doctor if I could take my antivirals for HSV once daily like normal because I read it helps those with bells and also facial palsy... she said it would not hurt so I also take valcyxlovir now once daily instead of the acyclovir I was required to take 5 times a day for 10 days for the bells. \n\nAnyways just thought I would share some info. Do not overwork your face muscles. Drink lots of water. Remember bells is a swelling issue. Also can take over the counter anti inflammatory meds to help. \n\nIf you have any flu or cold like symptoms. It is possible for antibiotics to help also. Good luck I am almost at 6 months and still not fully blinking.. but seeing small improvements day by day. Some of us heal slower than others. You will be okay! Thank you. It is nice knowing I am not alone :) My eye is definitely healing slower too. My mouth is probably 85% or more back but with some slight drooping still.", "Anything I should know? Yesterday, I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, I could not really react lol\n\nI first thought it my TMJ causing the back ear pain but thought it was strange because it has never happened before. Then I ate mac n cheese and I thought it was that that made my lip and tongue numb. Then my eye would not close fully and now, my face did not want to respond like a text left on open by my brother.\n\nAt first I thought it was a stroke because I heard that drooping was a sign but I got fortunate and instead got half of my face to not move. Thanks body :)))))))))))):(((\n\nIs there anything I should know during this time?\n\n\nI legit can not believe that fricking mac n cheese would do this to me even though it did not. Sounds an awful lot like how mine came on. The tip of my tongue went numb, and I just assumed I had burned it on coffee earlier that day. Stayed like that for several hours and then all of the sudden my lip and cheek and eyelid stopped responding so I went to the ER for stroke. \n\nI am about 18 months out from my diagnosis and I am pretty sure I have stopped healing. Things are mostly back to normal, but I still have severe weakness in my lip and eyebrow.  \n\nBut do not let my story discourage you; most people around here seem to recover fully within a matter of weeks! Keep your chin up, odds are you will be back to normal before you know it. Thank you so much for the response! I am so sorry that happened as well, and it is pretty interesting to read other's stories! I hope we both are able to recover as well :) I also thought I was having a stroke - so I know how scary that can feel!\n\nI noticed when I was watching TV that my right eye was watery, and when I tried to shut it, I could only shut my left (which is very abnormal, since I normally cannot shut my left without my right). Did not think anything of it. Then I went to brush my teeth and noticed when I spit that it all went down my face. Then I smiled in the mirror and knew something was off. Went to the ER later, and they confirmed it was BP. They ran an IV and kept blowing my veins, and it caused my heart to stop at one point. That part was fun.\n\nOne thing that I had that I am not sure others had was my taste being off. I guess my tongue was so numb that the taste buds on my right side were not functioning properly. For the first week, everything I ate tasted sweet. The first food I had was some cheese enchiladas, and I thought someone had pranked me and put sugar on them.\n\nDepending on how bad your eye is, you might wear an eye patch while you shower. It is hard to wash your hair without getting soap in your eye when it will not fully close. Also, lubricating eye drops are great for putting in your eye under an eye patch so that your eye stays moist. I used those, with my eye taped shut, then an eye patch on top to sleep.\n\nMine was 6 years ago, and I would say I recovered 90%, and the 10% is only really noticeable to me. I recovered within 8 weeks. When I smile, I have to focus on making sure both sides are even, and my eyebrow is still off a little when I smile. Everyone says they cannot see it, but I can. Sometimes when I am up really late and have a busy day, I can feel fatigue in that side of my face. I still get a little bit of soap in my eye sometimes when washing my hair - mainly if I am really tired.\n\nTry not to get too discouraged. It can be mentally, emotionally and physically exhausting, but hopefully you will make a full recovery. I am sorry you are going through this - I would not wish it on anyone!\n\nETA: Do not get discouraged if it gets somewhat worse or more noticeable in the next day or two. Mine was a lot worse 2 days after my ER trip than it was on the first day. Oh my gosh woah! That is a whole train ride I am sorry that happened! Especially the IV, that sounds painful to imagine. Hearing about the sweet taste buds is new, I never knew that could happened so I am intrigued, mine became numb and half does not taste much. For the eye, I will definitely try that tonight! I have really really long hair so I will definitely give it a shot. Even being a while ago, I can I see why it would still be visible :( Thank you so much for the response! Going through this sub makes me feel not as much alone. My main concern is laughing since I am a smiley person, my face just looks out of place but it makes me laugh more so I will try my best to not let it get to me emotionally:) Wow, sounds a lot like what I went through. I had neck, head (not like a headache but pain) and an ear ache. I made an appointment with the doctor just to get it checked out (was not too worried at the time). A day later my tongue was weird (thought maybe an allergic reaction) and the next day my left eye did not blink well. I called the ER to speak to a nurse and then ended up going in and sure enough Bells Palsy. They started me on steroids and an anti viral med quickly. I followed up with my doctor and it is been 24 days since diagnosed and I can regained about 95% of movement. Catching it early really helped. Eye drops and taping your eye at night will help and massaging your face will help as well. You will have to physically close your mouth with your hands to rinse after brushing your teeth. LOL It was too funny to learn the hard way. :) Good luck on your recovery!! Very similar to how mine came on! Started with bad ulcers on my tongue. Then about 6 days later, I was brushing my teeth in the morning and got a bad muscle cramp under my jaw. Thought I had just opened my mouth too far or something. Several hours later, I was laughing and talking with family, and I thought my face felt weird and like it was not moving. Realized my smile was slightly crooked and I could not squeeze my right eye tightly. Freaked out, had a panic attack, had to lay down and listen to my family try to convince me it was not a stroke (since I was not having any other symptoms) and I would be okay. Went to see my GP and got diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy. She put me on prednisone and valacyclovir, and said I should recover in around 3 weeks hopefully. I am on day 7 today, and have made progress with my smile. Eye is still very wonky though. It blinks so slowly and does not fully close. Gets water and soap in it in the shower, and I have to hold it shut. Do not be surprised if things taste bitter or your hearing is off (the facial nerve is responsible for the front 2/3 of your taste buds as well as a muscle of the middle ear). Also you might get pain right behind your ear, as that is where the nerve is swelling. Make sure you get steroids within 72 hours of onset if you can. It is really helped me to take progression photos daily and look at the progress, because sometimes it feels like I am not getting better. The photos help me focus on the little steps. Hang in there!! 85% of people recover fully. Also, I have had bad insomnia since starting the prednisone. Do not be surprised if that happens, I guess it is a common side effect. Oh my gosh, maybe we are the same person XD And 24 days is so quick I heard! Glad you were able to recover most of the movement :). And yeah, I was able to catch it on the 2nd day so I went to go to my doctor and he prescribed me prednisone but since closing my lips is a problem, I have to use my mouth to put over my hand* to sallow the pills XD. And this is such awesome tips, these will really help, thank you so much! :) OK, first off, you are ill, so make sure to rest as much as you can! \nIf your eye will not close, its very important to keep it moisturised, you can get a thick ointment from pharmacy/doctor. Personally I found taping my eye closed was awful, so I used a soft sleep mask at night and lots of eye lube!\nI had severe pain in my face, the only relief I found for that, was warmth!  Like from a warm wheaty bag or warm hot water bottle. \nDo expect symptoms to look worse after a few days. Take photos so you can see any improvements. \n Vitamin B12 sub lingually (under the tongue) is supposed to work wonders, I found this out too late to have an impact. \nDrinking through a straw helps reduce dribbling, and pressing on your affected side of mouth helps with pronouncing difficult words!\nGood luck! Try to remember that the vast majority of people recover fully and quickly, and there are huge improvements in medical care these days to help you recover funcionality if your recovery is slower. \nHope you are better soon That sounded painful with ulcers and the bad muscle jaw cramp! I feel you on the cramps, they hurt like a bee. I was also as well laughing with my family with my face not being able to move but since it was progressively getting worse, I was thinking of if I also was having a stroke, thank goodness we both did not! Now when I laugh, I look like I was really sad on one side but the other side completely disagrees! 3 weeks I have heard is a pretty sure time as well and I hope that you recover good and well, 7 days sounds hard and I am just on my 3rd, props to you!1!1! I have heard about showering and I never really though of it until yesterday, I just completely gave up and ended up using a towel on my head stuffing my hair instead since I do not have any eyepatches or tape which I got shortly later. I have also just picked up the prednisone and some other med (I have to go check) and I do not know if it is my bad sleep schedule or insomnia since sleeping has been difficult for me these past weeks. I am happy to hear about your progression! I love hearing about people's stories and roads down the path, thank you for sharing and the helpful tips/ideas! :D Woah, this is new information for me! Ice heard able tapping my eye lid but I got a sleeping mask a few hours ago since I am pretty sure tape is not going to do the thing for me! I will try to get as much sleep, school is starting soon (~2 weeks) and as a high schooler, I think sleep is my most concern XD. Drinking from a straw is pretty smart, Im going to go buy some in the morning to try this out. Pressing the cheek is really interesting because I was having trouble pronouncing a few words (like B's), that is a really inI never knew that!! And I will keep strong, sometimes throughout the day I would think \"maybe this is not really\" then drool my water all over the floor so thank you so much for the words! Ahh man, as a high schooler,  its probably going to be tough for you going into school, if you are not 100% recovered. I would suggest getting a few good mates to walk into class with you for support, after a few days you will be fine. \n\nMake sure to get proper eye gel from the pharmacist or doctor as it needs to be sterile. Eye care is incredibly important, you do not want to damage it by letting it get dry. The artificial tears they give out are useless, you will need a gel/ ointment. \n\nPlease take care, let us know how you get on! For sure I will keep you updated! Everything I ate tasted like I had pennies in my mouth in the beginning, it was really disgusting. My doctor that it possible might affect my taste buds but I cannot taste half of the things I ate or feel my tongue. Im concerned if that happens \ud83d\ude1f Hello, I am currently a nursing student from west coast university. I will be providing you some information upon Bells Palsy. Facial characteristics of bells palsy include the inability to wrinkle brows, drooping of the eyelid to close eyes, drooping mouth, inability to smile or pucker. Bell's palsy affects both women and men equally and the peak age is 15 to 60 years of age. This is often with pregnancy, hypertension, and upper respiratory hypertension. Recovery is 2 weeks to 6months. 50 to 60% have pain behind the ear and neck. Management would include protecting the affected eye, sling support, protect your face from the cold due to extreme sensitivity and pain, pain management. Treatment consist of corticosteroids, antivirals, full recovery by most patients in 6 months especially treatment is started immediately. Just as a reminder please consult your doctor for further information because I am not a professional. I hope this information helps you get more of an understanding.\n\nHolman, H.

I am prone to ear infections so I figured it was that and booked an appointment with a doctor. Fortunately yesterday right before going to the doctor I noticed I could not pull a straight smile. Immediately I knew it was likely Bell's as I had a friend in high school who had it. Went to the doctor and he put me on prednisone and an antiviral. After checking my ears he determined it was not at all ear related. My case seems to not be as bad as some I have heard. Winking my right eye is tough but I can barely do it and I have no trouble closing them both at the same time. My right brow also has 80% or so of its normal movement. I currently look no different while I am resting but I am reading it may get worse before it gets better. I frequently have health anxiety but having a diagnosis and reading posts from this community has helped a lot and I am looking on the bright side and am confident I will recover from this. I will attempt to document my progress for those also with this condition. So far the worst part has actually been the headaches and the upset stomach from the antivirals. Look on the bright side.. could have been worse (at least the way it was explained to me while sitting in ER waiting for results of my CT and MRI).. at least its probably not a tumor or a stroke ;)\n\nim almost 9 months post diagnosis for BP on BOTH sides of my face. it gets worse before it gets better but you will improve. The hard part to me is dealing with all the little inconveniences that come with BP: Not being able to close your eyes... close your mouth when you eat/drink... muscle twitches, that annoying behind the ear pain that lasted me WEEKS.. synkinesis... crocodile tears... food randomly falling out of your mouth when you eat...

The pain in my ear, down my jaw to my neck suddenly got far worse. I did not sleep at all.  It just kept getting worse and worse.  I was able to work all day Monday and yesterday which was not the case last week. So I really thought there was improvement. Right now I feel as bad as I have since it hit me. Everyone reaxts different. Although the pain is normal your first 48 hours will be your worse as far as symptoms. Take some Advil if it really hurts. Were you on steriods and/or did you just come off them? Yes. 48 hours ago I stopped. I thought that might be it. What you describe sounds exactly what I went through 24-48 hours after stopping steriods. Could be that? Take it easy and rest up!", "Diagnosed with Bells Palsy I got diagnosed with bells palsy 14 days ago and finished my 10 day prednisolon 50mg a day medication. \n\nAfter i have finished prednisolon, i started to get more headache and neck/ear pain. Is this something that is normal after the meds are done? I asked my doctor but he doesnt see any link with prednisolon. I have the same thing. I got BP about 12 days ago and just finished my meds. Some days, the head/ear hurts, some days, it does not. This happened to me. I suspected it was rebound inflammation. Same thing here. It went away after a few days, use warm compresses to help relieve the pain. I personally experienced no pain with my BP (save one 2-hour bout with some severe aching on that side...not sure it was BP related or not) and I have had it for over 4 months.\n\nThat being said, I have seen many people mention here that THEY DID experience pain.  \n\nEverybody reacts and heals differently, basically. But pain is not uncommon. Same here I have now had a couple of days with no real head pain and my face seems to be recovering at about 1-2% a day over the past week. \ud83e\udd1e Good to hear! \nMy earpain keeps coming back every minute with a pulse of short pain. \n\nOn the positive side i can almost blink my affected side completely!", "Judt got diagnosed with Bell's Palsy So, last Saturday I noticed I was tearing up way too much, I have a stressful freelance job right now, so I assumed it was due to stress. Sunday I noticed difficulty closing my right eye, subtle lack of taste on that side, and my lip going down, and inflamation of the side affected. I let days go by until Wednesday thinking it would fix itself (kind of dumb), and then on Wednesday I finally got to see a doctor, he told me it was most likely Bell's Palsy. He prescribed me acyclovir, prednisone, omeprazol, and eye drops. For the few things I have read over the last couple of days it seems like is result of some viral infection and related. I have got to ask cause I am new to this:\n\n1.- What kind of medication did you got to treat it? Did it help? Did you complement any other medication or treatment you found more helpful?\n2.- How long from where you noticed the symptoms to where you went looking for medical advice?\n3.- How long did it took you to recover?\n\nSorry if I come out a little obnixious, but I am new to this sub, and I am curious about what can I do or could have done to treat it and recover the best way possible. Thanks again:) Hi!\n\n1.- What kind of medication did you got to treat it?\n\nSame medication as you! \n\nDid it help? Did you complement any other medication or treatment you found more helpful? \n\nGood question. I have not tried any other medication or treatment apart from speech therapy and regular massage. But I am also only 4 weeks in, and have had only small improvements so far.\n\n2.- How long from where you noticed the symptoms to where you went looking for medical advice?\n\nI was also very stressed and noticed very sharp ear pain. I am used to issues with my ear but this pain was different. However, I did not have time to go to the ENT. Then around a few days later, I woke up with half of my face paralysed and went straight to hospital. \n\n 3.- How long did it took you to recover?\n\nI am still recovering, 4 weeks later. Only have had very small improvements so far (can raise the corner of my mouth a little bit, and also small movements on my eyebrow) But I also have a moderately severe case, so maybe recovery is quicker for you! What I would recommend is stress reduction and patience.\n\nGet well soon! :) I think most of us were prescribed the same medication so be sure to take it when needed! My doctors did not give me any refills they said the steroids are mostly to calm down the inflammation. My experience with the meds was it made me a bit groggy &amp; slow. My ear on the impacted side was also super sensitive to noise so I recommend ear plugs if the same happens to you. I also had extreme pain the first 2 weeks of being diagnosed, I would relate the pain to a migraine. It was a constant sharp pain that also made it really difficult to sleep so get some extra strength ibuprofen. It might not work but better to have it than not. It is still good that you did not wait too long before getting it checked out. Unfortunately besides the medications I was told to just hope for the best but I researched just about every remedy &amp; have been keeping up with those too. Lysine, b12, antioxidant foods, acupuncture, cbd oil (after you are done taking steroids) &amp; daily facial massages get a face roller if you do not have one it will really help!!!\n\nIt is been about 6 weeks since I have been diagnosed, I am not fully 100% like 50% of the way healed but I have noticed some change. This is really hard &amp; everyone heals differently so do not be discouraged. This sub has been super helpful for me so you are not alone!", "Pfizer - 2nd Shot It has been over two months I took the first shot and started to develop BP only a few hours later. I still had no signs of improvement and I am taking my second shot tomorrow. \n\nSome doctors in my country recommended people who had major and rare side effects to take antihistaminics for two days prior the vaccine. I know it has nothing to do with BP but I decided to try anyways. I also bought Prednisolone and I will be taking it at any minor sign of BP on my unaffected side or in case the affected side gets worse.\n\nI will report the results in a few days. I honestly cannot imagine the two things are related. I am not going to say anything definitively, but it is very unlikely. I had Moderna and developed BP a few months after the second dose. Never had it before. \n\nI do not know if they are related or not. I read some info suggesting there might be a correlation but it sounds pretty inconclusive. \n\n\n\nLuckily for me, my BP went away after like two weeks. In some cases, yes, they are. I never had any symptoms of BP in my entire life. I woke up that morning and my face was completely normal. It was the last time I ate and brushed my teeth normally. 5 hours after the vaccine I could no longer move my lips to the left.\nI am not anti-vaccine but it IS a possible side effect. Even Pfizer confirmed it to me when I emailed them. I developed it hours after my first shot, so it was definitely related. I had absolutely nothing until that morning. Most of us have never had symptoms of Bell's palsy until it happened. That is not particularly unique. It is still very unlikely it was the vaccine. In this case taking the second shot should not be an option People just randomly develop BP? How do you feel about the cdc saying vaccines never produce any side effects after the first few weeks?", "Can anyone help or give advice So I got bell palsy in August and I was put on medication and recovered for the most part but lately I noticed that same shoulder that was hurting  back then. Is now hurting again not as painful and my left side of my face has been I would say twitching I mean the muscles so I go see a doctor again for this?", "This blows Two nights ago after sending daily messages to my Kaiser Dr telling him I have got a huge lump in my jaw The lump went away and it felt like an ear infection had a baby with a tooth infection I had a headache and low and behold facial Paralysis it scared me so bad I thought I had an early life stroke. I cried all the way to the ER With my husband holding back tears. We  had just two years before I took my mother through hospice after her stroke. The ER dr looked at me and diagnosed me with no tests. He put me on steroids And an antibiotic. Now i have to fight to see my primary care dr. I cant sleep, i am still in pain, migraines that shoot down to my shoulder and no answers. Any clues what to so to self advocate for this?! Hey there! I know this Bell\u2019s palsy thing is very scary and it is normal to stress and want to do anything and everything to get better the fastest possible. \n\nWith that said I think it is important to stop, breathe, and slow down. The facts are that 85% of people recover in 3 weeks. The vast majority of  people on this subreddit recover. Second, you got diagnosed early and you got the right meds! The steroids are the most important ones. And I suspect you meant anti virals not anti biotics. Also early diagnosis is very helpful!! Finally, your primary care physician will likely not be much more help. I have had it twice and the first time I went to urgent care when I got diagnosed. I had a follow up with my primary and she confirmed I got the right meds then said if you do not see improvement in 3 months let her know. Maybe. Your primary is different but from what it sounds like you are in the best possible recovery scenario!!!\n\nMy recommendation is to try and rest and relax a little bit. Take some time off of work and try not to go down the rabbit hole of thinking thinking that you are in the very small percentage that will not recover. Chances are that you will. \n\nAlso do some research. Knowledge is power but here is what I know:\n-bells palsy is caused by the inflammation of the 7th cranial nerve\n-the cause is unknown but it is believed to be caused by a dormant virus, similar to how shingles works. Could be chicken pox or herpes virus that could cause this. \n-it is going to get worse before it gets better. Even though you got started on meds early\n-acetaminophen is the pain killer to use when you are taking the steroids to avoid peptic ulcers. \n-a hot compress helps with the facial nerve pain\n-look into purchasing an eye patch, eye drops, and/or tape to keep your eye moist. There is a chance you will not be able to close your eye at some point. \n\n-do not force your face to move!!! It can cause synkensis.  Which can cause unintended twitching after you recover. \n\nFinally if you need someone to talk to feel free to DM! I have been through this twice. It is scary AF and this subreddit helped me through it. First of all, please do not stress out. Relax. It is going to be alright. You have got your meds. You need rest. And for now, if you have work, take some time off - it is best to take time off because I doubt whether anyone can work with all that pain and being on medication does not help.\n\nSecond, so sorry to hear how traumatic it was going to the ER. But you have got your medicines, and after a bit, slowly start doing facial exercises. Massages help with the pain too. Please check online for different types of exercises and massages. Also, sleep well. Take a nap in the afternoons too if you can. And I agree to the fact that any doctor would say to wait it out at least 3 months and check for improvement. \n\nDo not worry. We are all here. You need any help, this sub is always there. Take care :) Thank you so much! Thank you! I have got KP and was diagnosed with BP last year. I have some thoughts. \n\nMessaging your doctor is great for non-urgent communications, but a bad for \u201cI have got this immediate problem\u201d. In my experience Primary Care Physicians do occasional cover weekend appointments for \u201curgent\u201d appointments, shifting there days off during the week, so it can take several days (in some cases) to get a response. In the future: start with a call to the advice nurse so you can get an appointment with a doctor quickly. \n\nIf there was concern that you had a stroke, they would have given you an MRI. The ear pain and paralysis are fairly strong indicators for BP, so unless you had something else, not given you an MRI is not surprising. \n\nDo go get acupuncture outside of KP as soon as possible. This should help with the pain and may help (it helped me) with the paralysis, with very little risk.  Also, get yourself an eye patch and eye drops, if you do not have them. \n\nI would recommend that as soon as the initial meds are done, ask your PCP about physical therapy.  I waited and wish I started sooner. Bell's palsy has nothing to do with lumps or migraines that shoot down the shoulder. The biggest issue is not being able to blink because of facial paralysis which makes your eyes unbelievably dry and it feels like there is intense pressure in your eye. \n\nSometimes a tumor or other growth can impinge the 7th cranial nerve and create bell's like symptoms, but I doubt a lump in your jaw could cause the type of full side facial paralysis of bell's. I cant blink and have face paralysis also. We are looking at Ramsay hunt syndrome its bells palsy symptoms\nWith extreme ear pain and dizziness", "recently diagnosed but have a question so about 3-4 days before i was diagnosed i felt my tongue almost lose feeling and things tasted odd i am not sure if that is common or anyone has experienced it and i did not go to the er until i noticed i could not really move my mouth or blink properly anymore which got worse throughout the day . how long would my recovery be? it is not that bad as of now but does it get worse or better", "Recovery Hey guys so I am 8 days in since being diagnosed but lately I have been experiencing a lot of pain on my affected side. Did anyone experience the same thing? Or should I be concern? I had really bad aching on my BP side for a couple of hours one night while sleeping. Other than that, I have never really experienced much/any pain from BP.  Might be worth talking to your Dr. about. It is more of a soreness feeling around the jaw and eye area I was diagnosed Saturday and I have the same pain. I read online that ibuprofen can help but I have not taken any because I am pregnant. Yes...had a ton of dull aching pain for a few days. I took 800mg of Ibuprofen for an extended period time, which made it bearable.\n\nI found relaxing/napping in a dark room helped a lot too.\n\nHope you feel better. I had the jaw pain I had really bad pain the whole time! I took muscle relaxers and used medicated ointment which I found helped a bit with pain management but not 100%. I found acupuncture and chiropractic helped the most with pain.\n\nOnce you are to the point of being able to smile again you will find that your cheek muscles will hurt a lot from smiling but I found that gritting through the pain and staying smiling as much as I could or moving my lips around as much as I could when they became mobile helped a lot with healing I have felt like a bruised peach for the two months I have had BP. Definitely less painful now than before. 50% recovered now. It gets better.. slowly.. My affected side was a bit sore when I touched it. I had it terrible for a while. Dr told me it is my nerves waking back up. Gave me gabapenton have no idea how to spell it lol but it is a nerve pain killer. It helped. Eventually it will go away. Am into for a month now and I was getting pain around my left ear in the first week and a half, not having it now. Was not taking any medication for the aches.", "Did Birth Control affect anyone? Hey amigos. I am at the 2 and a half year mark withhhhh not so much recovery. My Neruo gave up on me and so did my Oncologist but that is another story for a different day. \n\nWord on the inter webs is that pregnancy can trigger BP to occur in women. I have never been pregnant so that is not a cause for me, however, for those of you like me, with no kids and on birth control (or getting on birth control in my case), how did it affect your palsy? Was there any improvement or did things get worse or no change? I will have this talk with my doctor at the appointment as well, but its nice to hear other people's experiences too. ", "3 years I was diagnosed July 1, 2018. I am at 80% recovery, Neurologist says that is about as good as I can expect. \nLeft side of face (eye, mouth etc) partially paralyzed. Much better than the initial year. That is awesome! I am a little over 2 years out and probably 80% as well. I had some plastic surgery last fall to help with symmetry as well. Can I ask what surgery you had done? I am 8 months out and only about 30% recovered? I have gotten Botox for symmetry I had a one sided brow lift. My forehead on my bad side has zero recovery and my doctor said that part of my nerve is completely dead. So they went in and lifted the brow on the bad side so that it was not sagging and was more symmetrical at neutral. Jan 1st 2015, I am in the same boat as you actually . but I am right side. Id rather get it again and take the chance so I could possibly recover How was your doctor able to determine the nerve was completely dead? Absolutely zero change since the BP hit while the lower half of my face had a slow and consistent recovery. It had been 1.5 years by the time I had the surgery.", "My wife was diagnosed 1.5 months ago. Hi all, just wanted to chime in here.  Out of the blue, my wife was diagnosed almost two months ago, and after prednisone, accupuncture, CBD and multiple neurologist visits she has not seen much improvement. \n\nI want to help support her, I think she is beautiful,  and I have told her half a smile is better than no smile.  I also think its kind of like a cute Natalie Dormer smirk.  \n\nStill.  She is devastated. Lots of tears at night.  Anything you all think I can do to help her through this? Make her takes b12 and lysine  Does she need the B12 shots?  She is taking a B Complex now. I have hear B12 shot is more effective I had bp on 25 feb started taking b12 ,multi and lysine 2 week after and i started getting movement back 1 week afterward its been 4 week and im 80% recovered  Has she noticed any improvement at all? Or absolutely nothing? Does her eyebrow move or cheeks somewhat when she cracks a smile? I am along the same timeline 1.5 months.  Nothing.   She feels twitching sometimes. When she eats try not to look at her. Looking at people as you talk to them is normal so fight that urge. Also if possible sit on the opposite side of her effected face area, example, if the left side of her face is effected then sit on her right. Next to her if possible so you are not sitting across from her staring at her.\n\nAlso, as a joke and to break the tention say something like \"smile with both sides of your face if you DONT want to do the dishes tonight\", then chase her and tickle her It is quite early.  A friend of mine did not notice any sort of improvement until 4 months then it slowly came back. Be very positive and supportive with her. She will be okay. She is really down right now but she will be alright.  I am sure 1.5 months feels like an eternity, but she is still within the window to see improvement. The most important thing for her to focus on right now is eye care. Most likely the Bells will get better but any damage done to her eye during this time could be permanent. When she gets closer to the 3 month mark if she still is not seeing any changes then she  could look into an ENT referral. \n\nAs for her emotional well-being, just keep being supportive. Figure out the foods that are easier for her to eat (I stick to soft foods) and stock up. I found it easier to drink through straws. If she is self conscious about it, do not push her to eat in public.  It took me a long time to even feel comfortable having extended face to face conversations with people. \n\nShe just needs more time.  3 years and not anywhere close to recovered. Spent 4 months in Physical Therapy 3-4 days a week to learn to blink, eat, and drink again. \n\nThe only thing that is helped me, is u/Powered_By_JetA telling me time and time again that its this current smile he fell in love with and the only one he is ever known. He is always so sincere about it. The fact that he accepted me before I accepted myself, then pushed me to regain confidence and try new social things is what helped. He helped me rebuild my confidence despite the fact I have no chance in recovery to full motion again.  You are so sweet. I am 9 days out and my husband tells me the same thing, that I am still beautiful, but honestly it does not make me feel better at all. I am not sure there is anything be could say or do that would...he did bring him an article he read about BP, something about a bodybuilder who had it, it made me feel good that he had done some reading in his own about it, instead of me just telling him what I have been discovering.", "Progression So looking back this week. On Wednesday I accidentally bit the left side of my tongue but shrugged it off, Friday afternoon I had trouble whistling shrugged that off as well. But Friday evening during a conversation I noticed I slightly struggled enunciating a couple words. Saturday morning is when I struggled closing my eye, could not smile properly and realized I had BP. Should I expect for them to worsen in the next few days? Usually it gets worse before it gets better. My doc days days 5-7 are the worst but I am on my second episode of bp and I did not see any improvement until day 14. Others last months before they see any improvement. for me the doctors told me I was lucky to have caught it early and to expect it to bounce back in a couple days, but despite doing everything as instructed mine continued to get as worse as possible (no movement whatsoever on that side) before it got better. how long has the recovery taken? did both occurrences last just as long as the other Im only 10 days so idk if I will improve faster this time around. Mine took about a month and a half, but I did not do \"all the right things.\" The thing I regret the most is that I did not take any time off from work which was continuing to stress me out. Day 19 and finally starting to see some changes. How are you doing?", "I think I have mild bell's palsy since 3 days it is feels like it is slowly getting worse what are the precautions I should take to cure it soon. Does anyone going through bell's palsy feel like half of their tongue is numb? In my case I have a little problem while eating and the bell's palsy is not noticeable till it is observed very carefully? Anyone else had gone through a mild one like this? How long does it take to go away? How should I take care of it? Go to the doctor and get a definite diagnosis. You need to be on anti-virals and steroids as soon as possible. I would say mine was mild, though definitely noticeable and not as mild as what you are experiencing. Half of my tongue was definitely numb at times, and my taste buds were really off (i.e. - salty stuff had a sweet aftertaste, it was weird). I first noticed mine from my tongue feeling weird when brushing my teeth.\n\nDefinitely go get checked out asap. Your doctor will want to get you on a steroid and possibly an anti-viral. If it is caused by a viral infection (Herpes simplex - same as chickenpox/shingles), the anti-viral could make it go away quicker, but do not expect it to be gone in a few days. Mine lasted about 6 weeks. I am sorry you are going through this - it is an awful feeling. other than anti virals and steroids? time. just.. time. You need to go to the doctor ASAP to get both anti virals as well as steroids. I recommend taking some time off work/school and just relaxing, maybe treat yourself to a body massage. Make sure you get plenty of sleep and eat good and healthy. I have been recovered for over a year but sometimes my face feels twitchy when I am tired or have not eaten in a really long time. Is there a chance it would go away with time? have you experienced it without treatment? how long did it take to go away? It absolutely will not just go away with time. im about 4 months post diagnosis with BP on both sides of my face. All i have done is the \"standard\" 7 day regimine of prednisone and an anti-viral (cannot remember the name)  and some vitamin E. Other than that, i have not done any acupuncture or physical therapy (outside of massaging my own face every now and then)  or whatever else anyone else is doing and i have regained about 50% movement. \n\nso yes, i am slowly recovering with time.

Anyone experienced this?", "Before &amp; after pictures. 3 weeks in between.  Hello. I am an acupuncturist and have treated many BP patients. This patient was generous enough to let me take and publish progress pictures of him. This patient has only improved about 80%. He will continue to get treated until he is 100% or close to it as possible. \n\nThis is what I tell everyone coming in for BP treatment. 1. If it has not been 10 days since it started, it may get worse. \n2. The sooner you start acupuncture &amp; herbal medicine treatment, the faster the recovery time will be. \n3. More than likely you will get better on your own. But it may take longer. There is also a chance that it may not go away completely. \n4.

Do not know if it is because my eye does not shut properly and it is messing with my vision and forcing blinks. :( In the early stages I was getting severe headaches, particularly in the evening.

That sucks. I would say yes, though. Nerve damage is not necessarily a simple \"feel everything\" vs \"feel nothing\" deal as far as I know. There might be some signals still transmitting. I know I get little twitches in muscles I currently cannot move. is there hope for healing? it burns everyday goes numb then starts signaling Do you have any idea what the underlying problem is?\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that BP and trigeminal neuralgia are very different and if this REALLY REALLY hurts, it might be worth trying to rule out TN. yes TN.. my results said tn thanks to my shit filler doctor.. ruined my whole entire life Sounds like neuralgia, you should see a neurologist. Ah hell, that sucks bigtime. Hey- this sounds like something I have been diagnosed with-- Trigeminal Neuralgia. There is a subreddit for that as well that might be helpful but there are more active support groups on Facebook. If you can, talk to a doctor about it (they may not know much about it though unfortunately) and ask for them to refer you to a neurologist.

It was mild &amp; I could feel it more than I could see it. Since the facial weakness did not get better or worse, I finally went to urgent care on 1/8 but could not be seen bc they do not deal w facial weakness so I got sent to the er. The er Dr said I must have a mild case of BP possibly brought on by covid and gave me prednisone. Due to having no other symptoms besides the facial weakness they did not do any scans but now I kind of wish they did because I am super anxious about having a stroke. But it is been nearly a week since my weakness started so I am thinking that is probably not the case? \n\nHas anyone else been diagnosed without scans? My anxiety will not let me accept the fact that if the doctor suspected something more urgent, he would have ran more tests.", "Do I have Bell\u2019s palsy? A year or two ago I wanted to have a smirk smile for whatever reason, so I almost trained the right side of my mouth to smile while my left side did not do much. No I find myself talking and smiling with primarily the right side of my mouth. How do I fix this? I do it unconsciously. can you even move the left side of your mouth if you tried? if not, you should probably go to the doc to check for BP. I easily can.

I went to the ER and they gave me the normal steroid and antivirals and sent me home. \n\nNow 5 days later and I am even worse - the worst I have ever been.

No improvement until  Day 14", "Tenn. nurse gets Bell's Palsy days after getting COVID vaccination. ", "More than a week with BP and I am putting on weight. Is it okay to workout when you have BP? Lifting weights? Prednisone has made me really hungry and I have put on weight ever since I started taking them. Could workouts affect my healing rate? I think I am about 25-30% healed at this point and I have been on physical therapy everyday. If you are body feels up for it, I think doing some light gym work is ok. Maybe even a light version of what your workout normally is. \n\nI would not go crazy at the gym if it is not what you normally do. \n\nBtw if you are still on prednisone.

It gets sore after awhile but I feel my eye and corner of the mouth constantly drawing back. Instead of drooping it is drawing up. Yaaaay /s", "In the early days still I was diagnosed just yesterday and I did manage to catch this early as I keep getting less and less muscle control on the affected side of my face.    \n\n\nMy problem is my affected eye.  I cannot keep it moist enough and it is really bothering me.  At this point I am already considering just taping it closed and wearing a patch all day.  Opinions on this option and maybe some recommendations for better eye moisture maintenance?  \n\n\nI am currently using Genteal drops constantly.    \n\n\nThanks for the advice and yes, this thing sucks.", "Do you guys think that bell\u2019s palsy comes from stress or is that just a myth?  I think so. My Lyme test was negative, and my Moderna shot was 6 months prior to getting BP. So I ruled those out. \n\nI know loads of things can cause BP, but I can tell you I am under a tremendous amount of stress with a couple serious family matters. \n\nI do not know about you, but I always get sick easier when I am super stressed - I do not take care of myself etc\u2026 \n\nSo I am going with stress for me. \n\nAlso, happy cake day! I believe stress is a factor. Mine hit less than a month after my father passed away. I was dealing with the funeral, family, unexpected financial hits, and city bureaucrats that answered every question with \"Get a lawyer\". My diagnosis happened when I was experiencing tremendous amount of stress. Prior to and following onset did not experience a cold, flu, HSV, or zoster infection. Which is thought to be the culprit as I understand. Stress does weaken the immune system. Who knows. Stress can impair your immune system, which could make it easier for you to get it. So it can contribute.  It is not a direct cause, but it does not help things. do anyone know the direct cause? Nerve damage.  Usually, although not always, caused by a virus already in your body having a flare up.   Some viruses once you get them never truly leave.  Examples of this kind of virus are oral herpes (cold sores), chicken pox, mono, etc.  So as long as you stay stress free it will not happen to you? No.  Stress can make it more likely to happen, because your immune system is less effective when stressed, making a flare up of those viruses more likely.  But it can happen anyway.  It is not really a preventable condition.\n\nThat said, if you can avoid stress do so, because it will help a lot of other areas of your life as well. I was experiencing some of the highest stress of my life at the time of onset, so I believe it. So does the virus that caused this to happen stay in your system forever? Yes.  Many viruses stay in your system forever.  For example shingles is just chicken pox that reactivates in your old age.  That does not mean it will be a continual problem-  most people with Bell's will get only a single attack in their lifetimes. Weird thing is I have never had chicken pox or a cold sore in my life so getting bell\u2019s palsy was such a shock to me I strongly believe there is a link with stress, I was going through a very stressful period in my life, it all seemed to accumulate. Then I got struck with BP.", "Recovered but getting twitches? Hello folks! I had BP back in February and as far as I can tell, made a full recovery. However the last could of days, I have been getting odd twitches in the eye of the affected side, and wondered if it was connected to the BP. If so, is there anything to worry about, or anything I can do other than monitor it? I have the same thing going on. From what I have gathered, there is a couple of things going on. Basically not all of your facial muscles have recovered, just enough to give you facial range of motion back. So the muscles that are working are basically going in to overtime and occasionally get overloaded and twitch. For me it was the worst right before bed. Also caffeine and stress seemed to trigger it as well. Try practicing relaxing your expression, facial massage, and avoiding stimulants.", "Tried some acupuncture! Okay so it is only been one appointment but I am already able to fully close my eye hours after the first acupuncture appointment. I do not think it is coincidental considering my eye has been feeling suuuuuper weak lately. Also, I am able to drink from a plastic cup better, but still not from a bottle. \n\nThe needles going in did not hurt at all, but holy crap the pain I felt when my acupuncturist manipulates the needles in my face and massages out the knots I have in my jaw. \n\nShe says my anxiety could have to do with the massive knots I have in both sides of my jaw, as well as the terrible knots at my back. I need to reign in the anxiety to really help my face. I might need to start back on my anti-depressants/anxiety meds to help relax and be less tense. Also thinking of taking up kickboxing, I could do to lose a ton of weight lol. \n\nIf you have not tried it, I recommend it! She warned me I might feel overwhelmed and a rush of emotion and I was skeptical but I ended up bawling my eyes out for no reason, soooo I am a little less skeptical now! \n\nKeep your heads up lovelies!! It gets better \ud83d\udc9b I have done acupuncture about 12 times now and have also tried wet and dry cupping! I think it is all helped a lot although, it is hard to tell what is actually making a difference when you are trying so many different things! I notice a lot of tingling after the acupuncture and really feel like it gets things moving in there! \n\nSide note\u2014just started taking elderberry syrup the other day (known for its antiviral properties). I noticed some tingling and movement from this as well...again, could be a coincidence, or something else but I would recommend trying it!

Yesterday was really bad but it seemed to have gotten a tiny bit better today.\n\nI wanted to see if this is just a side effect of BP and if other people also experienced it? Is there anything you did that seemed to help? I definitely, in my experience, did not have it with the BP but rather with the meds. The steroids are pretty strong and have a lot of side effects but if it keeps getting intense, I recommend contacting your doctor once again since it might be something more serious.", "Just diagnosed, but not sure it is BP. This morning, I (26F) woke up and my eyelid and left temple were swollen (portion on my eyelid looks like a bug bite). My left temple and above my eyebrow curve out, a bit like your classic Alien face. I have pressure in both my left and right temples, especially when bending over, and headaches/slight pain behind both eyes but more on the left. Also, a low-grade fever of about 99.7 combined with some nausea the past few days, some sensitivity to sunlight, and ringing in both ears.\n\nI seem to have full mobility of my facial muscles, although chewing feels a bit weird. I cannot see any drooping, just swelling. My left cheek is very slightly softer than the right. Looking at photos of me yesterday I can see some slight swelling on my left temple then as well.\n\nThe doctor just looked at me and felt my face and said it was early Bells Palsy. She prescribed prednisone and sent me on my way. Without any noticeable facial paralysis, does this sound right? Is this all normal with early Bells Palsy? Should I get a second opinion, and also ask for anti-virals? If it is BP, I want to avoid it progressing further. Any advice would be extremely helpful! I have never heard of visible swelling being a symptom of Bell's Palsy, but I am also not a doctor. Thank you! That helped me feel less crazy getting a second opinion from a different doctor (who also asked for an opinion from a veteran third doctor). Both thought the Bell\u2019s Palsy  diagnosis was very unlikely based on the swelling. I definitely would get a second opinion. I had none of those symptoms with BP Thank you! I got a second opinion and it is probably some sort of infection, not BP. Not sure how the first doctor was so far off. Thank god you got it figured out...do not want to mess around with an infection!!  hope it goes away soon!", "Do facial exercises help after a long period after initial symptoms? So I have been wondering for a while why my face seems to have become so weirdly uneven in photos in the last couple of years. When I google 'drooping side of face' I came across Bells Palsy.

Just reaching out to see if anyone else is in a similar situation.\n\nCan you overcome synkinesis? Did you? How did you do it? How has it affected you? I am at 11 months since onset/diagnosis. I have synkinesis too. Some of my muscle groups still are not moving though, no matter the amount of physical therapy. \n\nMy Neurologist told me that there isnt much to do other than physical therapy and dealing with the synkinesis. It sucks. \n\nMy biggest symptom of synkinesis is just the fact that I cry when I eat and I cannot control the tears coming out. The other biggest, is how when I attempt to smile, my eye closes.  \n\n&gt;My biggest symptom of synkinesis is just the fact that I cry when I eat and I cannot control the tears coming out. The other biggest, is how when I attempt to smile, my eye closes. \n\nSame issue as you,tears come from my left eye whenever I eat or sometimes when drinking .It does suck but something I can deal with ,I was just happy that I made 80\u2105recovery on left.andddd I have it again on my right face hopping that I recover tho!  \n\nTake care you all!\n\n\n Ugh... I have this happen when I eat something that is too hot (temperature). My affected eye will start tearing. I have the smile thing also, so I intentionally try not to smile very often. 11 and a half months with identical progress. It helped me hearing your story so I figured it may help you to know that there is someone else going through the same thing in Florida.\n\nWishing us both complete recoveries one day. I miss Florida \ud83d\ude2d I wish it was easier to make support groups for this long term effects stuff but its so hard since hardly anyone makes it to a year with long term effects.  I know exactly what you mean. I have met a few people dealing with BP here and it always gives me strength. Hey guys. I sympathize with your struggles, but it does get better. \n\nBut it is so painful and scary to think I may never get my \"big smile\" back... I still hold out hope that I will.\n\nOn the right side of my mouth, the corner does not go up as much, and pulls down with my neck muscles. And visually this means the cheek does not pop out on that side either, adding to the asymmetrical look.\nIt is devastating that it is in the back of my mind while I am trying to live my life happy and free, smiling and laughing.\nAnyone else have that??\n\nI also noticed I am getting fine lines on that side of my face only due to the way the nerves are pulling... ugh. \n\nAnyone have anything positive or hopeful to share?? :/\nI like to think anything is possible...\n\nAlso - should we create a separate sub for the unique issues us long-timers have??\n I had BP about 8 years ago. I had almost total paralysis on the left side of my face, including not blinking and no tears from my tear duct. I recovered in the normal amount of time, about 3 months , but never did make a full total recovery. \n\nI have some of the same issues you mentioned. When I blink my left eye, the side the BP was on, I get a little twitch around the left corner of my mouth. I guess the muscles around my eye are using some lower face muscles to assist in the function of blinking, sort of like a pulley system.I still to this day notice a bit of tightness or \nnumbness on the left side of my face.\n\nFriends and family tell me they cannot even notice the long term effects.(I never did get much of the droopy face effect) so it is mostly just me noticing small side effects and feeling slight differences in my facial muscles.\n\nI did read their are some places that specialize in physical therapy for the synkinesis and that it can be effective even years after the BP, but for me, it is pretty much a fairly minor cosmetic issue now so I think I will just.ive with what I have and hope I do not ever get it again.\n\nIf you are still having synkinesis, you think about the therapy, although I remember reading the places specializing in it are pretty limited around the country. I live in the Seattle area and the closest place is in Portland and I would not drive that far for what little I have. Good luck with whatever you decide. Just saw this post. I was diagonesed 3.5 years ago. Also suffering from synkinesis. I highly recommend seeking out facial retraining. I saw Jackie Diels (you can google her) and she REALLY helped me to sort out a lot of issues. I am not fully back to \"who\" I was before (I do not know if I ever will be -- I miss being able to whistle and smile normally). But the therapy (and botox!) really helped with my over-tight muscles/extreme pain/and regain some natural movement patterns. I am coming to accept that I will never have my old smile again. It is incredibly frustrating. Good luck! Thanks for reaching out. It is hard to find others in a similar situation. I have some facial exercises that I am supposed to do each day, but I was not good about keeping up with them honestly. I think I was just upset and wanted to put it out of my mind...\nAnd I do get botox. I am excited because the specialist I go to found a new treatment that is supposed to make the corner of the mouth turn upwards when you smile (!!!) Do you have that problem too? The corner of the affected side of my mouth pulls down. I almost cried with joy when she told me they were trying something to help with that, and she said lots of people reacted the exact same way I did. I just got BP on 5/30.. still have not seen much to any improvement. Feeling a little desperate too.. \ud83d\ude2d if anyone could help me with a few answers, I have no upper or lower mouth movement at all, what is the longest anyone went without any movement there and made a decent recovery? I am just hoping for a decent recovery now not even 100%.. thanks in advance.", "What Procedure or Doctor Helped You the Most with BP? What do you recommend? MRI? Physical Therapist? BP Self massage? Acupuncture? Neurologist? Healthy diet? Etc? I found that acupuncture helped me the most. I have had BP four times. I usually do a combo of acupuncture, chiro and self massage. Obviously taking steroids etc (but that is obvious right) and I am doing self massages as well as seeing a physiotherapist which have improved my BP by 90%. It depends on where you are at. If you got BP fairly recently, I would say acupuncturist (after a regular Dr who prescribed steroids and antibiotics of course). But acupuncture helped get the blood flowing to my face and I think helped with nerve re-growth. Whatever you do, do not try electrical stimulation (for nerve reaction testing purposes sure, but not for bringing back movement - it can exacerbate synkinesis).\n\nIf you got it a long time ago and deal with residual issues like me, a plastic surgeon can help with Botox, to achieve better symmetry. Also, I have visited this clinic, and follow their Facebook and YouTube channels -  A lot of their massage techniques and BP philosophies have helped with my synkinesis. \n\nI do not know of any doctors or techniques that can guarantee increased movement, it is more about managing synkinesis and trying to achieve better symmetry. Hope this helps. \nDid you experience this synkinesis due to electrostimulation yourself? I am about 6months in, starting to develop synkinesis (I had acupuncture with electrostimulation a few months ago).\n\nMy physician has now pointed me towards a specialist who might propose surgery or Botox, depending on the assessment that I will get.\nWhat are the massage techniques, are those available on YouTube?\nDo you have experience with Botox? I am afraid that I will end up worse and get a botched Botox job face lol.... Yes. Not long after initial onset, I started seeing a physical therapist who sent me home with an electrical stimulation machine. On the affected side, I put two electrodes on my forehead and two near my mouth, and they would pulse at the same time. I was supposed to do this every day for 30 mins - 1 hr. \n\nMy synkinesis is pretty bad, it is all synced up and very difficult for me to isolate movement at all. I have the chin dimple, crocodile tears, mouth goes up when I blink or move my eyebrow, and when I smile my eye closes and my eyebrow goes up. \n\nThe massage techniques focus on visualization, closing your eyes and seeing the symmetry in your mind. It is more about connecting the nerves to relearn responses to your brain signals, while keeping your muscles relaxed. I went to that clinic I mentioned and it was not cheap! But I do think it helped.\n\nI have wanted to try Botox recently but I have been pregnant so I want to wait till I am done having kids. Botox is temporary, so if you see a reputable plastic surgeon, they should only use a small amount and if you hate it, it will go away in 6 months or so depending on how quickly you metabolize it. I just went to a neurofacial rehab specialist at a hospital. I got a referral from my doctor. i did not realize they existed, but there are some people with good training in this. He is given me a few exercises at this point to try to help me with eye closure.\n\nHe is also offered some practical tips for taping and lubricating my eye. \n\nIf you can find someone with actual experience in rehab, I think it is a good bet. I would be careful about going to a physical therapist that claims expertise without actually having specific neurofacial training. What this person told me is that the movements have to be very, very subtle and controlled.\n\nNow and in my previous BP experience, I have not had anyone give me a lot of actual information that was helpful for BP. I feel that there are so many unknowns.\n\nI have had acupuncture both times. It has helped, but I think that they can only help so much and your acupuncturist should tell you when they have done all they can do. (First one did, second one did not) Hmm I see. Did you seek this physical therapist by yourself or did a doctor refer you to this one in particular?\n\nI am sorry to hear that you are suffering from such severe synkinesis. I hope that it does not get worse and that you will be able to minimize the side effects.\n\nActually, I considered going to Crystal Touch Clinic myself, as I wanted to do anything to help the recovery of my face. I followed their YouTube advice, resting and gentle movements. I considered going there but they looked like a very commercial organisation. I did not like them making (ridiculous) money in the expense of unfortunate people suffering. Maybe it was a principal thing. Did the Crystal Touch Clinic say it was bad of the physical therapist to give you electro stimulation?\nAnyway, I decided to get acupuncture instead.\n\nDoes this means you are living in the NL (as well)? I now have a referral to Radboud UMC, to to facialis team. I cannot remember if a doctor referred me to a physical therapist, I was 14 at the time so I would have to ask my mom. That was over 20 years ago though so no telling!\n\nMy synkinesis is just annoying at this point, most people tell me they do not notice it until I say something. I have been able to relax the overactivity over time.\n\nCrystal Touch is quite a small clinic, in a somewhat sketch building in downtown Rotterdam lol. I do feel it was overpriced for what you get, but I had never heard of a BP specialty clinic before. You could say the same about many medical specialists, making money off people suffering. But I am really glad I got the instruction that I did, because it does seem to have helped. I lived in the NL for a few years, that is when I saw them.\n\nI hope things go well for you at Radboud UMC! Had my onset about 3.5 years ago with severe paralysis on the left side of my face. I am now 43.\n\nAfter running the gauntlet of neurologists, otolaryngologists, and ophthalmologist, my symptoms resolved to about 75% after about a year\u2026.and I still have some synkinesis that makes certain movements wonky.\n\nMy biggest source of disappointment was that my left eyebrow dropped down significantly lower than the good side of my face\u2026.and the ptosis that accompanied it made me look terrible in every. single. photo. Seriously\u2026.not one good photo of me in my sister\u2019s wedding.\n\nLuckily, my otolaryngologist referred me to a double Board certified otolaryngologist and facial plastic surgeon. He specializes in facial trauma and nerve damage.\n\nHe suggested starting with a round of VERY strategically placed, small dose Botox to help with synkinesis around my mouth, nose, and left eye. THIS IS MAGICAL and something that I will continue with for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe also tried a Botox Brow Lift to adjust my eyebrows - that did not work well for me. No side effects\u2026.just did not help.\n\nOne week ago, this surgeon performed an endoscopic brow lift - five small incisions in my hairline - to rearrange my forehead and lift my left brow to match my right.\n\nI got my surgical packing off today - and I cannot believe the results. My face looks like\u2026..MY FACE. Yes, there is still some swelling and I have a bit of healing left to do but - good Lord, was this worth it.\n\nWithin the next couple of weeks, I will go back in (with the same surgeon) for an upper blepharoplasty with ptosis repair on both eyes.\n\nIt is been a long road, but I am incredibly grateful to have found a team of specialists who not only took great care of me, but also listened and heard me when discussing goals and outcomes.", "Neck and shoulder pain Hey all! I have been experiencing Bell\u2019s Palsy symptoms since 2/6, the horrible ear and jaw pain came on. I could not figure out the pain, and tried cold remedies thinking it was a cold coming. Sunday 2/8 I had the worst pain and went to urgent care no diagnosis for Bell\u2019s palsy, but they gave me the steroid thinking it was an ear ache. I was also on antibiotics for a mystery infection from a couple weeks prior when the hospital could not pin point specifically where the infection was. I finished those yesterday. On 2/11 I followed up with my primary about the pain she ordered an MRI still no diagnosis of Bells at this point, and she just said take Naproxen, finish antibiotics, and steroids. 2/12 I ended up in the ER because the migraine was worse and my face was better, but still not fully mobile. While my face is moving more the pain is not improving. The migraine that comes with this has been horrible I cannot seem to sleep at all. Each time I sleep I wake up in so much pain in my head, ear, neck, and shoulder. Feels like I was hit by a bus. Have been tempted to take a muscle relaxer, but given that my face cannot move fully I was worried it would do more harm than good. I have been using a heating pad. It does not help that I have developed a bad cold on top of this and my nose is non stop running. The heat helps to an extent, but before the night ends I am in a chair because the pain of laying down is just too bad. Has anyone else experienced pain beyond their face? I get paid that goes down the back left side of my neck from time to time and paid from behind the left ear to the left side of the neck. Its only every so often. Maybe once a month it seems like but my neurologist says everything neurologically seems to be working fine so he says its just a residual side effect from the bells. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Thank you! The doctor is having me tested for an autoimmune because the pain ended up going down my whole body. The Bell\u2019s is getting better each day as far as movement in my face thankfully. I am almost to the two week mark that people say things get better. My lip and nose do not work on my right side still, but my eye can close again. Gabapentin ... takes care of the pain beautifully. The same day I discovered that I could not taste anything on one side of my tongue was also the morning I woke up with the most excruciating pain just near my left shoulder blade. It was bad enough that the doctor prescribed me a muscle relaxer for it. I do not know if it was related, but if not, it was a heck of a coincidence, because I have not had that pain again since.", "Question post recovery! Hi guys, hope you are well :) \n\nI had Bells Palsy several years ago now and recovered. Occasionally, I do get twitches and tremors, but that is it. \n\nHowever, I noticed afterwards that my lips seem to have shrunk a bit. I know it sounds odd. But I felt that is what happened. Did anyone else experience this? I have similar experience, I can feel same below my eyes. It is like my skin on affected side is pushed inside and because of that I still have some asymmetry on that area around eyes. I feel like I have pushed the limit physically to a good extent and there is still room for improvement. I am getting lot of support mentally to keep positive thoughts. I genuinely want to grow more skin there and just doing exercises told by my doctor. She also said that facial expression during emotions has a good impact to make face more symmetrical. That is also a part of my exercise, so if I am laughing I try to make sure I laugh fully and try to make my face symmetrical (of course I do this in from of mirror), similarly I do other emotional expression like surprise, anger, blink, sniff, pout, sad face. I feel like this is the last thing I have to do and I will never stop until I see that symmetric face naturally. I also thought about getting surgery, botox but it is not a priority for me right now. So I will go with exercises for now.", "Two months in, slowed/stunted recovery? I got hit with bells palsy on the evening of 1/25. Now that I know what the symptoms are, I realize there were warning signs (severe pain behind right ear) for days but had no idea what i was in for. It was full blown less than 6 hours after I noticed the movement on my right side had started to fade that night. I drove to the ER around 4am after panic set in as to what could be wrong. When i got there and after a stroke was ruled, they gave me the official diagnosis of bells palsy. I was immediately given a prescription for a steroid and anti-viral medicine for 7 days.\n\nThe following Saturday I woke up with severe pain on the right side of my face, it felt hard as a rock and was tender to the touch. It was so bad that I could barely keep my eyes open. My daughter had a basketball game that afternoon but I had to have my wife drive me home as the pain had gotten worse as the day went on. I went home, laid in bed and took a nap for a few hours in the dark. After I woke, I felt OK and a week later the pain had almost completely gone.\n\nAbout 5 or so days after that episode, I could move/twitch a little bit under my right eye and I could move, just slightly, a bit of my lip. A few more days pass and it get a little better each day, and I am excited because I am seeing progress every day. I can only slightly lift my right eyebrow, I can close me right eye. I look in the mirror and  make an effort to get a some decent movement. It varies from day to day. Some days it is easier to move, some days are a little more difficult.\n\nAs it stands now, I am a bit concerned because I made some good progress over the course of that 7-10 day period but then it feels like it all just came to a screeching halt. I hit a wall after getting a little better everyday for about 10 days. It has not gotten worse or better it feels like I got 15%-20% recovery and then by face just said \"That is all I got, sorry\" Also, I if i press on certain areas of my face, where I had that severe pain I described earlier, it still hurts (a lot) if I press or try to massage those areas (above my eyebrow, my chin my cheekbone, under my jaw and in front of my ear)\n\nI understand, healing could be a few weeks, months or years. I was just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience of the face still being tender and feeling pain after all this time and/or having their recovery some to a complete stop like I am describing.\n\n(I have attached a photo to show the spots on my face where I am still having that tenderness and pain if I apply pressure)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Everybody reacts and recovers differently depending on the severity. There is a scale from 1-6 in which I was a 4. My symptoms started around 3 days before you and have recovered about 85%. I also feel like I hit a wall. I totally understand you but it will get better. Rest and avoid stress, it helps a lot Hey mate, sorry to hear you were having so much pain.\n\nI have recommended it here a couple of times now - acupuncture. I had a similar experience to you in feeling progress and then it slowing down. I would essentially stopped at about 40%. But then I started getting acupuncture and it picked right back up again. I am now at about 90% and only my close friends can tell the difference. Acupuncture helped me through the process a bit faster I think. I was diagnosed on 2/6 on my right side too. I have come to a halt in my progress as well, not noticeable when my face is relaxed, but when I try to smile and full smile, or squish my face, you can tell. My acupuncture appointments are on hold now because of COVID, I think that is why I could be slowing down. Hey mate, are you feeling better now? I have been in bell's palsy for 6 weeks and hit a wall now. I have the same area as yours that will have pain if I pressed it.", "Does smoking worsen Bells Palsy? I got diagnosed with this yesterday, got tons of steroids, but I am having this craving for smoking even though its hard to smoke from only one side lmao. But I wanted to know, does smoking acts as a catalyst to delay recovery? I mean, smoking is bad for you and all, but I cannot see how it would affect recovery times.", "Tingling on the other side I am getting occasional tingling on the non-affected side of my face. No real numbness, just pins and needles and it goes away in a few minutes. No clear impact on the BP side. Has anybody else had this? Any idea what it means? I get cramps on my good side if I have been talking or smiling too much. \n I do not know if that is similar or not.  I figure it is because the muscles are pulling the affected side over or something.  Occasionally I mush the good side of my face over to the bad side and it kind of stretches things out and eases the cramps. Well, it is apparently called facial neuropathy, and not necessarily related to BP, but it is related to diabetes, which I have. BP can be related to diabetes too, and I think it is why I have it. I do find the neuropathy is strongly muted by B-complex vitamins and aspirin (which I can tolerate).\n\nJust one more thing to deal with, I guess.", "can bells palsey permanently make face droop? i had bells palsey a while ago and i have recovered from it but one side of my face still droops a little bit. this includes when i smile the right side of my lips only goes up a little and my right eye lid droops slightly. does anyone know if this is from BP? Yes it is very much from the BP, I got BP October 2019 and now over a year later my left side is still very weak, I am unable to fully smile, raise eye brow, and flair nostril.  Most people fully heal, but that was not the case for me.  I go to physical therapy once a month, you may want to see a specialist to get recommendations. Coming up on my 5 years still have half a paralyzed face. Welcome to the 5%! Right there with you, and almost the same timeline. Sending love. I am 1.5 years out and I am about 80% recovered. My eyebrow and above are still completely paralyzed. Curious, how old are you, and how active are you? Curious, how old are you, and how active are you? Curious, how old are you, and how active are you? 26 yo I was 26 when I got Bell\u2019s palsy. I am a competitive athlete with a BMI of 17-18. I got BP when I was pregnant. Going on 23 years. I had repeat episodes when I was young with full recovery each time. When I was 14 it hit twice and stayed. I had another episode last year that I am still recovering from, not back to my \u201cnormal\u201d which is probably 70%.  \n\nFor the how active question, in high school i raced bikes then I was a firefighter and medic. Not as active now, but a parent so not sitting around. I have the same issue. It did not happen the first time I had it but on a recurrence it did. It is especially more noticeable the more tired I get. How far along were you in your pregnancy? Did you recover? What have you done for treatment? My BP is likely due to pregnancy. Onset was at 25 weeks. I am now 31 weeks and about 90% recovered with several sessions of acupuncture and some PT. I was 28 weeks. I had zero recovery until I was one month postpartum. I immediately was started on steroids and antivirals but otherwise no treatment until I was over a year out. I did a course of PT and I also had some corrective plastic surgery. Thank you for your comment. I had bilateral, mostly recovered, but I have noticed that my right side becomes weaker when I am very tired. I always wondered if it was just in my head, but seeing this makes me feel less crazy. Haha", "So I was diagnosed with BP. I was diagnosed with bp on Monday (It is saturday night for me right now). Is there anything I should be looking for recovery wise? I have had an incredible amount of eye twitching today but still feel the pressure/ numbness in my my cheek and jaw area. Can close my eye about halfway (to the point where I can barely see) but have to close it manually with my fingers when I go to sleep. Doctors think it could have been lyme disease (i am awaiting results for that, should be here any day now) so they prescribed me Amoxicillin and a tapered dose of Prednisone. Any answers/tips would be extremely appreciated as I am stressing out about this quite a bit. Thank you!  Hi, what kind of doctor did diagnose you? Is it a surgeon?", "Hearing EXTRA loudly in effected ear - Normal? Hi again you guys!\n\nI posted this weekend that I was diagnosed. I have been taking my meds and am going to the dentist tomorrow morning to get the teeth out that I think caused the infection. However my concern today is how loud everything has been in my right ear, the right side of my face is effected by the BP. \n\nIs that normal w/BP? \n\nAlso a lot of the pain I had with it (headache, and such) have subsided by my ear pain has not. In fact it might be worse? Honestly hard to tell, so over pain at this point.\n\nAnywho... before i keep rambling. Normal or not? Should I go back into my doc?\nI plan to do so anyways once I heal from the dentist to try and get a referral for physical therapy.\n\n\nThanks so much. You guys here have helped tons this week w/me staying positive and not feeling alone. *snugs* I have only had it for a week so far, but I have noticed listening to music in the car that I have to keep it at a lower volume due to my right (affected) ear being sensitive. I am not a medical professional so please consult with your doctor.  Do not sue me.\n\nThat said, I had the exact same thing.  My doctor explained that the nerve that is affected by Bell's Palsy ultimately links into a number of nerves/muscles.  This includes functionality of the salivary gland, the gland that produces tears, etc.  So, as it was explained to me, inside our ears is a reflex similar to how you pull your hand away automatically if it was near a burner on your stove.  But, with BP, this nerve is not working right so the muscle that control that function, essentially leaves your ear exposed to loud noises - not good.  You need to take care to use an earplug(s) if you know you were going to be exposed to loud noises.  For me, it was bad for a couple of months.  It was not so much about how loud it was but the pitch.  I have two small dogs and their barks were hell on my ear.  I also coach so I would wear and earplug during games.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck with it and be careful.  It took me quite a while to get better (think months) so be patient and stay vigilant. Pretty normal in my experience. I had the headaches, the ear pain, and phono phobia and photophobia. Hearing and light sensitivity. It will get better in time and there is not a cure for sensitivity. You can only help the symptoms like wearing ear protection, sunglasses, keeping volumes low, etc. The ear pain is because your nerves are angry at you and are trying to figure themselves out. My doc had put me on gabapentin for the pain since its nerve pain and not an ear infection.  Absolutely.  I have had BP twice.  Once in HS during prom and the loud music almost made me pass out. \n\n2nd time was during college, I was prepared this time with an earplug in my affected side. I cannot speak to the hearing because my experience was muffled with a high pitched ringing. Terrible.\n\nThe pain however, is super familiar. I had about 2-3 weeks of intense headaches. My ear and face  hurt and were sensitive to the touch. It took a while for it to all go away.\n\nDo not hesitate to go to your Dr. I went multiple times because I wanted to make sure everything was \"ok.\" I am sure she thought I was annoying but I needed the peace of mind. This happened yesterday all of the sudden everything was loud Based on my one data point (and a few things I have read), this is normal.\n\nIn some people the eustachian tubes do not work correctly when BP does its thing... whatever caused the inflammation that pinched off the facial nerve did so quite close to the inner ear, at or near the stylomastoid foramen, through which also pass nerves involved in hearing and the muscular infrastructure that can affect hearing. Some of the muscles the tube runs alongside/through do not work, the internal air pressure goes down, and sound reverberates down it. The same thing happens when airplanes land, if you have problem sinuses: the opening in the nasopharynx gets clogged up, there is not sufficient air pressure in the tube to balance the air outside, and sounds get headache-inducingly loud. Pinch your nose, force some air into the tubes, the pressure equalizes and the sound volume goes back to normal. (On planes. No such luck with BP, in my case.)\n\nI am totally not a doctor, just someone who read a bit about these things trying to figure out why/how I got vicks in my goddam inner ear when I had BP... the opening of the eustachian tubes is at the back of the sinuses, the muscles that normally keep the tubes closed were not working correctly, and in addition to hearing so loud that I could hear my own pulse I had a minty-cool burning inside my ear. Normal!  I am a dance teacher and my students kept telling me the music was  too loud when I could barely hear it!  If you just started meds, it will take a while, but it will get better! I also had an extreme sensitivity to loud noises. I have had hyperacusis for most of my life, and BP amplified that in my left ear. After a while, the sensitivity began to return to normal, but was replaced with a drumming sound. The Sensor Tympani muscle seems to go into spasms and it sounds like a Buddy Rich solo is playing on my left side. It is all slowly getting better, but it is taken over a year to get this far.", "Bell's Palsy affecting Neck muscles I noticed that not only is my face affected by the full facial paralysis, but so was my neck. I noticed when i was lifting that part of my neck would strain while the other half did not. I can feel some of my neck muscles flex, but when I try to flex my neck ( sort of like a body builder kind of hard to put into words. best image would be Macho man )  I can only feel half of my neck flex. I did not see any sort of research on my neck being affected and I was wondering if anyone else noticed it. Yep happened to me too. It was one of the last areas to feel normal again actually. (I was diagnosed December 21st 2018 and I am about 95% recovered.) Hope you get better fast, good luck! At what point were you able to get mouth and blinking movement back? (I know everyone is different, but maybe some of us are the same?) I started to get movement back somewhere around 4 weeks after diagnosis. I noticed the same thing. Good to know I am not the only one", "I do not have information about the on-set nor does it seem I ever will but I became familiar with the term Bell's Palsy in my 20's. Although I went through various treatments, no one actually ever told me until I saw a neurologist. At the back of my mind is the possibility of a reoccurrence ", "What are my chances to fully recover? Hello! I felt facial weakness last May 13 but I was only able to get diagnosed and start with my medication today, May 19. Because of how bad the COVID situation in our country is, it is really hard to get an appointment with a doctor if you are not considered an emergency case. Anyway, I was just wondering if despite being 6 days late with my medications, do I still have a good chance with full recovery? The left side of my face does not droop, it is just quite stiff. Thank you in advance to anyone who may give their insight! I wish everyone here the best :) Most people will fully recover. The fact that you are not drooping is probably a good sign as well.\n\nEven if it takes weeks for movement to come back, you still have a high likelihood of full recovery.\n\nGood luck! It is a hard wait (I am on my second experience with BP, a decade after my first), but it will happen. In the future always look at other options like Tele Doctors or urgent cares and the ER. You might not be dying but you do need to get those meds In your system, the sooner the better. \n\nI got diagnosed on April 30th via webcam, I got the inflammation meds then, I read online other were getting antiviral and I did not so I went to an urgent care and got them on my 3rd day. \n\nMost people recover, 5% have some permanent damage unfortunately but even so the odds are in your favor. \n\nThings you can do is start looking up BP exercises that are down 2x a day, the earlier you start the better. \n\nI started also taking CBD oil after my meds were up, as well as acupuncture 2x a week. \n\nHope this info helps you. Tbh even if it takes months. None of my 4 cases have recovered in weeks, they have all been months, but they have been basically full recoveries. anything to recommend to avoid synkinesis? I have some of my one side from a decade ago, but I would like to avoid it this go around. Honestly no idea. I would try just doing face exercises, and hope for the best. That is basically what I have done, with the prednisone and antivirals in the start I had it back in 2015. Still notice some weird stuff like the way my eyes feel when closed. Not the same. Also I leak a tear from my right eye time to time. Like Johnny Depp in the movie Crybaby.", "Blurred vision I have noticed that my vision has blurred since my BP started last week.\n\nIf a rest my eyes for a while, it helps, but it is hard to work (I work in IT) since I stare a screens all day and that does not help either.\n\nAnyone else have this problem? Also, having more issues than normal sleeping since this started. I was seriously stressed when this started, now it is worse. \n\nI was on \"vacation\" last week when my BP started, so I guess the down time allowed my body to say \"fuck it\" and throw me out of whack. I noticed my vision getting blurred 3 weeks before having any other Bell's related symptoms. I was just about to schedule an appointment to get my eyes checked when I woke up one morning with half of my face stuck. \n\nI did not want to go anywhere whilst my face was not recovered, so I put the vision problems in the backlog.\n\nAfter 3 months or so, I fully recovered from Bell's and I also noticed my vision getting better and better. At the moment, (4 and a half months in) the blurriness is completely gone. I still plan to get an eye doctor appointment since I am also working in IT and at least get some glasses to reduce eye fatigue. You can get some first aid tape and tape the one eye shut, either during sleep or otherwise. My neurologist pointed out that I was not *really* blinking on that side unless I was focusing on it, and the numb eyelid can open during the night. It might be getting a little dry. I also find the drooping brow makes my vision a little off. Good luck! Sleeping and avoiding stress are apparently important for recovery Thanks! I have been doing that with the tape, sometimes lol.\n\nI find that my eyes are fatigued really easily now, but only from the onset of this. You know, now that I think about it, I had noticed the same. This is reassuring. Thank you very much! I think my other muscles are learning to compensate some, or I am getting slightly better. Hope it is the latter lol. Also sorry for those typos, just fixed them all I never fully recovered from a BP onset that occurred about 6ish years ago. My left eye\u2019s vision (the affected side) went to shit because the lower eyelid was paralyzed (and still is). Basically, the constant drag against the eyeball caused irritation &gt; led to blurriness &gt; over time caused low key scarring on the surface. I am doing the course of meds, but also adding in vitamins and supplements related to nerve repair (I learned about those when I stuck a machete in my leg last year and cut a nerve), taking turmeric and ginger and started CBD all in an effort to try and recover.\n\n(\n\nI cannot find the original link for that, but anything I can I am going to do. I would like to recover. Maybe some of those things could help you. I hope so.\n\nWith my face and eyes the way they are now, I am struggling to do what I normally would. I am only a week into it though, so here is to hoping!\n\nEdit:\n\nI found the link:\n\n( Hey. I was on vacation when mine started also. Very strange. Blurry vision first and second weeks. Less blurry vision on this third week. No other improvements yet though. Still getting headaches, bad nerve pain and soreness on effected side. I am having problems sleeping also. Taping eye at night, but still seems like effected eye moved at night. I am taking extra vitamins and supplements also to help recovery I hope. \n\nHow are you doing? Any improvements? I can now, ever so slightly, move my left eyebrow and a bit of my lips and neck. Not without a lot of effort.\nLOTS of cramping and painful random twinges. Those are making my sleep brutal.\n\nI now do not feel like everything is bitter. The few parts of my tongue that can taste are telling me everything is flavorless, but then I get a lasting off-sweet taste that is annoying. Not much appetite, that is good for my waistline though!\n\nI finished the meds, but keep hitting the vitamins I learned about for nerve healing when I severed a nerve in my leg. Also been taking cbd oil twice a day. \n\nMy eyes work ok for a while, but get blurry fast.\n\nAh, I also use a heating pad. To try and relax the facial muscles. I have a TENS someone gave me. I tried it once,but think I over did it as I was in agony later. Have not used it again, but plan to, but for shorter times. Hey OP. That is good you can move some and it is getting better. Are you on your 2nd or 3rd week of BP? Taping your eye at night right before bed with medical paper tape works well to help with twinges. I am not able to tape it during day or wear a patch. My effected eye will not stay closed during day. My taste never really went away, some did taste bitter first week. But did not loose appetite. Went by a healthy diet for bells Palsy my sister found me on the net. You still need to eat to get back your happy healthy self. \n\nI appreciate your link below for the nerve repair help with vitamins and supplements. I am trying those too. \nI am also using CBD oil cream to help with the pain.\n\nAlso, noticed blurriness also after awhile. Have to keep putting eye drops on effected eye atleast once a hour. I have been using artificial tears and a gel one during day and ointment eye drops at night before bed. My doctor told me to use icepack on nerve for pain also and not heat. I love heating pads, but doc said no. \n\nMy doctor wants me to get a MRI, since not better at check up. MRIs for brain are over a month out here for appt. MRI appt set for December 2nd. \n\nWhat is a Tens? I thought about ordering a facial massage roller. Maybe it would help the process. I do not want more pain though. I have alot of pain nerve and behind ear and soreness on effected right side and do not want more. Do you get pains? This would be my second week of BP. I have not gained more movement, but I can still move those really limited areas.\n\nI noticed when the cramping gets bad, using a heating pad helps. I had not tried icing it. I guess I will give that a go.\n\nA TENS is an electric muscle stimulator. ", "Those who have had repeat episodes, did you notice any signs of it the day before, and if so what were they?  Food tasted like metal, did not even come close to connecting the symptom to bells I am on my second episode in 3 months. First day I noticed numbness on the left side of the tongue, second day the classic throbbing ear pain on the left, third day cramping of the jaw(that is what tipped me off, same thing happened the first time), fourth day finally started to lose movement in my face. \n\nI had gone to the doc on the third day, so I had the meds ready to take on day 4. \n\nCurious have you had repeat episodes, if so what have been your signs?   head/neck ache, but this happened with my first episode, too, and I often have headaches and neck pain. onset started with a few hours of some lip numbness or tingling, but after that it went pretty quickly to paralysis twinge feeling behind my ear and some pain moving my face muscles. I have noticed a very strong correlation between getting enough sleep and having symptoms personally I have not had a repeat yet. I had my first in March, almost completely recovered within 4 weeks but last night my neck started getting a bit stiff, although this might be my anxiety because my wife said my face looked a little different earlier. I have just woken up and everything seems ok still How many repeats have you had? Are you taking B vitamins, Zinc and Lysine and drinking plenty of water? Whenever I feel the twinge in my ear/jawline or eye looks wonky, I will crawl into bed and sleep with a heating pad under my ear/head. I also have a supply of valtrex from my doctor to take as one offs. Your body needs rest, it is trying to fight something that is manifesting as the BP. Have your doctors offered an MRI to see if you have any black holes or white spots that might show what triggered the BP? It can be linked to MS or Lyme disease, at least in my case- I have MRIs every 5 years to see if I have new lesions. Take care and hope it is just a one and done for you. I have had three episodes and each time it took days to fully set in. The first sign has always been the pain around the ear/jaw and tingles on that side of my tongue which eventually turn to numbness. As soon as I have felt those signs I run for my b-complex &amp; b-12 vitamins and start the facial exercises early. I have had 1 full blown repeat where it when 0% - 50% - 0%, and since then it has not gotten that bad, but it is gone down from 100% functionality to 70-80% and back up to 100% from time to time\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit to answer your question: probably 6 times total but only 1 major My left side got it in March 2020.  I had not fully recovered.  Then on 8/15/2021, I noticed more difficulty eating and talking.  Two days later, my right side got it.", "Can I sleep on the BP side and any special foods I should be eating? I go to the neurologist tomorrow, the urgent care diagnosed me 4 days ago. \n\nIs it okay if I sleep on the BP side of my face??\n\nIs there any special foods I should be eating to help this heal faster? I read about B12... No idea about what side to sleep on. I know I slept on the opposite side. I had an ear infection on the same side so it worked out for me. Does one feel better than the other?\n\nI took supplements to add those vitamins/minerals to my diet. I did ask my GP beforehand. I ended up taking a B Complex, zinc, and lysine. I was also taking a lot of heavy-duty pain meds and antivirals so I ate a lot of foods that are good for the kidneys and liver like apples, cranberries, spinach, ginger, lemon and blueberries. \n\nGood luck! I personally slept on the non bp side just because the pressure from laying on the bp side was a little uncomfortable. I have been told leafy greens are great and to stay away from sweets. I took elder berry supplements and I think they may have helped heal quicker.  I have been sleeping anyway I  can but on the BP side increases morning symptoms", "Questions, 11 days in. I am about 11 days in and I am beginning to notice that my ear is swelling on the BP side, did this happen to anyone else? \n\nAlso does anyone have advice about when to start trying exercises? I still have absolutely no control but I have read that some people perform the exercises using their finger to aid the bad side? Swelling or pain? Swelling is something you should contact your doctor about ASAP. Not quite swollen, just red and little puffy. Maybe it is just because I am touching it more than usual. Will inquire with my doctor though.   You might want to read about Ramsay Hunt Syndrome ", "Day 17 Some movement back in face. Woo.\n\nHead pain, pain behind ear lobe continues. Should I be worried? I too would like to know. I am on day 18 with the same situation. I had that. Went away after 3 weeks though. Do not be worried, it comes with BP \u2764 I wish you a speedy recovery xxx Thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f The ear pain behind the ear is the worst!!! It is totally normal and it happened to me around the same time I started getting some movement too. For me it it stuck around for 2-4 days and sort of wanes as you get more movement. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb You doing better? I still get it when I yawn, neck stiffness too but I think that is just the muscles working again.. I hope haha", "Interesting possible connection regarding Bell's Palsy and some vaccines  I saw this,and am wondering if there are is any data on people who had Bells prevaccination? I saw a few developed after the vaccine, but the numbers were in line with general population developing Bells. Very curious as to the numbers who had Bells before. Was there a relapse? yeah, in my opinion the connection is weak given it actually seems like less people than normally get it got it (1 in 60 people per year I think?) I had the covid vaccine Friday. Literally fifteen minutes after my right side of my face started to get numb. I had a little facial paralysis that lasted about two hours. It completely resolved. I am feeling fine now. Interesting. A little scary. There is literally no correlation here.  0.0013% of people in the US will get BP per year.  The rate of Bell\u2019s palsy from the study group was 0.001%. Exactly what you would have expected.\n\nEdit,  is that I am thinking about it more. They are not telling us how many people got the vaccine in the article, just that 30000 people were involved and 3 that actually got the vaccine came down with BP. So we cannot run any numbers on the data provided. Yeah we would have to know the total number of those who received the placebo. One person came down with BP after getting the placebo Same, I need it know if those three who got it had it before. Having BP symptoms again after I have finally, finally 95% recovered is honestly my worst nightmare. Same, I never thought I would think twice about a vaccine but I only ever recovered about 50\u00f7 of my function on one side, since I had BP 20 years ago, if I have it on the same side I will lose the little I gained, if it is on the other side I will not be able to speak or eat normally... so... very very afraid right now", "Prednisone side effects I am on my third day of prednisone (5th day of BP) and I have been having a lot of visual hallucinations today, is this normal? You need to ask a doctor, can you call them?  Or the pharmacy that prescribed them.\n\nI had violent vomiting and had to stop taking it after 3 days. Visual hallucinations? See a doctor immediately if possible about that. I am on my 6th day of BP, I personally only have had very subtle swelling in the bend of my knees as a side effect from prednisone. It was from the steroids, they just lowered the amount to take and got me off of them.", "Ear tenderness I know this sounds weird- so I got Bells Palsy from an ear infection. I am 90% recovered now. But I have noticed when I scratch the inside part of my ear on the affected side (not IN my ear CANAL, but just the inside part) it BURNS for a couple moments like a hardcore stinging feeling and then it goes away. I am so confused by this? That takes a little while to fully go away. The ear pain was the worst part. My BP also came from an ear infection. I took some eardrops for that, but I do not feel like they helped much. It took like 5 weeks until my ear was sort of normal. How long did your palsy take to recover? I am wondering if ear infection types take longer? Had the same sensation for months after paralysis resolved", "Is it possible to recover after years? I got diagnosed with bells palsy around 10 years back, after amounts two months of physiotherapy, I was told that I am now fine. But sadly my smile did not fully recover. It did not bother me much at that time as I did not really payed much attention but now seeing some of my photos, I can see how it noticeable it is if you want to see it. So I was just wondering is it possible to recover my lost smile, even after these many years since diagnosis? If yes, then what sort of treatment should I go for?\n\nAny type of guidance is highly appreciated\nThank you! Unfortunately, I do not think so. This is purely anecdotal though. \n\nMy step-sister had it years before I got it. She did not recover very well and it is quite obvious when she smiles. I got incredibly lucky, because I went to see her the day after getting it. Neither of us wanted to say to the other \"What is wrong with your face?\" but before I left she asked me about my face and I told her how I would woken up the day before with partial paralysis. I would never heard of it before, so she told me what to do (go to the doctor) and I did it. So I was able to almost fully recover within a few months. My luck is all the more apparent when you realize it had been about ten years since I would seen her. But in my wedding photos, taken only two weeks later, it was still very obvious. Botox and fillers can help make your face symmetrical. I got bells palsy about 23 years ago when I was pregnant and I did not take any steroids or antiviral medication because they told me that it could be negative for the baby. I still have some asymmetrical features compared to pre- Bell's palsy but, have had tremendous success getting the Botox and fillers in helping my face look more symmetrical.", "Day 7... It is easier in some ways but harder in others. I made a post on this sub a few days ago, got a lot of encouragement.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am on day 7, and it feels like I have regressed a bit.  Not getting as much twitching, and my spirits are low.  As a new dad it kills me not being able to kiss or communicate with my baby boy properly.  I know there is hope and most people get better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it really sucks.  My wife is laughing at me when I try to speak sometimes, people at work say \"what the fuck is wrong with your face are you okay!?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am starting to get \"used\" to holding my mouth when trying to speak or eat but the mental toll it takes is just debilitating. It is me, again! Had it now for 10 weeks with no real recovery.  Once again, I am confident that you will get better, and probably a lot sooner, so keep your spirits up. Rest as much as you can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I wanted to let you know that, if you end up like me, \"it\" DOES get better even if the actual face does not improve.  You will learn to stop worrying about it so much, and find that you are doing things like holding your face while speaking without even really realizing it.  You will adapt and eventually start to feel relatively  \"normal\" even if your face does not.  Almost everybody makes a full or nearly-full recovery, so you will almost certainly get back to actually normal, eventually.  Nobody gets better in 7 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrow a beard, if you want and can. It really helps mask the sag! I totally hear in about kissing your kid! I was diagnosed 7 days after having my first child. I did not want to take any pictures with her, and it made me so sad I could give her kisses. I healed in roughly five weeks. I credit CBD oil for my recover. \n\nI hope you recover soon! Oh, and tell your wife you do not like her laughing at it. HAHA, my poor wife.  A couple of weeks ago, I said something to her and she kind of laughed.  Totally innocuous, and I was not upset at all, but was a bit confused because what I had said was not funny. So I asked her was was so funny, and she said, \"well just the face you were making......oh.\" Glad it does not bother you! I understand so much how you feel! I noticed very first signs of recovery on day 10. Are you doing any face massage / facial exercises? I like the people closest to me laughing about it. Makes it easier to joke about it myself and keep in good spirits.", "Just diagnosed yesterday and I do not know how to adjust yet. Hi! I was diagnosed yesterday for BP. It is on the right side of my face but I have no signs of drooping. I was given some antibiotics and steroids to help but I do not know how to deal with the stuff that came naturally to me like blinking, drinking, and eating. Any tips or advice for a worried person?  It will be alright. Sounds like yours is mild. Get an eye patch and some gauze if you need to for sleeping. Youre on the right track to get better. One day at a time. Took me about a month for a 95% recovery with symptoms that sound like yours. Do not expect 100%...I didnt Take all the medicine. It does not help right away but it will help. Get rest. Wear a patch for your eye. Get rest! Just let it run its course. Get rest! Get acupuncture, start going to a chiropractor, and if you can get in with a osteopath do that too! Also make sure to take the meds that your Dr prescribes- it should be Valtrex and Prednisone! I was able to get back to almost 100% normal within 2.5 weeks with all this treatment! It was a bit expensive but it was worth it Get an eye patch - this is your one chance to be a pirate, do not miss out on that. Taping your eye shut when you want to sleep can be helpful. Manually 'blink' your eye to keep it hydrated and free of irritants. If you must keep your eye uncovered, use lubricating eye-drops.\n\nBe diligent about staying hydrated... taking little sips all the time was waaay easier for me than normal swallowing. Since your normal processes do not work - swallowing, blinking - drink more than you normally would. You need to give your body every possible edge toward healing, so drink electrolytes; I used those little Emergen-C packets, 6-10 per day, plenty of vitamins and electrolytes. Might help, cannot hurt.\n\nGet plenty of rest. Make an effort to treat yourself well: warm baths, warm wet cloth on your face, gently massage the area. The root cause is, to the best of medical knowledge, inflammation - possibly viral in origin - that choked off the facial nerve... so do anything you can to avoid inflammation. The thing that is most in your control can be the hardest: do not stress. What is going to happen is what is going to happen; your attitude between now and then might have some benefit. Again: might help, cannot hurt.\n\nI assume you meant anti-*virals*?\n\nI have only had BP once, so this next bit is a single data point that is very YMMV:\n\nSometime before I had BP, there was a reddit thread about people who can raise just one eyebrow versus people who cannot. The prevailing wisdom was that people are just wired one way or the other, but then numerous people said they had trained themselves to raise just one eyebrow, by spending 15 minutes a day with a mirror, trying to 'find' (or form?) access to the individual motor nerve that they had never consciously, deliberately controlled.\n\nRight now, there is a nerve in your face that you cannot reach. It is not the same condition as the eyebrow thing - your nerve is basically offline - but it too is a nerve you have never had to micromanage before. So while you are doing those other things to take care of yourself - rest, warm cloth, gentle massage - try to 'find' that nerve. Find the nerves at the boundary between areas that have full sensation and areas that have been BP'd. In my own experience, the more I did this the more the area regained sensation.\n\nAs I said, this is just one data point, so it is entirely possible that I just happened to heal quickly and the things I was doing just *seemed* effective. But they really *did* seem effective, and this too is a 'might help, cannot hurt' sort of thing that might be worth trying. Thank you all so much for the advice! I recently got my eyepatch and currently wearing it now.   Did you never get 100%? It feels like it. No lasting droop and muscle functions as normal as far as I can tell. I feel lucky that I came out of it with no long lasting effects How long did you take your meds from the doctor? Did you do facial exercises at home also?  I am 9 days out and just finished my prednisone and valtrex I believe it was 9 days of Prednisone and Valtrex! The prednisone dosage decreased each day. \n\nI found that Chiro, acupuncture, and seeing the osteopath did more than the meds did I plan on seeing someone for acupuncture! Hope it helps! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb", "the third time at 13 hey, i am 13 years old and this is my third time getting bell\u2019s palsy.  i was diagnosed 2 days ago and soon will be scheduling an mri since it is a reoccurring thing at this point. it is hard everytime for numerous reasons but this time just feels so much harder.  i am a teenage girl and beauty standards in 2020 are not exactly easy to keep up with, and when your face is half paralyzed? i do not feel pretty at all. after the last time i had it, my face was finally seeming to go back to normal. i do not know if half paralyzed is the correct way to explain it but you know what i mean. i am so scared of going out and seeing people in public stare like they did a few years back, let alone going out and letting my friends see me like this.  i have already decided to continue online schooling at least until i get some percentage of control back and i will most likely miss a semester seeing that the last round i had lasted 6 months and it still left abnormalities. a lot of people on this sub reddit that have it are much older so you may not understand but i am just taking a chance here. i do not know anyone in my life that is experienced bell\u2019s palsy and no matter how hard they try they just do not completely get it so i thought here would just be a good place to rant. i have no questions. if you read through, thank you. if you are going through bell\u2019s palsy yourself, i am so sorry and please do not let it discourage you. you are beautiful and strong no matter what. I wish you a speedy and full recovery. Stay safe and healthy. My wife got it almost a year ago today and I think she is as beautiful as ever.  I am very sorry this happened to you, at this age I am sure it is especially tough. I also have three daughters, it would be very hard to see the pain something like this would cause them.\n\nKnow that people love you and things will get better. It went away the last two times so most likely it will go away again soon .... at least with everyone wearing masks outside it will not be as obvious to the public that half your face is paralyzed.... it will get better soon!! Sending you wishes of healing!! What is your treatment like? Please make sure to take care of yourself. As a 13 year old girl, this is a heavy load to carry!! But if you can find the strength to carry this with confidence as you heal, you will be the most beautiful in the room. hey there!\nIm also a 13yo girl that got diagnosed with BP a few days ago (though its my first time). I feel your pain. I cannot drink properly, I cannot laugh (and I laugh a lot), my eye burns and i have almost all of the symptoms. Luckily here where I live we have to wear masks so it is not that noticeable. Maybe you can try this too when you go out? That is one idea I have. I\u2018ll figure other tricks out as time passes haha. \nGet well soon! You\u2018ve got this hi! masks have definitely helped hahaha. i think it was because i caught the symptoms so early and went to the doctor for steroids right away but i have already regained some control with my smile and eye :) i just wanted to say hi because you said it was your first time, i hope it gets better as soon as possible gorgeous! i bought tons of reusable straws to help with drinking also ;) i hope you are not letting it discourage you, think positive always, sending tons of love girly \ud83d\udda4 Thanks Queen!\ud83d\udc9e You are inspiring!  Both of you, tackling this at 13.  I want to be like you when I grow up, and I am 49!  Keep your chins up, your shoulders back, and, til it is safe and comfortable, rock those shades and masks!  I feel like I am robbing a bank everywhere I go now... diagnosed for the first time on Thursday.  Sometimes I even throw in a ballcap, cuz, why not???\n\nKeep spreading that sunshine, ladies! I am so sorry, it is rough for a teen girl. I was 16 with mine. I could not imagine going thru it these days with all the attitudes of perfection and people idealizing doll features. Take extra care of yourself even though others do not understand- keep finding ways to let your feelings out because imo it is emotional too.", "synkinesis Has anyone here not completely healed and also does not have synkinesis? (at least had bell\u2019s palsy for longer than 7 months) because a lot of doctors say after a couple months if you have not completely healed you are likely to develop it so just wondering", "Hi. I just got here. I was diagnosed about two hours ago, although i pretty much figured it out myself with the help of google at breakfast. I knew something was when I was brushing my teeth. I filled my mouth with water to rinse and basically spit and drooled it everywhere. \n\nIt is barely noticeable for others. Smiles a bit lopsided, that is it. \n\nHas pretty bad pain behind the left ear fir the last few days but I thought it was from falling asleep with AirPods in.\n\nDoc gave me an antiviral and prednisone. And eye drops. \n\nSo, did I get lucky or is my face going go all droopy still? If it stays like this or better I will be good, I guess. \n\nAnyways. Hi friends. Mine got worse as the first week went on. Yeah. I kind of thought that was a possibility. The doctor was pretty indefinite about it. He would only say that it is different for different people. Thanks, dude. Sounds like you may have a pretty mild case so far. Be sure to take the meds. My first couple of days were kind of mild as well, but it went downhill after that. I asked for a low dose of Prednisone because I hate the way it makes me feel, but in retrospect maybe that was my mistake. Most people make a full recovery within a month or so. Sounds like mine too, more mild case and caught it fairly quickly. Did get a little worse before it got better. I took the same meds and used CBD oil (helps with nerve damage and inflammation) I was 100% better in about 5 weeks. Best of luck. good luck! mine got a little worse over the first week. I am day 5 now, but the deterioration stopped at around Day 2-3. When i got diagnosed i could move 50% of my face. And within 2 days i lost up to 85% of functionality.. It is day two. While the paralysis is more evident the pain is 80% gone! That is a big thing for me. I am sure the prednisone is to thank. I have my doubts that the antivirals do much but I will take them.  \n\n\nStill lucky. I have gone from about 20% to 30% frozen. Bit of a crooked resting mouth. Wife thinks it is sexy. If you have headaches or nerve pain I found that one excederine tension headache with one ibuprofen worked well for me. \nTake it easy, rest as much as you can. I found that lavender, copaiba, and frankincense EO \u201chelped\u201d. Might have been a placebo effect but it was still good. (Mixed with a carrier oil) Yeah. Discover that headache is a thing today. Also eating is a real bitch. The day I could taste bacon again was a marvelous day. It really depends. Mine worsened from day one to day three and went from about 60% paralysis to 85%.  I caught it early so was on steroids the same day I noticed it.\n\nThe antivirals did not start until day 3 as the doctor did not think to prescribe them. \n\nI am on day 12 and I think that I saw a little improvement over night. behind the ear pain will get worse before it gets better. I got BP on both sides and it took about 3 weeks before i noticed the pain was not there any more.\n\nand no - your face should not get more droopy. if it does, you should go to ER. The pain is largely gone. Doctor said it is a good sign that I am responding well to the steroids. The eating problem is not just taste, although the left side has noticeably deadened sensation. The real issue is that food particles that get lodged between the gum and the cheek on that side kind of get stuck there. I do not have the natural tongue dexterity that we never think about to get them out of there. It is surprising how many little things our bodies \u2018know\u2019 how to do without thought. Take one away and you are suddenly lost. Hey, I just want to thank everyone here that responded. It is really helpful to get feedback on what I am experiencing. I do not personally know anyone else that has suffered from BP, so it is been very important for me in these early days. \n\nI am genuinely appreciative of you all. hahah this cracked me up. I know exactly what you mean I am struggling myself. Sometimes I find breakfast up there in the gum during dinner time, disgusting I know. I have now come up with a method where I shove my finger into my gum to dislodge food.. ew Hi how are you doing now Yeah, time for a follow up. After the second round of steroids, the pain completely disappeared. I am very slowly improving otherwise. My closes almost fully. I cannot smile yet, but others say they see and hear a difference in my mouth as well. I guess patience is what it takes now. Slow improvement is way better than no improvement! Patience is the key, you will get better and better in time!", "Nuface (cosmetic electric stimulation) for Bell\u2019s palsy. If you use it for maintenance please share your tips!  Following.

Electronic stimulation is what I believe caused the majority of my synkinesis.

Hello, I do not think this would be bell's palsy. Bell's palsy strikes almost overnight, or at least for me, it did. It started with a ear block in the evening and then I woke up the next morning with half my face paralyzed. Paralysis does not happen over a time of few days. But do get yourself checked with a doc. Take care \ud83d\ude0a Mine was not instant i did notice dropping and i had pain even if your symptoms arent bells palsy you should go to a Dr or tye ER yo catch it early if it is bells palsy to prevent the full facial paralysis Please have it checked out by your doctor. Drooping on one side would concern me whether I could move that side of my face or not. Similar to the other poster, mine was sharp pain behind my ear and neck before Bell's Palsy came on. Pain was days before, morning of diagnosis, I looked fine and by mid day, I could not control my mouth. Hey! 21m here. \n\nFor me the earliest symptom was half of my tongue going completely numb. I thought I just burned it as I like to taste the food really hot while I am cooking. Then my entire face paralyzed the next day. It went from 0 to 100 really quick when it paralyzed.\n\nI hope it is not something worse, and I sure hope you are going to recover swiftly. Wish you all the the best.", "Secondary episodes in close proximity (in space *and* time) to the first? Monday night I had a little twinge-y nerve on my upper cheek, never had anything like that before. Tuesday morning I woke up with Bell's Palsy, basically centered around where that twinge was.\n\nToday I woke up with a twinge-y nerve in my lower jaw (6cm below the other nerve, 2.5cm from DMZ of first incident) that is much more spazzy than the cheek/eye nerve was. The first nerve spazzed a couple of times an hour, this one spazzes a couple of times a minute.\n\nNothing I have read leads me to believe that I cannot have another event in another location. The effects of BP seem quite localized to where the twinge-y nerve was on my cheek, almost perfectly centered there. The new spazzy nerve is quite close to the presumably virus-beleagured swollen gland that likely triggered all of this. It is in an area I still control (my mental picture of my face looks something like a Risk game right now), and it is really going to town. All of the other risk factors are still present; the WP article on BP reads like someone was following me around for the past few weeks, this was literally a 'textbook' episode.\n\nThe googles mostly speak of second episodes months or years later, not three days later. The circumstances that led to the first episode have not changed, other than me being more annoyed than I was before Tuesday morning. Does BP spread out to neighboring areas, bringing on secondary episodes? If so, how common is that?", "Is Cannabis Effective for Treating Bell\u2019s Palsy?  Anecdotal, but it did not seem to help me any.\n\nTook CBD tincture, rubbed CBD balm, and used THC daily.  I suppose it may have been helping, and that I would be a lot worse off today had I not used the cannabis. But there is no way for me to know.\n\nI did not see any dramatic changes, and I have been stalled at about 85% healing for a year now. Anecdotally, cannabis cures everything.\n\nIn reality it gets you high. Pot cures nothing. ok so I asked the same thing when I got Bell's around 2 weeks ago and from my experience; yes. When I was high I was able to actually really feel the droopiness in my left side and could focus on trying to put specific attention onto the smaller nerves while completely relaxing my face. Idk how really to explain it but it helped me mentally for the facial exercises and to be able to actually feel the nerves working out. Might not be good for everyone but it helped me recover almost all the way in 2 weeks. I used weed in edible form as well as vaping which the second probably was not the healthiest but I do think it greatly helped with my recovery.  The most important thing all the doctors told me was to keep my stress levels down which the edibles did.  Keep in mind however I am a habitual marijuana user for many years so I may have a completely different experience than others.  I also felt the weed helped relax my body and nerves which combined with twice weekly acupuncture and self massage really sped up my recovery time. It is incredibly effective with helping the pain. Best strains, Blue Dream and Granddaddy Purple. I lost track since I got my bp but smoking a dab pen and eating edibles are slowly getting my smile back it helps with the stiff and sore side (left )", "Suffering for over 16 years and wonder if anyone is in the same boat Hi everyone! \n\nJust wondering if anyone has dealt with Bell's Palsy long term? I have been dealing with it for over 16 years and at this point I am sure my face will never be back to normal. It definitely has improved since I first contracted it but certainly nowhere near 100%. Anyone in the same boat or have something that helped them? Thanks in advance! Yeh I am in the same boat. I had bells about 7-8 years ago. Most of the recovery happened in the first 6 months. Since then it is been the same. \nI would say I am about 75% back to original.\nI am not expecting it to change though. \n\nBut anyways, life goes on! It definitely does. I guess it is just nice to know I am not the only one. Going through this thread seeing most people fully recover in just a few months was a little disheartening. Yeh I know what you mean. I had the same feeling when I read posts about how much it sucked. And then for them to be fully recovered in 2 weeks!\n\nBut then I stopped reading posts. Tbh I do not read and post a lot on this sub Reddit, But this post I can relate too. Well thanks for sharing! You have helped me feel better at least! I am in the same boat, but I am going on 20 years. I am probably 80% back to normal, but that is that I guess. The majority of people I interact with daily now, I met after I got it, so they do not notice at all. I see it in every picture still, and especially if I have had a couple drinks. This post is relatable I got BP in 2000 when I was a freshmen in highschool . My face only recovered about 85%. It sucks but I have lived a normal life and even dated hot chicks. That Is great to hear! I also bagged an awesome husband so its has not ruined my life or anything. It just ruins my own self esteem. Haha I got BP in 2000, at the end of 8th grade. It is what it is at this point. I plan to try Botox to get a little more symmetry. \n\nI was wondering if us \"BP lifers\" should have a weekly discussion thread or a separate sub? Sometimes I want to talk about it but some of the newer / temporary BP people get freaked out if you mention you are still affected years later... When you said that you can tell in pictures especially after you had a couple drinks, I felt that haha I am closing in on 4 years, and progress stalled out after a few weeks. I am about 80% recovered. Now it is just an ongoing aggravation with an occasional minor flare up when I am tired. I have been wondering about Botox too. If you set something like that up I would love to join in on the conversation. It would be very interesting to hear what has helped other people or if anything can help after we have all been dealing with BP for this long. Sorry you are going through that. Thanks so much for sharing!! Hey, I definitely have not had it as long but I just left the neurologist with not so good news. I got Bell\u2019s in January of this year, so almost 4 months. \n\nI have had no progress and both of the doctors I have seen told me they expect really slow progress, if any. They even suggested metal weight implants in my eye to help me sleep/blink. \n\nI have another appointment at Stanford University to see a facial nerve specialist in June to hopefully get better news. \n\nAt first, this was extremely devastating. I fell into a pretty deep depression and social isolated myself. You guys give me hope that if it does not get better, I will still be okay. \n\nI would totally be down for joining a \u201clong term Bell\u2019s\u201d sub-Reddit Oh my gosh, I am so sorry you are going through that. That would be devastating. The body is an amazing thing though, you might be surprised what it can do, especially since you are so newly into this journey. Im here for you if you need to talk or anything!! I really appreciate that and I may reach out to you for advice Same here. Most people tell me they could not even tell that I have some sort of facial paralysis but I never believe them, haha. I find it to be so obvious but that is probably my self consciousness. Pictures are a hard thing to get over, especially when you can look at old pictures and see a full smile. I just keep saying that things could be so much worse though, that makes me feel better at least. 4 years, not fully recovered, but my recovery was mostly in month 6-12. it was pretty weird, because i fully expected never to use a straw again. i can almost use a straw without thinking about it now and can definitely smirk at people, which is really all i need. dont lose hope, you might get a bit of your face back yet! but also.... if you dont, life moves on. sorry for the last bit of shit advice.\n\nedit: its been closer to 6 years lol I got BP when I was 8 months pregnant with my son 14 years ago. I am 85% recovered and have had multiple rounds of Botox to try to help with the symmetry. Make sure you find a provider that is familiar with BP because they can make the drooping worse. I miss my smile too and run from the camera. Being on zoom for work is miserable. Have you tried B-12 vitamins? I get scared when I feel a tingle in my ear or my vision gets blurry thinking it is returning. Those times, I up the vitamins and head to bed. I would love to hear what other long timers have tried. I am happy others bounced back so quickly. Never tried B-12. Maybe I should give that a try. There is a Bell's Palsy subreddit that I just joined and I have been chatting with other long term sufferers. Makes me feel better knowing I am not the only one who did not fully recover. Thanks for sharing your story!! I would join your group. Let me know. A chatroom can be assembled.", "Can Bells Palsy cause migraines?

I am almost 90% my Bells Palsy was caused by my son's hand foot and mouth disease.\n\nI recently started getting what I believe are migraines or cluster headaches at the end of November. Could the two be related? I almost never had headaches before.\n\nHas anyone experienced this months after?", "Help! Am I being paranoid? Hey guys! I had Bells back in 2016, it took a couple of months but I fully recovered.\n\nEvery few months (anywhere from 1-8 months in between) I get nerve pain /  cramping on the Bells side of my face and jaw. It can be quite painful, but usually goes away after a few days. It is usually shooting pain up the side of my jaw and behind my ear, and the skin on that side of my face feels very tender and sensitive.\n\nThis time around, it has been happening for about 4 days, but the symptoms are a bit different. In addition to everything else, My upper lip has been twitching intermittently, and so has my eyelid. My eyelid feels very heavy. I have started feeling a little bit numb, which has been gradually getting worse, but I cannot tell if my brain is playing tricks on me or if my face is actually numbing again! When I look in the mirror my face still seems to work well.\n\nMy office is around the corner from a hospital, and I am really tempted to go to the ER and see if they can tell me if it is coming back or not. Is that an overreaction? Would they even be able to conclusively tell me, or would I just have to wait and see anyway? Could they do anything even if it is coming back?\n\nThank you!! If you think you have Bell\u2019s palsy go to a doctor right away you need to get on steroids as soon as possible for the best chance of recovery. Do not be an idiot", "Blurry vision I was diagnosed with Bells on August 18th of 2018. Though most of it went away(I had a sever case) I obviously still have some residual effects of the disorder. One thing that seems to be a chronic issue is my vision has been getting blurry from time to time. Mainly the peripheral vision. Has anyone else had issues with vision after the bells \u201csubsided\u201d? I got diagnosed March 2019. My vision on that side was blurry immediately.  I just always assumed it was because my eye was dirty from not blinking. \n\nI am only about 75% recovered (lower lip on the bad side is still basically uncontrollable and my eyebrow is slow/weak) but seem to have plateaued.  I have full control of my eyelid, but that side has significantly worse vision, also. Definitely almost exactly what I am dealing with right now. I presume that I will end up getting an Rx for a single contact lens or something if it does not resolve itself.  Assuming doctors recommended, of course. I have had 20/20 vision in both eyes up until now. :-( Man I am right there with you. I never had any vision issues until this bs started. What a wrench in the engine of life this is smh I was first diagnosed 30 some years ago. 22+ years with only 70-80% and recent episode bringing me back to 0% last June. About 60% now. I have been to tons of specialists over the years and had the same problems in my left eye. New doc sent me to a decent optometrist. I thought my eye was just getting lazy or something from the BP, but the doc said it was dry.\n\nEye drops. Systane Eye drops. It has made a world of difference! The blurred vision is gone. I get the occasional 'dry' feeling now. Now that I know that is what it is, I use the drops as needed or at least once a day, and its fine now. You can find them just about anywhere. I use Systane Gel at night and Balance or High Performance during the day. The brand makes a huge difference. Visine etc did not help at all.  Good luck! I was actually thinking if it could be because they eye isnt working properly and getting dry? Thanks for the advice! I recommend getting the two pack of drops. It has one gel and one high performance. Be sure to use the gel at night, or when it is really bothersome. It will make your sight blurry for a bit, but is an amazing help. Then during the day use the high performance a few times throughout the day to start. You should, hopefully, start noticing an improvement soon. I also wear glasses (nearly non existent prescription) to cut down on the chance of any debris getting in the eye, and wind drying it out more. I am definitely going to stop at the pharmacy and pick them up. Its worth the try Actually just ordered 2 and 2 on amazon. Thanks again The other solution for a dry BP-eye: just eat something tasty! \ud83d\ude02 That eye'll tear right up for you. \n\nUgh, at least for me. Lmao. Yes i get that from time to time when im eating. All of a sudden my eye just starts dumping tears. I already have a bad eye sight before BP and I just thought I needed new glasses. But the eyedrops does work wonders, my eyes are back to 'normal' now. Sigh I am not having such good luck. I am going to have to go to a doctor because my eyes seem to have become more blurry and now I am starting to become more stressed and worried. This BP shit is the worst", "I got to wear this so I do not constantly fuck with my face lol  Hang in there!!  I wish you a speedy recovery!! I got an eye patch and I already have a curly moustache so I am pirate gang for the next couple weeks! Hey you look like me! Hang in there fellow pirate. Hope we recover quickly How far along are you if I may ask? This is my fourth day. Left side now fully paralyzed", "6+ months into a BP recovery - AMA I continue to improve but it is been a long struggle.  Learned a lot along the way.  I am not a medical professional so always consult with your doctor. Coming up to 4 months. Getting my smile back finally. Still feel crap going on in my face all the time. What has been the worst part for you?  I hated not having my voice and people not being able to read my face.  Undoubtedly eye strain and dryness.  I work in IT so staring at a monitor has at times impossible.  I ended up taking a 12 week leave of absence \\- which my employer was great about.  It is getting better all the time but the weird part is that I now have all this tightness around the affected side of my face.  I saw a neurological opthomologist and he said that things are recovering but different nerves/muscle groups recover at different times around the eye which is having an impact on my vision.  Just feeling fortunate it seems to come back \\- I am told it is often the last muscle group to heal. No question but want to say stay strong Thanks! Staring at a screen all day is a killer on the eye. My eye improved two weeks ago when I could close it without the other eye also closing. \nI run my own business so could not take anytime off and would work till my eye was too sore to carry on.  But I work from home so it made it all a bit easier. \nI think another 6 weeks and i will be pretty much back to normal but that will be about 5 months of wonky face which I would not wish on anybody.  I would just recommend, if you are not already, seeing an opthamologist on a regular basis so he/she can monitor your eye health.  If you push through too hard you could potentially do long term damage to your eye.  Lotamax \\(steroid lube\\) has been a god send for me.", "Just diagnosed Hey guys so I have just been diagnosed with BP any tips? If its fairly noticeable, get ready for a lot of \u201cwhat happened to your face?\u201d. Just keep a funny/clever answer with you to reply I would go to an acupuncturist it helps a lot Try to relax as much as possible so the nerves can loosen up. This is a great time for Bell\u2019s palsy because you can hide it with a mask. You will be ok but try acupuncture or massage. I went for electro therapy for awhile, my insurance covered it Take the steroids and anti-viral meds as prescribed by the doctor, massage your face constantly, acupuncture is amazing, and excercise in the mirror.\n\nI have had Bells Palsy for 7 years. I am still not fully recovered. I would say I am  60%, but I still cannot smile. I am sorry you have to go through this. It is awful, but you have this community! Ya, definitely take the medication(s) as recommended by your doctor. Probably a steroid and anti-viral within.\n\nI purchased an online course ( from a physical therapist to help with the treatment. I did not do the electronic muscle stimulant as i read some negative things about them. I did do the recommended exercises 2-3 times a day.\n\nAdditionally and what I credit my fast recovery to - I saw a chiropractor who specializes in TMJ and Bell\u2019s Palsey treatment. He did an adjustment on my temporal lobe and I continued seeing him twice a week and am still seeing him. To be honest, it was super painful but I wanted to do everything i possibly could to fix this.\n\nLastly, I took B12 daily and would get a B12 shot on the affected side (in the arm) once a week.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and I will be happy to answer!\n\n*note, I am note a medical professional. I recommend getting your own diagnosis.* I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. \nMy advice outside of what is already been mentioned taking a prescribed medications, is to take care of your mental health. Most people heal within a few weeks, but if you do not, that does not mean you will not heal eventually. I did not see any movement at all for three months, and I fell into a depression. I wish I had known that it would get better eventually. I am at 5 months now and about 70% recovered. Also, there are a couple great Facebook groups for people with BP that helped me a lot. Stay strong, you got this! I was diagnosed about 3 weeks ago. I am seeing progress every day, yesterday I could not fully close my left eye, today I can. I was taking a high dose steroid for 10 days,I have been taking b12 vitamin twice a week. Exercising, taking eye drops, eating healthily, trying to avoid stress. That is an important one. You want to keep stress to an absolute minimum. I have also been following this ( and this ( daily and I think it is helped a lot. I am 3 weeks in and seeing a lot of progress. Still not all there but I am on the mend. I am sorry you are dealing with this. It can be very scary but research, educate yourself about it so you understand it better and remember you are not alone. Also, buy yourself a set of sun glasses if you do not have any already. It helps stop the eye from becoming dry from the wind. Good luck on your recovery Most of the recommendations above are spot on.\nMy partner is an acupuncturist and has had remarkable results treating Bells Palsy with accupuncture and herbal medicine.  I highly recommend looking into those treatments.\n\n", "So I was diagnosed with BP yesterday and one of the first things I did was check for a subreddit. Not surprised to find it! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b  Did you recently get vaccinated? That is what I did too! This is a great group for support That is what happened to me. I was diagnosed a month after my second dose of Pfizer. No I got my first shot in January same here. end of may vaccination and symtpons started showing this week. I really hope that this subreddit does not become anti vax. Of course more people coming here with Bell\u2019s palsy are going to have been vaccinated, the vaccine is becoming more available! I really hope that this subreddit does not become anti vax. Of course more people coming here with Bell\u2019s palsy are going to have been vaccinated, the vaccine is becoming more available! I do not get anti vaxers Being anti covid shot is not being anti vax.. Huge difference. Plus, vaccines have been linked to bells palsy in the past, so why would it be any different for the covid shot?.\n\n \n\nNot anti vax, but I am anti covid shot. Vaccines in the past induce bells.. Whos to say this vaccine cant ? Not enough studies yet.. ", "Can you move your ear or neck? Is it normal for Bell's pallsy that I cannot move my ear and a part of my neck on my affected side? Should the face paralysis affect areas that far from the face? Did anybody else also experience that? I found information on the Internet that the ear movement can be affected in people that can voluntary move it but I did not find anything about the neck. I found another post that says it sometimes affects the neck muscels too:  When I was diagnosed October 26. It started from a neck pain to my head. My left side was paralyzed. I would have ear pain as well as so much swelling on my left face and neck. It almost felt as if I slept wrong and my neck hurt the next morning. I got migraines and feel as if I had congestion above my cheek and nose and also forehead on my eyebrows. But it was all swelling combined with numbness. My left neck and head from the back hurt for 2 weeks until the swelling went away. Unfortunately the steroids given to me had terrible side affects I had to stop them at day two. I am about 3 weeks in... I have regained some movement of my mouth and eyebrow, but still cannot move my ear on the affected side.  Not sure what you mean about neck movement, though... i do not think I have ever been able to move \"part of\" my neck.  Prior to BP, I could wiggle my ears (both at the same time) and flare my nostrils (both at the same time).  Now, the BP side just does not respond. I am not sure how to describe it. When I tense my neck muscles from my jaw to my clavicles something (I do not know how to describe this part of the anathomy. English is my second language) moves under my skin on one side more than on the other. When I push out my jaw forward my neck moves symmetrically. When I try to move the area where my clavicle is (it is not possible to move the clavicle but I guess I move the skin over it?) One side of the neck moves and stands out, the other side not so much, only a little. I need to tense my jaw strongly to do it which I can only do on my good side so maybe that is the reason it looks assymetrical. \n\nSorry for this weirdly specific question. I am just worried. I am also almost 3 weeks in (day 19) and there is no much improvement in movement. At least my head does not hurt (only very rearely and not much). After two weeks I do not feel like I have a bruise on the half of my face and twitching stopped. Recently I do not feel constantly dizzy. I did not want to risk driving a car before. I just have this constant ringing and oversenstitivity to sounds in one ear still but it is improving slowly each week. \n\nFinally I can sleep for 8 hours a day thanks to my sleeping pills and the absence of the head splitting pain. At some point I could not fall aleep at night until the pain turned up and then sleep would be impossible. I am just tired but I am allowing myself to be as tired as I want to be and do as little as I want to do and not feel guilty about. \n\nI also lost almost 4kg in a week and a half. I have never lost that much weight even when I was very actively exercising. I am probably loosing muscle mass I will not be able to rebuild. And I did not drink enought water (I corrected that). I am conflicted because I do not want to gain weight because of the steroids but I need my strenght to recover.\n\nI also see worse in my right eye because I cannot close it. Everything is much more blurry. Maybe it is just because of the eyedrops but I am worried about the damage to my cornea. My right eye was always weaker as a result of childchood strabismus which can cause amblyopia, lazy eye, or loss of depth perception. Nothing bothered me that much so far. I just did not like watching 3d movies because they gave me headaches. I guess I subconsiously moved my head more to measure distances but it did not affect my life that much.\n\nAnother symptom I am worried about are spelling mistakes while typing. Maybe I am just getting old, or too sleep deprived and I forgot the spelling of some pretty common words. Or maybe because of my bad eyesight I push the wrong letters while typing. Or maybe it is caused by some brain damage. I will have an MRI tomorrow. Maybe I will know after that. \nSorry I needed to vent. I have no good advice, only sympathy to offer. :\\\\  &lt;-- B.P. smile, LOL\n\nI hope you have a quick and full recovery!  I had the eye blurriness too; it only improved a few days ago for me. I think it was partly dryness, partly from the glycerin eyedrops I was using at night.  I still have shooting pains below my ear, but I try to take encouragement from the fact that every day is a little better in some way, whether increased moement or new movement in an area that was not previously responsive. Hang in there! Thank you :/ ;)", "Weird feeling in my chin!? I cannot tell if it is  numbness/pins and needles or if I am just not used to being so aware of feeling in my face that bouts of feeling could make me feel like that. It feels like a slow pulsating wave through the left side of my chin to the center of it. It lasts for maybe 30 seconds and then is gone. It is such a weird sensation and I do not know what it is/means has anyone else experienced it?  That is exactly how  I first experienced BP, except it lasted for hours over a couple of days.\n See this is so weird for me because I have had the Bell\u2019s for a little over 2 months now! So that is why I think it is such a weird feeling!  How much movement have you recovered? Could be nerves coming back to life.  I can close my eye 80-90% of the way depending on the day and stress level! Also, I can move the corner of my mouth about an eighth of an inch. The bigger differences though are that my eye is less droopy and my lips do not pull down and out as much!  I am 7 weeks into BP and I have noticed that if I rub on my chin, it starts to swell a bit and pulse, it is super strange! I am not sure if this is what you are talking about but it is really odd and feels funny, was not sure if this was normal or not  Yessss omg right after reading this I rubbed my face and it had that feeling! That is exactly what I am talking about it is soooo weird!!   It is the strangest thing! I was actually at the doctor\u2019s today and explained it to her. She said it was not anything to be concerned about...had me pretty freaked out though the first time I realized it!  That is good at least!! It confused the crap out of me and I could not figure out what it was that was making it happen! I guess it is any pressure/stimulation to that area that I feel it! It is so confusing to explain, but it is such an odd sensation!  Yes...well I am glad I am not the only one, it was driving me nuts, tried googling and no luck! Mine just came about the other day  Ugh while I am sorry you are going through it too, I am glad that you are as well. It is nice not to feel so alone in this!! ", "How can I help my 9yo daughter My daughter woke up this morning unable to shut her eye, she did not tell me, by the time I picked her up from school she hadnt blinked naturally all day and her mouth was drooping aswell. I took her to the doctor and they said she has Bells Palsy. They have prescribed her 10 days worth of steroids, eye drops and eye ointment and advised me to tape her eye shut at night, I got some paper tape from the pharmacy. Any advice on what I need to do to help her? She is her normal happy self other than her eye irritating her a bit. I am constantly reminding her to manually blink her eye I am sorry to hear about it. I would say meditating with her could help, it has helped me a lot. I used the 21 days of abundance from deepak chopra (you can find it on spotify). Not sure how a 9 year old would receive it, but i would definitely give it a try.\n\nI got nice eyepatches, which is a good conversation starter with my friends and coworkers. I think they are pretty cool.\n\nAlso vitamin b12 has helped me. Not sure the amount for a child, but i would check with a doctor.\n\nAlso, I have a friend who had the same when she was 10, and she healed completely within a few weeks. Sending her and you lots of positive energy. I find 3M Nextape sensitive skin tape (it is blue) to be more comfortable for eye taping than the paper tape. \n\nHave her get lots of rest and keep her affected side from getting cold (it tends to tighten up the muscles which can be painful). Get her an eye patch for sleeping so she does not scratch her eye in the night.\n\nIf she is open to acupuncture, it is worth trying. A lot of us have had success with it. \n\nI hope she has a very speedy recovery! Do not hesitate to tape her eye during the day if it is irritating her.  It is important to take care of that eye. Would an eye patch help for when she goes back to school? The first time I had Bells Palsy, I was four, and my mom would just let me keep my eye open throughout the day, and give me eye drops every few hours. Is there a school nurse that could help give her eye drops during the day, maybe at recess/lunch time? if not, an eye patch may be a good idea. Genteal Severe eye drops will help protect the eye. Tape it shut during the day if needed, an eye patch will help but it will not keep it from drying out. Either tape or a patch would work depending on what she is comfortable with. I got an eye patch from an optometrist which she seems to quite like so will go with that at school, pretty much just for when she is outside and will keep taping it shut at night I will give them a ring this evening and see if they cam put the drops in at lunch time I hope she has a speedy recovery!! I used eye drops several times a day including an eye patch at night to stop me itching/scratching. Acupuncture, B12 Vitamins. \n\nI am 3 weeks in and almost 100% recovered. Just try everything you can.", "Raise your hand if you have gotten Bell's on both sides... \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Yeah... so I managed to get BP twice... within weeks of each other. The first time was this last February on my left half, the second was March... on my right side. Luckily, the second occurrence had the same bells (pun intended) rung as the first one-- head/ear ache, sudden fatigue, etc. and was able to get started on medication the very same day and recovered I would say about 95% thus far, post treatment. Unfortunately for the left side, I was advised to wait to come in and was about 48 hours too late for treatment to be most effective. It is been roughly 3 months and I would say it is about 70% recovered. \n\nBut man. Fuck this... whatever it is. This shit has been such a pain in the ass and such a nightmare to deal with every day. It is like when you break your arm and everyone sees your cast and asks about it all the time... but on your face. And I am really tired of chewing my lip when I eat. \n\nAm I a lone wolf on this one? Anybody else had it on both sides simultaneously? \ud83d\ude4b Sorry to hear that shit man. I only have it on one side and it is a pain in my ass no doubt. But it is actually more mental to me. I just have to keep my hopes up that it will go away. I am my daughters soccer/bball coach and I can barely speak, so yelling is way out of the question.  \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\nFirst time was Sept 2012 (23 years old), out shopping with my mom for her birthday and the right side of my face slowly stops working...I more or less knew was it was because other people in my family had had it so we did not freak out and actually kept shopping, then went to minor emergency on the way home. It never FULLY recovered, probably about 85%. Really bad synkinesis with my eye (where it closes too much from over compensating. Aka I look like I have a droopy eye) \n\nSecond time was Nov 2016 (27 yrs old), had some ear pain and a sore on my tongue, got \"let go\" from my job and on my last day on the way home, bam, not facial movement on the left side of my face. Since it happened so suddenly and I had pain that I did not have the first time, I went to the ER (took an Uber because I was pretty sure it was not a stroke and did not want to have to pay for an ambulance, but also was not sure enough to drive). \n\nSo now I basically have nothing that resembles a smile, the right side of my mouth kind of goes up but the left does not at all. And I look like I am really good at raising one eyebrow, but that is only because the other one does not move. \n\nLuckily my eye lids both work well and were only out of commission for a bit so no eye issues. But my lips still not working right pisses me off every day. I have come to terms with the lack of smile, but eating and brushing my teeth is such a pain!!! \n\nSmall silver lining.....will be much less prone to wrinkles since my face does not move!!!  I am happy to say that the left side, while not 100%, continues to recover. I have been massage my face and you can feel these weird bands \ud83d\ude33 I also had BP twice but at a young age. The first time was about 6th grade, I had 100% recovery from that episode in about 3 weeks. The second one I was 15 I think, and I did not get to go to the doctor for a few days, so I got back about 85% control I would say, I cannot quite smile all the way on that side so everyone thinks I am smirking all the time. But now I am 31 and it is not really an issue, the only people that really know are people that knew me when it happened and my wife.  \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb first time was right side and it went away in 2 weeks. Got it years later on the left side and I still have not recovered after 7.5 years.  I got it on one side 17 years ago and on the other side about two years ago. A friend of mine and her mom have both had it three times each, each time on the opposite side as the previous attack. But I feel for you getting it on both sides...be strong and have faith!  Holy hell that is... Shitty! Question, have any of you noticed a significant decline in your hearing? Mine is pretty bad compared to what I used to be.  Oh no, that is the worst! I hear fine out of it, but I do hear a rhythmic (with my heartbeat) \"whooshing\" kind of pulsing sound in my ear on my bell's side. It started the day of my attack and has persisted ever since. It is gotten ever so slightly better over time, and it is not constant, but it is still there...that is all I have noticed.  Mine's like my ears are plugged. Constantly.", "Botox and other injections? Hey all! \n\nI have responded on here a few times but I have never posted myself. I had BP in 2014 and unfortunately still have some residual side effects. My eyes and mouth are oddly connected. When I talk my eye moves and this same eye looks smaller than the other.\n\nI do not have any expectations but has anyone ever tried  Botox, fillers or any other injections? Ive heard positive and negative things about it but I would love some first hand feedback.  I have. Limited results and nothing bad to report. I have heard incredible stores but it seems that the practitioner giving the injection matter a ton with BP. They need to map the muscles on your face first and then proceed accordingly. Mine was not trained for that.\n\nAgain, no damage and some minimal relaxing of the platysma and other muscles but I do plan on going again after finding someone.", "(Question) Any Tips on regaining Taste and Speech Therapy? Looking for any pointers that could help restore taste on the right side of tongue?\n\nAlso any at home speech therapy suggestions ?  A list of words to practice saying everyday?\n\nThanks again!! I feel like I always just taste salt on that side of my mouth, like all day with every food regardless if there is any salt in it. Damn, I have this bland part on my tongue and I am trying to figure out how to revert it.\n\nBut I do know one thing . . Have you had curry?  That is the one thing I can eat that is still amazing. I am doing research on it.  To see if I can find something for all of us.\n\nHow long have you been diagnosed? What is your time line look like? Only about 3 weeks. I think I can taste curry (my combined spices of cumin, tumeric, and ginger), but it all tastes like flavored salt. Hmm,  I havent had this XP yet.  However this is only day 5.  If I find out anything i will let you know. My taste started returning after around two weeks. Once I noticed that a little taste had returned, my taste buds felt completely normal after a day or two. \n\nI do not have, or have heard of speech therapy suggestions for BP patients. However, I hope you are doing face exercises to help regain control of your afflicted half. I have actually recovered about 70/more percent control and taste and speech has returned to 100.\nI am doing acupuncture this Friday to see if that will tie everything up.\n\nI am going to share my whole experience with the BP community once the acupuncture is complete.", "BP and 3rd Booster Vaccine Hi all, has anyone who has BP in the past received their 3rd Pfizer/Moderna booster shot? I have a compromised immune and had BP in May. I would say I am almost fully recovered with just the occasional jaw soreness and back of ear pain. Would love to get the booster shot but wanted to just hear about anyone's experience. I had the Pfizer vaccine and 5 months later got a mild case of BP on my left side of my face. Nothing drooping and just the half a smile and watery left eye. I also had some ear swelling. Cleared up after about 3 weeks and they have not said they will give the booster shots in the USA yet. OF course none of the doctors says BP was due to the vaccine. I however, am kind of worried that if I get it then I might get a worse case of BP next time. Problem is my wife and I own a business that has been mandated now by the governor to get the vaccine. So I will also assume they will mandate the booster as well. Interesting as all the docs I saw from urgent care to my primary care all asked about how long it was from when my BP started to when my 2nd shot was. To be super clear, I would still take the vaccine again in a heartbeat as well as this booster shot when it becomes available to me. I will be making an appointment with my primary care doc to get advice on when I should take the 3rd shot and go from there. Was hoping to see if anyone perhaps 'prepped' and took more multivitamins, B12 etc before getting the booster shot. To me, BP recovery can be inconvenient but they know how to treat it unlike covid, its variants and the unknown long term impact. Yeh, but BP can also have long lasting effects in some people. My worry is the booster will cause me to have worse effects. I am probably going to get the booster especially seeing that i dont want to jeopardize a 6 figure income just cause of it. I got my second shot jan 14th so I am 8 months past that already. Ive had BP for a year now, the only thing that improved for me was my left eye being able to blink on its own . ive been hesitant on the vaccine because of it. And reading this makes me more hesitant since my BP has not improved much. My left side isnt as droopy like it was in the start its improved in that the most, but i can still see the difference. My vertigo and left ear ringing are still there. Really dont want it to effect the little recovery ive been able to make", "Twitching a year after recovering from Bells Palsy I had BP back in February 2020, and started to recover after taking a steroid. I regained motion on the left side of my face, but I still have asymmetry. Basically stopped thinking about it though since I have a thick beard and my speech is normal. \n\nFor the past 6 months I have been getting twitching on my nose and upper lip, especially when going to bed. My doctor told me it is unrelated and that I should stop drinking coffee. It helped a little bit it still happens. \n\nToday it occurred to me to look up twitching in BP recovery and discovered that it is a part of the recovery process and I got kind of excited. Looked in the mirror and pushed my beard out of the way to find my asymmetry has reduced drastically. I am wondering if I should start massaging my face to help ease the nerves. I am really excited to find that I am still recovering. That is amazing to hear!! So happy for you. Facial massage sounds helpful. That is wonderful!!! Yes, I suppose massage would help. Really positive news for us. Thanks for sharing! :) I have had it twice (opposite sides) and the recovery for me slowed down at the end. The asymmetry crept back all most unnoticed over time, it felt like 6 months to get back the last few percent, and it is not until one day you look in the mirror and notice it is mostly better.", "Venting. I (25F) was diagnosed in late October of last year. They told me it could take up to six months to a year to completely heal. The right side of my face was basically frozen for maybe two months before I noticed I could move my eyebrow a little or smile more. \n\nTalking, eating and drinking was just super difficult. I had to hold my lips together to drink from a straw, which was embarrassing. Food was just disgusting for like two weeks. I had to take a leave of absence from college too. I could not shut my right eye on its own and as a photographer, and photo student, it was so difficult. My vision was blurry a lot of the time on my right side, too. I could not read very well for long, I did not trust myself to drive, etc. \n\nI did not even let myself process any of what was happening because I had to work and was in school. It was super stressful and I had to keep moving forward.  If i did not take a leave from college,  I would have failed most of my classes. It gave me more time to just work and save money and focus on my mental health. I actually just got promoted, too! Not sure how going back to school will work but we will figure it out. \n\nNow, my smile is still a little crooked and I can feel the tightness in muscles in my face, especially around my eye. The right eye feels tighter when I laugh and I notice myself shutting that eye more than my left when I laugh. \n\nSometimes I have a hard time focusing when reading. But. Here I am, barely three months in and I am freaking out because I am not at 100%. \n\nI think the hardest part is not stressing about it. I do not have a lot of time to relax and sleeping is super difficult lately because I am on overnight shifts now. Until I was writing this, I did not even realize that it JUST happened a few months ago and that is not a lot of time to start worrying. \n\nI was just trying to read a book without my glasses on, like I normally do laying down, and I could not focus super well again. Tried it with glasses and it was only a little better and I thought I would moved past that part of this. It is just very frustrating because you want things to be normal again but theres no real certainty that you will get any better. \n\n\n\nStay strong out there! \u2764\ufe0f I think you cannot really expect 100% recovery. Sure it happens, but... Why set yourself up for failure?\n\nI had a fairly mild case nearly three years ago now. Paralysis of the jaw area along with a bit of my eye, and my eye watered a ton, though I could still close it for the most part. I was mostly recovered from the paralysis after 1-2 months.\n\nToday (will be three years in May), my eye is still a bit watery at sometimes, and in photos I can still see it in my face, if you know what I mean (tho I admit it seems like nearly everyone has had a touch at some point). One eye seems a bit off with certain poses, but no one is really that symmetric if you start looking.\n\nI still have a bit of synkiniesis, where my eyelid will droop a bit depending on my lip position. I also have a fairly loud pulse in my ear which effects my hearing a bit sometimes. Over learned to ignore it for the most part.\n\nSo I definitely cannot say I am 100%, but it is what it is, and frankly I am happy to be healthy and alive. Things could be so much worse and these side effects are mostly just inconveniences, so I feel lucky.\n\nYour approach of not stressing about it is the best approach. A B-complex vitamin and sone L-lysine probably could not hurt. Folks mention acupuncture... I am not really a proponent, but whatever works for you.\n\nTake care. Thank you! Everyone I have talked to said that it looks so much better and that they cannot even tell what happened. I guess I am just nitpicking my looks apart lol\n\nAnd though it almost looks back to 100%, it surely does not feel like it. I do not think I feel the same as I did from before. So maybe that is why I want to go back to normal so badly? \n\nI definitely am glad that it was Bell\u2019s Palsy and not a stroke. This whole experience has made me realize that I need to take time for me more often and work on my stress/anxiety levels. \n\nI will definitely look into the vitamins. The acupuncture, maybe not since I am not so good with needles and do not have insurance haha\n\nThanks again! :)  I am ~1.5 years in.  After about 2 months it was hard for anyone to notice that I had it unless they knew what they were looking for.  I still feel the same tightness in my face and I close the eye on that side of my face often to the point that my vision in  that eye has gotten noticeably worse (albeit it was not ever perfect, i have been prescribed glasses that i never wear since i was 5 years old).  I would love to think that someday my face will feel normal and that i wont be cock-eyed when i look down or over my shoulder... but i have personally come to grips with the fact that this might be the way I am for the rest of my life.  It could have been a lot worse.\n\nPS: Try CBDs, they helped me quite a bit. Wow man. It was about six weeks for me and I was back to normal. At least what feels like normal. I am so sorry you are dealing with this. Good luck!  Thanks! You are very lucky that you healed so quickly!  It could have been worse and I am just glad it was not a stroke.  Since I am so reliant on my glasses I am sure I need a new prescription to see better through my right eye. \n\nHopefully things get easier for all of us! Lol \n\n\nBut that is definitely something to think about! \nThank you again!", "should I try acupuncture? does acupuncture help for old cases of bell's palsy? I had it about a year ago and I started treatment immediately, it took me months to recover and it was not 100% recovery, I would say it is 60% there, I still cannot move my eyebrow or lips that much and I have synkinesis. I read somewhere here that someone tried acupuncture after years of having bell's palsy and it helped them, I also asked around and some people seem to have positive feed back but some of them say it does not do anything \ndoes anyone have experience with this? should I do it or is it a waste of time I did it pretty soon after onset and I think it helped.  Any stimulation of the muscles/nerves in that area has to help. Wen u first got it after how long did u start seeing movement? it didnt help me, but i would still try it. you dont have anything to lose except a bit of time and money  I have done acupuncture and find that it does help. Hurts a little and they massage my face very roughly to stimulate the nerves and get a response after performing the needles. I think it is good though and means you are responding. I find that I walk away feeling as though my face has been stressed and the muscles are a lot looser and less tight. With BP your muscles are inactive. It is almost like physical therapy - you need to reactivate these muscles and \u201cwork them out.\u201d It hurts and there is soreness but to me that means progress. Def give it a try I started doing acupuncture about 2 months in. I think I did about 6 sessions, one every week the last 2 were with electro stimulation with needles under a current. They also did quite rough massaging.\nI had some improvement during this period, but I cannot say if I would have had similar, less or more improvement in this period due to natural recovery.\n\nAfter 6 treatments I decided to stop for various reasons. I always felt really tired, got a headache and felt like picking afterwards. I also got very stressed having to lie still and unable to move much with the needles all over my face, head and body. (While I wanted to reduce my stress) the sessions also take about an hour, so quite a long time and they are not cheap.\nIn the end it felt like they were doing me more harm than healing, so I discontinued.\n\nI am continuing more gentle massage and exercises.", "Bell's palsy recovery time Hello everyone! Is it possible for recovery to happen suddenly, or it always happens gradually? Thank you. It can happen instantly or you can see small milestones along the way. It is completely subjective. Mine was not overnight, I think I got used to it and then one day was like oh wow it is better, so I do not really know the time frame...if that makes any sense My first two weeks or so showed absolutely no improvement. After that, I noticed that I was able to move my eyebrow 1 milimeter or so. Very slight movement, but it was better than the absolutely zero movement I had been dealing with so far.\n\nAfter that, I could see my face getting more control every day, and by day 30 I had recovered 99%.\n\nSo it was not an instant recovery, but I do consider my recovery time pretty fast overall :) Pretty sure it is different for everyone but I think we can agree it gradually gets better. You start to gain strength in you eye then that is when you know. After After your senses start to reappear Not to be the party pooper in here, but everyone recovery/experience is entirely different. I had physiotherapy 3 times a week, with 2 of those being acupuncture appointments, did stuff at home, took my meds, etc etc, and I began to see improvement around the 5 month mark. At 3 years, I have never regained full control. You really grow with it, if you are lucky enough to heal quickly take it as it is. But surely do not beat yourself up over it - this recovery is not linear. Thank you for your comments!", "Pain in back of head/behind ear I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy two weeks ago, and have recently finished a steroid cycle of prednislone. My GP has told me that unless it worsens, there is not much more they can do to help. At the moment, I am now dealing with weird pain, it is like a throbbing or pinching at the back of my head mainly. Is this normal, and is there any way to help combat it? \n\nAlso is there any kind of painkillers or supplements I should take if I really need to relieve pain? I had pain behind/under my ear when it first started and again as it started to go away. \n\nIt was always mild enough that a little ibuprofen took care of it. I would check with you GP as to their recommendation but I would imagine that they would suggest some OTC pain meds. But it is worth checking in with them just in case they want to have you see a specialist to rule out complications. Check with your GP of course for professional advice but I am pretty sure this is normal - at least I had it too but in my outer ear.\nI did not take pain medication for it as the two OTC painkillers I had to hand did not do much to alleviate it and it was not so bad as for me to seek out anything stronger. I had pretty bad pain one time, like cannot sleep. It went away in a few weeks, but it sucked. It should go away eventually. My doctor said it is normal. Warm compress helped me. It is most likely nerve pain so you can talk to your doctor about Gabapentin. I was pregnant at the time so I could not take that but I have heard it helps. My physical therapist asked me about pain in my neck and headaches. He said the weakness of the muscles to my neck can cause pain in the back of my neck and headaches from compensating. I had shocking pain the week after my steroids finished. Like could not sleep at all kind of pain. Heat packs helped and it only lasted about a week. Good luck mate \ud83d\udc4d", "Diagnosed with atypical bells palsy today Linked to a cold sore I had last week. It is a typical cos the paralysis is localised to just my mouth and eye/ and my forehead is unaffected. It is very mild in terms of appearance. But it is painful. I was prescribed 50mg of prednisone for 7 days. I waited 24 hours before going to the ER. was this too late to start? Also does it resolve after a round of steroids?", "4 months into Bells.. 4 months ago the whole story started.  \nAfter 3 months my mouth started to recover but until today my eyebrow is still doing very little.  \nI do facial exercises almost every day.  \n- Anyone have the same experience here?  \n- Eyebrow that lasts longer than mouth?  \n- After how much time did mouth or eyebrow begin to move?\n\nTo all the people here with BP, hang in there!\nIm positive! One of the reason is that im not alone with this weird stuff. \nAnd that i can share my story with you guys.\nIt is nice to talk with people who understands.\nThank you and thank you Reddit. It all takes time, and every case is different. Just relax and live your life around it. I did not have any movement for 6 months. Then suddenly corner of my mouth twitched when I was brushing my teeth in the evening. I honestly though I am going to cry with joy. In 2 weeks it will be 1 year since onset and I still feel it not being how it was, a bit tight, though I would say good 80% is back. To the point you cannot really tell i had it. My affected eyebrow does not lift as high as the other, and I cannot do fully symmetrical wide smile. My affected eye closes a bit when I eat.\nI had very good medical care, with steroids within 36h, MRI, emg and all. \n\n\nI see it there, if you pay attention you will see it too. It is going to be there most likely for ever at this stage, but I stopped worrying about it. I am just afraid to stand in a draft now \ud83d\ude05\nIf you absolutely need to get a palsy, this is the one to get. I am sure there are tons of people with similar experiences to yours. You will find them in the Facebook group which has about 16k members or something. This subreddit, good as it is, is nothing compared to that group. Best of luck to you Hi! Just curious. When you went to the doctors did they ever take tons amount of blood work? Did they ever find out how you got it. I just found out a had BP about a week ago! I am doing just a little bit better lol! They took some blood to exclude any other possible illness first. Do not remember if it was a tone though \ud83d\ude09.\n4 or 5 days before I got it I had an awful cold like never before. High temperature, shivers and stuff, took some paracetamol over night and felt better in the morning. I was also under quite a bit of stress doing my engineering masters and failing first exam in my life. So yeah, all the boxes ticked as to what might have caused it, therfore I have no idea.\n\nGood luck with yours and speedy recovery.", "Got Bell's around the 26th, and got diagnosed on the 30th. It really is horrible... The pain especially. It just came out of nowhere, I cannot believe it still. It worsened over the past week, and I went from only having a weird feeling on my tongue, to having horrible pain on the right side of my head (the affected side), to now being unable to move the right side of my face, close my right eye all the way, + all of the previous stuff. The pain is the worst part. It is making my life a living hell. It is so hard to get to sleep even with a bunch of sleeping pills and no amount of aspirin or acetaminophen seems to help the pain go away.\n\nI see my primary Dr. tomorrow on the 3rd. Hoping I can get some Prednizone and/or other stuff from them to help me recover faster as the ER I went to on the 30th did not give me anything to help except tell me what was wrong with me... If this lasts as long for me as some other people have it, it is going to become truly unbearable for me to live. The pain fucking sucks, I just want it to go away as fast as it possibly can.\n\nHas anyone had any luck with something to make the pain go away? I also had a lot of pain. The most helpful thing for me was a heating pad applied directly to my face. I am sorry, I have nothing to offer.  My Bell's was almost entirely pain-free.  I cannot even imagine. I had terrible pain for the first 3 weeks. Nothing helped it just took time. The ER should have given you steroids and anti viral drugs right away...that is irritating. I am 7 weeks in now and starting to get my smile back. The eye issues are my biggest complaint. Hang in there! Heating pad helped for me as well. The pain was waking me up at night. I took ibuprofen PM and put a heat pad on. It helped a lot. Hang in there. The pain lasted a week for me. I know exactly what you mean.  I had pain for about a week/week and a half.  It was like the entire side of my face was on fire.  It interrupted sleep and made life generally miserable.  All I can say is mine did eventually go away, and as it was lessening I was also gaining use of my face again.  \n\nI do find it a little strange that the ER did not prescribe anything to you.  From what I understand, they should have put you on a steroid a minimum, possibly an anti-viral as well (though, I have not had any medical training so I am not the best person to ask).  Hopefully your primary Dr. will correct that if necessary. I had a good deal of nerve pain too, I had predisone and after the doses the nerve pain was lowered but still prominent.  I was prescribed gabapentin for a month and that eased it too, eventually the pain stopped.", "Hearing issues getting worse I am going crazy here. I was diagnosed about 3 and a half weeks ago. I am very lucky that after 2 weeks, movement was coming back into my face. \nBut my hearing. OMG! Today it is so bad. Worse than ever! It is like a V8 is idling in my ear. \nAnyone else? What helps? Will it get better? I am going insane I have a pulse in my ear since BP. Right about a month after my onset, my BP symptoms had gotten much better, but I came down with a painful ear infection. Which was cured fairly quickly by antibiotics, but I was left with this ringing/pulse in my ear. Still there years later. Hammer on your doctor until they do something. I wish I would done more, but my doctor did not really seem to believe me at the time.", "How many of you have eczema?

I still get random nerve pain around my head and neck pain but not as frequently anymore.. I feel even though I recovered from bell\u2019s palsy as in the movement aspect of it, some nerve damage all around still lingers in me.. whether it be in hands or my feet.. it just sucks but I wont give up and just give it time(: if you all need someone to talk to, please do not hesitate to.", "Anyone have diagnosed Bell\u2019s Palsy with this presentation?  This is all involuntary and started 2 weeks after I received my first COVID vaccine. I have no personal or familial history of neurological disorders. Had my neurologist tell me it is anxiety. Bell's palsy is usually paralysis on one side of the face.\n\nIf your neurologist has not diagnosed it as bell's, I am guessing it is something else neurological going on. Another neurological problem is just as concerning. What did they diagnose you with? Even if they think the root cause is anxiety, what is the actually problem? Does he just call it an eye spasm?\n\nI would get another opinion if possible.\n\nIf anxiety is the cause, have they prescribed treatment like medication or therapy? I am actually in school for Physical Therapy and so I am pretty decently educated In musculoskeletal and Neuromuscular disorders. However, this was not like anything I ever learned about and my professors at school advised that I see a neurologist. When I called to make my appointment I called and said I was experiencing bilateral blepharospasms which is the medical term for my symptom. When I saw my neurologist I expected to be diagnosed with something but instead my diagnosis continued to be blepharosams (which is a symptom, not a condition). \n\nOn top of this, I also had some transient tightness, though not visible in to my R cheek, R neck (sternocleidomastoid and scalenes, and R bicep tendon) and some dizziness.\n\nThis has been going of for 2.5 months now and most of my symptoms have improved. But still have days where I will experience an increased in tension, dizziness, or feelings of spasticity in my face and am not back to normal still. \n\nIt is been frustrating to be told I just have anxiety when I was completely healthy before receiving my vaccine and have resulted to the internet to try to find others or treatment or any kind of answer to what happened\u2026\n\nI should also add that I saw an ophthalmologist who said he believed it may be a neurological side effect from the vaccine and saw my PCP who ran tests with everything normal aside from a slightly lowered WBC count. No Lymes, normal TSH I am so sorry to hear that. It must be so frustrating.\n\nI had my second bout of bell's palsy in a few days after my first vaccine dose. Have since had the second and I had no ill effects, which is not uncommon. I talked to pfizer about it and they believe the BP is a result of the vaccine, as do my doctors. I would report this to the maker of your vaccine. They cannot offer medical advice, but it is important for them to have this info on adverse effects. (I actually do research ethics for a living, so it was this weird thing to actual experience an adverse effect like this). \n\nSadly, I think that many people who have unusual or unknown symptoms have to go through a lot of doctors and put in a lot of time and effort to get diagnosed and treated. If possible, I would look on message boards for patients with neurological conditions (post this video) and maybe you will find someone with something similar. A lot of rare illness/disease info is spread through these advocacy/support groups. They might also be able to point you towards a doctor that can help.\n\nagain, sorry you are going through this. it sucks. I am glad your symptoms have improved. I am not a doctor but it does not look like bells to me although you mentioned you have had it for 2.5 months so maybe it is just healed/healing. Normally with bells palsy that side if you face is paralyzed so for example you would not be able to close your eye (the eye would roll back as if it was closed but the eyelids would stay open and youd see the eye white only) or move half your mouth (ex when I had it I would need to use a hand to hold the lips on that half of my mouth when eating so that I was not chewing on them since I could not hold them up / out of my mouth) etc. Does that resonate with how you were at the beginning? No, the most consistent and focal symptoms I have had was the bilateral blepharospasms and Right sided facial paraesthias, and Right sided neck paraesthia/tightness. I never had any symptoms of weakness but did not know if there was an off chance that it could present different. Even just typing that out probably reiterates it is not Bell\u2019s Palsy as that is more of a lower motor neuron disorder and spasticity is normally associated with upper motor neuron. Seems to be an axon problem but likely would be resolved by itself, vaccine side effects are extremely rare but are possible, i gurantee a neuro would be a valuable asset here", "9 months on, curious of others after effects I first got Bells early September last year. Luckily I am 95% recovered (slight droop of my lip) but feel luckily that I recovered so much. Just wondering if any of you guys who have recovered suffer from any after effects? I still get the occasional pain in the back of my head, my face will tingle or feel numb some times (may last a day or two then disappear again), my tongue still does feel normal on the one side and my face feels tight occasionally if I try to hold my eyes open wide. Scares the life out of me that it is going to come back sometimes. Sat here with my ear feeling tingly while my face is tight and twitchy and just wondered if any of you guys still have these sort of things happen. I had it after an ear infection back in December. I got lucky and healed in about 4 weeks, so I am not experiencing any lasting effects at all, I am really thankful for that. But as a result I cannot speak to answer your question. I am just here to say that this sub is not the most active and that there is a Facebook group with about 8,000 some people in it that is very active and has people with all sorts of experiences. I would direct your questions there My face is still pretty uneven, my friends say they do not notice it as much but to me it is like how do you NOT notice it? My eyebrows are so incredibly uneven, my smile is not near what it used to me. The corner of my mouth is so bizarrely connected to my eye they twitch together, and in certain motions I can move one without moving the other (I am thinking because of the way I refrained the muscles when healing). And aside from all of that, I have been getting more frequent migraines that excedrin no longer helps, and horrendous jaw pain once a month. \n\nI realize how bitter this comment makes me seem, please understand I am SO thankful for how much I have healed, but I cannot help but be angry/upset sometimes when i cannot fully smile anymore and it depresses me sometimes. I had a mild case, 100% recovery, but I do sometimes get pain behind the ear on my head, around where that nerve travels. I have seen other say the same, in terms of pain well after, obviously not in the same spot as me though. Do you have a link to the Facebook group, please? :) yep. here it is. Best of luck to you \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(", "What to do all day This is stupid but I do not know what to do all day because everything seems to make my eye strain worse. Normally I would watch tv or read while sick but both make my eyes hurt. What did you guys do all day while recovering? Was just diagnosed on Thursday. It was a challenge for me, and I started listening to radio. I watched TV in small doses. It is tough. I think with a patch on or off, it is tough. The first few days are very tough. How long before you noticed the paralysis and diagnosis? How is your taste?\n\nMostly I slept. For some reason, the antiviral they gave me helped me go to sleep. \n\nArtificial tears are a god send too. Use them often and use a patch whenever you can. It keeps the moisture in which also helps a lot. \n I felt terrible for the first 2 weeks. I had a splitting headache that would not go away. I had an ear infection at the time so that hurt as well. The anti virals, antibiotics and pain meds I was on made me dry heave a few times a day. I primarily slept. TV was hard but I watched it in short bursts. \nIt gets better and tv/reading become easier. Podcasts or audiobooks are helpful as well so you do not have to use your eyes.\nGood luck with your healing! I think I noticed it a couple hours after it started? I started having neck pain on Tuesday which got worse by Thursday and then after a couple hours at work I noticed that my left side felt sluggish and my left eye seemed delayed. I think it actually started on Wednesday night because we were eating dinner and I thought I was allergic to the sauce we had used because my tongue felt numb. But I went to the doctor and then started the prednisone and antivirals right away. \n\n\nMy taste is mostly gone on the left side, but if I eat on the right side (just jam it in that cheek) I can still taste things if they are strongly flavoured enough. \n\n\nDid you tape your eye closed with the patch as well? I have been trying to tape it closed during the day but it seems hard to keep it shut when the right eye is open. And the eye patch I got is an elastic one so I was thinking of getting some of those bandaid patches for during the day because at night I just tape the left eye shut and use a sleep mask to cover both. \n\n\nDid you take time off work? I worked on Friday and it was pretty awful. I was supposed to leave early that day anyways but it was so painful by the time I got home, even with consistently putting eye drops in. \n\n\nSucks because we were supposed to go on a road trip next Sunday to go to the wine country part of Canada but it seems pointless since I cant taste anything and have been getting motion sick in the car even short distances. Did you have issues with travel for a while? \n\n\nHow is your BP doing now?  That might work actually, I have been meaning to listen to the Harry Potter audio books. Seems like a good time to do it haha The headache seems to come for me when my eye is tired (we just had some contractors over and I did not want to cancel but just trying to act normal for an hour made my eyes hurt). Just had a 3hr nap which helped! I think I have lots of podcasts to catch up on... \n\n\nThanks so much :) how are you doing now?   How are you doing now?  I had BP back in 2014. I am as healed as I am going to be. Thanks for asking. \ud83d\ude42 I am back to around 80-90% - I spent around a month doing very little. Relaxing, and taking naps and being deliberately calm. \n\nWhile I took the prescriptions for steroids and antiviral agents, and a bunch of vitamin B, fish oils , etc, the neurologist I saw suggested that the number one reason for the inflammation was stress....and I was a nervous wreck.  I am really glad that I listened and allowed myself to be concerned, but not focused on recovery.  When recovery happens, it will happen relatively quickly - you will be surprised. \n\nYou have got this - your willingness to adjust your normal activities during the recovery time really bodes well. 85% of people afflicted by Bell\u2019s Palsy recover quickly within a couple months.  Be really good to yourself, and be positive...mental positivity will also help you recover. It is better. I am 7 days In. Finished my antiviral dose and 3 more doses of prednisone. \n\nI have more control over lips and tongue. Getting food stuck out of weird places is easier than it was earlier this week. \n\nI am able to also push more food back so I can swallow. That is also progressing slowly. \n\nTook the whole week off. Not sure I would have survived without it. I use the computer a lot so it is tough to work. \n\nI did not shut the patch closed but I got this $6 patch from Walgreens that had this shitty foam on it. Ripped it off and it works like a charm. It is annoying to get used to but stick to it. It really helped me. \n\nIt is all progressing but real slow. \n\nTaste is the big worry for me. \n\nI am sorry you had a lot of pain. I had almost no pain at all thankfully. Just came out of nowhere. \n\nAs for travel, I have not really gotten behind the wheel. My wife drove once and I was uneasy over it. Since then, I have just been walking everywhere. We live in Chicago so everything is easily accessible. \n\nGood luck to you. Keep us updated please. \n\nFingers crossed for the taste returning. \n\nAs for your trip, I think you will find it getting better over the next few days and then you might be able to go. \n\nI do not know if there is any alcohol restrictions. I had about a 1/3 of a beer two days ago. No big issues.  Update on your recovery? I had an episode 5 months ago, second time in my life. I would say about 90-95% recovered, only issue I see is my eyebrow still does not go entirely up on one side and that same side will tear up while eating some foods. I am hoping for a full recovery but if this is it, eh. ", "CBD Oil - How much to take? I decided to give CBD oil a try after seeing many positive comments about it on this sub. Can anyone who has benefited from CBD oil tell me how much to take daily? And in what form did you take it (I am going sublingual)? \n\nAlso, I was advised against it because it overtaxed the liver (unverified). Anyone have any info on that (I have liver problems)? I just took a \"dropper full\" under the tongue, once daily.  No idea if it helped me or not.  Did not hurt, at least!\n\nCannot speak to the liver question, I am sorry. How many mg\u2019s or unit of measurement was in the dropper? I was using a 1500MG bottle with a \"serving\" of 50MG.  It ended up being about a half-full standard size medicine dropper I was taking like 100mg CBD but i did not get results except for it helping me sleep longer which I will take especially because of the insomnia.

When I brought up how I was depressed my smile is gone which was one of the only things I like about myself she said \"well at least you can wear a mask\".

Was wondering if anyone has noticed the same thing or has used THC related products for Bell\u2019s palsy. I know that cannabis can act as an anti-inflammatory but do not know much else in terms of the medicinal use. I am not sure if it is in my mind, but I feel like I can visualize and move my face in subtle ways with cannabis. I do not use it to improve the BP, but I hope it is a bonus.\n\nI think CBD would be great for the anti-inflammatory effects. This is an interesting effect to hear about but I personally would not do this if it does not have any long term effect.  It should be studied to understand how it seems to be restoring movement, albeit temporary. Tried it, joint kept falling out of my mouth \ud83d\ude24 \ud83e\udd23  I developed BP literally ten minutes AFTER smoking a new strain\u2026.needless to say, have not touched that strain since. Damn, what strain? Peach Rings", "Diagnosed today...(sorry for the wall-o-text) Ever since Christmas morning I had an ear ache come on super fast and hard that transitioned into a headache from hell. I have bad teeth, and one broke recently so I assumed I needed to drag myself into the dentist. \n\nI have REALLY bad anxiety and one of my biggest triggers being the dentist.... main reason i have let my teeth go so.\n\nSo for 10 days, give or take, I have this ear ache, headache that wraps around my head, goes down my shoulder, and to top or off a throbbing tooth.\n\nMy mind is racing b/c this doesnt seem like anything I have experienced before. (prior to facial paralysis) The weeks building up to it both eyes have been twitching like crazy and if I didnt mention it above I do have anxiety. I have conquered panic attacks for the most part but suffer physical symptoms daily, upset stomach, sweats, jaw clenching. So I was also wondering if that is what all this was...\n\nI finally called and made a dentist appt on thursday, its for monday. Time to get that taken care, anxiety or not its effecting my health too much. I wake up today (friday morning) and I am having trouble lighting my cigarette. My mouth is acting like the end of a balloon when you let air out. \n\nI also noticed my tongue was numb last night and food tasted off. I assumed the numbness was from the Ibuprofen I had been gobbling and did not think much of it.\n\nI cannot smile fully... and cannot shut my right eye at all! I am freaking the fuck out, did I have a stroke?!?!!\n\nSo I run to google and come to guess it is BP. The docs agree. Im on Prednisone, Acycovir, penicillin and have to put a salve on my eye and tape it shut each night.\n\nI KNEW this was not just teeth pain, or just a tension headache or even just my anxiety. \n\nI dunno why I am posting here... I guess for some comradely? A shoulder from someone else who has/is dealing with this. Any tips or tricks? I admit I am quite worried about lingering effects.\n\nBTW - Typing with one eye def has a learning curve. Sorry for any typos or formatting issues. Sorry to hear about your new diagnosis. Take your meds and do your face exercises. I had it in 2015 and I tried so many different things to try and heal. I firmly believed acupuncture was why I really started healing. Do your research!\n\nWe all know what you are dealing with. Hang in there! Why give you penicillin (if you do not mind me asking?) I was diagnosed early January with a mild case and it was slowly recovering until I started acupuncture. After 3 sessions the physio told me that I do not need any more and Im at least 95% recovered in a month How bad is it? Did the whole side of your face drop, or is it just weak? I was diagnosed early December and am at least 95% recovered. Your case sounds viral, I am pretty sure mine was stress related.\n\nDo not stress too hard over it, just do what the doc says and it will all come back to you. Be realistic though, I was. I said to myself if I get 90% recovery I will be happy. Some people do not ever fully recover due to the nerve being too damaged, but even then 90% recovery would barely be noticeable to most people.\n\nIt can take anywhere up to a year for maximum recovery,l. I was lucky, the doc said my case was mild and the damage was limited. Very happy with my recovery.\n\nStay positive bud Rest. Get lots of rest. Cover the eye. Took me six weeks to get back to 100%. Wishing you the same.  The whole side is dropped, and I awoke this morning to it even more severe. At least yesterday, for the most part, I could drink from a bottle and keep most of it.... not so much today. Def going to need a straw.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience and the kind words! I am guessing b/c my bad teeth? *shrugs* Thank you &lt;3\n\nBy rest, do you mean just laying down.... or more so taking it easier than I normally would? Thanks, Ill youtube some face exercises. The E.R. did not mention anything like that to me. Also I am soooo glad you found something to help get you along. Really hoping I dont need to go that route. Next to dentist fear #2 is needles, lol. For how long is your treatment cos I was given anti inflams for a week only. I was advised not to use a straw or strain my muscles. Be strong you will pull through!! Both! I was fortunate to be able to take off a lot of time and sleep during the day when I got tired or when my eye bothered me. I think that really helped the recovery process after the meds were done.  The ER told me to puff my cheeks in and out, smile and frown and raise and lower my eyebrows 100 times a day. Every Dr and person is different but that is what I was told. \n\nI cry every time I get a shot so needles are a huge fear of mine as well. I happened to have a ton of pain with my BP so I was willing to try anything.\n\nI really hope you feel better soon! I was diagnosed last Thursday 12/27 man it is not easy.  Just keep in good spirts about it. Do not let it get you down.  I think 10 days, give or take? To finish the anti-viral meds.\n\nI might have to get back in touch with them then.... b/c I cannot drink anything without a straw atm. It falls outta my mouth and/or I choke. Fun times :P\n I help out at the Boyfriends family business, which happens to be a motorcycle shop. This is the slow season so I think they can do without me for a few weeks. \n\nThanks. Thanks for those tips! Ill start on them tonight!\n\nSame... as for the crying and this BP giving me a lot of pain. My ear is still on fire and the back of my head is killing me. Plus the pressure on my eye, feels like it is about to pop out.\n\nIf it does not get better w/face exercises, rest and the meds I will most def be looking into acupuncture. It seems you are not the only BP sufferer who got help from that treatment. How has your recovery come along so far? Are you still on meds or have you finished?\n\nSorta wondering when I will start to regain some control. I thought after taking meds it would only get better but things are slightly worse today.\n\n I finished my steroids after a week still no movement. This Thursday will be two weeks still no movement or taste. Eating hand foods is so hard. Rather eat with fork &amp; knife lol I def feel that, due to my bad tooth I am also rocking right now I am limited to things like scrambled eggs and tuna fish and soooo sick of it. I mean nothing tastes right anyways, but still. \n\nI really need to try and find something to distract myself and/or lift my spirits. Im not handling this well at all.\n\nAlso not getting any support at home. No one is helping me, Im still doing all the home chores, taking care of the dogs .... I feel like they do not give a crap.", "Fever while recovering Does anyone know if having a fever while recovering is normal? My fianc\u00e9 was diagnosed 2 weeks ago and for about a week he is had a fever on and off and is in extreme pain. His doctor will not get back to us and I am steering to get worried. Tonight his body was cold but he had a fever of 101.8 last week it was 102.3. Is this normal? No that is not normal.  I am not a doctor, of course, but the \"healing\" that is takes place from BP is basically just a reduction/elimination in the inflammation that causes it, followed by a period where the body attempts to repair/replace the damaged nerve.  That should not cause a fever.  \n\nHe should probably get checked out. It depends did he get Bell's palsy from an infection fevers with an infection can last around two weeks but i would still try to get in touch with a doctor or go to an er hopefully everything is alright The side of his face is still so swollen too Test for lymes disease Thanks I will mention that I got it from Lyme disease so it was not fun but I do remember being run down and feeling like I had the flu before and after for sometime ", "Post recovery spasms(?) Apologies if this has been asked/belongs elsewhere, I am not a usual user of Reddit \n\n\nI dealt with a bout of Bell\u2019s Palsy in late 2020 (October I think it was) and was able to recover in about 5-6 weeks\n\nHowever since recovery I have noticed regular spasms in my bottom lip on the same side, has anyone else experienced anything like this?

They feel like a leg cramp in my face. I guess its a part of synkinesis (my best guess), but it has its own name, Trigeminal Neuralgia which can be diagnosed by a neurologist. I am currently trying out a \u201ctried and true\u201d drug, according to my PCP to help with calming down the spasms and cramping, called carbamazepine which is an anti-convulsant (yes, a seizure medication) and it is been helping a lot. \n\nTry talking to your PCP or neurologist about it.

Is there anyone who also has seemingly permanent Bell\u2019s and has any tips or hints to improve muscle function?  I have too .. mostly facial exercise and massages but nothin... Ive had bells for over 3 and a half years. I am also military so I get decent medical but they just referred me to physical therepy anyways. Its that or even plastic surgery. So, on my own, I bought a bottle if theracurmin and I am still feeling the tingling sensation after I do some facial exercises which leads me to believe that I can still progress. I am practically symmetrical when I dont smile and i have to force it on my right side but it closes my eye when I do it. Just more exercises. Try the theracurmin It sounds like you have recovered from Bell's, but you are now dealing with synkinesis.  I am experiencing the same issues with my eye closing when I move my mouth.

But it would be more fun to share it with a few others too... if you are done or are coming out of BP. If you would be up for it, I am looking for before and after pictures (\\*middle too if you have one\\*) along with captions of either the date or the time marker (2 weeks in, 6 months in, etc.), along with just your FIRST name which you give me permission to use in the video at no cost to either of us. This is strictly a voluntary free deal. I think you should be able to just PM the material to me, or we can arrange something else. Please let me know if you are interested. No violation of rules here is intended or expected.  Post a reply to this if you have questions. Thanks!", "How do you cope ? I am on my second day of medicine, my mouth and I are now fully paralyzed. I lost all motivation to leave my bed or even be awake. I do not know how I am meant to live like this for months lol. Try to keep yourself entertained. Do you have any hobbies? Thank you for your comment, \nI am a music producer and skateboarder. Trying to make music has been bringing on the vertigo and I worry about exasperating my condition. Skating seems unwise for an array of reasons\nI am trying to keep busy with art ,. Conversation , games but ultimately my headspace is completely gone and it feels almost impossible to motivate myself You are still in the early stages so I guess once you have become more accustomed to BP things will get easier. Just keep in mind that it is only temporary. Just try to do your normal daily routine (if possible, try not to exert yourself physically). Do not feel hopeless. The best things I did for myself were 1) To take the medication on time and for the full prescribed course; 2) To rest. Bell's Palsy takes a toll on your entire body. Your body needs sleep and to de-stress. Meditation is highly recommended for BP. There are several great meditation apps for iPhone and Android; 3) To reach out to family and friends, who will provide you with emotional support; 4) To see a neurologist for follow-up care; 5) Acupuncture. I credit much of my 90-95% recovery after 2 months to acupuncture; 6) Vitamins. Ask your primary doctor or neurologist if they would recommend Vitamin B supplements to aid in nerve regeneration; 7) Physical therapy. I saw a physical therapist, who works with BP patients. You can also find BP PT exercises on YouTube; 8) Taping. I found information about how to tape my eye and mouth at night to help them \"remember\" where they need to be; 9) Research. I found the more I read about BP and its treatments, the more empowered I felt to advocate for myself and identify possible treatment options, e.g. acupuncture and PT); 10) Feel hopeful. Yes, I definitely felt down (a lot), but the more proactive I was, the more hopeful I felt.\n\nI hope this helps a little. I am sorry you are in a thought spot. I am two weeks in and feeling a lot better! I started acupuncture on the second day, had 3 treatments along with the Chinese meds and the western meds... I tried to carry on life as normal, but did bite the inside of my lip like 5 times. Be careful. Just try your best to relax and talk to friends/family, you will be on your way soon! Good luck! This sure helps me!!", "Day 14 - No Improvement Hello Everyone:\n\nI spent my Christmas Eve in Urgent Care being diagnosed with Bell's Palsy - likely pregnancy related as I am currently 33 weeks.  Our first child is due to arrive in mid February!\n\nLuckily I got placed on a 7-day course of prednisone and took my first dose within 24 hours of symptom onset.  Unluckily...it has been about 14 days and I have noticed no improvement at all.  Smile is still completely gone, eye does not shut completely, and my affected eyebrow has no increase in motion. \n\nBecause I was diagnosed during the holidays I could not see my GP or OB in person until yesterday.  I was looking forward to hearing what they had to say about Bell's and was eager to adhere to all of their advice.  Suffice to say they had none - I am a healthcare professional myself and both my GP and OB basically wanted me to explain to them what I think I should do and wanted me to quote them when they think I will get better.  Fair enough - neither had treated the condition recently and my GP has never specifically treated it in pregnancy (which some studies suggest the prognosis is not as great) \n\nAnyways - for the first 14 days of this I just tried my best to rest.  Now that there is no improvement I am ready to change gears into \"do everything in my power mode\" and of course continue to hope for the best.  A few questions:\n\n\\-Is now a good time to start facial exercises?  I had read some mixed things on the internet about not starting early due to risk of synkinesis , but at 14 days should I get on these things?\n\n\\-Is there any hope at all that I might have some improvement prior to February even if after 14 days I have seen practically none?  How far along were you in your Bell's before you noted signs of improvement?\n\n\\-Already started B complex and I am going to give a nearby acupuncture clinic a call today on my lunch because why not? \n\n\\-What else can I do - give me all the advice. As annoying as it is, patience. I did not see improvement for 4 weeks, not one bit, then somewhere around 4 weeks, I woke up in the morning and muscles on my BP side were twitching, from there, it took about 2 weeks to get \u201cfull\u201d motion back. It is been a year now, my face is not the same but no one notices now. I got bells when I was 28 weeks pregnant. I saw zero improvement until 3 weeks after I gave birth to my son. Honestly, I would not really start trying anything until after you give birth. If you have improvement before then, that would be great, but you are right about starting work too early and causing synkinesis. The best thing you can do is just be patient. I am sorry this happened to you. I saw absolutely no improvement until around day 12 or so. At that point, I noticed that I could suddenly move my eyebrow a tiiiiiny tiny bit. After that, I started seeing improvement every day, and had made a 99% recovery in a months time.\n\nthat being said, everyone has a different go with BP.\n\nPersonally, my GP told me to start face exercises day 1, while also trying to relax and get lots of rest. I did face exercises 3 times a day, each session lasting about 15 minutes. I would also just do some random face exercises throughout the day, like practicing blinking when watching TV and stuff like that, or practicing my smile.\n\nIf you want, I can link you the PDF I got from my doctor. It is in danish, but there is a lot of pictures, and you should be able to copy paste the text and translate it. Wow, mine must have been super bad. I had it for months my senior year of hs with no improvement. I really hope you do not have to wait that long, best wishes! Thanks for this.  One of my doctors hypothesized that it might begin to improve once I give birth (which sort of made sense to me because until then I am going to be just as immunocompromised as I am now).  It is just so hard to do nothing! How much improvement did you see once you reached that point? Sure!  I will take the PDF.  I might start slowly doing them - while also resting and relax like you did.  This seems like a good compromise to me? I think that is the problem - everyone has a different go so its so hard to be patient! \n\nI am assuming it finally improved for you.  I can appreciate that getting Bell's Palsy in high school was probably very difficult. Sounds silly but I sing this childhood song to myself when I get impatient and it helps: \n\nIt was difficult BC of fear of the unknown n worries about it being permanent. But I had wonderfully supportive parents and an amazing community that helped. My English class got me a giant Get Well card that I still have. 1 frend wrote,\" I hope that you get well soon even though youre not really sick!\" n it still makes me giggle. \n\nBetter now, only flares up when I am super tired. All in all, God is good to me, even in my afflictions. \ud83d\udc9c good luck I understand your frustration. \n\nI am 1.5 years out with about 80% recovery. I am still seeing a slow improvement below my eyebrow but my forehead is totally dead. I actually had some plastic surgery recently to help restore some facial symmetry in my upper face. Alright, here you go :)\n\n\n\nAnd yeah, I would say that now seems like as good as time as any to start. In this community, there is a lot of different opinions on when to start doing the exercises, because apparently people hear a lot of different stuff from their doctors. I think there might not be enough knowledge on the physical treatment of BP as of current time.\n\nBut yeah, I would say start doing the exercises. Here are some pointers:\n\nI recommend massaging the face before you start going through the exercises. Massage both sides by rubbing your hands in circular motions. This will help get the blood flowing, which is good for your recovery :)\n\nIt is important to watch yourself in the mirror while doing these exercises, since you will be doing each exercise with both the healthy and afflicted side of your face at the same time, and then try to match the afflicted side by using your fingers to help it along.\n\nWhen you start the exercises, hold each exercise for 3-4 seconds while trying your hardest to make the grimace on both sides of your face, and help the afflicted side with your fingers when needed. After the 3-4 seconds, relax your face completely for 3-4 seconds and repeat the exercise two more times. Do this for all the exercises.\n\nEnd by relaxing your face and stretching the skin as shown on page 10. I recommend stretching both the normal and the paralyzed side at the same time.\n\nDoing the massaging, exercises and stretching will take about 15 minutes from start to finish. I was recommended doing this 3 times a day, but if you want to work your way there and start slow, you do you. Also remember to feel free to do some exercises whenever you feel like it during the day. Like doing the blinking exercise throughout the day, or doing the smiling exercise whenever you go by a mirror at home or such.\n\nI hope this is all helpful to you, and wish you the very best on your recovery. Feel free to ask if you have any other questions :) I saw improvement after 2 weeks. It starts with twitching then after week 3, you will notice everything coming back. \n\nTrust me when I say this, it comes back all so sudden. One day you will not be able to close your eye &amp; the next day you will. When recovery begins, (WHICH IT WILL) everything is pretty fast from then. \n\nYou do not need to necessarily see improvements after 2 weeks, whatever anyone has been telling you, everyone is different. \n\nAs hard as it is, be patient with yourself and whenever you feel down just tell yourself that this is TEMPORARY. I know exactly how you are feeling. I have been there myself. Please do not ever lose hope. You will get better, TRUST ME.\n\nEdit: and in terms of facial exercises, I did not do any and I had a full recovery. Personally, they did not help me. But it is worth trying. I took basically 3 weeks to recover and what really helped was my doctor prescribing prednisolone for the inflammation and was back to full movement after\n\nit is not typically a linear recovery as far as I have read up, once the inflammation is taken care of and the nerve is no longer irritated it can be pretty quick I needed surgery, a facial nerve decompression, I guess it is called, after two months of daily physical therapy and zero improvement. I immediately got better (sad to say, I am still at 50% at best 20 years later). I am not sure that would be a possibility for you, because of the pregnancy. And maybe it is not worth it, if you get better on your own.\nIn my extremely severe case, if it was not for the surgery, I would probably still be completely paralysed. We determined its severity with a test where I got needles stuck to my face and electricity charges to see if the muscles would move (they would not and did not until after the surgery). I do not know how the test is called in English but I am also not sure that would be advisable during pregnancy. \nHonestly, one thing that had helped me recover a little bit since is to make movements with my face on my own. I think, with time, my brain managed to get some connections reestablished. I do have the problem where I close my eye a bit when I open my mouth, but I am now capable of winking, which I was not for years. \nBest of luck to you, if for now there is things you cannot do maybe explore them for after giving birth. Stay safe, and your baby, wishing you a full recovery. Thank you!  This gives me lots of hope.  The odd thing is that I have already had twitching (quite a bit actually)... just no huge changes in movement.  I am hoping it is coming soon though. I got mine at 38 weeks pregnant and am 7 weeks postpartum with zero improvement so far. I was diagnosed right away and started steroids and have done acupuncture as well and vitamin B. \nI am trying to be patient but it does get very disheartening to not be able to smile at my baby. I hope your recovery is faster than mine. Everything this person said, do. Sound advice!\n\n  \n\n\nAdditionally, you could consider seeing a physio (neuro specialist) and getting acupuncture. Both have been very helpful for me. You will recover - and your baby will love your face now, tomorrow and years from now.  The must frustrating part is being patient - trust me this is what drove me to write this post at 6:30 am yesterday haha!  I hope your little one is healthy and congratulations on your bundle of joy.  You will improve! Honestly I would REALLY take it easy with the exercises in this early stage until you get more control. There is some good research out there about pushing the nerve too hard early on leading to Synkinesis issues down the road. I think I am dealing with some of this myself 9 months later after exercising a lot in the beginning. Wow that is very interesting. Could you link me any of this research if you still have the source? I am dealing with synkinesis 13 months in, and I have been practicing from the first day regularly for several weeks with PT assistance. I stopped the exercises after half a year and now I keep asking myself whether I could have done anything to prevent the synkinesis - but your post makes me realize it might have been better to start slower ... Honestly, I wish I could remember the exact resources but I remember watching several YouTube Videos about Synkinesis and hearing that doing exercises before your nerve is somewhat recovered can teach bad habits and signals down the road. I think that might be what is going on with me - I went too hard in the beginning and I am paying for it! Consulting a neurologist this week to see what the next steps should be here... I will check some videos out. Would be glad to hear about what the neurologist had to say. Mine suggested, and has already started, symptomatic Botox therapy. It has helped a bit so far but can take several weeks before the first results are visible. Yes, I will keep you posted. Remind me if I do not.\n\nCan I ask what your Synkinesis symptoms are?\n\nMine are fairly mild so far - I get a very small chin twitch when I blink, and my neck twitches/flexes as well. I also notice a bit of eye tightness/twitching when I eat. Most people do not notice my symptoms but I do! Sure, my eye lid closes about half when I smile, whistle or eat - this sometimes also triggers my ear. On the other hand, closing my eye makes my mouth twitch. I do not have crocodile tears (anymore) and luckily most people do not notice this. But personally, I am sort of a perfectionist, and it is impossible for me to not notice the rigidness and inflexibility that this is giving me in my face expressions.\n\nI have started with small doses of Botox on the eye and the ear, will probably continue with the mouth next time and slightly increase the eye dosage. Interesting. Sounds like a bunch of smaller things but I totally get how people do not even notice but it still drives you crazy. My neck especially drives me nuts - I can feel it hitting my shirt collar all day every time I blink.\n\nCan you keep me posted on how Botox is working for you? I have heard that it can sometimes have side effects like droopiness and stuff, but also heard that it helps eliminate/reduce the twitching. Would love to hear how it is going!", "HELP PLEASE.

Never even thought of using CBD oil I was treated with steroids and anti-vitals within 3 hours of onset. Unfortunately I was diagnosed on May 10th and have not experienced any improvement to date. I hope you recover faster! It is been about 8 weeks for me. Slight improvement as far as my ear go and I can hold liquid in my mouth, but my smile is still crooked and I still cannot move my eyebrow on the affected side either... prayers to you I have had it for a week and a half and the symptoms have gotten way better. I can close both eyes entirely now, though I still have a crooked smile and cannot wink with my left eye. Once you get over the hump of not being able to close an eye, it is all downhill. You are welcome, and I did not either! My husband actually brought it up, when called the pharmacy asking about it they said they had quite a few people using it for that purpose...honestly I feel like when I started the CBD (3 weeks in) that is when I really noticed some changes. Within 15 minutes of taking it I could feel my nerves twitching and coming back. \n\nTry to be positive, I was miserable and depressed over it...it fricken sucks. Wish I would have just been more patient. Was diagnosed Sept. 10, 2018. \nStarted antibiotics, anti inflammatories, steroids. and just a little THC \nI am about 90% recovered. You can still tell when I smile. And I still do not have full function of the right side of my face below my eye. \nStill keeping faith. \nBe patient. I was on 14 days of steroids and antivirals.  I did not even begin to SEE recovery until 3 months in.  Am now about 50% recovered. You will get there, just stay patient (that is all you can do, really).\n\nI also took (am taking) CBD, THC, Fish Oil, B complex. None of that seemed to have any impact, on me. Which CBD oil did you use?

It is feeling weird like i am heavier on one side of my body, not enough to fall etc but still ? It is weird, i am on day 15 and recovering I have had terrible vertigo since being diagnosed last Friday. Sorry I do not have any words of wisdom. I took 5 days of prednisone and I am on my final day of Valtrex today. Yeah I have also had really bad vertigo/dizziness. Cannot tell if it is from the methylprednisolone or just from BP though. I have not been able to do much other than laying down and going to the bathroom.", "My experience with BP from Lymes disease  So sorry your going through this. Trust me, myself and many others here can sympathize with your B.P.  It is no fun.  Make sure you take care of your effected eye with an eye patch and natural tears. I got a prescription for some eye drops, yet no pharmacy had it in stock so it was substituted to \u201cRefresh Tears\u201d Eye lubricant. One tiny bottle was $15 USD, but well worth it. These drops are thicker then water or Visine drops. \n\nTry and stay upbeat, because this will go away eventually. For me it took 1 month before I started to notice my face was coming back to life again, then another month before I was back to normal. \n\nStick in there, you WILL recover. Hey man thank you, im doing great, it scared me at first because i had symptomatic lyme (i thought it was covid) then it started affecting my nervous system so i went to the ER asap, and i got a couple weeks of doxy so i was ok, no more lyme but still recovering from the whole palsy thing. It sucks bc i make music and i couldnt sing for a couple months but its all ok now, no need to be too scared or worried anymore. I appreciate it man Sorry dude, but if you got Lyme you also should get tested for other infections you got from the tick bites. Babesia can be almost impossible to eradicate, and I have found my Bell's coming back depending on how well I am taking my antibiotics.", "Day 12 and I am feeling defeated Today is my day 12 since being diagnosed with Bell's palsy. A few days ago I could start to move my cheek and even smile just a little bit. But now today I am back to not being able to move it at all. It is extremely frustrating. Yesterday was my first day off of steroids. I am wondering if that is the reason for the setback. Has anyone else experienced something like this? I am day 14 and nothing yet, never been more frustrated in my life it is difficult but you have to be patient with your body. The steroids are a mixed bag bc they treat the inflammation but suppress your ability to fight the root cause.  Just relax, stay positive, and rest as much as possible Typically it can take 6 weeks to 6 months for recovery for most people.  Go easy on yourself. I am 20 days in i think and after a couple of face(fake) - outs im definitely on the upswing. Both lips and cheek are way better. Did my 1st seven days on valtrex and prednisone and 5000mcg of b12 everyday and once a week pro massage. It gets better! After my onset mine got worse before it got better, I think around day 10-14 being the worst, then after the steroids seemed to kick in properly and I was fully healed within a month. Just try and get as much rest as you can, I also did face exercises (literally just searched facial exercises for bells on youtube) which I did 1-3 times a day depending on how \u2018tired\u2019 my face felt. It gets worse before it gets better. Honestly days 10-12 were rough and it may be that you are feeling some swelling. Once I stopped feeling swollen and pain in my jaw, ear and behind my ear, I felt more significant improvements with moving. Massaging the face helps a lot.", "Just diagnosed, looking for personal experiences. Symptoms, diagnosis, and start of pred and valtrex in the last 24 hours.\n\nI had been quarantining after Covid contact trace. I had a neg PCR test day 1, pos PCR test day 2, neg PCR test and neg rapid test day 3, and a neg pcr test day 7. But by the mid of day 7, my mouth felt funny and I loss taste. By dinner that evening my mouth felt as if I had been to the dentist and got stuck with novacaine. By bedtime, I was stuck. \n\nMaybe Covid was my opportune viral infection, maybe it was the stress of being quarantined \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I run a high volume bar; this is not going to make things easy, I am sure. Did you delay returning to work/did it change your day-to-day? What sort of time frame did you experience to notice any movement? 50% recovery?? I was diagnosed at an urgent clinic, should I get more testing done? \n\nI am trying to not let it rain on my parade, but after 2 long term work shutdowns and a couple quarantines this year, my cloud is big and gray. I am 6 weeks from onset, 3ish weeks complete recovery. Day 4 will probably be when your bp gets to its worst point and if you keep up with the antiviral and anti-inflammatory, you may see similar improvements, but mileage may vary. I did not let it get to me. I put in my eye drops and gel at night, I made jokes about it both in person and on social media (bunch of posts on this very page, actually). I also supplemented with multi vitamins and 2500mcg of b12; still do, in fact. I think a positive attitude and constant laughter for the first week helped me as I was seeing slight improvement within days.\n\nGood luck, speedy recovery \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c I have seen a few of your posts, definitely brought half a smile to my face! \ud83d\ude0f\n\nBless you and thanks brother!! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc Recovery is a twisty road, but you will get there. Just keep at it and do not let it bring you down. Bad juju is detrimental to overall health \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c Had Bell's twice - the first around a year ago, came out of nowhere and took about a month to get back to 100%. It was a pretty rapid recovery with 50% coming back within two weeks.  I took a coupe of days off work to relax, cut alcohol and caffeine completely, and was running 3-4 times a week. I did the usual steroids, anti-virals, vitamin B and acupuncture.\n\nThis time around, opposite side of the face about 2 months ago. Have been pretty stressed with work, my father passing away, resulting in overseas travel and mandatory hotel quarantine away from my wife and kid. \n\nI came down with a horrible cold/flu that put me in bed for a few days.  Just as I recovered from that, I came down with a second round of Bell's. I would say I am 60% recovered two months later - I still cannot blink, unfortunately.  This one is very, very gradual in its recovery. It takes me a week or two to notice any improvement, but it is definitely crawling back.   \n\nEveryone is story is different, but most people recovery fully and reasonably quickly. Take care of yourself and good luck with the recovery. Start taking your steroids every day and take your facial expression physical therapy seriously and you will be OK. I did not and I regret it and I am about 85% recovered Tomorrow will be 3 weeks from onset. I would say I am about 90% recovered. I still get random twitches and I cannot smile quite as much on that side. But it is almost imperceptible.\n\nI also waited a week to get on the prednisone and antivirals. My episode was almost exactly 3 years ago, and I did completely recover. My advice is to take a week or two off from work if you can.  I tried to go about my normal life at first, it was hard mentally, but then I realized that I was actually physically sick and needed to rest. I felt like I had a bad flu for at least a couple weeks. It is normal for your symptoms to get worse in the first few days or so, and that is how mine went. I did not start improving at all until the 3 week mark, it is different for everyone though. Try to stay positive, do the facial exercises, get as much rest as you can, and allow yourself some grace. I just had bells about a month ago. It took me 3 weeks to recover 100%, just a little ear clog feeling left over that I do not even notice. I was starting to get an ear infection (left untreated), went and got my flu shot anyway. The next day, the bells hit me, mild/moderate symptoms. The doctor told me the flu shot had nothing to do with it, that an ear infection likely moved inwards toward my facial nerves.  All I had was the paralyzed face, ear discomfort, eye twitches. \n\nI work from home so I was lucky enough for Bell\u2019s palsy to not really affect my life in a huge way, and masks covered it up. I wore the eye patch when in public, taped my eye shut, took anti viral and Pres. \n\nSleep was the main thing that helped me. The steroids gave me insomnia/woke me in the night full of adrenaline, and if I had to be up early in the morning and did not get 8 hours my face would always be worse that day, and feel extra numb, eye extra twitchy. Looking back I wish I had taken melatonin or something to help me sleep during the process. I did not quit my morning coffee, but I cut back a lot. \n\nI did not exercise at all, just walks. Any exercise agitated my face- and I feel like your immune system is already inflamed, so it is best to just go for walks, meditate, so gentle yoga (I could not do downward dogs because it put too much pressure on my face).\n\nI took B12 and vitamin D most days- once I was off steroids my doc told me to take Zinc to help repair my immune system. Good luck! Thank you for taking the time to reply. Keep on, keeping on, wishing you all the best. Thanks for the advice. Wishing you the best. Thank you for replying. I am my toughest critic, so I need the reminder. Wishing you all the best. Thanks for the thought out reply \ud83d\ude42 Your story and advice is appreciated, wishing you the best. Thanks for taking the time to reply, it is much appreciated!! No problem! I wish you the best of luck in your recovery. I hope it is speedy and complete! I was diagnosed October 3rd. The night before I felt my lip and eye twitching but I did not think anything of it. The next morning I could not move the right side of my face. I went to a walk in clinic and they prescribed steroids and antivirals for 10 days. I did not feel any improvement for the medication. It actually made me feel really depressed. \n\nAfter I finished the medication I began taking a multivitamin everyday and I have had so much improvement. I do not know whether it is the vitamins or time. I did let my main doctor know since I got shingles earlier in the year. I recently tested for Lyme to see if that was a cause. \n\nBut I stopped drinking alcohol while I was on medication. I continued smoking THC though. I did not really change my day to day lifestyle, I just made sure I was drinking lots of water and resting as much as I could. I did facial exercises here and there but did not keep up with them. \n\nAfter jointing this community, my Bell\u2019s palsy was definitely mild. I could close my eye and blink. I could still drink and eat, just a bit more slowly. \n\nGood luck on your recovery!! I was diagnosed the week before Thanksgiving in 2017. I have regained full control now, but by New Years 2018, I still had only about 80-85% control. It came very little at a time. I remember waking up and being able to twitch my cheek and that was like winning the lottery. \n\nI noticed leading up to my full loss of control I had a loss of taste and my hearing was affected. That started on a Thursday, and by Saturday I was in full Bells Palsy mode. It was a slow onset the day of, by 6pm I was in the ER with my diagnosis. Looking back, I had a bunch of symptoms but all the weird things happening were not things I generally would associate with each other so I was not aware of it happening until I thought I had a stroke. \n\nI still have some effects after healing completely. My smile is off ever so slightly. My eye squints more when I smile, and every now and then I will feel some \"twinges\" in my face. Usually the little pulses happen in my chin and lips and they sometimes cause visible twitching but it is not painful and everything settles back in again soon after. \n\nThe biggest thing when healing is take all your meds. Doctors still do not know what causes it 100%, but the meds certainly help with healing from what I have read. My meds caused severe nausea so I had to switch but my PCP was great about it. \n\n Make sure your eye stays hydrated, especially while sleeping. I would tape my eye shut nightly for several weeks, but did not need to throughout the day. If I noticed it was getting dry during the day, I would use eye drops (not visine, get the single use sterile eye drops). \n\nCoupled with keeping your eye from drying out, try to avoid long boughts of staring at a screen intently. I could not avoid it because I work on a computer, so if youre the same make sure you give your eyes a break throughout the day. Coming home after work, I would spend time relaxing and watching TV with my Palsy eye taped shut. It allowed my good eye to not strain so much and my bad eye to relax. \n\nEating will be difficult, so take small bites and use utensils when you can. Avoid straws unless you want to make a mess, and I would avoid eating with other people until you can chew with your mouth closed more throughout your meal. I dropped a lot of food from my mouth while eating and not many people understood why it was happening. \n\n\nAs you heal, your facial muscles will start to tighten back up and that hurts like a bitch. The whole time, people kept asking me how I felt and would pity me for the imagined pain I was in. The palsy was not the problem, the healing hurt 1,000x worse. Because your face has not moved, or moved properly, in so many weeks you have lost strength and as it tightens back up you will definitely feel it. Take some advil and maybe use an ice pack if it gets bad enough but it should get better! Had it April 2019. I believe I saw improvements a little after 3 weeks. Was pretty much fully recovered after 4 weeks. Biggest pain to me is the eye situation. I bought a patch and then used soft towelettes as extra padding to keep it shut. So I was diagnosed earlier this year and took immediate action. I got b12 shots every other day, Took b12 vitamins, had multiple acupuncture seasons as well as a realignment. I also routinely practiced facial exercises. My symptoms where gone within 2 weeks. The biggest thing is to just let it takes its course and attempt everything you can to help the process. I had a bells 7 days ago, one day after having my flu shot. Interesting. Just wanted to check in and see how things were going Much appreciated. The biggest surprise/annoyance for me has been the dry eye/inability to focus. Went thru all the meds, started gabapentin, but luckily the nerve pain seems to be subsiding. Unfortunately, no movement or twitches or anything yet. Been doing massages, taking B12, and just staying patient and positive (currently drawing up plans for my \"Jingle 'Bell's'\" holiday cards and pretty sure I am not getting a gf anytime soon so money saved on XMas \ud83d\ude01).  It is been a rough 2020 but I am well aware that there are billions of people on this planet that would trade for my life in a heartbeat. Yeah, got to take the good with the bad for sure. Gfs are costly, even long term booty calls cost a few bucks here and there. I had to get my weekend warrior something for her birthday lol", "Got diagnosed four days ago. Any advice? I woke up feeling my face a little funny on monday, I could not raise my right eyebrow or suck on a straw without letting some liquid spill. I was (and still am) on a 1-week long trip around the country but I took some time to go the hospital in the same day, and got diagnosed with BP. They prescribed me prednisone for a week, and I also started taking some vitamin B12 the next day. \n\nI have also been exercising my face (still no physiotherapist, but I am getting one as soon as I get back home). I have noticed a small improvement in my face, I have an easier time sucking on a straw now and my nostrils can move more easily than in the first days. \n\nI am 18 and I know my BP is not as bad as most cases, my face is not completely paralyzed, in fact it is barely noticeable unless I laugh. But I would still like some advice in what I can do to recover faster. Any tips? Be patient. I had zero improvement for over 3 months and within the past 3 weeks. I have gone from 0% improved to about 50% I know I am not supposed to recover at least for the next two weeks, patience is not a problem. But there are things that make recovery a faster process, like medicine. I was wondering if you would have any tips besides what I am already doing. \n\nHow bad is your BP? Mine was not super terrible...also most noticeable when I laughed. I saw a lot of improvement when I started CBD oil. I am was fully recovered after 5 weeks. Make sure you do your facial exercises every day. This is going to take time You need to start on steroids right away I took antiretrovirals and prednisone.  It started in just my eye, but over the course of a few days it progressed to my entire face. The right side of my face was pretty much paralyzed completely; could not blink or close my eye, raise my eyebrow, or move my lips. My speech was affected because of my mouth paralysis. \n\nYes. I was told at least 2 weeks, with recovery in 3-6 weeks for most cases but in my case it was months. I started to lose hope that I would ever see recovery. So just be prepared for it to take longer than expected. I am prepared, but I do not think it will last too long. I heal unusually fast whenever I suffer any injury, and even if that is not the case, my BP is very light and it has not gotten any worse since the start. I can speak normally and I barely remember I have BP unless I start laughing. \n\nEven if it does last long... Well, I have been warned! Thank you Yes. Are there any specific facial exercises you would recommend? I will look into CBD oil, not sure I can take that. But thank you! Scientifically, the steroid is the only thing that has ever proven to have any effect on Bell's Palsy.  However, many people report having increased improvements with B12 and CBD.  Some people recommend electrical stimulation or acupuncture, other people say those are terrible ideas.\n\nMy BP side was completely paralyzed for three months, as well. I honestly do not feel like anything I did helped. Would it be any good to start taking steroids after four days? \nI am not sure I can take steroids at my age without suffering consequences on my health later on, but I will look into it! Thanks! Prednisone IS the steroid.  You say you have been prescribed it. Are you actually taking it? Oh. Pardon me for my ignorance! I am taking it, since it is what the doctor told me to do. I knew it was a corticoid, but I was not aware it is the same thing as an steroid (is it?). Well, problem solved, because I started taking Prednisone less than 24h after I noticed my face acting weird. Good! I started my Prednisone about 6-7 hours after my first symptoms.  Based exclusively on what I have read on this sub, it seems like people who have a \"less severe\" attack also recover more quickly.  I would bet you will be back to 100% within a month. Sounds like you had a mild case and got on it very fast. I waited 2 days and still only had a mild case. 100% recovery in just over 1 month. I took the same meds and did dry needling at a physio and facial excercises. I do not want to get your hopes up, but it sounds like you will go pretty well as the nerve damage was minimal I hope you recover quickly! I am in exactly the same bout as you, I started noticing something was up on Friday night but did not get it looked at and diagnosed until Monday. Mines pretty mild and you cannot see it too much unless I smile or do something like try and whistle. My eye will only close about 80% and is watering a lot which is probably the most irritating thing!\n\nThe doctor said I was just in time for steroids so I am taking them for 10 days. Plus CBD oil as I take it anyway for general relaxation but I have upped my dosage a little and I have some vitamin B12 coming today as if there is a chance it will help I am going to try it! \n\nMy biggest tip is is to get some eye drops and use them a lot as even though my eye is not completely stuck open it is still getting very dry and irritated. My doctor stressed the importance of keeping it lubricated as if your cornea gets damaged it can be very serious. \n\nAlso try and rest and let your body recover, I have been extremely stressed at work and I am sure that lead to my BP. Maybe not caused it but I have certainly been run down and like you I am very really ill, it anything\u2019s wrong I usually have a lazy weekend in bed and it goes away so I am struggling a little with something that will not just go away quickly. I am taking it as a sign that I need to chill out and look after myself a bit better. \n\nWhat I am struggling with now is how much time i should take off work, I went in on Tuesday and they said I should take the rest of this week off (they pretty much had to force me to go home!). Now I am realising that I am not going to be better by Monday and my BP will really effect my work as I cannot look at a screen for long without my eye watering like mad and talking is difficult, also I am just so tired out! I would really like to know how much time off from work others with BP had? I do not want to miss work but I do not want to make my recovery time longer! \n\nSorry for the essay, I hope everyone reading a speedy recovery and I am so glad I found this sub :) You are welcome! Yeah, it is really weird when something just does not go away. You sound like a workaholic lile me \u2014 I am on summer break from college, though, so I will not have to worry about time off for a while. But I do hope you get some feedback on time off work, as I have read stress can lead to BP.\n\nI have also read somewhere that the mind is connected to the body in a way we do not see. So I would recommend you have fun and keep your self esteem high. Do not be self conscious about BP, it is something that happens. I was extremely bummed out about getting BP in the middle of my trip, but a few hours later I realized I should still have fun. Do not let it ruin anything it should not. It is hard to laugh now and I am someone who laughs all the time, but I have decided I will just keep laughing with my now weird face. \n\nEven if it does not help your recovery at all \u2014 better than being depressed. Good luck to you, buddy. And sorry for the essay too. For what it is worth, I work with a screen all day, and it can be frustrating, but most days are alright after the first week or so. Tape the eye when sleeping, take whatever supplements you feel comfortable with, and take as much time as your employer/purse will allow. \n\nSpeedy recovery, and child-like wonder while all this is happening - in most cases this is temporary. \u263a\ufe0f I am still amazed at how much the cheek does while eating... \ud83d\ude02 You should TOTALLY have fun! And talk to people about it, if you are comfortable. Most people I have encountered have had at least an acquaintance or relative affected. It really helps to know that you are not alone in this period of tribulation. Plus, if you think about it, most of us never saw others that were exhibiting symptoms before, which is indicative of the fact that most recover in time. \n\nBest of luck, and speedy recovery. \u263a\ufe0f", "Is it okay to have 1 or 2 beers while I am recovering from bell's palsy? I am stuck at home and would like to have a beer as I recover and relax. Is this okay? I am not a doctor. Or even close to an expert. But I bartend for a living, and am part time alcoholic. I got drunk more than a few times during the first two weeks while taking the medication. I fully recovered after about four weeks, though I did stop drinking two weeks in, and saw the biggest leaps and bounds in the last two weeks of recovery. Whether that was abstaining from the drink or just natural healing I do not know. Yeah... I am not trying to get drunk. Just a beer or two. I appreciate you sharing your experience though and it gives me hope. I imagine alcohol does not mix well with prednisone (not sure, check the box/ask a doctor), but after that two beers should not hurt. If you are on prednisone or an anti viral do not drink, they mix poorly. However if you are not on either of those I think that you should be fine \n\nI will state however, that most causes of Bell\u2019s palsy are viral, and your bodies immune system must fight it and heal your nerve. Drinking alcohol directly affects your bodies natural state. While recovering from Bell\u2019s palsy the smartest choice to minimize the effects would be to avoid any added stress on your body. But, a few beers most likely will not hurt, especially if you have a tolerance. Do they not mix well in the stomach? Or in another sense Both alcohol and prednisone suppress your immune system. If you are on prednisone and drink alcohol it will do you no benefit in terms of recovery from Bells. I will not say it will cause harm because it may not.\n\nPrednisone is also not very good for your stomach, and can irritate the digestive tract. Combing this with alcohol could be prone to trouble. Prednisone causes nausea for a lot of people, and you may find that alcohol makes this even worse.\n\nHowever, consuming prednisone with alcohol will not set off some chemical bomb in your stomach. It is just highly suggested that you do not drink alcohol while on drugs like this, to minimize their side effects and let them do their jobs. On top of minimizing the negative effects alcohol has on your body. \n\nI personally do not drink on any sort of prescription, mainly because I am a college kid who when he drinks does not do it in moderation lol. But if you want to drink in moderation while on it I would say if your prednisone dose is low (in the taper) and not long term a drink or two should be fine.  Okay thanks for the info", "Is eye twitching good or bad? I first noticed bell\u2019s on August 31, took meds starting September 2 in the morning (so within 48 hours), and now, Sept 4 my right side is completely paralyzed (has been as of yesterday), but I am noticing my eye starting to twitch today. Am I getting better or is this a bad sign that I am going to have some crazy uncontrolled movement on one side of my face? Mine was a mild case and yes I had twitching of my eyes. i dont think it is a bad thing it is just part of the Bells Palsy. I hope that you improve and recover soon. Mine lasted 3 weeks, but as I have said mine was pretty mild. Still freaked me out though being 55. I think it is a good sign. I had Bell\u2019s palsy and twitched a lot through my recovery. My twitching happened into bells, as well as out of it. I think it is just a sign that something is happening to your nerve, whether it is damage or some recovery, you really will not know until it happens.", "No complications from 1st vaccine dose Hi friends- some of us have been a little worried about BP recurrence from the Covid-19 vaccine. Happy to report that I received the first dose of the pfeizer one about 36 hours ago and have had no BP related issues. Nurses are saying the side effects are worse after the second dose, so I will let you know how that goes (early February). Take care everyone! Thanks for the information, please keep us updated. I am 3 years into Bell's and most of the symptoms are now livable, but the possibility of a recurrence is more than a little disturbing. It is worth noting that covid itself is very likely linked to ( so the vaccine is still going to be the safer bet. Just got the first dose today (moderna). Had BP in 2006 for an entire year, so I  was terrified. It is been 2 hours and zero issues. Onset of BP was around 3 weeks in the trials.\n\nI am 17 days after Moderna and now have BP. Not saying it is related, but who knows. Oh I did not know that. 3 weeks after the first or second dose? I am getting my second shot this Friday (2/5) I (33f) received my first dose (Pfizer) on 1/14. I developed BP for the 3rd time (1st time I was 8, second time at 29 almost exactly 4 years ago) on 2/5. No clue if the vaccine is what caused it but I was cleared by 2 doctors to get my 2nd dose on 2/9.", "I think I might have mild Bell's palsy. I was hit in the right eye really hard with a softball about 3 years ago and have noticed my face getting droopy since then. No numbness or paralysis, just droopiness, and it did not used to be that way.  Cannot speak to your issue... but for me (and others I have read about) you just INSTANTLY have it. I woke up, ate breakfast, and was like, \"half my face is not working\". \nAnd not diminish your quandary, but I cannot tell by your photo that anything is going on. You look great IMHO! From this photo you do not look to have BP. As specialk45 mentioned, it is a sudden onset. I had intense pain behind my left ear and a terrible headache. Then noticed that I was dribbling water out of the left side of my mouth when I tried to drink (~9am) and by 1pm I could not close my left eye. What you are describing sounds different. I would talk to a neurologist or a GP to get a consult. Best of luck! Thank you for your feedback! I was not sure if it could be a gradual onset or not. Yeah, since I have no numbness, it is unlikely that it is BP. Good luck to you as well! I woke up on a Saturday at 7am and felt great. Being a Saturday, I decided to snooze a bit and sleep in. I woke up again at Noon with a paralyzed face. It is been 4 or 5 weeks now and slowly getting back to normal.  You will likely be 95 plus percent back to normal in another 3 weeks. I hope! I am in sales and talking to customers is kind of important. I have to poke the side of my face to speak normally on phone calls without slurring. It is more difficult in person. I was just at a tradeshow for USAF and I felt completely down and out trying to speak loud and project. The good news is no one actually cares! Business as usual. ", "Recent visible face spasms - is this connected to my Bell\u2019s palsy? It looks like a vein is being pushed outward  It happens whenever I do a toothy grin - my left side is still drooping and the visible \u201cvein\u201d or other thing is still there  I have the same thing happen right above my lip on the affected side. It is been visibly quivering for about 2 weeks. No veins though. I look at it as a good sign that the nerves are active and fighting to take hold. If I do facial exercises around the mouth, it goes away for a bit. But your smile looks fine. Mine is still off-center. Maybe try the exercises to strengthen the muscles in that area.", "Training mouth to eat on BP side again? I would say in 85% recovered from my onset in January. My recovery started about a month ago but my mouth is not completely healed. I was never able to eat on BP side, but lately I have been trying and having some success but it is challenging. It is like I have to focus really hard to chew, and very slowly. Curious if anyone has tips on how to re-train my mouth on how to eat on that side again? Hi there! I was diagnosed with bp almost 4 weeks ago. I tried eating with the affected side, but I had to always use my tongue to move food from that side to unaffected side as I could not eat properly. Food would get stuck between my cheek and teeth and would not move. But an uncle of mine who is a doctor,  told me to try eat on that side, even if it is difficult. So for lunch I would take extra time to eat and practice. Or I would practice with dry fruits and nuts. So right now, there is improvement. I have noticed that the part near my lip has not improved (food gets stuck there), but towards my cheek has. But that is the only improvement overall for me :/\n\nI suppose chewing gum helps, have not tried it myself since I do not like chewing gum. \n\nEdit: chewing gum part. Thanks for the reply! I think I will keep trying for sure. Definitely will attempt the gum thing Hey, was thinking more about this and thought how about swishing (rinsing?) water in mouth? I have not read this anywhere, but I suppose it would not hurt. Obviously not to try too hard, and yes, it could be a mess, but maybe doing that might give you a better understanding where your mouth works and where it does not. I tried after brushing my teeth, still messy but realised not too messy like the first time I did after being diagnosed. i have long term bells palsy, about 5 years, mostly ok\n\nbut for swishing/rising, i still cant do it without assistance. i have to pinch the corner of my mouth closed with my finger\n\ni also use that as an exercise, where i hold a ball of air on one side of my cheek and move it to my bells palsy side and try to not... uh... make a farting noise hahaha. still cant do it, so not sure how effective it is. also i try to make comical faces in front of the mirror, like angry, happy etc. sometimes you 'feel' like the muscles are doing what it is supposed to, but they are in fact not. hope this helps! This is 100% accurate for me too. When I was first diagnosed there was no way I could even attempt. My mouth has improved a ton but there is still that space where my mouth does not close all the way when I pucker or try to swish", "Just diagnosed today Anything you folks can suggest I should/should not do? Yesterday my eye was twitching like crazy and by the end of the day when I was trying to call my cat for bedtime I could not make the usual noise I use to call him. Looked in the mirror and realized my mouth was not moving right.\n\nWent to the doctor today thinking I had hemifacial spasms but she said it was Bells Palsy. Great!\n\nWas given a mountain of pills to take and a cat scan was ordered to rule out anything else that might be going on.\n\nWhat should about avoid doing while this is going on and is there anything to lessen the annoyance it is causing? \n\nThanks in advance! It is just a waiting game. Take the steroids etc then let your body do its thing.\nI am 9 weeks in have regained 70% in the forehead, lip is about 15%, still cannot blink. Speech is about 80% back to normal. \nIt is highly unpleasant but you get used to it and it does improve.  I could not blink,Theratears liquid gel nighttime eye drops, worked the best. They made my vision blurry because it is an ointment, but it was way better than my eye tearing up all day. Sleeping is hard. I had to use medical tape to tape my eyelid shut. I would recommend a patch instead. Good luck! It is such a weird thing to be diagnosed with, but it will go away. So! First, I am sorry you are dealing with this too! \n\nNow. I suggest you take the prednisone exactly as directed all the way through (assuming this is what was prescribed to you!) \n\nI have tried many different things, Physical therapy has been helping keep my muscles awake and from atrophying too much, even though 3 months in I have small dips in my face. The thing that has helped most though was acupuncture. After 3 appointments I can finally turn up the corner of my mouth slightly! I also look a little more symmetrical too! It has made a huge difference and I wish I started Acupuncture sooner, I was told the sooner you start the better!! \n\nAs far as your eye protect it! I slept with eye patch bandages for a while before I could restfully keep my eye closed.  Mine has gotten slightly stronger. But I still carry eye drops with me everywhere because a strong breeze can still lift my eye lid! \n\nRest. As much as you can. It gets worse/weaker with sleepiness and stress! Try to avoid stressors/anxiety inducing situations and make sure you are sleeping enough! \n\nStraws save embarrassment and are much easier than a small capped bottle! I still often drool, dribble drinks out of the side of my mouth, or drop food out \ud83d\ude48\n\nAlso, make your employer aware of your situation! I teach and in the beginning talking all day was PAINFUL I literally had to take naps on my lunch break, and at the end of the day for our longer days I needed to call it quits early sometimes and just rest my head and eyes. Having an AP who was aware, supportive, and understanding made a world of a difference. She made me feel okay about taking a break when necessary otherwise I would have pushed too hard and made myself worse! \n\nKeep your head up and good luck!!  Well I am glad it goes away! It is definitely just annoying for me at the moment as I can still close my eye on the affected side luckily. Thank you so much for all the information!  I was given two different types of prescriptions. The prednisone and something called Mylan-Valacyclovir, but I will be starting those today. Hopefully the crazy list of side effects do not effect me and I can get through this without incident! Protect your ear on your affected side. Be careful around loud environments. I suggest an ear plug in that ear if you are anywhere loud. I almost passed out at a comedy show I am about to be a year in to my BP recovery! Still not 100% but I can live with this now. If you need a friend or anymore advice DM me! Everyone here has pretty much covered everything already.  I second everything said here!! Take the meds. Take care of the affected eye...eye patch, eye drops, eye lubricant. I wore sunglasses indoors for a few days. Rest!! Do your face exercise and facial massage. I also used essential oils and castor oil tinctures. I am not sure if those did anything but I was willing to try anything. \n\nI do not want to say it will work for everyone but I had a lot of good luck with acupuncture. I was not healing very quickly and was feeling like crap for about a month. I started acupuncture and I finally saw progress!\n\nI can totally sympathize with what you are going through and I am so sorry.  Good advise above. Two addendums. A) there is a great Facebook group with great information and thousands of other members (myself included) who have been there. B) as much as you are tempted to DO NOT STRAIN to force muscles to move. It can confuse them and cause what is fall synkenesis. I spent minutes every day trying to will movement and when I finally had some I pushed even harder. \n\nEnd of story is after 2 years I am 90% recovered BUT some of my facial muscles are synced for the rest of my life.\n\nEvery time I try to smile my eyes closes. When I chew the rest of my face moves too. Please do not repeat my mistake. They human body, almost always, recovers at its own pace. Sometimes in weeks, sometimes in months.\n\nLet it heal at its own pace. Please do not strain to force movement and cause other problems like I did. Oh wow, I was told nothing about that! Thank you! I am a big drag race fan so that would have sucked to find out the hard way. Thank you so much! So far mine is pretty mild. I can close my eye, partially smile and bottles have not proven to difficult yet. I will keep your offer in mind if things get worse. No need to apologize! I will get through this like everything else! I am a trooper through and through! Wife is scared and nervous, though. Think the doctor saying they want a CT scan to make sure it is nothing sinister causing this scared her quite a bit. Thanks for the advice! I have not tried to make it move more but I have been playing with the lack of movement. I will stop that, haha!  Of course! Sorry it was such a wall of text haha! I think the Mylan-Valacyclovir is an anti viral since it is a virus that gets into the cranial nerve! \n\nMost important is really to protect your eye! I just had to buy new sunglasses to help cover my eye from the wind and obviously to protect against the sun because I still cannot close it! I will have been dealing with this 3 months tomorrow! \ud83d\ude12\n\nI wish you a speedy recovery!!  I still have the ability to close my eye and keep it closed. \n\nI wear prescription glasses so sunglass are not a possibility for me but I will be picking up a patch in case it gets worse for the night. \n\nI hope you get full functionality of your face back soon, friend!\n\nThanks for all the information, I will be keep this post close! Ah that is great news!  And thank you! Good luck!! ", "Pain coming on a week after diagnosis I was diagnosed last Tuesday, and was prescribed Valtrex and Prednisone for 7 days. I had no pain up until yesterday, which was my first day off of the medication. I would say I have recovered about 50-60%, but now my neck, jaw, and face on the affected side are very sore.\n\nHas anyone else had this experience? Is it a sign of healing or possibly because I am no longer taking the medication? I am not sure if I should contact my doctor or not.\n\nThank you! Pain is normal with BP. My mother is still recovering but she had that pain for the first 2-3 weeks. The doctor prescribed gabapentin for the pain and she said it helped. Personally I think  it is a sign of healing but that is just me.", "Facial synkinesis. Is it too late for me? Hi everyone I hope everyone is good. Seven years ago I got bells palsy. It took a whole year to get better but I noticed some differences even though I looked closer to what I used to look like before I got it. I had involuntary facial movements and what I did not know then is that it is facial synkinesis. I did not know what it was and doctors never told me about facial synkinesis. Now I am founding out more about it and I was wondering if I can get help even if it is been seven years. Is there still hope for me.\n\nForgive me English is not my first language. It will be more challenging to address because it has been so long, but yes, there is still hope. I went to physical therapy for facial synkinesis this past summer (1.5 years out from BP) and I had marked improvement after several sessions. Okay thank you. I really hope so. What kind of doctor or specialist do you go to for something like this. A physiotherapist maybe? I saw a plastic surgeon initially because I wanted botox. He referred me to a physical therapist who did \u201cmirror therapy\u201d for facial palsy. Okay, thank you so much for responding to me. Any reason they did not want to do Botox? I was thinking about doing the same. Been 20 years since I got BP though, and I have tried physical therapy. There is a clinic in The Netherlands that I visited for it. Some small improvement but really takes daily practice to see. The areas that I wanted addressed by Botox would not have been good areas because the injections would have made it so I could not smile well. Once that was explained I decided it was not the right decision. Mine is pretty minor, so I never pursued a remedy. My left eye lid tenses a bit if I touch my lower lip with my tongue. So weird how this manifests, right? Ah I see. It is definitely a very individualized thing, facial palsy. Affects people so distantly. I am looking for more symmetry in my smile, so probably would get a little Botox on my unaffected side. My affected eyebrow and eye are quite overactive so I think a bit would help there, to calm it down. It sounds like it could help your eye! My eyebrow is dead, I actually had surgery recently to create more symmetry. I am in a similar boat and am curious if you can explain how mirror therapy works? They would have me sit in front of a mirror and position it so I could only see the \u201cgood\u201d side of my face. It is supposed to help train the \u201cbad\u201d side how to do those movements again. I am sorry to hear that! I hope the surgery helped some. I will try that. Thank you. It did! You can see results in my post history if you are interested. Yes it looks great! Thanks for sharing. I am in a similar boat. After a nearly full recovery I woke up one morning a few weeks ago and now my blinking makes me chin and neck twitch just slightly. Hoping it is temporary but afraid it might not be. So strange how it is different for everybody. I am not sure if it is serious enough to be concerned or what. Does not effect my symmetry at all.", "Five months and issues with blinking persists I am five months in, to the day, and mostly recovered from my second bout of Bell's palsy (10 months apart).  But an issue with my right eye persists where it lacks the ability to blink naturally, and it is constantly watering. \n\nI can consciously make my eye close and force a blink, and it stays shut when I sleep. However, the blinking part is incredibly frustrating. \n\nHas anyone had luck with surgical interventions, or had a sporadic recovery after the 5 month mark? I am losing some hope for recovery. I have Ramsay Hunt Syndrome which is usually misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy since it causes facial palsy.  Many people on my RHS facebook group have done implanted gold weights into the eyelid - or they also make one that sticks on to the outside of the eyelid.  I opted for a different procedure which was an injection of filler into my eyelid.  The added weight allowed me to immediately begin blinking/closing normally.  The filler eventually dissolves (a year?) so there is no need to remove a weight.  Much less invasive as well.  This was done a oculoplastic surgeon who works with the team at the Center for Facial Recovery in Rockville, MD.  I was very pleased with the results of this procedure since the lack of blinking normally was the worst part of my condition. This is really good info, thanks! I might look into this too. Not sure where you live but here is an option in Dallas:  ( Thanks! I am in Oregon, but maybe they can recommend someone near me. Can I ask how they ended up confirming your RHS instead of BP? After researching I was convinced I had RHS but my doctor seemed to think not. RHS usually shows up as rashes in the ear and often sharp ear pain.  There is a test they can run to see if you have Shingles (which causes RHS).", "Day 20 with Bell\u2019s Palsy  Good progress. I am 26 days and almost fully recovered. Looks like you do not have much more to go. Speedy recovery \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f Happy to hear you are almost recovered! Was there anything that you feel helped the most as far as the recovery process? I stayed positive and optimistic, laughed like I never laughed before, kept it light, but let people know what was going on just to clear the air (dealing with customers and such). I heard b12 may have some benefit, so took 2500mcg/day plus multivitamins and used a jade roller a little. I posted some videos on here, they kind of show my attitude towards it. You are so pretty! After a lot of research I started acupuncture on day 10 and they gave me a soft golf ball to roll on my face. They also gave me some chinese herbal supplements, which im honestly not keeping up with. I do think the acupuncture has definitely played a big role in speeding up the process. I have done 5 sessions so far. I will check the video out. Thank you!!! \u2665\ufe0f I have heard so many conflicting things about it, it was almost impossible to know what was what, so i just figured I would take the meds I was given and augment with a little b12 to be on the safe side. Your progression kind of looks like mine did, so I am going to take a gamble and say this week will be a pretty decent week for you. Week 2 to week 3 for me was pretty big. If you look up Phil Bell's palsy on YouTube, you will see a few more videos. I did a 2 week and 3 week progress update on there and you can really see the progression. Best of luck in your recovery! It looks like you are starting to gain control back.\n\nIt took me about 9 months for mine to recover until it was undetectable by others, but still never fully healed from my perspective. It does not look like you will have that happen to you.\n\nHave you had any strange muscle twitches/spasms on your affected side? I have been getting acupuncture treatment since day 10. After every treatment I usually get twitches/spasms in the area where they attached the stimulation rods. I was told the twitching is a good sign. Yeah, I took it as a good sign as well in my case. I have not had any twitching for a couple of years now (had my BP in 2015) so I assume I am as healed as I am going to get naturally. Probably a good idea for me to do some rehabilitation exercises.\n\nWhere did you find out about the acupuncture? Well when I was researching recovery treatments, acupuncture was popping up. Then a video I watched(I will link it) the girl recovered pretty quickly and she felt that the acupuncture helped the most. I honestly have not been doing any facial exercises or anything like that, I just massage with the squishy golf ball my acupuncturist gave me. (", "Trying to lighten the mood for fellow BP redditors  Hahaha this is good For me the worst was: can you open your mouth so I can understand you when you talk?", "Is this a sign its getting better? I have had BP for a little over a week now and noticing that it feels like my muscles are moving but my actual face is not.\n\nWithout looking in the mirror it feels like it is moving quite a bit, but when I look in the mirror nothing is moving. I felt done twitching while mine was improving, not sure if that is what you are feeling. For me it is been 4 weeks and everyone thinks I am 100% healed, I would say I am about 90%. This happened to me, I kept \u201cmoving\u201d the area as much as possible and I believe that is what helped the most. After that I had most movement back in that area in about two weeks. I have noticed the same thing: it felt like my face was moving but when I made a video I realized it was not. Or it was not moving as much as I felt. But I would say it helped me push through. Your face needs reminding the way it should move. Now my lips are able to move and I am able to whistle a little bit. My eyebrow is also starting to move again. I just keep moving it every 30 minutes or so. Seems like it is helping. All the doctors I went to said the more you move / do face exercises, the better. Specially at early days. Hope you will recover soon.", "What It is Like To Live With: Sudden Paralysis of the Face ", "I had to make a collage to see the progress. I am praying for continued healing and improvement. Keep hope alive!!!  It will Happen! Just takes time, good luck! Thanks That is extremely good progress!  \n\nI started making progress about 3 weeks after onset then it stopped, it progresses to normal more slowly now.  It will get there for you too! So sick! Whatever you are doing keep it up! Thank you! I feel better now about the process and looking forward to more progress! Did you do any therapy? Thank you! Absolutely!!! Wow! I really needed to see this today- thank you for posting. Patience is hard but it is little sparks of hope like this that make me keep going:) I have not done any personally.  I will do little massages and tap the side of my face but that is about it.  It is more of a matter of your facial nerves remembering that they work and you will feel twitches on the affected side. Yes! Thank you! I posted it for comments like yours! It makes me feel better to know that through this process, I am able to encourage others. I have been so absorbed in my insecurities, and for what?!? It is going to heal as slow or fast as it wants... if that. Lol. You are more than welcome and thank you for helping me because this process has totally taken a toll on me. Oh ok. Well, My therapist recommended the facial expression exercises over the massages. So just try making facial expressions such as frowning, acting surprised, etc. I still feel tenderness in certain areas so I put a pillow case with an ice pack on my face for about 8 minutes too. I feel it has helped, we shall see\ud83d\udcab I have done that too.  I recommend making sure your affected eye is used to light and seeing.  I train my eye too since I cover it frequently.\nBest of luck! Best of luck!", "Hey I just got the palsy! Better than a stroke \ud83d\ude0eWhat do you all think about B12 shots? Man what a weird day. Everything was normal till I was eating lunch and noticed half my mouth was not working. I looked at my face in the mirror and noticed my eyes were not blinking at the same time! Did not take long for me to figure out it was not just my mouth and eyelids... it was the whole right side of my face. Went to urgent care which sent me to the ER... TL;DR: you know the diagnosis.\n\nAnyway, has anyone gotten B12 Methylcobalamin injections? I have read thru some of the threads here that mention they might be beneficial. There is a couple places close by to me that offer them. I am thinking I might give it a shot, har har. Any thoughts? I say take them b12 is good for the nervous system and helps prevent nerve damage give it a shot you have nothing to lose Thanks for the reply! Yeah, TBH I have been wanting to try B12 shots anyway so this is a good excuse. I took them orally and I saw improvement the next day Yes. My doctor suggested B- Complex.  Took them orally, but an injection would put it in your system quicker.  I am also doing acupunture which has, at least in my case, worked wonders.  Highly suggested. Yep- got my shot today. Cannot say I feel any different but we will see if anything happens in the following days. For the acupuncture, did you specifically tell them about your issue? Then they poke your face? Yes. I called and spoke with a nurse that worked there first.  I asked if the doctor had experience treating Bell's Palsy.  He did. I went for a free consultation and ended up receiving my 1st treatment that day. The needles are very fine-pointed. Since I was \"frozen\" due to the paralysis, I never felt it. Now I am heading into my 3rd week of treatment and I do feel it which means the nerves are awakening.  Is there visible improvement? Yes. Very much so. Wow! Ok, I might give it a shot. Thanks. You are welcome.  Please do not forget to apply warm compresses to the affected area and google facial exercises.  \nI did warm compresses immediately and waited a few weeks then began the facial exercises.\nI protected my affected eye, too. Covered it at night after applying an ointment made especially for eyes. \nAdditionally,  I am still taking B- complex, CBD oil and Turmeric...low dose chewable aspirin in a.m. to reduce swelling. \nBest wishes.", "Does stress prevent healing? I am on 4 full months of this now. My mouth movement is almost back to normal and I have started to be able to close my eye. But, I am still not blinking and still having to wear the eye patch at night. And I still have some double vision that comes and goes. Does anyone know if stress can make healing slower? I have a very stressful situation at work that keeps going and sometimes I even have panic attacks at night. I just find myself wondering if this is slowing down my healing progress. Not sure about it preventing healing, but I believe mine was stress-induced.\n\nPrior to my BP, I had just endured what was probably the most stressful work week I have had this 2021. I assume that it likely caused my immune system to drop low enough for a previous infection (probably the mumps virus I had when I was a kid) to trigger the BP.\n\nImmediately afterwards, I let management know I developed BP, mainly to explain my appearance at our regular zoom meetings. They took the hint and refrained from piling anything unnecessarily stressful on me for the next couple of months. And I think I am about 85-90% recovered (most of my face works now, except half my lips and I still cannot whistle).\n\nBack to your main question: the short answer is yes, constant stress is probably contributing to your slow recovery from BP. If stress can induce BP, then not surprisingly it could also likely extend the duration of the symptoms. I think mine was stress induced as well. Something interpersonal happened that caused me to really go into a state of almost panic/fight or flight for a few days off and on. I felt this flush/hot sensation behind my ears (I still do actually) and thought it was just anxiety. But then BP came on over like a day. \n\nGot meds and have a neurologist appt Monday (ten days after onset). Trying to be calm but it is stressful. Not having a social life and needing to rebuild one is what led to the stress in the first place, and now I cannot really meet new people.\n\nI am wondering what the beginning of recovery feels like. I am getting mild flutters of sensation once in a while (like an imperceptible twitching) around my eye and lips, but no movement yet. My doctor and acupuncturist told me I had to rest and avoid stress. \n\nI am meditating almost everyday and I can feel how much it helps. When I do not, I feel something is missing  (21 days of Abundance on Spotify is really good: \n\nI am also going to bed on time and sleeping at least 8 hours.\n\nI am having to modulate the stress, so as soon as I feel it coming, i take a step back and breathe a few times. \nFor me, I guess the way I manage stressful situations is changing as I adapt to this BP situation. It is been 3 weeks and I feel that I am more chill.\n\nAlso I am taking vitamins (B12, C, D) and now that I stopped with prednisolon, I am taking probiotics before going to bed. \n\nSorry for the long reply, hope it helps you somehow and wish you a good recovery. Others have said as much but I want to be short. It is possible stress caused it in the first place. So treat yourself well, and take care of your needs.

Sunday night (going into Monday, may 3rd) I woke up around 11pm from my sleep with weird throbbing pain behind left ear with some crazy nausea but no vomiting.

I cant blink on my right eye and mouth doesnt open fully if i try to show teeth. Also if i do muscle exercise involving nose, right side of nose doesnt get wrinkles. Lips are also asymettrical kind of. But all in all i guess it could be worse? When my mouth is closed i look usual, so im guessing i got a mild case? \n\nI also got 4 A4 instructions about face exercises, should i start doing these exercises asap ? Some yt video said not to do them in initial phase... \n\nAlso some page didnt recommend chewing bubble gum as this exercises wrong muscles, is that true?\n\nshit man, fckin shit.. just when my life started to turn i get this for me... im scared of never getting any gf if i get some permanen damage to my face because of it. I am sorry you have to deal with it man. Bells palsy sucks big time. \n\nThe good news is the vast majority of people recover completely or very near completely. Of those that do not recover completely, the remaining effects are usually very minor. \n\nI will share my story, hopefully it brings at least a little ray of hope for you. I was diagnosed in early September. From the what you describe, very similar case to yours. I had some movement of the larger cheek muscles, but I could not blink that eye, could not bare my teeth, had trouble closing my lips around straws or cups to drink. I also lost taste on that side of my tongue and had issues producing tears. The tears was honestly the worst part for me. \n\nFirst, I will tell you this. Most people will not notice anything is wrong. If you do not smile, it is likely far less noticeable than you think. It is easy to feel like your face is all messed up because your brain knows it is sending commands but the muscles are not listening, so it tells you your face is messed up. The reality is it is not nearly as noticeable as you think to everyone else. \n\nSecond, most people are far more compassionate than you think. I did not find anyone who acted weird or treated me poorly because of it. Most who noticed either ignored it or gently asked if I was alright. Everyone who I explained it to said it was not that noticeable, and treated me with a pretty high level of compassion. \n\nAll that said, at this point, I am nearly completely recovered. I still get little twitches in my lips and eyes on that side from time to time, but other than that, I cannot notice any symptoms. I know my recovery was on the faster side, but it sounds like you have a more mild case, so I would wager you will likely recover pretty rapidly as well. For what it is worth, I did not do any kind of physical therapy. If your doctor prescribed it, do it as instructed, but I would not recommend doing anything they did not prescribe. \n\nMy biggest piece of advise is to just embrace it as part of your life journey. You cannot do anything to avoid getting it, and you cannot really do anything to control the recovery beyond what you are already doing. You can however choose how you let it affect you mentally. Do not let it get you down. Do not let it control your social life. Do not let it make you feel like you cannot do the things you want. (except maybe whistling, that may not work). Keep your chin up, it WILL get better.  said it all.\n\nI healed up in around 7 months. People were chill.  My biggest issue was my eye twitches and my drooling.\n\nYou are going to get through this.  \n\nTake good care of your teeth! I found it hard to floss. I am 8 weeks out, and fully healed.  My biggest advice is baby your eye.  Tape it shut at night, and keep it moist with eye drops. Amazing turntime from diagnosis to meds. You will be fine. Do your facial Exercises as recommend It will get worse because it gets better.. the symptoms fully hit me on day 3.. on day 3-4, it slow extended from the left side of my face to right side. I will not suggest doing the facial exercise so early.. I took vitamin b12 and curcumin which helped me a lot too. Hang in there! You will get through this! It sounds like you jumped on meds really quickly. \n\nHere is a mental guide for recovering from facial paralysis: (\n\nYou will be okay!", "Just been diagnosed with Bells Palsy This morning I work up and my face felt off, like numb but I could still feel it. It is taken me a while to figure out what is going on. I have been to the doctors and he confirmed it was Bell\u2019s palsy and has prescribed me strong steroids. No aching and no pains but I cannot close my left eye without squinting hard, my mouth on one side has a numb effect and I have lost some taste. My tongue is slightly tingly. I have not heard about this until today so any information and advice in helping deal with this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance Be patient with yourself. Be kind to yourself. Take your steroids. Do physical therapy. See a neurologist. Invest in eye ointment and medical tape. Straws. They made everything easier. \n\nIt will be alright. For 95% of people this isnt forever. Thank you, I will take it easy on myself. I worried myself thinking it may be a sign of a stroke. In terms of physical therapy my doctor has told me to make faces to keep my muscles moving. I will have to use tape when I sleep. Straws, yes. Strangely did not think of that. \n\nSomething I was worried about was how long it will last and if there would be any lasting effects or long term damage. Everyone is recovery is different. 95% of people recover with no lasting effects. It can take 6 weeks to 6 months to be 100% again. Just hope you are not in the 5% club. I hope not. I am not sure if it is one of the conditions that is easier to treat the quicker you catch it? Generally the outcome is better the sooner you start steroids. I had it last Christmas. It took 12 to 14 days for full recovery. Just take easy and take meds.  I took selfies to see progress for myself. I helped. That is a relief. I will be starting them about 9 hours after first feeling the symptoms. Thank you for your help I am glad to hear you recovered so quickly! Great idea to takes pics to see your progress, I will do the same! Be patient for sure. It definitely feels worse then it looks. Stay on the meds as prescribed and  you will see a difference. I  am going on day 14 and can notice my eyebrow, nostril and month move more a little now. Eye drops and taping my eye at night helps a lot. Brushing your teeth and rinsing your month made me laugh so hard. Good luck! Massage your face, chew gum and try blowing a ballon. If need be acupuncture I need to look in the mirror to make sure my eye has not fallen down my face. Blinking is annoying. I have to be conscious to close my affected eye. I am hoping for the same results 2 weeks into my recovery. I have tape for when I sleep but drops I have never liked but may have no choice. Haha, has not thought about how that is going to feel. Drinking makes me laugh sometimes so brushing my teeth is going to be a show! Thank you!! Great ideas, thank you! Use a home made hot pack for the pain and to get blood flow for healing \nDont worry if you dont see results in 6weeks\nAnd eat healthy This video is informative and reassuring.\n\n\n\nMy BP began 5 weeks ago. I took Prednisone from day 1 but it still worsened before getting better. There was a long period of being much the same but improvement has been rapid in the last week. I can tell I am not yet fully recovered but no-one looking at me would know without careful observation. We each have our own recovery timeline. I hope yours is sooner rather than later but as the video says - do not panic! Best wishes.\n\nJust saw your comment about making faces. You might want to double-check that. My doctor told me to definitely not do any facial exercise and I did not. Each day I checked my progress, or lack of, by raising my eyebrows, closing my eyes, blinking, flaring my nostrils and smiling. Did that once a day, that is all. Take the time to go get blood work done. My BP was caused by Lymes Disease which was caught super early because of the BP. May not apply to you but it is worth a look just in case because then you can clear it up with two weeks of medicine. My face snapped back before I finished all of my medicine... best of luck! \n\nTough times do not last tough people do! Thank you, I will be sure to do that.", "Diagnosed with bell's palsy after shingles (31M) As the title says, I got shingles on 4/17/21 and started healing a week later. My shingles were around my ear and all over the left side of my head. On 4/29 (Thursday) I started noticing that my left eye was blinking slower than my right one. By the end of the day I started noticing significant weakness in the left side of my face. The next morning I could not move the left side at all. My eye would not stop tearing up, I had super sensitivity to high pitched sounds, sensitivity to bright lights in my left eye, pain in my ear and a change in taste. I did a little research and found out that this can happen if you get shingles in or around the ear. Being the stubborn person I am, I did not make a doctor appointment until Monday 5/3. My doctor new right away what it was and prescribed antivirals and prednisone. He said I should have been in there by Saturday for the best odds, but I should hopefully notice improvement within a couple of months. Trying to be optimistic, but damn is it hard (and frankly embarrassing) to try to eat and drink in public when half your mouth does not work. Luckily I have a supportive wife and she is very empathetic. I know I am very newly diagnosed, but I am happy to have found a place where I can talk about it with people who know what I am going through, and learn more about all of this. This could also be Ramsay Hunt Syndrome which you should google. It could mean a more severe paralysis, or not. This is what I think I had and it took about 4 months to get some movement back. Either way, Prednisone, antivirals, rest and making sure you eye is OK are what you should do. Best of luck to you.", "Brass players with BP I have had bilateral bells palsy for over 3 months now, so no control over any of my face.\n\nI used to play both euphonium and trombone in my local band but obviously cannot do that currently.\n\nHas anyone here recovered to the point of being able to play again? Flute player checking in.. 5 and a half years of not being able to play.. and it kills me every day. \n\nDont use me as your example though. I am in the small minority that does not recover facial movement. Have not played woodwind since I was young but I think I could do it. It might take a bit to get the muscle in the cheek back though. I am 1 year out and still cannot fully hold breath in my cheek +1, and it sucks hard. I played French horn for 10 years, and I loved my orchestra. 1.5 years ago I got BP (no improvement until 3 months). Almost full recovery, apart from the very corner of my bottom lip, so I leak air and cannot really play. I am in a choir now and I like it a lot, but it sucks that my horn (gift from my grandfather) is now just gathering dust instead of being played. I am about a month from symptom onset and my face is almost completely back to normal! My lips pull a little to the affected side, but I am able to pucker pretty well now. I do not have a trumpet anymore but I am pretty sure I could play just fine now, but probably would have had a little trouble a week ago.", "Jaw pain/soreness I was diagnosed last Wednesday, so just over a week ago and am currently taking prednisone. I felt the worst on Sunday and have not seen any sort of improvement which I know would be slim of course. But today I woke up to my jaw feeling sore on the affected side. It feels like I had a tooth pulled, like that bruised feeling. It does not hurt to talk or eat, just when touched and has no noticeable swelling. Has anyone else experienced this? I have an appointment with my doctor next week so unless it becomes worse, I will just wait to talk to him then.  I have had BP twice, the first time was 17 years ago. Unfortunately I have had consistent jaw pain and soreness on the affected side since I was first diagnosed.  I have tried everything I can think of and seen multiple doctors about it, but it is still here. \nI am sorry, I hope you have better luck! I had it as well, and the jaw pain would come and go throughout. I am recovered now, and I do not have the jaw pain anymore. Yes, I also experienced jaw pain.  And a ringing/pressure in my ears.  It was awful.  Went away after about a week on a high dose of prednisone and antivirals (still had the facial paralysis, but the pain was gone.)\n\nHang in there! I had pain for at least 3 weeks. My whole head hurt to the touch and ached at the same time. You are not unusual! Good luck with your healing! I was diagnosed October 19 2018. I am about 80 percent healed now. I did and still do have that feeling in my jaw. ", "Radiation Exposure and Bell\u2019s Palsy: A Hypothetical Association (2018)  Hmmmmmm, I have been recovered since August 2018 but recently I have been experiencing twitching in the affected side, I wonder if it has anything to do with the AirPods I got for Christmas ... This particular study focuses on HSV-1 (the herpes virus that causes cold sores and, likely, causes BP) and whether radiation causes HSV to \"activate.\"  It is commonly thought that stresses on the body cause HSV to activate, and they want to know if radiation is one of those stresses.  Not that radiation causes BP. Turn off the AirPods for a week. Feel better?\n\nUse a wi-fi radiation app to measure all the signals your AirPods emit.\n\n Meters: Android: Wifi Radiation Apps\n\n\n\n Meter Reports: Wi-Fi\n\n", "Eye Twitching and Late Treatment Hello all, my sister contracted BP two weeks ago but it was diagnosed only on the fifth day. She got steroids intravenously after that for three days, orally (12 pills/day the first week, now 2), however she was not told she had to put in eye drops or that she should wear an eye patch, let alone tape it at night (we live in a rather provincial town). After two weeks we caught up on everything and started taking care of the eye. My sister also has TMD and we suspect it has something to do with her paralysis and she developed a tic in the eye on the UNaffected side of the face (it twitches all the time now). I thought it was synkinesis at first but it only happens to the muscles/nerves on the affected side of the face, doesn\u2018t it? We tried searching for it on the net but found nothing. Have any of you had problems with the other side of the face? And do you think any damage could already have been done to the affected eye since we were so late with the treatment (my sister herself doesn\u2018t feel any eye dryness or discomfort)? And is it also so bad that the treatment with steroids began later than 72 hours? Hi I will give you as much information as I can.\n\nMake an eye appt with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) like I did. He will guild your sister more then any internet post due to everyone is condition being a little different and test her vison, front and back.. For me my eye was fine the first 24hrs when I got BP then the muscle became weak which is weird as most people wake up with the weakness in the beginning (like I said everyone is a bit different).\n\nMake sure to let them know she has BP so they can squeeze her in the same day or as asap. Carry the meds she was given always as she will get asked about them even after they are done.\n\nWhen it comes to her eye for now first figure out if its closing properly. If its not determine how bad is it, for me it would delay in closing so it was mild, the most I had to do was put on drops so it doesnt cause dryness which can lead to eye injury over time.\n\nFor those who have extreme weakness to the point they cant close it they have to patch it or tap it down. In either case drops and night ointment is recommended, and ask her to try to take notice if throughout the night as she sleep if her eye stays open or if its open when she wakes up. If she does then patching it at night is a good idea for a week or for however long she needs it to be.\n\nI also had twitching but it was on the affected side and it was due to my eye lid recovering. If she is having twitching on the non-affected side then it could be due to stress. When you get BP you have to do your best to relax and stay stress free.\n\nA few other tips Id say are I was wearing glasses until my eye was fully healed, especially when I went outside cus of wind and the delay in my blinking. Try B12 pills or/and CBD oil. Most importantly look up a good acupuncturist with good reviews and let then know ahead of time you need treatment for BP. Acupuncture helped me the most tbh.Other things I tried was exercises, drinking lots of water and drink milk before sleep.\n\nIt should also be noted that I felt awful after being off the meds for inflammation which could be why shes having issues coming up, I sure did, and after a week I got off the B12 and CBD oil bc my affected side started to twitch, I have always been drug free, unless seriously needed so for me I felt it was the best move as I was 90% recovered at the time.\n\nAlso how much of the meds what she on per pill. 12 seems very excessive, I was on meds 3 pills per day for 7 days. Both Inflammation and anti viral. Also the meds from what I have heard havent been proven to help BP, its just a safety measure that MIGHT provide extra help.\n\nIf you need any other help you or have more questions, you can DM me here or at my discord ICHI#0009 hopefully some of this information has been helpful. My understanding is the same about synkenesis - it should only happen on the affected side. If her eye is not sore it should be fine but I agree with the other commenter that you should see an eye doctor. \n\nI did not start taping my eye until a few days in either - I have Ramsay Hunt, which is more severe, and I am still taping 4 months in - but no damage was done from those first few days. I would recommend night gel and 3Ms fabric tape - others were too harsh for my eyelid. Hi there, I would like to know if I can still take steriods  even if my bp is about 2 years already? Pls advise Thanks Hey Ann, usually treatment for BP works better in the beginning. For steroids and antiviral pills they work best within the first 72hrs of BP. The meds you get also have not been directly found to work but everyone takes them as an extra help and on it potentially working.\n\nI do not think a dr would prescribe them to you since it is been two years but try talking to your dr, if you do not have a current dr then try an urgent care or tele dr. If they tell you it will not have any major side effects then it will not hurt for you to try it out. You never know but that is something only a dr can comment on.\n\nI do recommend acupuncture treatment and trying other things like CBD oil and b12 if you cannot get the meds or after the meds are done. (Do not mix to many things at once)\n\nAlso BP exercises are good to get on if you have not already.\n\nHope this helps Thanks for your advise, this is very helpful, nice to know \ud83d\ude09 You are welcome", "Dumb question maybe Is it normal to have headaches towards the front of your head and the back of your head both on the side of the BP? Also with the paralysis part I thought I was not supposed to be able to feel my face, i can feel when i touch my face but no muscle movements just a lot of twitching. Sorry for the ignorant questions. \ud83d\ude1e Not a dumb question at all. Numbness happens to some and not others. I have not had headaches, but the symptoms vary so it could be perfectly normal. Maybe someone else has some experience there. The twitching is normal, it is little signals getting through. It is also a sign that healing has started. I had twitches for a while, then some movement returned and I am blinking a little better. Now, I have a drum solo in my left ear. They are all signs that the slow healing process is moving along. Thank you! This subreddit has help me out so much. I really wish I knew what caused this as it just came out of nowhere.", "Face exercises and massage during my physio  That is what am having as a part of my physio therapy (prior to that they do ultrasound massage, UV lamp and electric stimulation). Massage/exercises take about 10-15 minutes. Man all I got was electric stim and that screwed up my nerves even more and caused some gnarly synkinesis. Oh wow! Did not know it can cause that. Any warning signs to watch out for? Not really. On e you have it there is really no reversing it. The biggest sign I guess, is if you smile but your eye closes instead. Thanks for filming this for us! I saw this post last night and first thing this morning I called my massage therapist.\n\nI am a massage therapist in a clinic, I went in today (day 3 of flair up) and my boss gave me a facial massage.

My wife had an episode of Bell\u2019s Palsy, that ended last week. \n\nI can break down her timeline and treatment here to help keep you all positive and help you cope through this extremely scary experience.\n\nPro tip number 1, in most cases, this will, indeed, go away. \n\nMy wife (40) has a history of HHV-6 type issues, that just keep cropping up, almost seasonally. They usually crop up around her menstruation cycle and during periods of high stress. \n\nWe were able to back trace her condition to be directly, and historically related to the varicella virus. We concluded this because she became symptomatic shortly after she was 5, with HHV-6 like symptoms. An easier way to think of this is to just call it \u201cherpes;\u201d although you may find that difficult because it is related to varicella and she had no sexual contact at 5 years old. Essentially, her condition and this episode of Bell\u2019s Palsy, is textbook herpes. We like to call it HHV-6.\n\nThis illness was impossible to pin down, because it rotated, through a series of illnesses that presented itself as many different things. One episode a doctor said she had herpes, another doctor called it mono, and another time it presented as zoster or shingles. Another time, she was even told she may have like disease. Not true. It was Herpes or HHV-6.\n\nEither way, against my better judgement, I took a crack at it because, over the years, it began to intensify, and became more and more of an issue.

I hope I can bring a little bit of hope and happiness into the lives of those that are going through this. Being a practitioner, are you familiar with this in children? I honestly think I watched my daughter have this happen to her tonight. She said her eye started to water and then within just a few minutes that side of her face was not working. My mother was diagnosed with BP when she was in 7th grade. This really scared me tonight. Research I have done pretty much says that with children it will more than likely go away on its own. I appreciate any advice or feedback from anyone. Thank you.  -a concerned mom. I personally never worked on children, so that is not my area of expertise. In her case, I would definitely take her to a physician because the treatment is going to require a prescription and some follow ups. \n\nEven though it may resolve itself, children are cases I would always seek help with the diagnosis, and getting some meds to help her heal.", "Pain behind ear So I am going on month 9 I passed rhe 8 month mark and I am very scared before bp the night before I got horrible pain behind my ear.

Hey! So quick backstory: Friday late night noticed my smile was weird and my contacts felt like they were really dry. Then Sunday went to ER, diagnosed BP (right side face effected) and given steroids and antiviral as per most people. When reading a lot of unfortunate issues most people seem to have, I am thinking mine might be a bit more on the mild side and optimistic for quicker recovery but I am hoping anyone here is able to help. Honestly, I am looking for a bit of online guidance as the internet info is all over the place! \n\nBelow symptoms have been the same since onset (~7 days ago):\n\n- eye can blink on its own, a bit slow but I can fully close it on my own without using my finger. Eye is sore and feels \u201ctired\u201d, using drops and a sleep mask at night just in case it is opening involuntarily\n- smile is visibly crooked, laughing really pulls my face to the side but resting face looks normal\n- under eye has begun twitching when I try to smile\n- I can talk and pronounce all words with some mouth pulling\n- face ache near temple (almost feels like clenched jaw pain)\n- have full taste and hearing\n- ears are a bit more sensitive to loud sounds (pots banging, loud tv)\n- right eyebrow and forehead are tight, slight movement of eyebrow tho\n\nI am so sorry for everyone having to deal with BP, it is mostly a mind-effer for me and I am aware that a lot of people have severe symptoms and I am extremely sympathetic towards that.\n\nThanks everyone Hey! I used the House-Brackmann scale to classify myself, I believe it is a well-studied scale. Maybe check that out to get a general idea of the severity? It will not be completely accurate because it is meant for doctors to assess you, not for a self-assessment, but it is more objective than different people\u2019s opinions!\n\n\nI was where you are a few weeks ago (albeit my BP sounds a bit worse, I was sitting at V-VI on the scale above) and completely understand how you are feeling. You might like to know that I have made a 90% recovery, I have some tinnitus and slight asymmetry in my eye and mouth but otherwise back to normal. \n\n\nThe neurologist I spoke to said it is likely that I will continue recovering much slower than I did initially but could be 100% recovered eventually, although honestly it does not bother me at the moment because this is way better than I was expecting. \n\n\nIf you need to chat feel free to send me a message, I know how full on it is to have BP and how helpless it can make you feel! Thank you so much for your advice, I have checked out the House Brackmann, it is bit confusing but semi helpful to see where you are at. It is good to know that you are making a great recovery and hopefully you will be able to be back to full motion as soon as possible. Honestly, it is nice to have real feedback than what is on Google, so much appreciated! No worries at all! Yeah it can be kind of confusing, I found the version with a table that actually describes the characteristics most helpful, rather than the ones just saying mild/moderate/severe! Did you finish your steroids? I remember mine got worse after I finished the steroids. Hey! No have not finished yet, full dosage today and then gradually decreases the dosage for then next 5 days\u2026! Your symptoms appear to be on the milder side to me. Have your symptoms stabilized? For most people it worsens, stabilizes and gets better. If your symptoms have stabilized here, you are pretty much on the milder end. Thank you for your response, yes they got worse Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday and have stabilized the last two days, with a slight eye twitch when I smile today. Appreciate the support! I have had it twice and it happened that way both times. It felt mild while I was on steroids but as soon as I was off it felt like it got worse. I did not have a taper tho so idk if that will make a difference Good luck and hope it is a mild and easy recovery! Thank you! Hi there! I am not a medical professional, however I was diagnosed with a moderately severe case of BP (House-Brackmann Score 4). Yours seems more like a score 3 at worst, maybe score 2 (I do not want to diagnose you of course) I am wishing you a speedy recovery regardless! :) Make sure to get rest and take your meds! Thank you, appreciate the advice! This app is much better than Google lol that is true, lmao. also i feel like doctors never told me what signs of recovery are so i was always like 'wait, is this pain good or bad?' thanks to this community i have learned so much! I know! I am struggling with that a bit too. I think the clenched jaw feeling is normal, almost feels like \u201cregular\u201d nerve pain, and general face fatigue from trying to move it around.

Yes, I am not a doctor but you should absolutely go see a doctor at emergency or urgent care immediately.

I take it at face value (hah pun intended) the initially people are thinking worst case scenario when hear about BP and then they see the person and it does not look as bad as they have imagined. Then months later when the person is healed, people have a frame of reference from before and can genuinely see the improvement. Seconded. We do not see ourselves the same way people see us. And that is something I have learned from having permanent BP. I pay way more attention to my flaws than other people do.  When I was just starting getting movement back, a so called \"friend\" told me I looked really bad and damaged, I cried not because of the words, but it is really frustrating not to be able to blink and your face feels weird and gets tired... We should look for words of encouragement and kind people. I am glad it seems your have better friends. Truth is people that do not see you often, are better at noticing the changes. Just like if you do not see your friends kids that often, you always feel like they have grown a lot, where your friends does not notice it that much, because he sees them every day.\nIt is the same story with you looking in the mirror 10 times a day, you do not notice all the small changes.", "Doing the Hokey Pokey \u201cYou lift your right cheek up, you let your right cheek down.

And what do you do to cope with pain?\n\nI am on prednisone and CBD oil currently. I had some ear pain, but it was not excruciating.  It went away after I started prednisone.", "One year ago today I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. Let me start from the top. I was so stressed out because I had my exams coming up. I was also staying up really late which led to me developing a migraine. I had a migraine for a week. I told my mum about it and she told me it was only because I was not sleeping. \n\nFast forward to a week later, I bit into my burger and I could not taste a thing. I told my sister and she said \u201coh you might have covid, take a test\u201d. I ignored. \n\nI went to revise and as I was being tested by my sister, my lips went numb and I could not pout properly. I again brushed it off and went to bed. \n\nThe next day I woke up (the morning of my exam) and I realised I could not eat properly nor was I blinking correctly. I searched up my symptoms and it said that I had Bell\u2019s palsy which I did not believe. I went to go do my exam and by that time, my whole face had drooped. I took a day off the next day and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. I was broken. \n\nI fell into deep depression during this period. I became suicidal. I had EXTREME anxiety every time I would wake up. I would run to the mirror and check if my face had improved. I hated my face. I hated everything. I did not want to go out. If I saw another person smiling, it broke me. I was so jealous. All I wanted was my face back. \n\nAfter 4 months of steroids, B12 tablets &amp; facial exercises - I was fully back to normal. I know how you all feel because I have been there myself. Please do not beat yourself up like I did. It seriously DOES get better. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask \u263a\ufe0f", "My story (2 weeks in) I have BP since Oct 4th, so today is my 12th day. It was really hard for me, specially the first days. I felt lonely, but after some investigation, finding so many stories in forums and in this community, I felt related to know many are passing through this at the same time as me..\n\nSome background:\n\nMy wife got chicken pox since Oct 1st. Then, on Oct 4th I woke up feeling the left side of my face a little numb. Throughout the morning it got worse so I decided to go to the doctor (otolaryngologist), since my ear was the first to hurt. I investigated and I found out that the first cause for BP is stress related, but the second cause is herpes zoster virus, or chicken pox. However, when this is the case, small wounds similar to chicken pox appear near the ear. I thought that is why my ear was hurting. But so far, no wounds have appeared. So maybe it was just a coincidence my wife had chicken pox at the same time? It would be too much of a coincidence, but I do not know. I am here anyways.\n\nSome of my symptoms are:\n\n\\- Pain in the left ear, similar to the pain when you hear a loud noise. Hyperacusis, which is heavily related to BP. I am a musician so this bothers me.\n\n\\- The paralysis started in my eye and eyebrow. Then, it descended to the rest of my face after 3 days.\n\n\\- It is hard to eat because I bite my lip. It is hard to drink water, as it is hard to keep it inside.\n\n\\- I recently noticed that, unconsciously, the small muscles in the back and top of my head have been trying to compensate or generate any small movements, so now these muscles hurt, especially behind my ear, I saw it is called auricularis superior muscle.\n\n\\- The first days, I could not close my eye completely at each blink, but somehow, I did not notice it until it was very itchy. I started using eyedrops but it took 2 days to alleviate the itchiness. Now I can close it.\n\n\\- I did not loose any taste, but the left back of my tongue feels a little numb.\n\nMy treatments and progress:\n\n\\- On the first day of symptoms, I immediately went to the doctor, as I mentioned. So I got it quite early. Many of you have mentioned how important this is. She explained that this is a relatively common disease, but she could not tell if it was stress or chicken pox related. She gave me antivirals (Valaciclovir 1g each 8hrs for 5 days) and Deflazacort (30mg for days 1-4, 15mg days 5-8, 7.5mg days 9-12). I cannot honestly say that these have helped, but I completed the treatment.\n\n\\- The first 4 days it got worse each day, until I reached my lowest point, maybe a 2%-3% of movement. I got worried so searched for an alternate treatment. I made an appointment with an acupuncturist.\n\n\\- On the 5th day, I felt a little better, maybe 5%, but I visited the acupuncturist anyway. She explained BP is very common, especially in China, and they treat it with acupuncture. She put the needles in my face\u2019s left side, and used electrostimulation. This caused me some worries.\n\n\\- On the 6th day I woke up again at 2%.. I do not want to blame acupuncture nor the acupuncturist, maybe it was just a coincidence that the setback happened after the treatment, but I do not want to risk any nerve damage so I have not returned since..\n\n\\- Since day 7 I started making rehab exercises (I read you are not supposed to do them on the first week). I am doing these exercises: ( twice a day (morning and evening). It is a good thing to do them in front of a mirror. On the first 2 days, I saw very small progress, reaching again 5% until day 9. But in the past 3 days (days 10-12) my progress has been HUGE. I am now maybe at 35% mobility and I am hoping to be fully recovered in the next 7-10 days. I would definitely say that these exercises have helped more than the pills or acupuncture.\n\n\\- I am also taking B12 pills (500mg) since day 4.\n\nMental progress:\n\n\\- I have gained a certain appreciation for the rest of my body. I never considered thanking my face for all the movements it does, so I thanked my right (good) side. Then this went on to actually thanking every other body part.\n\n\\- This disease has helped me (forced me) to reduce my stress and focus a little bit more on taking care of my body and my thoughts. I have tried having more useful and overall happier thoughts. By indirect consequence, I have even noticed a boost in my productivity.\n\n\\- It is been 2 difficult weeks. But each day the soreness diminishes, the motion improves, and I am hopeful that I will be fully recovered soon. Any improvement, as small as it may be, has made me quite happy and thankful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for my English, I am not a native English speaker. I hope my experience helps anyone reading. I will appreciate any comments on how to improve further my condition and accelerate the recovery. The video that you posted is great! She is really helpful. Keep up with massage and exercise. It is hard to be patient. I am over 3 months in and I am finally moving my face a little bit. \n\nHand in there. Ibuprofen and heat help the pain. Thank you for sharing, it is nice to see someone else going through similar things. I have been with Bell's Palsy for 10 days now with a very little bit of improvement. \n\nI am also going to the acupuncturist and I feel that it is helping. It is quite scary to see half of your face losing control.\n\nI am taking CBD oil to help relieve pain before going to bed and keep me calm/relaxed. I did not get antivirals (and I wish my doctor gave me that, she only gave me steroids and now it is too late). \n\nMy mother was visiting, and she made me a clay mask with calendula tea on the paralyzed side (you mix the clay powder with some calendula tea, put it between gaze pads, leave it on your face until it dries, it took around 2 hours for me). That helped so much, it felt like it sucked the inflammation and for 3 days I had close to no pain.\n\nWishing you a nice recovery :) Thank you for your reply! I am glad you are improving. Yes, heat can help. The acupuncturist put heat on my neck, where the root of the nerve compression is supposed to be. I wish to you a soon recovery! Thanks for your reply! The CBD oil is a great idea. I have it at home and I had not thought about using it\u2026 Yesterday I took it before sleeping and today I felt improvement. I am about 40%-45% recovered now. I might try the clay mask later! It is a good idea, it is supposed to improve blood flow. I hope you have a soon and fast recovery! Thank you for sharing your experience. I am on day 2. I spent seven hours in the hospital ER because my doctor thought I had a stroke. Only to find out that it is BP. So far it is been really hard and disheartening, but I am glad to know I am not in this alone. Must have been awful to be so long in the ER! Yes, the first days are difficult\u2026 But this community helped me so much as well. You are not alone my friend. If you (or anyone reading) feel that I can help you, feel free to write :) Thank you for the exercises. They are very useful :)", "It still haunts me till this day. 2012 I got diagnosed with bells palsy, it took 6 months for my face to recover back to normal. To this day I still get paranoid if my tongue feels weird, my eye twitches, anything. I feel like no one understands this \"curse\". I am terrified to have kids one day because I hear it can trigger it.. I try not to stress because that is the worse thing for your bells, but it is hard. Does anyone else feel this way? I feel like I am haunted by the memory of my \"two face\" I know exactly how you feel! I am so scared that it will come back. I am especially worried that it will be on the opposite side, since I still have residual effects on the palsy side. Loss of taste was the first symptom that I remember noticing, so if something feels weird on my tongue I will get something flavorful and move it back and forth to test both sides. \nYou are definitely not alone in feeling like this. Feel free to message me if you ever want to talk about it.  Thank you! I definitely will. I feel like I have no one to relate to on it which is awful  I know exactly how you feel. I have had it twice. Last time over a decade ago and I guess I feel overdue Twice?? How far apart? And did anything trigger it? Ugh I am sorry!! Thinking about that just gave me a rush of anxiety.. I have only had bell\u2019s for 10 weeks but I am already terrified of another reoccurrence! I am almost fully recovered but due to stress I keep testing my face to see if it had gotten worse!\n\nI know that Bell\u2019s peaks at 48 hours of the onset but do any of you know if it can worsen after almost a full recovery? \n\nI know this is me being completely paranoid (which does not help my stress level at all) but I was wondering if this is a valid concern?  About 4 years apart. Lasted around two weeks each time. First on my left side then on my right I am with you as well! I still have some residule damage like other posters here. Mine was so so painful and every time my eye twitches I freak out!", "Unresolved BP for 22 Years: Flair Up This Week Hi all, I am new here and like the title says I have had a constant Facial droop for 22 years. When I was young I would have episodes about once a year. When I was 14 I had two and the second never resolved. I had a few more attacks where the symptoms would worsen over the years and clear up slightly with treatment. \n\nThis week I got an ear infection and the pain worsened Tuesday to the point I could not sleep. Wednesday as I was driving to my PCP I could feel a BP episode coming on. It has been years since I have had a flair up. I was able to get medications at that appointment after arguing with the nurse over it. She was all for giving me steroids for the BP but had no interest in treating the trigger. \n\nSpending so much of my life unable to smile has been hard. I have had dreams where I can smile to wake up and just cry. This week things are different, I am a mom now. I have two daughters. I am embracing my crooked grin, I am sporting my eye patch, I am going out and doing my shopping. I am even going to go to work. \n\nBut damn this hurts.\n\n(Apologies for format; on mobile and I am still learning) Fuck man hope ur flair up goes down.

Hope the flair up will get resolved soon.", "bells palsy longterm effect on me I got diagnosed with bells palsy in july 2020. I say its a mild case, it started with a earache, it was the reason i went to the doctor and left finding out it was BP and didnt know i had vertigo, i just thought it was clumsiness. But did seem weird how often my clumsiness was at the moment before finding out i had BP. the 2 main factors i would say was stress and my braces treatment. My left eye can blink on its own now and my left side droppyness is not nearly as bad as it was in the beginning. People dont notice it. I can still see the slight difference but its improved alot. I still have vertigo and ringing in my left ear. The ringing isnt as bad as it was in the beginning. When any noice would make the ringing louder. Now it can go unnoticeable unless i pay attention to it or its quiet. The left side of my head still feels somewhat numb. And i do have slight twitches that are not really noticeable. i see alot people saying that twitches are normal in recovery which is a relief to say the least. But one thing i have noticed also is that i have had a hard time controlling my anger now. I get triggered easily and have a hard time getting out of that state of mind while being well aware of it. I wonder if anyone else has had a change in there anger after being diagnosed with bells palsy or is it just me", "Bell Palsy Free After a month of sadness and heartache I can finally say that I am a Bell\u2019s palsy free! My smile is back to normal and I officially can blink again. I do get some twitching in my effected eye but nothing horrible. I would say that the acupuncture seemed to speed up the healing process( I did 3 treatments). I took a lot of vitamins and tried to rest as much as I could. I also think i positive attitude really made the process less dreadful. In the beginning I was having a really hard time dealing with not looking like me, but I just decide to try have a better attitude about it because with time I would be better. I know if you are dealing with bells right now, it is hard but trust me you become a stronger person because of it! I am so happy for you! Congratulations! If you mind me asking, what are all the vitamins you took? The twitching is good. It means the nerve is recovering. My affected side twitched until eventually everything was 100%. You may not have symptoms but the nerve is still recovering Thank you! And I do not mind! My mom is a nurse so she got me everything that she thought would help. She made me take Sudafed 12hr, B6, iron ( because I found I was anemic), geritol multivitamin, super b complex, vitamin c, and folic acid. Occasionally I would drink them with orange juice and she sometimes made me drink Emergen-C. I agree... I think attitude and keeping as stressfree as possible is a huge help! Glad you are doing good! So happy for you. I am on day 21 and no sign of improvement. And my head aches. Thank you! Stay positive! Try to get as much rest as you can! And take your meds", "Not being able to blink driving me up the wall! Hi all, 29F here, only on day 4. Got it from a sinus infection. I have a relatively mild case because I was able to get on medicine within about 8 hours of my facial symptoms (had a desensitized tongue for 3 days before that but had no idea what it was). I do not really have any visible drooping, I just have no lip control and I cannot fully blink. My face has started to tingle a bit today and my nerve pain seems to be going down a bit so hoping those are good signs.\n\nBasically my question is, how do you guys go about your day without being able to blink? The feeling of a dry eye or watery eye absolutely drives me to distraction all day every day. I do not know if it s just me (I also am super distracted if my lips are dry), or if this is one of the worst parts for anyone else. I have drops, the gel, etc. but obviously it only does so much. I do not want to tape my eye shut because I do not want my other eye to start trying to compensate. Is this one of those you eventually get used to after living with it for a while?  It sucks for sure.  I eventually just got used to it.  Eye drops are SUPER helpful (the synthetic tears kind), so I highly recommend that.  But start making a habit of reaching up and blinking your eye manually with your hand.  It also helps that when you hold it close with your finger you roll your eye around in the socket for a bit... just up and down and back and forth... then re-open it with your fingers and do it again in a minute or so.\n\nSorry you are going through this, hope things get better for you quickly! Thanks for the advice! I do use those individual synthetic tears drops, they are great. They were \"prescribed\" after lasik a few years ago and I am obsessed with them. I will try manual blinking more often. I actually just discovered if I tape my lower eyelid to push up, my top lid comes down enough I can mostly blink. Certainly an annoying feeling having tape under my eye, but if it helps me blink I am all for it!  My Ophthalmologist insisted I keep my eye taped closed.  He used a paper skin tape and just put a piece over the lid from top to below the lower lid.  You can damage your eye if it too dry.  You can also use a patch and you should still use the drops even if you keep it covered or you are asleep.  Even asleep your eye will not completely close.\n\nGood luck! Nice. Curious to hear how things work out with you post Lasik - I plan on getting Lasik and wondered if the residual longer last side effects.of bells palsy may make that impossible or not worth it. If your desperation is great enough, I have a tip that really helped me, although not everyone digs it. Basically I bought a pair of super-cheap sunglasses, popped out the lens that went on the side I could not blink on, and attached some elastic band to the corners of the lens and wore it as an eye patch. The lens creates a pocket of humidity around your eye which keeps it from getting dried out feeling. You can also still see out of it but it helps protect your eye from bright light. Personally I loved it, but some people do not like that you may get a few odd looks when you wear an eye patch.", "Moderna and Bell\u2019s Palsy I developed Bell\u2019s palsy in 2013 after having chickenpox and have recovered about 99%.\n\nAfter reading about the vaccine side effects and doing a lot of research I found that a lot of people did not develop Bell\u2019s palsy again after the moderna doses. \n\nI am not anti-vax by any means. I really want to protect myself from COVID and just wanted to know your experiences with the moderna vaccine.\n\nYour responses will be appreciated! I got Pfizer but had zero recurrence of symptoms and have continued to improve gradually from my initial Bell\u2019s. Either way, getting Bell\u2019s again would be better than dying of COVID. Glad to know you are improving :)\nI totally agree! Getting covid and the after effects are way worse.\nThanks for your response I had BP back in 2016, 99% recovered as well. Had the Modena and no relapse. I think the chance of relapse due to the shot is infinitesimal, and the protection you get from the shot is extremely valuable. Personally I feel like a droopy face vs getting sick or dying from COVID is a no brainer. Yeah, I am 2 years out am at 85% or so with gradual improvement. Got my shots about 8 months ago. That is great to know! Thanks for sharing your experience. May I know what your interval was before getting your second dose? I got the Moderna shots in February and March. Then Bell\u2019s Palsy came along a month ago in July. People ask all the time if they are related and in my case, no. It is good old fashioned stress for me. The people who have gotten it from the vaccine get it immediately or within two days. (Says my semi-extensive Google search, lol). \n\nIt is also pretty rare, considering the million of case studies. (Again\u2026 google\u2026 so take that with a grain of salt). 3/18 to 4/13. I got BP in March, 90% recovered. Had my 2nd Moderna shot 2 weeks ago and still in the clear. \n\nHave not stopped my Vit B12 daily since my BP. I have had BP repeat episodes multiple times over 20+ years. Pfizer 3/30 and 4/20 with no worsening symptoms. That is great! :) thank you for your response I have had Bell\u2019s palsy this year and I have made a 95% recovery so far. \n\nI have had both shots now and symptoms did not get worse or returned in any way. Got Moderna x2 and no recurrence. Happy to know you are recovering and did not have any recurrences :) thanks for your response Appreciate your response. I was not aware of Vit B12 until recently. Will definitely add that to my vitamin intake. Congrats on the recovery! :) Thanks for sharing your observations! Wishing you a speedy recovery :) What is your favorite b12 source? Pfizer and no recurrence. I had the same fears as you but seeing that the chances are really low I decided to fuck it and get a long with it. I would rather have BP than Covid. I just use whatever 1000mg tablets I find over the counter :) My close relative got the Pfizer one and developed bells 2 weeks later after 2nd dose. First time ever getting it.", "No movement in 48 days and I am freaking out. I am 48 days since diagnosis and I have had no improvements since week 2 (which was basically just my mouth on the non-affected side opening up a little more). I have absolutely no movement on my left side and I have had none since the very beginning. \nI understand that this could take 6+ months but most cases I have seen that take longer to recover at least see SOMETHING move by week 6 or 7 which I am at now and there is nothing. It is extremely discouraging and scary and is hurting my morale. Is there anyone in this community that has had ZERO movement for months and gone on to make a full recovery?", "Mild Bell\u2019s Palsy triggered by Moderna Vaccine, bad luck, or other unrelated inflammation? No one can give me an answer on this but I thought this might be work sharing. \n\nTo preface, I had BP a few years ago and recovered 99% after a couple of months. I could fully function without issue after my recovery. \n\nI received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine last week and felt fine for the first couple of days (other than fairly moderate arm pain). A couple of days later, I started feeling mild but noticeable BP symptoms somewhat similar to my first bout of BP from years ago. I went to urgent care where the doctor examined me and concluded that he could not conclude my BP had returned because I could (and still can) move my face fully and normally. Unless and until I presented physical drooping, the doctor did not want to give me Prednisone - I do not disagree because I have had to be on it within the last year for other inflammation and do not want to over due it. \n\nI went on my way and kept monitoring my face. Today, I was not getting worse but had no real improvement so I went back to urgent care. I was seen by a different doctor who came up with the same conclusion as the other doctor that she could not say one way or another whether my BP had returned. She recommended I visit a Neuro so that I could be diagnosed by someone who specializes in BP. Again, no Pred was prescribed. \n\nMy appointment is not for another week or so and I hope in that time my face is able to get somewhat back to normal on it is own. I can eat, smile, blink, close my affected eye, my forehead lines, and frown without issue so I am less concerned than when I have full blown BP the first time. \n\nSo this makes me wonder, is this being triggered (not caused) by the vaccine, am I just having bad luck and the timing of my mild recurrence happens to be right after the vaccine, or is this possibly caused by some other,soon to be treated but not yet treated, immune system inflammation? Because of this occurrence close to the vaccine reception, I thought I would share. I was just diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy today.\n\nI received my first dose of Moderna a little over 2 weeks ago.", "Just a quick question about dosage. I was diagnosed today and I was given prednisone for 5 days is this an abnormal occurrence? I was also not given an antiviral... I was diagnosed Sunday.  They gave me a 7 day prednisone and a referal to a neurologist.  The neurologist the next day gave me 7 days of an antiviral.  There seems to be mixed literature on antivirals doing much, but you might want to see a neurologist and follow up on one. I was given 7 days of steroids.  That seems to be the norm.  I would follow up with your doctor or whomever you were referred to.\n\nThat said the steroids made me so violently ill that I was puking constantly.  I had to stop taking them after 3 days, and I still recovered - though I in no way recommend skipping them if you can tolerate them. UK? I had the same, and they took me off everything at day 8. Massive mistake - they had misdiagnosed me as Bells when it was Ramsay Hunt. I did not exhibit vertigo or a rash - but some 30% do not. \n\nAntivirals show little statistical difference for Bells recovery, but for Ramsay its a 50% swing in recovery chances. \n\nI am here 1 year on still at only 60% recovered. There is not a day that goes by that I am not furious at the doctors for skimping on the medicine and mis-diagnosing me. I saw 5 doctors in the first 5 days, 4 were very calm and relaxed - said it was Bells. 1 (who did not have the power to prescribe) said definitely Ramsay H, but they overruled him. HE HIMSELF had had Ramsay and knew what he was talking about - later on the others all admitted that they would never seen a Ramsay Hunt case and assumed Bells because it is much more common. \n\nPersonally? I would always push forward 2 weeks of antivirals and steroids as a minimum. That is the standard treatment course in other countries. Only stop if you get ill from the steroids. That way your covered better for Bells and Ramsay. Ramsay Hunt is very often missed or misdiagnosed - I suggest you check facialpalsy.org. Good luck, it sucks. Hope you have a speedy full recovery I would also suggest tapering off steroids at the end. Do not shock your body coming off - can lead to a resurgence in swelling and inflammation. Ask for supplies for 5+ days to taper off Thank you for your reply I shall seek more medical advice Absolutely thank you for your reply! That is what I noticed too and an unwillingness to give antivirals if they are unsure it was the cause, which makes sense if it is an immune problem Also US here had to go to emergency since no one would see me", "I have more control on the affected side of my face. My lips on the right side wet paralyzed about a month ago.\n\nAs I am recovering, I can do way more stuff on the right side than the normal side. I feel like it is much more stronger.

There is a support group on Facebook with more activity than here - \u201cBell\u2019s Palsy and facial paralysis support \u201c. You might be interested in that - it helped me.  Good luck! I had to get a patch with some eye gel as well so I could sleep without damaging my impacted eye...I highly suggest finding a way to keep your eye protected at night. I am going to work on that this weekend. It is getting worse everyday I think. It is impacted my eating and drinking today. Was fine yesterday.  I will check it out. Thank you!  It generally does progress over the first week, but then it should plateau. As long as you are taking the required steroids, and if you can get an anti viral medication, then rest will be the next best medicine. It will get worse probably before it gets better. That is what happened to me. Could not squint much. That is getting better. Could not move or talk very well. That is getting better as well. Sticking to the meds has helped. I am glad this sub exists too. Good luck to you.  2 weeks in and off day I am 50% back to normal. I got lucky in that its going away quickly How about taste? Did that go away for you? Is it coming back? Please say yes.  Taste was the first thing to go about 4 days before the facial paralysis. It is coming back though. Happy that it is too!  Thank god! I can only taste sweet.

Day 7 today and only slight improvement. Hoping to find a neurologist that can explain why I keep getting BP. Requesting kind words, healing thoughts and prayers. I would like to make a suggestion. I have read that reactivation of herpes simplex virus can cause that inflammation of the facial nerve (Bells). There are people who supplement Lysine. Lysine is an amino acid that displaces arginine, and displacing arginine is important, because arginine is used by herpes simplex to replicate (and herpes simplex virus never goes away, it only goes dormant, then when opportunity arises, it re-replicates to high enough levels again to show symptiomology/infllamation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps, from now on, supplementing Lysine, could help prevent new Bells \"outbreaks\" for you, so long as said Palsy is due to reccurent Herpes replication Thank you for the advice!

Only taken for 5 days, with no taper I developed a mild case of Bell\u2019s palsy and was prescribed 60mg of prednisone for 7 days. 3 pills a day, no tapering down. I found that really odd. It started giving me horrible insomnia and my symptoms were gone so I stopped the med. two days later, I started experiencing all-around body/muscle aches and pain. Still sort of experiencing it.\n\nI have been more thirsty since stopping it, and peeing more frequently. I called the doctor today and took two pills (40mg), and will taper more down as the days go by. She says I was experiencing withdrawal hence the muscle aches.\n\nBut I have also been experiencing palpitations and brain fog. I do not feel like this is normal. I had my blood sugar checked before taking this and it is completely normal. I do not have high blood pressure or anything. \n\nI am sort of worried that taking such a high dosage has triggered diabetes but I am not sure... I keep reading that frequent urination and thirst is not even normal. So I will visit an urgent care tomorrow... but I just wanted to know from people who have taken this themselves (at least this dosage) - is it normal? \n\nI also have crazy moon face and it is making me feel horrible. Idk something feels unusual and I am just really worried. Cant even focus on my midterm right now.\n\nI really hope somebody responds... thanks. &gt;palpitations and brain fog\n\nYup, same here, plus hand tremors. I felt awful for a few days after stopping the prednisone. I got tested for diabetes because of that, but I was fine. \n\nEverything came back to normal after three days or so. Prednisone is not aspirin, it has heavy side effects and withdrawal symptoms. It is good that you will visit a clinic, but you will probably be fine. Wish you the best! I definitely had the crazy thirst. I ready drink about 3 liters of water daily due to a history of kidney stones, but the thirst I had while on the high steroid+anti viral combo was something else. I could not have enough no matter how often I drank....\nHaving said that - it did go away after a few more days.\nI did have a very gentle taper off period though (doc gave me 7 days at 60mg, then took off 10mg every 5 days. I understand that is rare, but it could be because I am a big guy)", "BP week 3 - Grade 4 &amp; Covid Vaccine Hello everyone. I got Bell's Palsy 3,5 weeks ago (House-Brackmann Grade IV). Received 2 weeks of steroid treatment + 5 days of aciclovir. So far, I have only had very minor improvements, they are barely noticable (eyebrow raises very slighly, can move corner of mouth a bit). I am getting my covid-vaccine soon and was wondering if anyone has gotten their shot DURING  recovery (meaning they did not develop BP as a result of the vaccine but already had it when they got the vaccine). \n\nI know there is a thread about how long it took to recover, however I would like to specifically ask people who got diagnosed with Score IV how long it took, since I feel like most people either recover within 2-3 weeks (not in my case) or people who have a very slow recovery and it takes years. I am not sure if age plays a part in recovery, however I am in my early 20s so I am hoping for a full recovery. I am grade IV (4 years in 2 weeks). I got both my Pfizer shots and it had zero effects on my Bell\u2019s. I had a reaction to a vaccine as a kid so was worried about how I might react to this one, but except for a sore arm and feeling a bit tired, I was just fine. \n\nYour nerve takes a long time to heal so rest and time are some of the best things you can do. I had no movement for 3 months so you are already healing far faster than I was. \n\nDo not give up hope! Just yesterday I had some movement return in my jaw and gum area. Support your body with rest, good food, and whatever treatments work for you. \n\nI hope this helps:) Hi! Thank you so much for your reply and sharing your experiences with the Covid vaccine! Relieving to hear that it does not worsen the BP (my neurologist also told me it is fine to get the vaccine with BP). \n\nHow has your BP developed over the past 4 years? (yay for the movement returning!) The most important things for me right now are my smile and i also want to be able to close my eye. :( My BP has slowly but consistently improved. I saw very little improvement for the first 6 months and then over the next 6 saw quite a lot of improvement - enough to get me to about 65%. During that time I used acupuncture (on the unaffected side), massage, osteopathy, and an acupuncture pen called Pointer Plus (after the 6 month mark to try to avoid any synkinesis).\n\nSince then I average some small improvement every 2-4 months and am sitting about 75%. I still have to tape my eye and my smile is not perfect - but the improvement yesterday gave it a boost! \n\nAbout 2 years ago I started using marijuana (legal where I am) as I found that it really helped me to relax and focus on \u2018working out\u2019 the tiny muscles of my face as well as isolating them to help \u2018undo\u2019 some of the synkinesis. \n\nI also did speech therapy for about a year(just stopped a few months ago), which helped me relearn tongue placement as well as made me more aware of all the deeper muscles that had been affected by BP. \n\nI am patient and tenacious and I am not giving up hope that one day I will see my old smile again :) \n\nI wish you a healthy and speedy recovery:) First of all, thank you for your elaborate response! (And sorry for the late reply!)\n\nI am happy to hear that you are seeing improvements and that all the things you have tried have helped you!\n\nI started speech therapy and my therapist uses a vibration device (do not really know what it is called) to stimulate the facial nerves. I am interested in acupuncture, but I am only on week 4 so we will see. \n\nAnother question if you do not mind - do the 'bigger' movements just appear overnight? I have only had tiny movement back so far, but I cannot imagine suddenly being able to raise my eyebrow again - did it happen gradually for you (if you had bigger movements return)? That is great that you are doing speech therapy, I never used the vibration device (it was early covid) though I have thought of getting one. How is it working for you? \n\nAnd most of my big changes came during acupuncture or immediately afterwards. Because so many muscles are involved in movement, it was not so much that I got my eyebrow movement back all at once. After some tingling and numbness a piece of the muscle would gain movement and from there I could continue to work on it. \n\nI think the big movement gains are often for those that have less damage done to their nerve and so heal rapidly. Whereas with more damage and slower healing the gains are a lot smaller and take more time to come.", "How do I eat without food falling out of my mouth? I feel like an idiot because I cannot eat properly lol Haha tilt your head back maybe. But do not choke. That may still make you look idiotic, but maybe slightly less than before lol. \n\nBut in all seriousness take much much smaller bites and keep the food on your non affected side when chewing. Thanks haha, I cannot even drink without spilling it all  \ud83d\ude02 You are welcome. I have found that I have to sip on drinks out of the side of my mouth (the bells side) like pop eye. Also straws are your friend. Smaller bites, take your time. Also, get ya some straws, everything i drink is through a straw. Its been 6 months now, and I am getting tired of it... The key is...small, tiny pieces.  Break your food up into manageable pieces. Put a small amount on your eating utensils.  It takes awhile to eat so allow for this in your schedule.  Patience when healing is the key. Much love ... Option 1: Hold your mouth shut with your hand.\n\nOption 2: Eat your food like a chicken drinks water (youtube it)\n\nWhen I first got diagnosed, I went out with a friend on a Saturday to help him get something he found on craigslist. Without thinking about it, I got an iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts on our way. Took a big old sip from it and promptly squirted iced coffee all over his windshield. \n\nI later learned straws are actually quite helpful, but you have to use them correctly. However, \"correctly\" is different when you have BP vs when you do not. You will find there are ways to do just about everything you could do before BP, even if you look like a clown doing it.\n\nExcept whistling, I never figured that one out... Thanks, I am quite embarrassed about it atm and look stupid. Hopefully i heal quickly Thanks. I will try holding my mouth shut. I look like an idiot at the moment and am quite embarrassed. When I was walking down the street some young kids (12 maybe?)  kept on looking at me and pointing. So I am going to stay at home for a while Yeah, I know what you mean. BP is a humiliating and demoralizing condition. It gave me a much different perspective on what differently-abled persons go through on a daily basis. \n\nI was pretty lucky, I looked very close to normal when my face was at rest. But it was hard for me to bring myself to socialize or go anywhere really. I was always afraid someone would put me in a situation where I had to eat or drink or laugh or something that would show how messed up my face was. \n\nJust remember, other people's perceptions of you do not define who you are. Do what you need and want to do and forget about the jerks that have no idea what you are going through. And DO NOT let it get you down. Getting depressed will not help your recovery. Yeah, when my face is resting my face is drooping a bit and it is quite obvious it is not right. It is very frustrating for me \ud83d\ude41 No reason to beat yourself up over something you cannot control.  The people around you who are kind understand and will be a good source of support. Tiny bites, and lots of soups and mashed/ soft foods. Tiny bites of those two. But yeah, i was basically all soup and mashed potatoes, because it was just the easiest way. It is going to be awkward and ridiculous. If you are doing facial exercises that can help a lot. I was not able to use a straw at all. I bought a 12 oz Hydroflask coffee mug to use at meals and was able to create a seal between my mouth and the lid. It was a lifesaver. For the gym, I already had a Hydroflask wide mouth bottle with a straw lid. I was not able to use the straw lid, so I swapped it out for the Wide Mouth Flex Sip Lid, which worked great for me.  I was not able to eat soups and ate softer foods that I could chew on my good side. Thanks, I might try buy something like that Hi, all. I am preferring small food I do not have to bite into and tear (burgers are not my friend). I would rather small pieces that can be picked up with a fork or finger food. Had some chicken penne pasta yesterday and that was pretty easy. Small sips of drinks from a glass have been ok, or a can, but I cannot tilt them back very far. Small sips also ensure that if I do dribble, it is not a lot and it is easy to clean up. Do not want to be dribbling coffee all over the shirt. I am mostly quarantining since the whole outbreak began, so all my eating/drinking has been at home, which is not embarrassing (just frustrating). It can be a little different for everybody, so experimentation is the key. Very small food pieces, like rice, can be hard to manipulate, often getting lost in the weak side of my mouth, so just washing it all down with a few little sips of liquid has been really helpful. Keep drinking in small sips at a time. Cuts down on dribbling and clean up.", "Anyone else have Lyme induced facial palsy? I am interested to know how your recovery went. It is been 2 months since my facial palsy started and 1 month since I finished my antibiotic for Lyme. Facial palsy is still pretty bad. I am interested to hear from anyone else who has had a similar experience. How did recovery go? Did you take Prednisone before finding out it was Lyme?", "Update : Diagnosed Nov 9th  Pretty quick recovery! Nice This gives me hope ! Thank you  Awesome! Yes ! I am grateful  Yes ! When were you diagnosed ? Sorry to OP but I am just completely baffled by this whole thing, I had a dull pain behind my ear, my left side of my face went numb and paralyzed, and a week later everything was completely back to normal, I have full control of my face, just so many unanswered questions... Nice man! December 17th; a month and some after you  Ask away ", "Is this enough steroids? I was just diagnosed this week and was only prescribed 6 days worth of prednisone that tapers off each day. I have read the usual amount is 10 days and wondered if anyone has also been prescribed only 6 days. I am concerned it is not enough but have to assume it is. Looking for feedback from others regarding this. Thanks! The asshole doctor at the emergency room only gave me one day with no taper to make sure I made a follow-up appointment, with which neither doctor i saw answered their phones to make with me. My pharmacy got in touch with one of the doctors that tapered me off over the next 6 days. You will be fine. Just take advil for a few days to reduce any swelling afterwards and supplement with b12... That is all i did I had a similar situation. Only four days from the ER doc. Went to neurologists after the fact, and he put me on another 6 days. I received 6 days worth without a taper from urgent care. I followed up with my own doctor, who on his own tacked on another 2 days. I recovered in a month. I do not know why I recovered so quickly. I slept a lot, took my meds, and tried to keep my mood up. Beyond that, you are really at the mercy of your own biology. Did you fully recover? I got 5 days but high dosage 50 mg no taper and I am recovering quite nicely, I started taking ibuprofen as an anti inflammatory when my days were up. I felt a little sluggish on day 6 but afterwards I was back to normal energy wise. I am a week and one day out and my smile is coming back as well as numbness is diminishing a little every day.", "recently diagnosed Question? Just diagnosed 4 days ago. Is it common for symptoms to worsen when tired?  Yes, no question. As the day goes on the symptoms get worse. Lots of rest and sleep for you my friend.\n\nWishing you a full and speedy recovery. I had the same problem! It will get better, I noticed my symptoms did not seem as bad in the morning and would get discouraged throughout the day thinking it was worsening! Although, it seemed the symptoms were not as bad when I was well rested!  Thanks thanks PS feel free to message me any time. I have had BP (about 85% recovered) for 2 years and have learned a lot about it from my mistakes.\n\nIf you are on Facebook there is a great support group there btw. Definitely! It is really important to keep yourself as rested as you can, I really do believe that stress (good, bad, physical and mental!) has an impact on BP recovery.\n\nI have also found that even outside of a BP episode, when I am really tired, the side of my face that was affected just feels weaker - even though I do not think there is a visible difference.\n\nGood luck in your recovery! Without a doubt. After getting Bell\u2019s I had bronchitis and was out of work for another week (I teach) during that week off my face felt stronger and more manageable. When I went back to work the nerve pain increased, and I found it a lot more droopy/tired by the end of the day. Also, stress is a HUGE factor for me making my Bell\u2019s worse. I suffer from anxiety and when I feel an anxiety attack coming on or I am worried/upset/angry my speech is affected and my face gets very tired. \n\nKeep your head up! And stick to what the dr said. Starting PT the earliest you can will make a huge difference, and I do not know nun about it yet but I am starting Acupuncture next week after being 2 months in. \n\nGood luck and keep us posted! \ud83d\udc9b I have not been told that this could be episodic \nThanks for the heads up. 1st recheck with GP is today. will be asking about PT and alternative medicine.\nthanks what the name of the FB page?\n Bells Palsy and Facial Paralysis Support Group. thanks\n Ahh good luck! I hope everything goes well for you! Keep you head up!  It can be, but I do not think it is common. Like all things related to Bell's Palsy, it is hard to find reliable scientific information. Anecdotally, it seems people generally have at least a few years between episodes. I still consider my BP the diet coke version - my first just over a year ago was certainly milder than a lot I have seen online, and relatively brief.  I hesitate to even really call the recent thing anything more than a brush with BP.\n\nAgain, it is hard to find scientific support for this, but I really believe that getting onto a course of steroid treatment as early as possible makes a big difference. It seems in the US, that is often combined with an antiviral. \n\nBell's is also really emotionally difficult I think, and from chats I have had with other people here, it is not uncommon for our loved ones to really underestimate how crappy the symptoms make you feel. ", "Dry/watering eye? Hello,\nI am newly diagnosed been on prednisone for a few days. My eye on the palsy side will not stop watering no matter what I do. I have read that some people get dry eye would the constant testing be the same thing?\nIf so, any tips? Thank you! Yes, this is absolutely normal, get eye drops for the day and eye ointment for night.  I also taped my eye shut at night for about a week and a half.  It did not bother me at all for the first couple of days and  then it started to really bother me.  I would sometimes tape it shut for an hour or two during the day and that also really helped. Thank you! Absolutely normal, and probably the most maddening symptom for me. The day before I got diagnosed and started treatment, I was watching TV and my eye was just pouring tears but it felt as dry as a desert. I found that trying to force that eye closed was the best form of relief in addition eye drops. \n\nDoctor put me on acyclovir 5 times a day for 10 days, 3 weeks of prednisone (3 per day for 1 week, then 2 for a week, and then 1 for a week) and recommended B12 1,000mcg sublingual. \n\nEach day my symptoms got a little better, but the eye irritation would usually still creep up in the evening. \n\nIt is been two and a half weeks and I am basically back to normal now. Do not be discouraged, things will get better! I am so glad for you to have made such a speedy recovery! Thanks for the advice and encouragement!", "Cannabis Research for Bell\u2019s Palsy ", "Twitching post recovery Hello, \n\nI had Bells back in January and was about 85-90% recovered by the end of February. The first signs of my bells in January was constant twitching in my eyebrow, lip, and cheek for about a day. It then progressed to paralysis. \n\nI am concerned because all day today my bottom lip of the affected side has been twitching. My anxiety is stressing me out that I am getting it again, and was curious if anyone else dealt with twitching post recovery? I have got twitches when I move my brows, my mouth twitches and reverse. I still got them, and they will not ever recover, bit there is training to get them less noticable. I am sorry to bring you this message, but there is no way you get rid of them... Not really looking to get rid of them, I just do not want bells again! Actually good news. yeah that happened to me as well. I think it is just what the nerves do when they are getting medium-low strength 'connectivity,' if you will. So as you are coming back from 0% this could actually be a sign of healing, and it will go away as you get all the way better  \n\n\nediting to let you know that in my case at least, it got better. The only residual annoyance I have is from trying too hard during paralysis and accidentally getting some synesthesis where my eye closes a tiny bit when I chew \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I am about 8 years out, 99% recovered. The twitchs for me come and go still. If I am really tired or stressed, they are definitely more prevalent... I heard that during recovery twitching means the nerve is recovering. This happened to me, I still get some twitching now and then but I am like 95% recoverd I had it in  mid December and recovered 95% by 2 weeks. I was really surprised and thankful because everywhere I read it said that it might take  3-6 months. I immediately started on vitamin b12 2500 MG tabs and l- lysine. As someone here said twitching is the nerve healing itself.  Hope you get a speedy recovery. I get them too. They come and go. Twitching, numbness, pain in my ear, a scraped feeling on my face. They started a few months after I recovered, and have come back to visit for a few days every few months since then. I assume they are either a side-effect of whatever caused my BP, or are signs of whatever damage may have happened to those nerves when I had BP.\n\n\\&gt;  My anxiety is stressing me out that I am getting it again \n\nI know how difficult it is to derail those trains of thought, but anxiety and stress are literally at the top of the list of things that contribute to a BP event. Worrying does not just screw up your day unnecessarily, it can contribute directly to another event.\n\nBased on the stories people have shared here over the years, there is a high likelihood that these twitchy things \\*will\\* go away. You can help that happen by reducing stress and taking care of yourself - like, actually and actively \\*take care\\* of yourself.  Make a point of it. Eat right. Take vitamins and electrolytes. Get good sleep. Take warm baths. Put a warm wet cloth over the nerves that are bugging. And do whatever works for you to silence the worrying.\n\nI am hoping you will be back with an \"all that worrying was for nothing\" tale. But if you are in the small percentage of people for whom it goes the other way, the 'take care of yourself' thing just becomes that much more important. You can look into Botox if they get too troublesome, that has helped with mine. My chin and cheek would move sporadically and freak me out so I researched doctors who treat BP with Botox. I found some wonderful providers who are gifted at knowing the muscles to inject to stop the twitching. It is never too much where I am frozen face, just enough to stop the annoying twitch. I wish they could make me symmetrical again, but I doubt that will ever occur. I know there are sites that have exercises for the face and some people are successful with massage/tapping. Just keep hydrated since dry mouth can occur with BP leading to tooth decay or receding gums. Your body is telling you it needs rest, so be good to yourself.", "Eye redness So I had a mild/moderate case a little over a month to and have been 99.9% better for several weeks now- occasionally I will have eye twitches and slight numbness in the right corner of my mouth but it is extremely mild. However, in the past two weeks, my eyes have been getting super red, with more redness on the effected side. I have the artificial tears, and they help a lot. I find that when I use my mineral sunscreen (which I have used for months and never had issues before) both of my eyes are burning slightly and turn pink. Has anyone experienced this? It is freaking me out", "Just been diagnosed Apologies if my questions have already been answered I just cannot read the whole chat atm with one eye so I would rather keep it brief\n\n- what have you guys done to make your healing better/ more effective?\n\n- should I start massaging my face to potentially get the muscles to work again ?\n\n- I work in a high stress role serving the public so would you recommend time off from this or can you carry on as normal ?\n\n- For some reason I feel my bp may have been caused from stress , did anyone else who had been previously diagnosed have stress, or do you think it was caused by something else?\n\n- my doctor did not really explain to me why people put tape over their eye , is it recommended that I do this?\n\nOnce again thanks in advance for your answers , I wear glasses as it is , now I am only using one eye so I am basically blind I am on day 15 of BP and can see my face just starting to recover. I lost my taste first then the next day it was my face. I have read BP keeps developing for 3 days, this was the case with me. My face got a little worse until 3 days then stayed as was. \n\nI went on YouTube and found a few facial exercise videos. It is just about 5 mins a day.\n\nIf you feel stressed that may have been the cause, I would take some time off. I did not feel stressed but I took a few days off just to get used to the changes, like taking a bit longer to eat/drink etc\n\nDid your doctor prescribe a course of steroids? \n\nThe tape is to help close the eye fully at night if you cannot close it. This will help with the dryness. I am a fellow glasses wearer and there were a few days where I just could not face my work computer so again time off from work etc will give your eye a break.\n\nI am no doctor but what has helped me was the steroids, resting lots, B12 (it was suggested to me on here) and the YouTube videos. I got prescribed predisolone 5 in the morning 5 in the day at 5mg for the next 10days , hopefully that is all I need... No idea what caused it. I had some pain behind my ear and tge next morning I felt like something was wrong with my face. \n\nI has taken 3 weeks to recover. Never bothered with taping my eye at night as I just sort of pushed it closed with my pillow. Wear sunglasses during the day and make sure to manually close your eye lid every once in a while. My eye suffered from irritation in overly bright areas and windy conditions. \n\nMost importantly, take it easy. You are technically disabled, if only for a short while. It is a reality check and a potential kick-start for a healthier lifestyle if you needed it. It is kind of weird , I jog, go to gym eat healthy , it is only these last 5-7 weeks that I have slacked off due to work and now everything has went to shit I really do not think it is a good idea to force your face to move by doing exercises on your initial days. Look at it this way; say you broke your leg, would you go jogging the next day or let it rest? \n\nLet your face rest for a bit. Once healing begins, then start with facial exercises. That is what my doctor told me.\n\nB12 helps a ton. Once I started taking it, it sped up my healing process which I am so grateful for. \n\nYou will get better. Whether it is in 3 weeks to 6 months - you will see normal again please do not worry. You got this I am rooting for you \u2764\u2764 I would argue this... Of course, depending on the actual reasoning behind it, but I wish I had started acupuncture asap.  The doctor said the sooner the better with mine.  I did that and a tens unit twice daily.  The more I used it the better I got. &gt; The more I used it the better I got.\n\nCan you tell me where you put the pads of the TENS Unit? Thanks I had to cut them and shape them to my face in various areas that were markered on my face.  It was above my lip and the side of my eye.  I had to refer back with pictures daily of the placement.  So it was a bigger deal to them than I thought it would be. Def take time off if you can, especially if you have a public facing role. The first week will likely be uncomfortable and will get worse. It hurt when people made me smile or laugh. The second week is when I started getting nerve pain. Working from home it was not too bad but there were two days I had to take completely off because it was too much. I slept so much the second week. By the Third week I was feeling much better. \n\nThe tape if for when you sleep, so that you can tape it shut and it does not dry out. I did not like using tape and opted for eye gel then manually closing the eyelid when I slept. Hi - yes, I believe stress is an inducer. So be patient and kind to yourself.  Things to do: even at 10 days post-diagnosis you might need eye gel in at night and to tape your eye closed - white or clear medical tape (over thin tissue or cotton strip so tape only sticks at two ends) works. You need to keep dust out and moisture in. Scotch tape will work in a pinch. Plan on doing this for the first couple of weeks or until you can consistently keep your eye closed tight at night. It will prevent the eye from drying out. Any patch will work until you get the one you desire most - again keep dust out and moisture in.    Gently stimulate the muscles in your face and behind your ear with your fingertips - frequently throughout the day. You need to wake up the nerves originating behind your ear that fan out across your face on whatever side has BP. Initially, it might hurt to put soft touch behind your ear but as time progresses you will want to daily have someone - a professional, friend, family, or you - reinvigorate the nerves behind your ear that traverse into your face with touch, massage, and acupuncture. Identify the places on your head where nerves exit bone plates and gently tap, with clean fingers, along the route of the nerve. After a few weeks (Do not do this too early) you will want to have mirror time to watch your face move and imagine it move where it cannot and should. You can get muscle tone back if you are patient and diligent and spend months doing daily mirror facial movements - again wait a few weeks on facial exercise - but do massage now... after a couple of weeks hold a straw with your lips to improve mouth muscle tone - go for symmetry around the straw while looking in the mirror. Use a straw because you can breathe through it.", "Eye Taping! like many of us here, my doctor recommended that I tape my eye shut at night. Actually, she wants me to tape me eye all day as well, but we will get to that.\n\nMy eye taping skills were pretty bad - I would tape my eye and when I took the tape off in the morning, my eye would just be open...So in case anyone else is dealing with the same shortcomings (it is not a skill we really need to cultivate until THIS happens ;) ) I asked the dr for some pointers, and he recommended this technique, which has worked for me! \n\noh and do not forget to put your ointment in first :)\n\n1. cut a piece of tape that is just a bit longer than your eye\n2. attach the tape to your eyelid first - make sure it is good and attached (i am experimenting with putting the ointment in after this step - otherwise the tape will not stick to the eyelid)\n3. use your fingers to push/scrunch your cheek UP under your eye\n4. with your cheek scrunched, attach the tape to your cheek\n5. when it un-scrunches, gravity will pull down the tape with your cheek, keeping your eye closed.\n\nit is not pretty? but we are used to that!\n\nissue 2: the skin around my eye has taken a beating with all this taping - taping it multiple times a day is asking too much, i think - anyone have any advice for skin care during taping? I bought pro optics moisture chamber clear eye patch to help. I  alternate between taping and keeping it open to save my skin. I also switched from paper tape to mepitac silicone tape which has decreased skin irritation a lot. &gt;just bought both - thanks for the recommendations! You are welcome. Thanks i also splurged on some nice facial oils from herbivore :) Eye patch works wonders and all you have to do is pad it manually close your eye then place the eye patch works best for sleep so you can alternate tape in the day and patch at night thank you! is there an eye patch type/brand you recommend? i have had bell\u2019s palsy for a week now, and i would 100% recommend buying some \u2018fake\u2019 glasses to wear in the day. this keeps my eye in working condition, and i can still see. at night i just wear an eyepatch. i also ride my bike every day, which i use downhill goggles for. i do not know how much this will help but i thought i would share. How do you pad it? Have not quite figured out the best option yet. you are hardcore dude! thanks for sharing! right?! it would be so much easier if my eye did not insist on popping open all the time... So what I did is I bought a generic eye patch from cvs and put makeup pads inside of it, like the circular padded cotton ones i put in like 3-4 and then manually closed my eye with the eye patch, the force of the cotton kept it closed enough for sleep thank you!", "posting for hope! I was diagnosed November 5th, 2021 and just like everyone here I was freakkkkingggg out I was at work and all of a sudden my lips started tingling but I brushed it off then my face started feeling tight then i realized i could not smile went to the hospital the next morning and was diagnosed with bells first two weeks were so tough mentally physically emotionally at about week 2 1/2 i got baby movement in my affected side and now on week 4 1/2 I pretty much have everything back but my smile, it is coming back tho my dimples are starting to show again! did not take the steroids besides one day they made me feel ill, i just took vitamins and lots of water did not get lots of rest bc i work 2 jobs but almost week 5 and i am 85% healed! just remember that time heals all!", "Ear pressure? I have had BP now for about 5 weeks. This past week I started to notice ear pressure on my BP side whenever I attempt to smile or move my face. It feels like my ear wants to \u201cpop\u201d like when I am in an airplane. Anyone else experience this? I am on my 4th week and am experiencing this. It is magnified when I yawn. Yes. One of the worst symptoms I am experiencing. It gets worse when I try to move the muscles on that side. I am going on my 16th week without much improvement. Hope you have a better experience Thank you! I hope you will see improvement soon as well. This truly has humbled me. Omg I got that!!! It goes away after you start healing trust me!! It was so annoying so i totally get u stay strong \u2764\u2764 Yeah! I definitely experienced this days before I was diagnosed even after the diagnosis :)", "Switching Sides I am two weeks removed from being diagnosed with BP. I was given a weeks worth of Prednisone and Anti Viral. Took both and after the following weekend I was seeing definitive improvement with moving my eye, better speech, smile looked like a smirk but still limited. Now three days later it has switched sides. Seeing a neurologist tomorrow about it, but am now worried that it is a bigger issue because of the switching sides. It seemed to be healing on the quicker end of the spectrum but now I do not know. If anyone has similar stories about this and would share it is greatly appreciated. I do not have enough a similar situation but keep taking your meds and doing your facial excises Bi-lateral Bell's Palsy is pretty rare, I believe.  I am sure your doctors will get on the right path!

Blood Work and MRI ordered so we will see", "do i have a bellspalsy? i only noticed my face was like not aligned last last month and i thought i just look tired. i guess this started when i got my jawlocked on the right side. I am getting anxious now whether if i have bellspalsy coz my right side looks ok but on the left side looks like tired.  there is no pain or whatever that i am feeling right now. it is just I am anxious to what is happening on my face. pls help nah your face looks completely normal. If you had BP you would not be able to smile like that.\n\nif you are not feeling right, see/call your doctor. Reddit is not the place for medical advices. no, not yet from what I can tell. bell's palsy paralysis makes your face droop quite a bit. it is hard to explain, but it is like the muscles are dead and they make your face look lifted and normal even when it is at rest. When you have paralysis, everything hangs down.\n\nyou will feel weird sensations as well as see misalignment as well (which I cannot see in you, looks normal, but I am not a doctor)\n\nare you feeling any numbness? It has started like that for me both times, then the next day it went fully into BP.\n\ncheck if you can whistle or keep water in your mouth. \n\nlockjaw can totally affect the symmetry of your face. If one side is tense, it will show slightly, maybe that is what you are seeing. that muscle tension probably tires out your right side too. if it stays around, you should still see the doctor regardless.\n\nhope you are healthy! I would say get it checked I noticed my face was similar to yours and over time it became asymmetrical then I had full bells palsy to be safe go see a doctor to catch it early since you had tmj or jawlock you are at an increased risk of bells palsy but get the opinion of your doctor's but stay calm and do not stress about it so you can heal If everything is symmetrical, which it looks like it is according to the pictures, and it started a month ago, then you should be fine. But if you are concerned about being jawlocked, you should consult a physician. i do not feel any numbness at all. i really do think that this is caused by the jawlock. it is really hard to wakeup every day cause the muscle the my right jaw feels like a a branch that is about to break (based on what i can tell). i already said this to my family and got consulted to the doctor. only gave some medicines and i still feel like those were not enough. every time i tell them that this jawlock is serious and it will affect me time to time. they will always say \" just massage it or what ever. it will heal like a sprain.\" if only they know what I am really experiencing and how i suffer everyday. (I am really sorry if i say a lot haha I am getting emotional just by typing this. u do not need to read all of this thx.) I did read it! I am so sorry they are not taking you seriously. I have a good friend who had TMJ and it caused severe pain. It is awful. \n\nPlease try to talk to another doctor. Maybe you could get advice on a subreddit for lockjaw or other jaw issues? They might give you tips on how to get doctors to take you seriously. again, really sorry you are experiencing this and on top of that dealing with unsupportive family and health care professionals. that sounds horrible. I hear you!\n\nhang in there. it is normal to feel emotional about this kind of thing. It is so hard. \\*hugs\\* thx i appreciate that. it is just the anxiety and fear or being bullied. might thinking of taking my life", "Should the MRI be with contrast or without for Bell\u2019s palsy? Have the appointment tomorrow but want to make sure its the right one? I know you guys are not doctors just want to know what you guys got and if contrast matters or not. My MRI was with contrast. depends on your doctor and what they ordered. The prescription just says, MRI HEAD RE: BELLS PALSY. \n\nBecause of my moms headaches, dizziness and pain behind the ear/head. \n\nShe does not have insurance so we want to avoid going to a neurologist unless it is necessary. That is why she requested the doc do an MRI first. We just want to rule out certain things just in case. I did not have an MRI for mine...they did not even make it seem like an option I had an MRI and contrast with mine the first time around, which seemed like a waste of time (and money) since it was clearly Bells. Second time, they did not feel the need. Yeah tbh I am just a bit worried. My mom has always been healthy. She never really gets sick or had something like this happen before. Before bells happened she was experiencing a lot of headaches and dizziness that would cause a bit of loss of balance for 1 month or 2. \n\nShe is getting better but I still worry it could be something serious. It is a very scary thing, so definitely do as your GP suggests.

I finished my pain pills (naproxen and gabapentin) around 4 days ago and some very slight pain is coming back, but nothing I am too concerned with. I do have a question though; often times when I eat now I get a weird feeling/sound in my affected ear. Kind of like when you yawn and you can hear it in your own ear? I do not really know how to describe it. I also get a weird sensation in the back of my mouth that causes some slight nausea and is unsettling. Am I crazy?

Worst flu of my life. Was bed ridden, feverish and barely breathing for about 6 days. Thought it was over, and then started getting a pain behind my ear.\n\nWent to brush my my teeth yesterday morning and when I was rinsing, the water started dribbling out my mouth.. Weird. Sure enough about 3 hours later, my eye was leaking and I could no longer smile or feel half my face! Joy...\n\nI am on anti viral, steroids, and got T3s on back up. I cannot say words with P\u2019s or F\u2019s, close my eye, and I have got a sweet new eye patch. \n\nHoping this shit goes away soon, but going to start on the physio ASAP. Happy New Year to me \ud83d\ude2c.\n\nHope you are all doing okay. Be patient- Good luck! Cheers for that. Already it is a huge pain but I am staying positive! Definitely keep on with physio, I got it when I was 14 and did not even bother w any physio. I am 21 now and I cannot smile properly and absolutely hate how I look in photos and videos. Hope you make a full recovery!!! Sounds like your experience has been gruelling! Yeah my buddy told me the same thing, I am sorry to hear that. I have always been a big fan of my smile so got to keep on it :). It has not ben fun. And I am meant to start the second half of my electrician classes this week, not sure how that is going to go considering the pain and inability to use one eye. But thank you :) Might need to take time off to relax and rest sorry to say it. I went on disability for 6 weeks. Hopefully you will have another opportunity for the class but right now it is really important to eat well sleep well and be stress free \"Went to brush my my teeth yesterday morning and when I was rinsing, the water started dribbling out my mouth.. \"\n\nThat is exactly how I found out. I am curious if the flu had anything to do with the BP. As far as I know it is still a mystery how it affects people.\n\nI am two months in with modest recovery so far. At least I am not having the pain I had in the first two weeks.", "Facial twitch two months after diagnosis? Has anyone else dealt with facial twitching months later? I was diagnosed Feb 12 and my face looks mostly normal (though still different to me). \nI noticed the last two weeks the muscles in my upper lip/cheek on the side that was affected have been twitching off and on. \nI feel my \u201csmile\u201d looks the most healed so I am surprised the muscles are twitching there. \nIt is very subtle, rapid, light twitching when it happens, but I saw it up close in the mirror the other day and it kind of freaked me out. Just your nerves being overly active.  Could be a sign of healing, could be a sign that you are having a mental breakdown. It is nothing to be overly worried about. That was my sign of movement Hi - I think that is normal. Unfortunately I have been having the similar twitches for years after I came out of my first BP. \nMy neurologist told me it is nothing to worry about - as long as it does not cause pain or gets worse on it is own. \n\nI have noticed they happen more often when I am stressed or tired but they eventually go away after a few days. \n\nEveryone is different though - I would not worry about it. Talk to a doctor if you are concerned. Good luck! This is my kind of humor haha. My pucker and smile still are not fully healed (diagnosed 2/5) and I have noticed towards the end of the day if I practice my pucker I will feel some twitching. I like to tell myself it is a good sign. About two years our for me, my eyelid, an area around my jaw, and eyebrow still will have a twitching fit for about 5 seconds once every month. Definitely used to be more common, but thankfully it gets less and less common as you regain more control.

I had 2 episodes - 2015 and 2017 and then intermittent worrisome facial tingling every few months since and it is worrisome about recurrence. Thanks in advance. Hi there! I have had 7 episodes (ranging from 1998 to most recently in 2019).  I received both doses of Moderna in December 2020/Jan 2021 with no issues I got the first dose of Pfizer and no issues. Tomorrow I get the second one and I will update you. :) Thank you so much. Hi there, oh my goodness 7 episodes? You are one tough person. Thank you for sharing. This is reassuring. I hope you have had good recoveries. Thank you for sharing. I have had BP twice (2004, 2016). I had the first Biontech dose some weeks ago with no issues. Second dose is next Tuesday and I will try and remember to update if you would like! I definitely appreciate it Thank you for this I thought my 3 cases was a lot lol. Wow I had JNJ about 2 months ago. No issues to report. Thank you! I was super nervous about the vaccination but thankfully it did not affect me whatsoever, I have been at about 80% after the last 2.  Hope all goes  well for you! I had this concern before getting vaccinated. Good news, I got Pfizer and no issues :) I have had lifelong BP with many early episodes until 1997 when it just stayed. Since then I have had only partial recovery with continued episodes where I have zero function for awhile. So, I have had it a LOT. \nHad both Pfizer shots back in March and April with no BP reaction after, or any episode since.

I had some side effects and felt awful for a few days but I am grateful that, so far, my face is holding up! \\^\\^ Haha all good, thanks so much for responding, really! It means a lot Glad to hear that! Just to update you: I had my second Pfizer vaccination a month ago and no hint of any kind of BP-related symptoms! were ur side effects in relation to bell\u2019s palsy? I do not think so, they were more like Covid symptoms so related to my body fighting the vaccine.", "I had a one-sided eyebrow lift to help correct remaining BP. Onset 5/19 and maybe 85% improvement in lower face with zero recovery in my forehead. AMA!  My wife had it in January of this year and has had good recovery on lower face over the past few months - albeit with significant synkinesis, but she is worried about the appearance of her forehead and eyebrows. Did you have any movement of eyebrows/forehead? And how does the procedure help?\nHope you continue to recover! I am over 3 years in and still recovering. Did your surgery have any effect on eye closure? Or was the lower part of your face recovered enough for that to no longer be an issue? \nThanks for sharing :) This is very consistent with my experience as well, I am sorry for your wife. No, I have zero movement in my forehead. I got this procedure for cosmetic reasons, but my insurance covered it because my droopy eyebrow caused ptosis, which limited my vision, so we were able to say it was for medical reasons. I will say it did make it a tiny bit harder to close my eye but I have been practicing and as I have adjusted, it is pretty much back to what it used to be before the surgery! I am 3.5 weeks out from the surgery now. That is great news! Good luck on your recovery :) Thank you! I hope you continue to recover. Did the BP affect both eyes? \n My fiance was recently diagnosed with this and it has cause one of her eyes the affected one to be wider and the healthy one to kind of be droopy.\n How long did you waited to make this decision pls help !

So one I just woke up with my right side not working 100%.\nI can kind of smirk, and when I try to squint my eye, nothing Ng happens but you see some muscle working under it and try to love my eye brow, but just slight movement.\n\nMy question is the day before I was fine, but I did spray the bed and pillow with disinfectant spray before I fell asleep. And I always tend to sleep with my right side of my face on the pillow. Would the spray have something to do with it.?\n\nAlso tired to make an appointment with neurologist but they only have appointments till midb- late October... I drove to the ER to get checked out last week Monday because I did not know what was going on. It probably did infect your ear or something. Wish you the  est of luck and a speedy recovery for you Go to urgent care or ER, you need to get put on steroids now.  With Bells Palsy the sooner you can get treatment the better.  If you wait, you will have a worse chance at recovery. Urgent care would be able to get me what I need, or it would be best to go to er.? I would probably go to the ER in case they want to run any additional tests, you can get it all done there. Depends on the specific Urgent Care. I would say call them. You may need to do a CT Scan to check for stroke (my ER did). Good luck Being that the morning I woke up with my face like this, I had the taste of lysol through out the day.would that rule out the stroke?\n\nJust trying to prepare my self for when I go to the er.\nSeeing on how when I kind of went over board on staying the whole bed with disinfectant spray to the point when I fell asleep it was still moist, but since I was tired I just went to bed.... Stayed at the hotel by the way that is why I used so much spray I cannot see you. I am a random person on the internet. Go to ER/Urgent care and see a doctor.\n\nMy doc told me to always treat my (recurrent) BP as a stroke until it is ruled out and I have been dealing with it for 30ish years. So even being a former firefighter/medic that knows what this is and feels like I go to the ER every time. They will start you on the needed meds too.\n\nEdit to add: Not trying to scare you, but I am blunt. It is really quick to rule out stroke and usually they do not keep you waiting long at least. I went to the er, got cat, mri, ekg and echo to rule out stroke and got put on the meds. A little precaution goes a long way", "5 Weeks ....and counting. No movement yet. Had to deal with Thanksgiving pictures, really hoping I get to avoid the same for Christmas. I know it could be worse, just really irritated at this point. Anybody got a little bit of hope for me today?? It literally comes back almost as instantly and it went away, man. Just give it time I was same at 5 weeks, except it was Mother\u2019s Day and my birthday instead of thanksgiving... like the other comment said it came back quick, I do not even reminder the date but it was between 6-8 weeks, hang in there!!! I found that acupunture helps not only with appearance but also with pain. \nIn the meantime while you are healing...relax, sleep a lot to promote healing and know that it takes a while for muscles to return to normal.\nMy doc advises vit B-Complex, too. \u2764\ud83e\udd0d Some comments seem full of false hope. It could take 6 months before you start to even regain a bit of twitching. Most healing is very gradual. Most people do not just snap out of it. Your facial nerve only heals about 1 mm a day. From my initial onset, it was 10 months before I could blink my eye and barely even smile. At a year I was fully healed with some permanent residual synkinesis. Acupuncture can help,  it if you jump into it too soon, you can do more damage to the nerve as it heals, so just take that slow. Do not over manipulate your face. Some people get very lucky and heal very quickly, but that is not typical. My god I know this feeling. I am finally getting back to looking almost like myself probably like 99%. It took me about 3 months to have significant movement. I got this end of may and I am now just getting better really. It seemed as if healing took a long time to start but once it did it kept healing. Also acupuncture is what started healing it for me. After my first appointment I had feeling in my face again of being able to locate a muscle even though it was not moving I could locate it again. I highly recommend if you have the means.", "How long until you start blinking again? I have had Bell's Palsy for 6 months now. Things are improving and I can make my eye closed. But it is still not blinking on it is own. I am still having to use a lot of eye drops and my eye still gets so dry. I still have to wear the eye patch at night. How long did it take you to start blinking again? I know everyone is different, but I am getting so frustrated with it. My neurologist told me yesterday that it is as healed as it is going to get and I will have to follow up with a special eye doctor about getting eye lid weights implanted. I refuse to believe this, it has to get better, right?", "Prednisone Side Effects I had taken Prednisone for 10 days during the month of December and I have been fully recovered since early January. I have recently noticed that I have been having muscle spasms throughout my body. They are not painful, just annoying. Anybody else have experience with this? I will be making a doctor's appointment because I have been having these symptoms for 1 week.

I have had many cases of bell palsy around me and it will come back for sure, do not be scared everything\u2019s fine.

Can I ask how many times I have to do it? And that will help my pout come back right?? \ud83d\udc9e Yes it will, mine came back pretty fast, do 10 or 20 repetitions slowly, keep in mind face is made of muscles, if you train them they will improve again so do not worry. The slowly u can do the best it is for the muscles as it works them out well, you will see improvements soon do not worry I read a study that injections are effective and the pill form is not. I started taking 1000 mcg of b12 methylcobalamin injections about every other or two days apart. I am three weeks in and have noticed much less tension in my left side of my face. The nurse who administers it said my eye is more even than when she first saw me. I am hopeful. It is been 9 months since my initial onset and I took prednisone immediately after discovering the symptoms and talking to the doctor. I wish I took the b12 shots at that time.

I ( about how happy I was that BandAids were working so very well at keeping my closed at night. Here is an update to that post:\n\n\n**Update: 6 days in \u2014** indeed the BandAid was ultra sticky and good compared to tape. Though an issue has popped up that might be a concern. There is a small small of residue that is left on the eye lid from the BandAid when removed. I guess I have not take enough care to clean the residue 100% off and therefore as my eye sits open (all day) it gets a little sticky up there. The only way you would know is by pulling your eye lid down, as you cannot close your eye if you tried. Anyways, I have been trying to do a better job cleaning the next day and the top of the eye lid (where the BandAid sticks to) is getting very sensitive. I guess like any extra special attention you are body is not used to, the skin there is quite tender and irritated... because of the super-stickum of the BandAid, and then *pulling* it off after many hours. It is just tender skin there! Might also be because I am using tough-ass \"CLEAR WATER BLOCK PLUS 100% WATERPROOF PROTECTION BandAids. They were just ones we had in the cabinet, that is why.\n\nYou may wish to pick a less super-stickum BandAid if you are trying this. Or give it a go one night and give it a reasonably good clean off (any residue) the next day. I think the combined slight gummy residue, coupled with the fact that the folds in your upper eye lid do not ever allow for the residue to fully dry, just gets things dirty in there. Clean well after BandAids!", "Day 15 Update Hi friends! I am posting a lil update :)\n\nSo 15 days have passed since my first sign of symptom and I feel like I have recovered at least 10%! I did not take any steroids or medication and only went for acupuncture the first week of symptoms. My BP is mild at best. I could close my eyes, still not squeeze it shut but it is something :) \n\nThe numbness in my tongue has subsided, albeit I still cannot really fully taste anything. Like a really mild flavour on my right side.\n\nI can smirk on my BP side (right side) but it is nowhere near a full smile. All these are little steps to recovery (I hope) but I hope everyone who reads this does not feel so discouraged! \n\nI have been trying to move only the BP side of my face. Like smirking, or trying to raise my right eyebrow etc. I did not massage my face or apply pressure as I fear that synkinesis might happen (miswiring of nerves after trauma). Only facial exercise. Have you taken a blood test for Lyme disease? That is what bells did to me.. It was a symptom of Lyme. If it had not happened to me.. I would be in extreme pain still. I have the antibody markers of Lyme. So I am still on doxycycline for a week.. Then will hopefully get a clear bill of health! Do you got the bulls eye rash? I do not have any particular symptom of any disease, no pain/ache etc and honestly i am too lazy to go to A&amp;E (and expensive if it is something that will heal by itself)  :( No I never got the rash. Even if you do not have any symptoms.. Go.get checked out Same. No bulls-eye rash, but I tested positive for Lyme. Scary right?! I had no clue... It wrecks havoc on your body it is awful.", "BP in toddler Hi all,\n\nMy 18 month old was diagnosed with Bells Palsy this past Saturday. He started steroids on Monday. In my opinion his symptoms have gotten worse since onset. My question is to those of you who took steroids, when did you start to see an improvement? Steroids are prescribed for most people and it does not really fix the BP, it just reduces the inflammation that causes nerve damage. When you see paralysis, the nerve is already damaged, and it takes at weeks (and often longer) for the nerve to grow back. Steroids are important to take for a short period to reduce inflammation so the nerve can start to heal and so the damage does not get worse. (This is my understanding, so forgive me if I am wrong. Someone can correct me if this is not quite right.)\n\nPeople have different levels of recovery. My first bout of BP I was feeling improvement in a few weeks. My second and current bout I only started getting significant improvement after 4-6 weeks. That is a bit unusual and has meant that I have a longer road with fewer chances of fully recovering all facial movement.\n\nMy first day of bell's palsy was mild and then got worse over several days, but since he is a baby, I would definitely make sure you tell your pediatrician everything that is going on just in case it means something else.\n\nSorry you and your baby are going through this! Hope he makes a quick recovery. I am sorry you are both going through that. Was he also prescribed antibiotics? I was given both antibiotics and steroids two days after onset and fully healed. I am sorry you are dealing with this in your child. But, as others have said, the point of the steroid is to reduce the inflammation that is causing damage to the 7th cranial nerve.  If paralysis has already started, then the nerve is already damaged, and you and your guy are simply going to have to wait for his little body to repair his damaged nerves. No he was not prescribed antibiotics. He had a double ear infection and was on amoxicillin. It was actually his last day on antibiotics when he started to have BP symptoms. Sorry to hear that your toddler got BP.\n\nIf it is any consolation, it is quite normal for BP to get worse the first week. I know mine did.\n\nAnd usually young people tend to recover faster. Of course it might be hard to do face exercises with a toddler though, but physically he has a good chance of getting a full recovery.\n\nBest of luck with his recovery. Please consult doctor for better understanding. Sorry, that you and your child have to go through all this. My thoughts and prayer are with you and I wish him a speedy recovery.   \n\n\nRegarding steroids, I saw improvement almost after 10 days. I just wanted to send you a note of encouragement, hang in there, I am sure it is scary right now. So sorry to hear about your toddler. Perhaps try seeing a chiro? I got BP when I was 6 years old the first time. I went to physio therapy and shock therapy but I was obviously much older and receptive to the treatment. Chiro seems less invasive than meds or oral treatments? I wish you both well and a swift recovery A word of encouragement, babies tend to have extraordinary rates of recovery. They heal broken bones and other injuries very fast, the same should apply for the damaged nerve.\nSo after the initial onset, and when the inflammation is gone, he should have a very good chance of fast recovery. I am sorry your going through this. It is very emotional process to go through. I was recently diagnosed on oct 26. The steroids did not work well with me. It made me have an emotional rollercoaster and made me cry so much and made me feel worst than I was. Keep an eye on your baby and see if theirs any major side affects that make your baby feel different. You know your baby better than he knows himself and just cuddle him with affection. Being cuddled willl make him feel safe and I hope he gets better. Do not try to massage the face as when it is swollen it actually feels like a bruise and would hurt more during the process. I purchased those little back massagers from target and placed it on my check and the back of my neck in the paralyzed side. It did not help to make it better. But the vibration helped me not feel the numbness as it was tiring and exhausting feeling the pain all day. If your doctor recontenta Tylenol for him do so as it gave me headaches from feeling my head swollen", "You will persevere. You will recover. One day I woke up with a terrible pain", "6 months post.. anyone else have these lingering symptoms?

The right side of my face was paralyzed. There is still some stiffness but it is not noticeable. \n\nRecently I have been having alot of twitching mainly my eye and sometimes my cheekbone below the eye. \n\nI wonder if anyone else is experiencing this and/or if there is a way to stop the twitching. Thanks in advance! woah! ive recently have had eye twitches on my right side (also the side i was paralyzed) and it has been stiff too. i was diagnosed in 2017. im experiencing the same exact things!!!! Oh good I am not the only one then heh\ud83d\ude05. Have you had the twitching for a while or is it a recent thing ? its been like this for the past week so pretty recent! yours? Ngl I cannot remember twitching up until recent. Maybe i did and cannot remember but I know it started to get annoying very recent, maybe like a month Yup.  Happens all the time to me.  I was back to \\~95% after 3 months of paralysis.  I still get twitching around my eye on the affected side.  Usually it is when I am stressed about something. Huh I have never thought about it like that, I usually twitch alot when I am at work so I guess you might be on to something with the stress thing xD It is possible that the twitches are unrelated to BP. who knows, you might just have a bit of a magnesium deficiency.\n\nTry eating some bananas or getting some magnesium supplements :) Thanks! I will look into it :)", "What is the recovery time frame for mild Bell\u2019s Palsy? So I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy 3 days ago. I got it right after I had a bad middle ear infection. I thought I had a perforated eardrum, but apparently I just have a ton of puss blocking my ear canal (leading to me not being able to hear). I have facial paralysis on the right side of my face and my tongue is numb so I do not have much taste. I just started taking prednisone today and I take it for 10 days. Has anyone recovered by just using prednisone or does it usually take e stim and/or acupuncture? Mine started with an ear infection too.  I was on prednisone, same number of days and also an antiviral.  It took about 1.5 months to mostly go away.  Im not sure if mine was considered mild or not though, so hopefully you can get better quicker. Thank you for your insight!  :) I am still recovering since may 30th, but it was not from an ear infection. I actually got one during recovery..  now you have me wondering if they come together sometimes. I wish you a quick recovery! If you have any question or anything let me know! Doctor of oriental medicine here.  I would say the average patient I see with Bell's Palsy takes about three sessions (1.5 weeks) to get back to 90+% of normality.\n\nOf course some take longer and some people acupuncture does not help at all, but this is my average. Thank you so much for your input!! Is there anything you would recommend me to do to recover quicker or more effectively? Either a few days, or 6-10 months. I was taking a huge dose of steroids like 150mg a day for 5 days that tapered down and a massive 1000mg of an antiviral medicine.  My symptoms were gone in a week and made a full recovery.  Good to hear, I am 1 week in after ear infection. Hoping mine is sorted, or at least on its way by easter.  Mine started the same way, and I am on day 4 of prednisone and anti viral meds. The eye is the most frustrating part for me. Fingers crossed it will not take months th at least have the eye working better. ", "Masks, the good, the bad, and the bells palsy On one hand our current culture of encouraging (mandating) mask usage is nice for those of us that are somewhat self conscious about going out and about with this. But I have to say having my breath constantly blowing into my eye is far more annoying than any of the glasses fogging I ever dealt with. \n\nToday I forgot my eye drops on my dresser when I had to do a Costco run, I thought I was going to die from the dry eye on that trip. Have you tried wearing the disposable eyepatches with a face mask I do that to avoid dry eye not yet, I am only a week and a half into this, so still learning I definitely recommend getting an eye patch. Hell, your local pharmacy probably sell some good old regular eye patches that are reusable. I used that whenever I went outside when my BP was bad. I definitely rocked the pirate look for many weeks. I got a black eyepatch from the pharmacy (the type with the elastic around your head) and wore it whenever I had to wear a mask. Not precisely fashionable, but it let me get groceries without my eye screaming at me.", "Bells Palsy and the Cold Hello All: \n\nI was diagnosed will BP this February and was almost fully recovered by May. I am terrified it is going to come back and when I notice the slightest sign I think that it has returned. I am wondering if these symptoms could be a result of the could weather? Has anyone else has old symptoms return due to the cold without a full on reoccurrence of BP?  Stay away from fans, AC, wind and cold. I fully recovered 4 years ago but the slightest breeze can give me this 'tired face' feeling that freeks me out. I still exercise and do massage 3-5 times a week.  Thank you, this really helps me out! I just keep thinking it is coming back and it is totally freaking me out! ", "Pain Has anyone had major pain with Bells Palsy? I am a little over a week into my diagnosis, tapering down on the steroids, and I have finished my antiviral med. I am having major pain along my ear and jaw on the affected side...sometimes it gives me a headache too. It is worse by the end of the day and I am so tired. I am doing acupuncture, massage and my brother has been using a tens machine on me too (he is a physical therapist). This pain is terrible though...did anyone else have bad pain? What did you do to ease it? I am thankful this thread exists, thank you guys for any, and all answers. I had HORRIFIC pain once the steroids were done. I had to ice my face constantly to get 15 minutes sleep. It was scary. It did go away though. \n\nI am still affected, even though I was diagnosed in August. \n\nWhat comforted me the most after the two week mark (when most cases are healed) when I had no change, was finding out there are typically two types of BP- one that goes away in 2 weeks, and another that will not start healing until 3-6 months. Just as I had come to terms with my new normal, I started getting movement the day after thanksgiving. \n\n Good luck with everything, it does get better! Thank you so much. I am not at the two week mark just yet, I am really hoping I see improvement soon. Even if I do not see improvement, I want the pain to go away, I will try ice as well as the heat I have been doing too. Thank you for your encouragement \ud83d\ude0a First of all I would recommend stopping the tens until the pain has disappeared, you need to give yourself a chance to let the inflammation in the nerve go down. The muscles are not affected, it is the nerve that operates them(cannot think of the correct terminology lol) the nerve goes into your face via a small hole in your skull, and has become squashed with the inflammation.  Once that has gone down the movement will probably come back on its own. You may actually be causing more inflammation by exercising too early.\n I personally had lots of pain. The only thing that helped me was heat. I had a microwaveable wheat bag and it was amazing relief. If you do not have that, a hot water bottle may help. I know some people also find that ice helps, I suppose its a personal preference. \nHope this helps! Thank you, last night I told my brother that I did not think I could not handle the tens unit, he did a little massage instead and that helped a lot...for a little while at least. It is not helping that I have not taken any time off from work and I have had engagements that I could not miss either...I have had zero downtime. I am at work today and I am going to try warm compresses. Thank you for your help. Rest, you are ill! That is my plan this weekend, no plans, just rest Yes. Like u/iwillbringuwater, I had terrible pain once the initial steroid treatment stopped - exactly where you state. I called my doc and he put me on a 2nd round of steroids, albeit slightly reduced.\n\nThat did the trick. I have been pain free since. \n\nBTW, I am in my 4th month and about 60% improved. I have a call into my neurologist, I have epilepsy so I am already established with one, I am waiting to hear back and see what he thinks. I feel like if I could just get some good sleep and downtime I would feel better. Tell them that you are not sleeping. That is what sealed the deal for me. do not do the tens unit yet, and be wary of over manipulating your face. you can cause permanent damage, synkinesis, to the nerves in your face and actually make your recovery droop worse. After not having any pain on the affected side for months, I started getting pain on the non-affected side about a month ago. I do not know if this is part of BP or some unrelated neuropathy, perhaps in relation to my diabetes type 2. Three weeks in for me. Pain started after first week and lasted for a week. I have recovered about 75% in 3 weeks. Rest, rest, rest. Avoid stress Trust me! Gabapentin!\n\nYou are feeling nerve pain.  Gabapentin is great for nerve pain, I know ... I have lived it!\n\nIts been 9 years since I was hit with Bell's Palsy. \n\nI had horrific pain after the usual treatments.  Nothing worked ... until one doctor recommended Gabapentin.\n\nWow! All pain was gone, that felt SO good.  Such a relief!\n\nJust wanted to hopefully help some of you.\n\nOh and ... I had no side effects from the meds, and no problems when I finally discontinued it. Thank you, my doctor was considering putting me on it but I already take 2 anti seizure meds that make me very tired. He did have me increase my Prednisone and that has helped a lot and he may put me on Gabapentin as I am coming down the steroid. I am hoping it will be enough, the pain was tremendous over the weekend.", "Can I drink while I am recovering from BP? I googled it but all I see is some research paper with results that say ppl who drink have a lower chance of getting BP, that might be while I have a mild case of it but yeah can I have a drink? I am not talking about getting drunk, but the occasional beer/drink? Are you currently on any medications? Hi Erica, I am done with meds only taking B12 and some CBD oil Then do what you would like. I beg to differ. I waited 3 weeks before I started drinking after diagnosis and I was back at about 90% by then. Remember this is trauma on your body and it is healing. Drinking could slow the process down. I understand the tho so a occasional drink probably is not bad. I have certainly not read this conclusively in any study/article re: BP, but alcohol could contribute to inflammation in the body and contribute to the inflammation in your cranial nerve which is producing the BP. My treatment for BP has been super holistic and I have been reading up a ton on ways to reduce general inflammation in the body. Certainly do what is best for you but thought I would share. Good luck with your recovery! You too bro, I deff will not over for it, I just have not been able too enjoy myself in two weeks, thanks for the info friend. I drank. It caused my Bells to look worse while I drank. I guess due to muscles relaxing. But once sober it did not make a difference. And that is fine too. Im not a doctor, I have no place to tell OP what to do and not do other than to consult their doctor if they are on medications. But remember, not much is known about BP. Its not something that is commonly studied and no one has ever really tried to find a \u201ccure\u201d for. Each person\u2019s case is also very different with timelines. I am 5 years out from diagnosis with no facial movement at all and I did everything the first year from medications, to PT, electric stimulation, and neruo consults to look for tumors. So allowing someone to do what they want with their own journey is not going to effect your own. It is good you relaxed in a way, I went out and have 2 drinks, it was fun and relaxing. In another two weeks I will treat myself to another drink. \n\nIdk between acupuncture and CBD oil yesterday, maybe even the drinks I woke up well and my eye closes without the other eye again which is great. Means the muscle is stronger.\n\nThanks for the comment I went and hand 2 drinks, I took CBD oil and had acupuncture yesterday and I feel great. Oddly I also am able to close my eye without the other again so that is a huge win. New to BP so I do not have much advice. Read that BP was due to inflammation and since alcohol possibly could cause inflammation, I would say, maybe a once in a while thing?", "I assume tingling is a good thing? Saw the doctor on Thursday. Started meds Thursday evening. I have started to feel a tingling sensation in my lips today. Does that mean it is working? It could also just be a side effect of the adrenocortical hormones. Personally, I did not get any tingling sensations during my recovery.\n\nAre you doing face exercises? The meds will help, but doing face exercises is key to regaining control. Yep been doing the face exercises. If you are not afraid of acupuncture... worth looking into.  I had great success with it. I am about to go to my chiropractor right now. I will try whatever I can. Mine seems like a mild case but I want it to stay that way or recover. Took about 6 weeks with me.  2nd week I went to acupuncture.  3rd week I started going 3 times a week.  I also had a tens unit on my face twice a day.  My eye was pretty bad. Not too sure if it directly correlated to healing but I have had tingling as well, just keep resting and doing facial exercises and hopefully it will go away. Prednisone has also helped me so if u are prescribed it make sure to take it. I am currently on it. Did your doctor continue the prednisone after your initial prescription? I am trying to rest but the steroids are giving me all kinds of energy. I got diagnosed and prescribed prednisone last Tuesday and have been taking 2 a day since then. the prescription was supposed to be for 1-2 a day but the pharmacist made a HUGE mistake and labeled 12 a day, thankfully they told us that it was a mistake but the funny thing is that they actually put in enough pills for me to take 12 a day for a week so now I have like 70 pills leftover.\n\nbut to your question, I have only been taking it for about 6 days and I am supposed to take it for a week. I have noticed a lot of improvement and I mostly attribute it to the medication; I have got like 75% of my facial mobility back rather quickly. I do not think I will continue it for more than a couple of extra days at most.\n\nthe medication makes me feel jittery and I also have trouble going to sleep, initially I had taken one and stayed up 28 hours and worked out twice in that span and took melatonin and I barely fell asleep. if you already have trouble sleeping (i do) it makes life a bit harder.\n\nbut you kind of get used to it after the third or fourth day (at least I did) if not take a melatonin pill to get to sleep a bit easier. you can get them at any drug store, they come in a little jar with like 60 pills, you can get the dissolving ones you just hold under your tongue or the capsules you swallow. I personally recommend the capsules, if you do not mind a chemical-minty flavour then try the dissolving ones. &gt;kly. I do not think I will continue it for more than a couple of extra days a\n\nI had the exact same issue. I was prescribed 60mg of prednisone, and I could not sleep. I was staying up all night.

But my eyebrow has not had any change. Even when I cry, as I look in the mirror and see my eyebrows not even match when I furrow them, it makes me more sad.

To make it feel better but the best thing you can do is try to relax and not stress too much about it.  Again I understand the psychological impacts this has. I was there too.

The one incessant issue I have is eye watering- anyone else? I did get lax with eye drops and eye patch since I have such great function of my eye but wonder if I need to bring those back. Thanks! I am sorry, my eye was relatively dry during my spell.  It took quite a while (almost exactly 90 days) before I began healing, but thankfully my eyelids were the first thing to return and that happened basically overnight on approximately day 92 or so.  My eye was very dry the whole time.\n\n\nNOW, however, I have developed synkinesis, and my face sometimes confuses my eye and mouth functions.  If I am really enjoying a meal, for example, my mouth may water but I will also end up weeping from my \"BP eye\" lol. I have to dab my eye frequently.  Annoying to me but not bothersome to others, NBD overall.  My eyelid will also involuntarily blink while chewing, sometimes. It is common for us, unfortunately!\n\nFollow your doctor's advice. I suggest gentle therapy like light massage and exercises in the mirror.  Rather than things like electronic stimulation or vigorous massage.  Just IMO.  I believe I permanently damaged my face (or otherwise prevented it from healing) by massaging too roughly while my poor nerves were trying to regrow, or I shocked the shit out of them, or both.  I stalled out at about 85%, and that was over a year ago. Again, just my single anecdote.  the exact thing happened to me! I went to the optometrist and she said that although unnoticeable, our eyelid may still not have the strength to completely close when we blink so our eye produces tears to prevent the eye from drying (something along those lines, I forgot some of what she said). In my case, the consistent eye watering lasted about 3 weeks. I am 100% recovered now and wish you the same! :)", "Not a plea, just want to word vomit.

I thank Covid and wearing a mask...harder to tell when you cannot see my face. I am single...behind in life, not in the greatest of shape, and now I fret that I will be working with a half-working face the rest of my years, and all that kind of sucks....but the absolute worst part....I love music and I just wish I could whistle again. \ud83d\ude19\ud83d\ude1f I agree with being thankful for the COVID mask mandate while I had BP. My fear is getting it again and not having a mask to hide behind next time. God bless! I deal with some ailments that have diminished me and limited the amount of things I can do in life as well.

Unfortunately at this point, I have not had any recovery. The only thing that has really changed is that my \u201cbad\u201d eye has been tearing more over the past 5 or so days, and I would say it is increasing. I have a single tear drop down my face probably 2-3 times per day at this point. Does anyone know what this means? Could it be a sign of recovery? I am not understanding.  Are u tearing more or less from your infected side? My affected eye is tearing more The lack of muscle tone in your lower eyelid can distort the size, shape, and position of the lower punctum, the opening of the canal ('tear duct') that connects your eyes and the inside of your nose (which is why we get a runny nose when we cry). Our eyes can also respond to dryness by tearing up more. This can be exacerbated by a change in the humidity in your environment, such as you might experience when the seasons change, or changes in your nasal cavity, which might be a response to changes in humidity or a side-effect of having a 'stuffy' nose.\n\nIf your sinuses are gunked up - if none of those tears are draining down into your nasal cavity, especially if they previously \\*have\\* been doing so - a tear duct that is blocked or unreachable due to changes in morphology (or both) is a likely culprit. Thank you, this is helpful! Your tearing has to do with u not being able to close you eye. I know when u blink u think I re closing ur eye but u are not. That is why it is tearing. Record yourself and u can see your eye is not closing completely. There are no tell tail signs of improvement. If it bothers u a lot I recommend u use an eye patch. Yeah, it does not close when I blink. It is just odd because it is been stuck open for 4 weeks and just started tearing about 5 days ago. That is really weird. Please use an eye patch or tape your eye closed when u go to sleep. Do not use visine it will really mess up your eye. Hope u get better soon. I tape every night and use lubricating eye drops like TheraTears \ud83d\ude0a thanks so much! My eye doctor told me to put eye drops in every hour till it started feeling better. That happened to me. I found that this was only triggered from being in the light. I found much relief with hanging around in dark areas until I felt better. This happened to me.  I ended up seeing a neurological ophthalmologist and he said it can, in fact, be a sign of improvement.  As the older cells are replaced by new healthier cells it can cause tearing. That is good to know! I still have not had any other signs of recovery, so we will see. I am a little over 5 weeks out.", "What exercises should I be doing? Hi! I was not informed of any facial exercises from my doctor that I should be doing. A little confused because I am seeing a lot of people recommend them. What things should I be doing and when should I start. It is day 5 for me. \n\nPlease tell me this gets easier, I am really struggling mentally with this. \n\nLots of these stories are really scary. Day 5 is too early for exercise if you can schedule an appointment with a physical therapist, and things i did was take vitamins for healing nerves i rested and meditated to avoid stress which can slow recovery, most exercises can be found on youtube as well as massages i visited healthq a youtube channel that really helped with exercises and massages also just eat healthy and focus on recovery ik its scary with people talking about percentages of recovery but i really didnt notice changes until 4 months it is hard but you can get through it but yea it is way too early for you to start exercising just do ice and heat compresses and i would honestly recommend seeing a physical therapist Okay, thank you so much! When did you start doing exercises 12 weeks i just wanted to heal before i did anything to avoid synkinesis Did you massage your face before that? Yes and I used a heat compress pain and to avoid the muscles from tightening I was never informed about facial exercises by any doctor. I only found out by reading online comments here on reddit. So I cannot say what exact exercises to do. I can only recommend practicing your typical everyday facial expressions (a smile, pouting, raising eyebrows, squinting, etc). I also practiced my speech. Particularly words that start with the letters p, b, and f. Massaging definitely helps!", "Day 5 of Bells Palsy/ Day 2 of Methylprednisolone Day 4 wrapped up about 4 hours later than it normally would because of the side effects of the steroid prescribed by my Dr. The symptoms of my Bells Palsy were minor compared to some of the experiences of others I had heard. I picked up my prescription Friday morning around mid day and took my first dose of steroids before I ate lunch. About an hour after taking that first dose I started to feel the effects of the steroids. Mainly I was just feeling a bit jittery, similar to when I drink too much coffee but, it seemed to help with the inflammation. Slowly throughout the day as I was working on some basic facial exercises (Trying to smile, furrowing my brows, trying to flare my nostrils) I notice that my range of motion was improving. I feel like the steroids are working! My condition has improved quite a bit in the past couple of days, the advice I had gotten from a few of you in this sub was helpful and your kind words improved my outlook on the situation. I am know that I am not fully healed and it will probably take some time before I am. My main focus going forward will be to better manage my stress levels. Upon reflection of all the events that may or may not have lead up to this compression on my facial nerve, I do think that this was triggered by stress.

I was diagnosed almost two weeks and was immediately put on steroids and antivirals. The steroids did a pretty good job because now that I have finished taking them, I am in a fair amount of pain.

I am currently sitting at almost exactly two weeks, to the very hour, of the onset of my Bell's Palsy. The right side of my face is still entirely paralyzed, from hairline to chin.  I can keep my eyelid closed so long as my other eye is also closed, so thankfully I have not had TOO much trouble sleeping.   Otherwise, life has been rather difficult, I am afraid.  My job is literally to speak to people, face-to-face, all day.  It is only mildy embarrassing, but totally exhausting.  Emotionally, I feel better now that I am done with the Prednisone.  I was on a 14 day tapering dose, first administered the day I had symptoms.  I was also on a 10 day course of an antiviral, I forget the name.\n\nMy hearing is mostly normal, but some louder sounds really bother me now. My dog barking, for instance, hurts my ears now (both of them...).  Same with stacking dinner plates(?).\n\nMy vision is blurry.  I still cannot tell it is because I cannot blink, or for some other reason.  I am terrified my vision has been permanently damaged.\n\nThe day I was diagnosed, the tip of my tongue went numb.  I assumed I had burned it on coffee or something.  That was it for hours.  And then my lip went, and from there the rest of my face went so quickly I ended up at urgent care for a stroke panel.  Was sent home with this diagnosis (\"or maybe a stroke, but we do not know without a CT scan, and we do not have a scanner here, so either you have Bell's or you need to drive yourself to an ER\").  Could still move my forehead and most of my eye.  Woke up the next morning with a completely stone face.  Total bummer.\n\nWent to the ER two days later when I swear the left side also started to go numb.  CT Scan this time (friggin weird as Hell), no concerns in my skull.\n\nAnywhoo: two weeks out, totally dead face still.  I know it is very early, so I am doing my best to stay positive.\n\nWill try to update.  \n\n Take B12 that will help with the recovery ! I have been, thank you! B complex (if that is not the same, please correct me), fish oil, zinc, CBD. Some ibuprofen or acetaminophen here and there.\n\nI appreciate the advice. For me I was super lucky and was stone faced for about two weeks and then I started noticing recovery, I was 80% by the four week mark and totally recovered by the 7 week mark, keep your head up! Stay strong bud. It sucks, but things _will_ get better. Also: CBD and/or THC helped me a ton of you live in a state with access to medical or recreational cannabis.  CBD does not make you get high at all. Every team I took it my face would start twitching. Worry not, PLENTY of THC, too. Haha. I massage a CBD topical around my ear and take a dropper of a tincture 1-3 times a day.  And then THC in various forms once I am home for the evening.\n\nHonestly have not seen any results from any of the cannabinoids, yet. But it is too early for anything to be working, obviously.\n\nThanks so much for the encouragement!\n\n Great, thanks so much! Haha, nice. We will, I was not an avid user myself when it happened but was never against it is use both medically and recreationally. Honestly, you are going to hear a lot about different things that helped people from accupuncture to chiropractic and more. I really just think that it most likely goes away on its own and whatever the person was trying at the time gets attributed for the cure. The best you can do is manage your pain and comfort. I believe this is actually the case, also.  Time, more than anything, seems to be the only common denominator here, but I will keep trying all the other things as well.  Cannot hurt, anyway.\n\nWell, I am avoiding acupuncture for the moment.  I was prepared to start that soon, but I have seen all the suggestions AGAINST it on this sub so I will hold off on that for a while I think. So I am a bit new to BP. My boyfriend was diagnosed a week ago. It is affecting Both sides of his face, and reading these comments, it sounds like you experienced it in both sides as well? Today we could finally see a tiny amount of movement in his left side when he tries to smile. I read it can affect both sides in rare cases, just looking for people that experienced it in the same way. Thanks, and this sub has been very helpful No, I ultimately did not get it on both sides.  I think I was having a sort of panic attack and kind of imagined some numbing on my \"good side,\" because I was worried about stroke, but once they confirmed I was not having a stroke, I calmed down and the stuff I was imagining went away.", "DO I HAVE BELL'S PALSY Hi everyone, on September 17 night of Friday when I went to sleep I noticed that my right eye did not close too much when I blinked and when I woke up I noticed that I could not smile properly but I just ignored it because maybe just because of braces but at night I checked my face again I noticed when I laughed my right face had no reaction so I searched on google and came out here that I might have bell's palsy.\n\nI dont know if i have it or not i still have taste buds, i still have the feeling on my right side face, it didnt affect my ear but on saturday afternoon i have got a headache and then i drooled when i tried to sleep.\n\nIm sorry im bad at english im 16 years old and im from the Philippines its been 2days and i hope i dont have it. This sounds like it could be Bell\u2019s palsy. Onset of symptoms happens over 1-2 day but can get progressesly worse. If you can get to a doctor ASAP that would the best thing you could do. The earlier you get medication the better changes you have for an early and quick recovery. thank you so much i will try and tell my guardian tonight so i can a medication. Yes you have to start treatment within 3 days of the onset of symptoms for the meds to be effective. Meaning, if you noticed them Sept 17, you have until Sept 20 to begin medication.\n\nDo not wait until tonight to tell your guardian. Tell them now. but theyre off to go somewhere and theyre going home tonight Get to a doctor and insist on an MRI to rule out anything else \u2026..I was told by 3 doctors for over a year that I had Bells Palsy without having had a MRI and finally got an MRI after getting to a 4th doctor who had the practice of making sure he was making a informed diagnosis .  I actually had a cancerous  tumor in a  salivatory gland.  Thank god I persisted and found out.   Good luck.\ud83d\ude4f thank you for informing me", "Day 3 - Twitching Hello, I got diagnosed 2 days ago. I was on a very stressful work bender, and woke up numb on the left side of my face. I thought i had just slept badly or slept on it... until that night when i realised my face was lopsided. The next morning I went to the doctors and got diagnosed and put on Prednisone within 24 hours.\n\nThe next day (yesterday) I woke up and my face had worsened, and now my face has become totally lopsided. I had an acupuncture session following some advice i found on this subreddit... and my face started to twitch on the bad side on my eyelids, below my eyelids, my nostril which is totally paralysed and also around my bottom and top lip. My face is twitching heaps even today and I am confused if this is normal? I still cannot move it. But I found that today I can actually open up my mouth to eat food instead of dribbling all over myself!\n\nThanks guys! I think the twitching is a good sign. You should definitely not do anymore acupuncture as there is no evidence that it works. Twitching might be a sign that nerves are coming back. While this is happening, try not to force your muscles to move as this could lead synkinesis. what do you mean by 'force your muscles to move' i am trying to do faces like kissy face etc to test mobility - should i stop doing this? I hope so :( Really. Today marks 3 months and for me the twitching was a prelude to marked improvement. I welcome it. Wish I had more of it. Yes absolutely stop those efforts. I know it feels like you have to \u201cworkout\u201d those muscles to help recovery or you just want to check your progress but it is not helping. Your muscles are not working because the nerves got cut off due to BP. If you try to move them now, you are essentially teaching the nerves around the affected area to help move those muscles. This is not a good thing as the surrounding nerves will continue to fire when your original nerves eventually comes back. This is called synkinesis and is the most common lingering effect of BP. I personally have this and my lip and neck muscles move when I try to lift my eye brows. \n\nMy advice is rest/sleep as much as you can, do some mild running/workouts everyday, and cut out all substances (even coffee). You will be back to normal in no time and take this as a warning sign and try to lead a healthier lifestyle. Good luck! I second this. Sounds like you have a mild case and just rest and ride it out.  All that acupuncture stuff is more likely than not just coincidental. Most people (not me) get better within a few weeks on their own, and I think by week 2 people get impatient and try acupuncture which becomes the \"cure\". thank you so much for your advice and kindness, i really appreciate it! Yeah ok this makes sense, thank you :) Any updates on your condition? Just diagnosed 56 hours ago, no acupuncture but having twitching as well.

Just droopy face &amp; it did not used to be that way. ", "Husband just diagnosed, doctors are not doing anything? He is at a military hospital and they basically said \u201cit will clear up in three days if not come back\u201d. Based on what I am reading here this does not sound right? Does not he need medications asap for the best chance of recovery? Will not waiting three days decrease his chances? I am feeling frustrated that the doctors will not do anything and that is the only hospital he is allowed to go to. They should have prescribed him and antiviral and a steroid at the least. He was just discharged like three minutes ago. Should I insist he go back and push for it? I am not convinced they will give it to him. This is not the first time this hospital has neglected to do anything about health issues he is experiencing. I am worried he is going to have permanent loss of function due to their negligence. If this just started happening like a day or two ago then yes go back in there and raise hell the steroids work better the faster you get them if it is been a more than a few days the steroids are less  likely to help. Also it can take much longer than three days to heal my symptoms started on the 12th of July I only have about 60% recovery so far. He just woke up this morning with it. Im going to to push him to go back and make a stink. This is the only hospital he is allowed to go to I wish he could just go somewhere else When I was trying to go to urgent cares and stuff they would not even see me I went to the er and told them I thought I was having a seizure. That got me treatment lol. Yes. Go back for antiviral and steroids.  The sooner you take them the better results. I have found doctors to be maddingly unhelpful with Bell\u2019s Palsy. (And I like my doctors!) \n\nMine told me two weeks and I will be completely normal. I am on my fourth week now. It is a long recovery. \n\nLook for help here, this is a great place, then YouTube and Instagram have a lot of people that have had this and can fill you in. \n\nOnce you are done with the doctor, get some supplies. You will need sensitive or delicate tape for his eye, Eyedrops, and I also take B-12. \n\nBest wishes for his recovery! I did the exact same as the other reply - I went to the accident and emergency ward, told them I might be having stroke and they triaged me. They figured it was bells and started me on steroids a few hours later. 3 weeks and full recovery. Do whatever you need to. Good luck! It is important to start the medications as soon as possible for a higher chance of full recovery. \nI ended up gong to the ER saying I was afraid I was having a stroke and they immediately gave me the medication and explained it was Bell\u2019s palsy", "Facial exercises... Yay or nay? I have got Bell's on both sides. One worse than the other but I can now move the bad side at least a little. Are facial exercises worth doing? It helps... a lot. I got it on one side. By after doing the exercises vigorously for one week, I recovered quickly. Which facial exercises do you do? I was diagnosed 3 weeks ago, and am barely seeing improvement Cant remember. It was on YouTube. I think it was an Indian or a middle Eastern lady I never went fully flaccid on the affected side of my face, but I have been doing exercises twice a day since I was diagnosed. I like to think that they have helped, but definitely do not force your face to move in ways that it does not want to, otherwise you might end up with synkinesis. I would talk to your doctor about it first, just in case. Look up laurel liu (acupuncturist) on tiktok/instagram/youtube. She shows some great ones for assymetry, and her exercises have helped someone heal an impressive amount from bells palsy. I have been doing them a lot too lately, since I had it on my right side 11 years ago and 5 days ago got it on my left. \n\nAcupuncture has helped me a ton. My brother had bells palsy and if you go soon, it can cure 100%. Cannot even see it on him!", "Does heat help? I got diagnosed today and started on prednisone. One of the drs I spoke with suggested heat and massage to the affected side. This temporarily relieves my facial drooping. Has anyone else heard of this? Or could it be a possible misdiagnosis? My physiotherapist worked with ice to \"stimulate\" the muscles. It worked and my paralysis only lasted for about a month. I do not know about heat, but massages DEFINITELY help. Heat = increased blood flow. Massaging will also heat up your skin/muscles and increase the blood flow.\n\nThis makes muscles easier to move, and will in turn help you with regaining control.\n\nMassage and/or apply heat before doing face exercises, and stretch out your skin once you are done with the face exercises. I was told by the doctor that having my face hit cold wind from an air conditioner would paralyze it again. I did massage and it worked after a couple months. Google face exercises and do everything you can to stimulate those nerves and muscles Is there a good place online that I can go to for exercises? Thanks! I am hoping to do everything I can to get through this as soon as possible There is some youtube videos, but they all differ a bit in terms of exercises, time and repetitions. I personally got some sheets of paper with pictures of exercises and instructions from my doctor and followed those. If you want, I can share them with you. Can you share the exercises with me? Hey, sorry for the late reply! Turns out I had thrown out the pieces of paper I had with my face exercises on after I would made a full recovery. But after searching the web for quite a bit I was able to find it :)\n\n\n\nIt is in danish though, but the pictures are good, and the exercises are varied and cover the muscles nicely. You can copy paste the text into a translator if you want :)\n\nI recommend massaging the face before starting the exercises.\n\nHold each exercise for 3-4 seconds while trying your hardest to make the grimace, and help with your fingers when needed. After the 3 seconds, relax your face completely for 3-4 seconds and repeat the exercise two more times. Do this for all the exercises.\n\nEnd by relaxing your face and stretching the skin as shown on page 10. I recommend stretching both the normal and the paralysed side at the same time.\n\nDoing the massasing, exercises and stretching will take about 15 minutes from start to finish. Try to do this 3 times a day, and also feel free to do some exercises whenever you feel like it during the day. I would often do the blinking and smiling exercises when I was just relaxing and watching TV and stuff like that.\n\nOnce again, sorry for the late reply. I hope you find some of this useful :)", "Should i do acupunture Hi ive had bells palsy for 8 months now and i was wondering if i should do acupunture or if it is too late for me to get any effect. My mouth got some movement back in desember but no movement above the eye I started acupuncture the week I was diagnosed and continued with treatment twice a week! I am about 9 weeks in now and have seen a lot of improvement almost to a complete recovery. I was told by my acupuncturist that it is best to do it sooner than later and I truly think it helped me with recovery! That said, I would give it a shot if I were you, it cannot hurt! Might as well try a few sessions and see if it helps! \n\nI would also recommend cupping, I did that along with the acupuncture! It was not a very pleasant experience (and looks pretty gross, to be honest) but I think it helps get then blood moving and improves function! \n\nGood luck! \ud83c\udf40\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc  I personally did it for six months and though I did recover somewhat I think I would have recovered that amount regardless.\n\nThat said who knows? If you can afford it I would definitely try.  I have had bells for over 3 years. Got about 80 percent back. I did some accupunture and even connected an electrical current to the needles that shocked the muscles a bit. I honestly do not know if It helped me though. Anything is worth the shot to be honest. Total waste of time and a complete scam. why? ive seen some people saying that it does work  I tried it when I had Bell's. Then I looked up acupuncture on the NIH's website. It is completely unproven to provide any relief and is considered to be a scam . Considering most people recover completely within 3 months as far as they can do (barring permanent damage), I would venture the acupuncture is more of a placebo than a cure tbh.  I recommend trying it. I was making little to no progress with my healing and pain. After a few sessions my pain was a lot less and I was able to drink out of an  actual cup without dribbling!! Make sure the person you see is well trained and from a reputable institution. The worst thing that could happen is you get an hour or so to relax and de-stress. I hear it helps but I did not do it. Smoking weed helped me in my opinion, it made me not stress, think about it, or feel the pain in my face from the steroids. It comes back slowly. My mouth recovered first Acupunture is a great treatment if youre in the hands of a professional.\nI recomend you visit n inform you about the different treatments. Once I go for anxiety n I surf over the web to find a good doctor in acupunture for me. This page is good n you can inform yourself about many aspects and treatments you have in acupunture.

In need of advice/support from others who have experienced similar. Writing again to see if anybody might be able to offer some advice on my current situation... as I am still without any real solutions after 3 ER + 2 walk-in visits.\n\n((\n\n----\n\n**An update and continuation**: My doctor confirmed the original diagnosis of Bell's Palsy to be correct. The walk-in clinic that I went to when I began experiencing tingling in my face, and extreme inner-ear pain caught and acted quickly on my diagnosis before any paralysis was seen or took place. Fortunately I avoided any paralysis... but they prescribed me on such a high dose of Prednisone (50mg). Having never been on Prednisone before, I had no idea what I was in for.\n\nWhile on the Prednisone - I felt absolutely crazy... I had little to no appetite. could not focus, could not stop being light-headed, and my hormones were a wreck (I was randomly breaking down crying... often out of nowhere.) My entire body just felt _off_. After a few more visits to the ER, they told me to stop taking the Prednisone cold turkey. They seemed shocked that I was given such a high dose... but said I should get through the side effects within a week or so. \n\nWeek 2 flies by and still felt like garbage. Beginning of week 3 I go back to the ER because at that point I needed answers on what I could do to feel atleast a little like myself. I was worried they missed something. I was breaking down crying constantly, which is somewhat of an anomaly for me (I have never done this before... surely the Prednisone did a number on me.) The ER doctor told me that I was likely suffering from adrenal insufficiency due to the Prednisone... and that my body would simply need to recover through rest and relaxing. \n\nAnd as much as I explained that I have never had messed up hormones or anxiety like this prior to taking the Prednisone.... the last ER doctor I saw kept pushing me to have my GP prescribe me anxiety medication... almost hinting that my issue was an anxiety disorder, and not treating the anxiety as a side effect to the Prednisone. Extremely frustrating.\n\n---\n\nThis all brings me to my main questions:\n\n(**If prescribed Prednisone**)\n\n- If prescribed Prednisone, did you experience your hormones being an absolute wreck, and your body feeling like garbage non-stop while on it, and after coming off of it?\n- (if applicable) What dosage of Prednisone were you given, and how long did you take it?\n- How long did it take for you to begin feeling more like yourself?\n- Was there anything you took, or foods you ate that seemed to help?\n\n\nThanks Cannot exactly remember the name of the steroids I got here in Ireland but it sure messed me up for weeks. Turns out I was given an extremely high dosage. Experienced everything from mood swings to even paranoia. I was given the gift of CBD oil and am genuinely surprised how fantastic it is been working. Have not had a twitchy face of spasms either. It is helped me to completely relax and can even sleep at night now, after 10+ years of insomnia. I was on prednisone for 10 days, and for the first few days it felt like it was not working, and then after that and once I was finished the 10 days, my body felt completely out of wack. Its a motherfucker of a drug, and can mess up your body a bit but once it is gone you are going to be alright afterwards. Just remember paracetamol and warm/cold compress are your friends if you need them, and just get plenty of rest 60mg Predisolone for 6 days. After 6 days it finished and I stopped. I am now on day 10. The drug made me get pretty anxious but otherwise it did not really affect me. I was on 20mg of Prednisone 3x a day for a week. I was always sweating, constantly tired from not being able to sleep well, I was dehydrated from all the sweating, hungry and had mood swings. After I was off of them, my muscles were incredibly sore for no reason (like I had not worked out or done anything strenuous). It took a few days to a week to feel normal again. 50mg for 5 days; mostly sweaty, a little sad, but no massive side effects.\n\nthat being said, I have heard awful stories about prednisone. for many people, it is truly a nightmare.\n\nI am sorry you are going through this. hopefully some other folks will have good advice on how to deal. Hello,\n\nI still have my meds empty cups and says 20MG for the Prednisolone. \n\nI did notice once I stopped taking prednisone I started to feel pain on my ear and behind my head on the side that has BP. It lasted about 4-5 days and while it was manageable it was severe for two of the five days. Now I am completely fine.\n\nI was on prednisone for 7 days 3x a day, I would take it after I ate as suggested and drank lots of water throughout the day.\n\nI would suggest trying a few things like acupuncture, drinking milk before bed, try CBD oil it helps with BP and anxiety. B12 is also good, I take one a day now. yoga and meditation can help too.\n\nMost importantly it is important to relax and not get stressed. I go on walks now everyday.\n\nif you need someone to talk to, PM or message me on Discord @ Ichi#0009. On my 3rd day of Prednisone. Having chills and hot flashes. Sweating a lot. Headache. Jittery.

After reading through how BP can last for weeks or months I was wondering would I need to meet with a personal physician to get more medication or is it normal to stop taking meds and allow for healing after 7 days. \n\nThanks for the help! Usually a 7 or 10 day course is enough to reduce inflammation of the 7th cranial nerve to promote healing. You should follow up with a neurologist though, and communicate if you have any pain. Facial pain is usually met with muscle relaxers or gabapentin (in my experience). Awesome thanks! The soonest appointment I can get with a neurologist is the 28th so I will see what happens by then. That Is alright. It takes some time. Its not going to magically disappear by then. But take it easy. Stress and exhaustion do make it visibly worse. Dont try to work the muscles too much the first few weeks either. They got to rest and heal. Understood. I have been moving them a bit today but I will hold off on that. Also another reason is that those are antibiotics and 10days is the sweet spot for destroying a possible bacteria that caused an infection and the reason it should not be takeb for weeks is due to it nature of not  discriminating against bad bacteria in the good bacteria in your gut and prolonged use could be a very serious problem Makes sense, seems like they gave me a pretty high dose also, I would not want the negative side effects I was reading about. Good to know. I will just relax and let me body do it is thing. I did not do facial exercises until I was 3 weeks out from my diagnosis. Yikes, I had no idea I should be waiting way longer. It is my first day since diagnosis so hopefully did not do too much damage. Are you healed now or still recovering? It is also important to take probiotics after a regimen of antibiotics to make sure your culture can return to normal as quickly as possible. I simply switched to Activia for my smoothies, but you can get probiotics in pill form in the vitamin area of your pharmacy/grocery store if yogurt is not your thing. Good luck on a quick and full recovery! Different person here, but personally my doctor advised me to start the face exercises day 1, and I recovered 99% within a month with no side effects like synkinesis or similar.\n\nEveryone heals differently though, but personally I felt that doing the face exercises helped my recovery, and made it easy to track my progress.\n\nAnd regarding your question in the post about whether to expect your BP to get worse, mine got gradually worse the first 2 days or so, and then reached the peak of paralysis. Since you are on day 5, and if it has not seemed to change during the last couple of days, yours probably will not get worse than it is.\n\nAnd whether you need an eye patch or not also depends on how bad your BP is. Personally the eyelid on my afflicted side would only close a tiny little bit if I tried closing both eyes and relaxing, but even then it would only halfway close. In regular day to day situations where I tried blinking with both eyes like usual, my afflicted eyelid would not close at all. So for me an eyepatch was needed when going outside and when sleeping. When I was just inside my home I would not wear the patch, but would just use plenty of eye drops and blink manually by helping close my eye with my fingers. Thank you for all this great info! Today is my third day and it feels a lot less heavy or numb. Still not much movement but it does not seem worse if anything maybe a little better as my eye seems and feels a little more relaxed. Whoops, I do not know how my mind read somewhere that you were diagnosed 5 days ago. I think I might have had two tabs with different BP threads open at the same time and mixed things up.\n\nBut great to hear that it is at least not been getting worse since diagnosis. But it will probably be a little while before you start seeing any real progress. But all that depends on a lot of variables, like age, general health, level of paralysis and also a bit of randomness.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have more questions though. In general, people here are very helpful, though you might get some conflicting advice sometimes, since people of course recommend whatever worked for them, which is of course also what I am doing, haha.\n\nBut regardless, good luck with your recovery :) Haha no worries! Thank you for taking the time to answer me and others. I will take you up on your offer if anything comes up! Thanks. Having this support means everything. I feel more positive and less alone. I have been taking a lot of vitamins b12, vitamin C, getting Turmeric soon, and eating the most healthiest things I can right now. I am 25, in pretty good health I think lol. Think it helps that I stopped smoking 3 months ago and have been actively taking better care of myself. Although this caught me off guard I feel fortunate to have this time to heal and really give myself the self care I have not. Feels like my body forcing me to now and I have to love it in a way I have never have before. Thanks!! Good tip! I love yogurt. Great attitude, keep it up :) I doubt you did any damage. It was suggested to me to wait. \nAfter the ER visit, I went to my regular family physician and an eye doctor. Then, after googling regarding how others healed quicker, I decided to do acupunture.  It was that doctor who showed me the proper exercises.  I am almost healed completely and that is huge because I had a severe case. I am highly considering acupuncture. I do not think I have a severe case from what I have seen and I feel it could really bridge that gap for me. Do you think I should go the acupuncture route the first week or after? So happy for you and your recovery so far!! That is amazing. I highly recommend acupuncture. I was diagnosed with BP on November 25 (likely caused by pregnancy) and started acupuncture on December 1. I have had 5 acupuncture sessions so far and have recovered 85-90%. I was on prednisone and the anti-viral for 7 days and started taking vitamins B-6 and B-12 three days after BP onset. I used an antibiotic eye ointment and eye patch at night. I do not need the eye patch any longer. That is amazing! I will definitely schedule an acupuncture session as soon as possible. I waited about 3 weeks out. I kept hoping it would heal on its own, but progress was slow to none. ( I had this condition one other time. It was mild and healed quickly on its own.) I am here for you anytime if you need to talk. Something you can do right now to ease any pain and help circulation is to apply warm compresses to the affected areas. Yes, after reading more on it. I see it is better to get it as soon as possible. I am finding that at night and after naps is the hardest times for me right now. As I wake up and remember it is still happening. Thank you, means a lot! I have a heating pad would that be good on the low setting? Sure. You can do that as well as using a warm, damp washcloth applied to the affected areas. Not at the same time, of course.  Moist heat does wonders. Thanks! I will get on that tonight. Eating anti-inflammatory foods is a good idea, too. Healing from the inside. Google a suggested food list will help with meal planning. I wish you the best and you are now on my prayer list for a speedy recovery.  God bless. \n( You may reach out anytime \ud83d\ude0a. ) Thank you for praying for me! God bless you! Praying for your full recovery and continued health as well! Have an amazing night or day depending on where you are \u2764\ufe0f I think not only does it work well for some people,  but it also gives those of us suffering from Bell's a sense of well-being knowing we are doing something proactive to help with the healing. Many thanks, my new friend.  \ud83d\ude00 I love that logic! I see how the mindset plays a big part in our recovery! Thanks much friend. Perfect! I was wanting a better meal plan and some exercise also. Great, I hope it works well for you, too, and that you will post updates! I absolutely will! And thanks :) That is not correct. Prednisone is a steroid and acyclovir is an antiviral.  The steroid is the main medication in that it reduces the inflammation of the nerve and slows down further damage.  You do not need to be on it for long for that to happen.\n\nThe antivirals have not had a lot of proof to work, but usually are prescribed out of caution. ", "4 months and 10 days later and movement is returning (bilateral) At the end of January I lost control of my left side, then two weeks later the right too.\n\nIt has not been fun at all, and I have been worried that I may never regain control (as a brass player I had to think about whether or not I would be able to return to it) but suddenly yesterday I began to notice movement.\n\nIt began with a taught feeling in my face around the corners of my mouth, like they were being stretched (obvs these bits had not moved much for a while) and went to have a look in the mirror. Both corners of my mouth could twitch, and today I can manage a teeny tiny smile.\n\nWanted to give some hope to any other bilateral sufferers and celebrate too Awesome news and I am happy for you!", "Just took my prednisone with my bedtime meds I am just glad my poor husband is away this weekend- I am NOT sleeping tonight. Cannot wait to be off this stuff. I had the same experience! It was terrible. I was up until 5:30am night after night. Eating pizza while watching I Love Lucy in the middle of the night. Or trying to eat pizza, as half my mouth was paralyzed and I could not taste right lol. It will get better!! Take it dah at a time. Three weeks and I was totally recovered. And only about a week of it was super rough. Ugh, so relatable. I am on a week of prednisone now and I am constantly ridiculously riled up/hyperactive. Third night in a row that I do not manage to sleep for more than 4-5 hours. I might ask my doctor about my dose tomorrow, do the same if you think you need to :) \n\nHang in there! Thanks! I am doing much better most of the time, but I will be talking to people and my face will decide that, nope, its not working anymore, and its back to slurring and making faces. Everytime I think I am making good recovery I take a few steps back. It is so frustrating! I am glad I have found this sub!! Thanks! I think I am mostly past my super rough part. But I will be in the middle of talking and my face will just quit. It is frustrating. I am just glad I found this sub! My doctor recommended taking steroids in the morning to try and minimise sleep disruption. Still barely ever felt tired That Is when I take mine. I accidentally took it at night, too.", "8 months review Got my bp Saturday after Thanksgiving I am 2020.  I feel like I am 70ish percent at the moment. I cannot whistle still. My smile still has not come back on my affected side.  I really never had eye issues.  If I do not smile \ud83d\ude01 you really cannot notice I have bp at all. When I do smile you can tell.  The left side of the face just is not pulling up as my right side.  I am getting muscle spasms on my left side chin area.  And occasionally some tingling around the corner of my mouth and lip.  The sensation is similar to going the dentist and getting their numbing shot with it numbing the nerve and also coming out of the numbing phase. \n\nHow long does it take for the mouth to get back to normal? It would be nice to have my face fixed before family pics.  \n\nSide note I apparently did get the coronavirus at some point iny past because I have the antibodies.  And coronavirus could have been what caused my bp.  I am also prediabetic.  I did change my diet drastically to lower my glucose levels because high insulin apparently can wreak havoc on the bodies nerves. \n\nYeah so 8 months in would likey face to smile again. Every case is individual. There is no set time line. Unfortunately, nerves are a slow heal. I am 9 months out and can just now smile.\n\nHere is what helped me. My case was severe so I waited 3 months to see what progress natural healing would provide. I also knew my nerves were damaged severely so I did not want to risk further damaging them by doing anything in the beginning.  Once I hit the 3 month mark, I started to receive acupunture.  It was a big help. I regained some movement. I used hot compresses to relieve pain. Then iced the swollen areas. \nNow, to really help with \"retraining \" the nerves, I follow the exercises on YouTube. A person named Dr. Jo instructs one on how to properly do them. \nYou at 8 months out -- far enough out from initial diagnoses to try to really exercise those nerves and muscles. Just be gentle and do not overdo.\n\nAdditionally, I have begun running on the treadmill and closely watching my sugar and salt intact. Too much of anything is not good and salt and sugar will mess with your pre-diabetic state. ( My husband is pre-diabetic, so I get the diet restrictions.)\n\nIt can be a long road to recovery but this community is here and we understand.  You can always DM me. I am here to listen. \u2764\n\nOh one last thing. Do things that bring you joy. It could be walking in the park, reading something inspirational, praying/ meditating, catching up with family/ friends, buying yourself flowers or plants, going to your favorite restaurant etc... Be good to yourself while you are healing. Self-care and love will speed up healing. It is true.\n\nThe ER doctor told me I may never recover. Guess what? I am recovering. Everyday I look more like my former self. You will get there, too, my friend.", "Stage of recovery at 3 1/2 months Hi all, I hope everyone is doing well. As the title says, I am a few months into Bell\u2019s palsy recovery. The onset of symptoms was relatively severe, however, I was mostly recovered at 3 weeks. Currently, I still cannot blink correctly in the affected side, my eye lid closes about 1/4-1/3 of the way. Fortunately, I can close my eye all the way though. I still get that weird inner-ear sensation when scratching my face too, but my sensitivity to sound is negligible. I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience as it feels like my recovery has stalled out after about a month. I am really tired of having to carry around eye drops and not being able to wear contacts. I also wonder if people think I am constantly blinking at them lol. I have an appointment with a neurologist in February, but would really like to see some improvement before then. \n\n\nBTW if anyone is early on from the onset of symptoms, I HIGHLY recommend CBD. It was fantastic at calming discomfort and pain.\n\nWishing you all well, IA Another longer term person here! Hi!\n\nI am at more than 6 months and my eye still will not completely close. I am seeing a neurofacial rehab person and hoping that will help. \n\nIt is hard to go through this and have doctors just kind of shrug about what to do. \n\nHoping you continue to recover. Hang in there!", "Hello guys..I am freaking out I guess with Bell\u2019s palsy. I got diagnosed last Monday and I know I have been reading that it takes time but it is hurting me so bad emotionally. I feel like I cannot socialize, smile, and laugh and I hate it. Any tips on fast recovery ?  I was diagnosed last Tuesday. I have been doing nightly facial massage after washing my face. It makes me feel better. I can see my cheek move a little more and can close my eye a fraction more than a few days ago. I went back to work on Saturday it is been emotional for me too. Stay strong it will get better and do not forget your eye drops! I swear using a full spectrum CBD oil and liquid vitamin B complex helped me. I did no massage. I am 100% recovered How did you use the CBD oil ? You just applied it to the face ? That is so good for the recovery \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc Yes my eye has gotten so much better to after massages. Thanks for your input \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude0a I took it orally. They do make a topical kind for pain also that you can massage on your skin. My pharmacist recommend just taking it orally since I was not in a ton of pain I would not need the topical one. \n\nWithin 15 minutes of taking it I could feel my nerves start twitching on my bad side which for me was a sign of healing and my nerves trying to work again. \n\nI also tried sticking to a diet of non inflammatory foods. Also try not to freak out even though it is hard. I regret stressing out the way I did. I cried like everyday and it is all I could think about. I only left the house like once. (Was not working, I was diagnosed a week after having my baby) It just takes time to heal. My doctor said that everyone she saw with it made a full recovery. I hope yours is quick, mine was about 4 weeks Yes! I have stayed in bed and became so antisocial. I recently had a graduation and I felt like I could not be happy probably cause I could not even smile. But yeah I hope  I have a quick recovery also Good to know. Idk why I have not thought about CBD oil. Thanks for the idea \ud83d\udca1 Hey! Honestly you get used to it. I was diagnosed 4 months ago and am only about 60% or so recovered. I did not see any improvement in the first 2 months or so. At first I also did not want to leave the house and cried a lot, but eventually I learned to deal with it and barely even noticed it anymore if I did not look into a mirror. Like others here I massage my face and I also started taping it (you can look up \u201cfacial paralysis kinesiology tape\u201d on YouTube for tutorials on how to tape it). I think the taping is helping the most. Good luck! Your welcome! I (25m) got diagnosed with it when I was 10 years old and I had the same reaction. Its been 15 years, and I am only recovered only 75% of movement on the left side of my face. I struggled for years having low self esteem and often hated taking pictures because of my smile. Through the years, I embraced it and grew to love it. I have had women come up to me and tell me I have a beautiful smile and that is the most attractive feature about me. You are beautiful no matter what happens to you. Embrace it, grow from it, and love it.\n\n As far as exercises go, do facial massages and CBD oil helps as well. YouTube was a great source for finding exercises. I have heard some people do acupuncture as well. I was diagnosed with BP 3 weeks ago and I am just starting to get my smile back. I did acupuncture 3 times a weeks along with facial massages and facial exercises as much as possible. I also got b12 injection every other day and started doing yoga to help with my stress. It is not an easy recovery but trust me it gets better. Surround yourself by positive people and do not give up! BP is only temporary! I just got it last weekend! I am searching for answers as well. Okay yes let me know. I have been trying everything Can I smoke weed or do you recommend CBD? Most be people told me smoking weed was better but I could not cause it made me to paranoid so I just used the CBD How are you using the cbd? How much of each and how often? I use the oil to massage my facial muscles. Not sure exactly... I took 1000mg of CBD three times day. But it depends what the dosage says on the bottle. I recommend talking to the pharmacist they could tell you better", "Just got diagnosed at 19 Woke up yesterday with the right side of my face feeling weak/ numb and the right side of my tongue not being able to taste anything and ended the day going to the ER and getting diagnosed + prescribed steroids and antivirals. I was very surprised and confused as to how I could have gotten BP, but I am thankful to have found this sub to read other people\u2019s stories and advice. Hoping for a quick recovery. \n\nI saw a comment on one of these threads about taking B12 along with the prescribed medicine to speed up recovery. Can anyone else speak to that and its effectiveness? If anything, B12 is not going to worsen your condition. It is all I can say. Truthfully, no medication has been proven to work for all cases except for prednisone. I took B12 just to be safe, and while I cannot say my recovery was related to that, I did get all my face movement back within a month and a half. \nBe sure to get plenty of massaging and exercising on your face as well \u2014 those are muscles and they need to be stimulated. \nAll in all, I can only wish you good luck. I have no experience with vitamin B12. I just took steroids and antivirals and did the whole dose. I rested up and I recovered completely (took 8 months for a full recovery but it was not bothersome after 4 weeks). You are young and have a very good chance of recovery!  I know it is hard and frustrating waiting for improvement - but just hang in there and do not try anything crazy/untested would be my advice! Yow what do you think the cause of bell\u2019s palsy in your face? like before it happened what did you feel like there something pain your head or discomfort without pain?

Both are truly awful. \n\n# Why am I posting?\n\nAfter diagnosis, I came to Reddit to read the experiences of others and for encouragement. Being here really helped. So I decided to make a guide for recovering from facial paralysis. It is everything I wish I knew at the start, and things that might help. It is not medical advice but more of a mindful approach to getting better.\n\n**Here it is:** (\n\nYou will find:\n\n* Some stats about Bell Palsy\n* What I wish I was told\n* 7 things you can do while recovering\n* 7 things you can do as a loved one\n\nI really hope it helps. Stay strong! I am nearly 3 months in and still cannot blink on one side of my face.  This is my second bout. The first time, which was a year ago now, I healed mostly in a month and was back to 100% not long after. \n\nThis second time  is proving very difficult because I had a very quick recovery first time around, and it is just not happening now.  In fact, I am terrified of it never getting better.    \nEach story is different, I read about quick healers and the never recovers, and it does not make it any easier. I am so sorry you are going through this nightmare again. I can only imagine what it would feel like to reach the one month mark with no visible improvement. I know these words might ring hollow for a while, but remember that you have conquered it once and you can do it again. Recovery might look different the second time but it is not impossible. Try to let that encourage you if you can.\n\nWas there anything from the first time that helped you get through it? I have had it multiple times, and it is taken over 5 months to recover every time. You have still got time. Stay strong! Thanks for the positive words. It is hard to explain to people how this condition eats at you mentally. Having done it once, getting it again was a huge kick in the teeth and it is hard to not feel completely defeated this time round. \n\nThe first time, I just tried to stay relaxed, exercise really helped my mental state, I took a few days away alone in a hotel with a book. I am completely with you. The thoughts can be so consuming. I can only imagine how hard it would be the second time. Processing what you are thinking and feeling is already hard, let alone putting them into words for others. Also, whoever said patience was a virtue probably did not live this nightmare. \n\nI really hope you see a little improvement with time. Please feel free to reach out if you need any positivity or if you need someone who will just listen openly. Ya, I think the more I read about others experiences, the more worried I become.  Some heal in a week, others, never.  I am past the 2 month mark now, and I am starting to worry.  I can close my eye a little easier, but no other improvements.\n\nHad dry eye issues as well, and then last Friday I found out I had a stroke in that eye as well.  So not only is my face fucked, now I have a permanent blind spot in my eye.  Gee, thanks, I hate it. I had this once before--when I was 18- years-olds. It was a quick heal and I had even forgotten about it. Now, many years later, it has happened again. \nI wondering what role stress plays in this. 3 months in myself, but it is my first time getting it. I would say I am about 30%. Getting around 5% recovery every 2 weeks and since the improvements are so marginal, they are difficult to see at times. Cannot blink yet since the muscles I need for it do not work at all yet and cannot do a full smile. When I picked my lips they lean towards one side and I still dribble when rinsing my mouth.\n\nCrossing my fingers because there is very little I can do. Just try to stay positive? At least my resting face is not bad at all.", "Just left the Facial Nerve Specialist at Stanford 6 months ago I was diagnosed with BP. So far, no progress. I have basically tried everything except for acupuncture at this point. \n\nHad a full MRI with and without contrast and nothing bad was found. \n\nYesterday I had a visit with a facial nerve specialist and his recommendation was to wait another 40-60 days and then possibly start with plastic surgery. Discussed putting a weight in my eye to get it to close again, tightening up my cheek so that the bottom of my eye is a bit tighter (it is very droopy right now). \n\nHas anyone on here had plastic surgery due to their BP? More importantly the weights in the eye lid surgery? Here is what I am talking about if you do not know\n\n Cannot comment on your question except to saw acupuncture (early in the recovery) seemed to be single the most helpful thing. It may be beyond the point of being helpful (it was going to be) for you, but if it was me I would try that before plastic surgery. Outside of cost, there is likely little downside. Accupuncture had helped me and I have it for 3 years with improvements. Now it is a smaller portion of my  face. My eye still sometimes does not shut and the production of tears can still be an issue. Other than that you would not know I had it or that I cannot feel so\nOf lower portion of my face. I wish you luck!!!!! Thank you for replying. I have now found a good recommendation for acupuncture in my city and plan to make an appointment with him soon. \n\nI did wish I would have tried it sooner. I was expecting this to go away in 4 weeks or less, which unfortunately was wrong. Right now I have zero controller of the entire right side. No lines in my forehead, no lip movement, dry eye that does not shut, etc. I am trying to stay positive but after yesterday\u2019s visit, I am starting to lose hope. \n\nI plan to try acupuncture in the next 30 days. I am rooting for you! It is such a scary experience and I never heard of it until it happened to me. Are you doing any daily facial massages as well? Also, many people recommended ginger and clove oil to massage over the affected area(s)of the face. I wish I had made a point to give some things suggested to me sooner. Maybe try some of these somewhat holistic approaches??? Not sure if that is what you could label it as. How are you doing mentally aside from the recent visit and mention of plastic surgery? Stress does not help anyone or any situation so, please,try not to worry. Just take it a day at a time. Your recovery is based on your body and your results will vary from others. That is okay because this is all about you. I have had the thought to try Botox to lift the side  of my lip that droops so I can feel normal and maybe not drool as o do front time to time. \ud83d\ude0bI hope that made you laugh \ud83d\ude39 at me a bit. Good luck okay! I want you to get better! Side note:\n\nMy side that is affected is the left side. If we stand side by side we make a whole functional face \ud83d\ude0aI hope it is not too soon to joke? I just want you to relax and know that no matter the outcome that you will be okay. We can definitely join forces to be whole again lol Yesssssssssss!!!!!!!! Hahahaha I am ready for it! \ud83d\ude02 I hope it helps! Botox in the eyelid helped me, I am almost going on 14 years. I found an ophthalmologist who was familiar with BP and using Botox to treat my issues. I feel B vitamins, Lysine, Zinc, Turmeric have also improved some of my movement. Make sure you keep hydrated, I had to have a gum graft since I was not salivating on my BP side causing gum damage. I wish you a speedy recovery and movement soon. Never had the weight in the eye but had it proposed to me as a possible solution. This person is an ENT in SF so likely not your doctor. I opted not to do it because it sounds like yours is a much more serious case. I am so sorry your recovery has been so stalled. I have had it 3x now and the idea of getting it again is just as scary as ever. I am really sorry you are dealing with this. I did acupuncture in the early stages, and I am about 95-98% recovered. \n\nAs someone else pointed out, there is no downside to trying it now. Like everyone else has mentioned, acupuncture helped. Even just with the pain and swelling I felt. I was lucky and got in early (like day 5). My acupuncturist is familiar with BP and said she had a patient who saw her after 3 years of living with BP. Her patient had progress but it was definitely gradual. \n\nEchoing the sentiment to try the holistic route since you have to wait for the surgery anyway. My partner was told to get surgery for his cubital tunnel but tried holistic and physical therapy and exercises and eventually recovered without having to get surgery for his cubital tunnel. \n\nGood luck and I hope you see improvement soon! Hey.\n\nare you referring to this FNC at Stanford?\n\n(\n\nDoes anyone know if the FNC does facial nerve transplants, to replace irreversibly damaged facial nerves ? hey. so glad to hear that you have recovered about 98%. \n\ndoes the acupuncturist inject needles into the paralyzed/weak facial muscles?\n\nWhat about acupuncture into the lips?\n\ndid it hurt?", "Better after rest? Hi all - after a rather terrifying visit to the ER with my 11 year old daughter we found out that she has Bell\u2019s Palsy. After waking up this morning, her affected eye seems a little bit more mobile but it now seems to be gradually going back to the same amount of movement (or lack of) that she had last night.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Could it be a result of rest or because she was patched overnight? \n\nI know in the grand scheme of things this is a silly question, but I got a little excited that she was recovering but now it seems she may not be.\n\nThanks for helping this anxious momma! Mine is totally like that! I am on day 10 I think? And when I am sleep deprived it is sooo bad- it get worse as the day goes on, right before bed when I am tired my face is super super droopy, and when I wake up it gets better. Thank you so much for sharing. I hate that you are going through this but it is reassuring to know that this is something that could be expected. It is hard to stay calm, which is what I need to do to help my daughter. I hope you recover quickly! You are a good parent! She will most likely recover 100%! It is scary but not as bad as it seems! Thank you so much. I felt a little ridiculous for taking her to the ER and having it be something relatively non-threatening, but watching her not blink and not be able to smile was just freaky! She, on the other hand, did not even notice anything was wrong. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f You are not ridiculous lol.

I have not experienced this yet, although I heard that people who have had bell's palsy in the past are more likely to experience it in the future.\n\nYou should probably make an appointment with your doctor.  Does the rest of your muscles still work normally?  My mouth and neck are sore and I cannot crack a big smile Just so anyone finding this is looking for advice about the same thing. Bell\u2019s can sever the ends of the trigeminal nerve. They are like little fingers and it trims them a bit at the ends if you do not get to the doctor quick enough or if your causal infection was severe. Once you have recovered from bell\u2019s, that damage can be permanent but without inflammation in the area, you may return to fully functional mobility. Should you experience inflammation in your face cheeks or neck from any illnesses, your bell\u2019s symptoms can return but should reside once the illness passes. Take care of your eye as the danger of corneal damage is ever-present.", "Ear/jaw pain after stopping meds? Hi all! \n\nI was diagnosed a little over a week ago, and yesterday was my last day of meds (anti virals and steroids). \n\nWhile I have not seen any improvement in the actual condition yet, I have been feeling pretty good otherwise. Today though, I have been in a lot of pain. From my ear, down my jaw line and actually extending into my neck as well. It is pretty severe pain, and it is extremely uncomfortable to lie down or move. \n\nI have some left over pain meds from a recent surgery so I am taking those for now but I am wondering if this is normal? Could this just be adverse effects from stopping steroids? If anyone else has experienced this, please let me know! I am going on 5 weeks and I had that as well. I was on the meds for week 1 with no pain. After the first week the meds ended. Then week 2 I had some ache pain that woke me up a couple nights. I took some PM ibuprofen a couple times that week. Then, no pain week 3-5. I still have no movement but it looks stronger to people that see me. So that is a plus.  \n\nI have been going in for a new type of laser treatment called an MLS laser at a local dental office. Also, I did two sessions of acupuncture. That is, unfortunately, a normal symptom. Pain in this nerve is often the first symptom of BP, and it can reappear when the anti-inflammatory meds wear off.\n\nThe BP-affected nerve emerges from the stylomastoid foramen, which is below the ear, behind the jaw, near the depression behind your ear lobe. (Like, right where you describe the pain.) This spot, where the nerve exits through a hole in the bone, is where the swelling of an irritated nerve could 'choke' that nerve, blocking signals to and from the nerves and muscles in your face.\n\nFrom my own experience, and others I have read here, the post-steroid pain is a short-lived phenomenon... a day or two. But, like every other aspect of BP, this too is a YMMV situation.\n\nIf it was me, I would let the doctor know about this... it might be that the steroids were helping, and could continue to help. It happened to me too but after a couple of weeks it went away. I do not know if it was s coincide, but I had unfathomable pain in my back when the Bells Palsy started. mine stopped a couple weeks after I stopped the prednisone and antiviral meds I am on the same timeline as you, with onset the same time- and no movement but people say it looks better/stronger now at 5weeks. \n\nI had EXTREME pain after week of meds finished. Lasted a few days at that level of pain, but peppermint oil helped and it subsided to occasional pain (more of a discomfort). \n\nI have not been offered any further treatment other than they will let me see a neurologist but appointment is a month out. \n\nDo you feel any of the treatments have helped? I like the idea of the treatment and the science behind it, but because I have not seen any results to my liking, I am a bit disappointed. We are going to try a new laser next week that is an older model but has treated more patients with some positive results. We will see. \n\nThe acupuncture I will try for once a week for a month and see what comes of that. \n\nI will try to keep you updated. Please keep me updated as to how you are doing. Thanks so much guys! It is been a few days and it is slowly improving. My Dr also said it was normal. I appreciate the help :) I was just diagnosed I want to say 5 days ago and the pain in my left ear and all the way down my neck is Unbelievably painful. All I was told to take were the muscle relaxers and Tylenol as needed for pain. So here I sit in my recliner at 4am unable to sleep in a lot of pain!!!", "Calling all long term sufferers and the non healed Hi! My 12 year bell\u2019s anniversary is around the corner. I never regained my full smile and My right eyebrow is still dead. \nI would love to hear your stories. It took a long time to come to terms with the fact that I will never look like I did before. \nIt took years for me to learn to smile and laugh without hiding behind my hand. \nHappy anniversary, Bells Palsy. You fucking suck. I have had mine for 1.5 years currently. I do miss being able to smile. I am coming to terms with it but I constantly cover my mouth when laughing and I would be ok with wearing a mask for awhile longer haha I had it when I was 13 yrs old. Was traveling to village by train for the first time sitting on the window seat. Eating snacks and too much cold drinks like 5-6 that day. The train was travelling through tunnels where there was too much dust and wind directly entering my ears, was not aware. \nWhen I reached my village next day I had same incident like you. I brushed and when I was gargling with water the water was just drooping on my shirt and floor. My face was hard in the left side, when everyone saw my face they were unaware of this condition. I was late for the treatment as parents were unaware, it took me 2-3 yrs to finally get my face back to 75% movable.\nIts been 8 yrs, I can smile with my lips close but not showing teeth its just a crooked smile \ud83d\ude01. Mask helps hide my face. The eyes are watery when I eat hot, chilly and spicy food. When I have cold its just vulnerable due to synkinesis, nose is watery, eyes are watery. \nAfter BP, I became more shy and reserved than before but currently working on it as I have a life ahead.", "Will facial massagers help bell's palsy?

About a week before today i started having this really bad dull pain in the back right side of my head and an ear ache in my right ear, CT scan showed nothing abnormal though no one could work out what the pain in the back of my head is, has anyone else experienced this pain leading up to the day of BP? Its pretty much where my neck meets my skull on the right side between the middle of my neck and ear? any help is appreciated alot. Also just got to say this sub is helping alot, i live alone atm and dont have much support and finding this sub was immensely helpful, got to keep keeping on (:\nBetter than some worse than others is quite a great way of looking at this to get  through it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Yes, I am on my second go (yay!) and I have had significant neck/head pain before both. Yup, that is where my pain started. Migraines about a week before, ear pain and the back of the neck pain. \nI think that spot in the neck is where the nerve is that causes BP. Same, I had severe pain on the back of the ear of the affected side for about a week prior to bells.. I do not remember any head or ear aches leading up to the diagnosis. For me, it was a weird spot on my tongue that I was hyper aware of the day before. And it got worse as the day went on. At first I thought it was a weird taste bud, but  then it festered into like a Canker sore in the middle of my tongue. Next thing I knew I could not feel the back right side of my tongue and things tasted like metal. By 11am the next day I could not feel my top and bottom lips on the right side only (tried to put on lip balm, could not rub my lips together), so I left work, called the doctor, went to the ER. Not having a stroke, but was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy and the tongue sore had nothing to do with it. I definitely noticed the ear sensitivity on the affected side starting that day. That was 13 days ago. I have noticed some slight improvements since then, but still nowhere near normal. It just takes time I guess. Mine started the same way last Wednesday! Wicked electric shock ear pain on the right side with really sensitive spots around my head/neck. By Sunday morning I had lost most movement in the right side of my face. Invest in a nice sleep mask to help keep your eyes shut, I got one I can heat up and it is wonderful. Yes, vision was blurry and ear pain, thought it was from being at the pool and riding my bike home. I was 8 months pregnant and the doctor thinks I was trying to get a cold sore and it damaged the nerve. Do they have any idea what caused your onset? If it was a cold sore, I would also ask for a rx of valacyclovir. I would also look into taking Lysine and B12, keeping drops in your eye if it does not close and warm olive or castor oil massages on the paralyzed side. Everything I read 14 years ago when it happened to me said do not touch the face or chew gum. I feel that was detrimental to me still being wonky all these years later. This sub is a wonderful resource and good luck, just rest and if you are mentally up for it, take a daily/weekly selfie so you can monitor improvement. Thanks for all the replies guys! Has been helping alot knowing the pain in my head is somewhat common, ill start doing some more things based on everyones advice (: Late to the game but I experienced the exact same thing in the exact same areas. Started with the pain which became excruciating when BP came on. ER doc said it tracks with BP (pain in ear and behind ear). My doctor friend who checked in on me later said that I may have ear blisters if my BP was triggered by shingles. \n\nGood luck! The pain does go away (it comes and goes for me but is much reduced. I am on day 4 with steroids, antiviral, topical CBD and topical voltaren/anti-inflammatory, and B12 with anti-inflammation supplements like curcumin).", "Tmj and posture issues I had bells palsy as a kid, I am now 29, and then I had a cross bite that I got adjusted with braces... But I lost my retainer and now my jaw is crooked again, and it affects the posture of my whole right side of my body. I notice that I do not smile with my right cheek bone unless I really think about it.\n\nHas anyone else noticed a similar affect after recovering? \nDo I need the do facial exercises or just get my teeth fixed to alleviate the issues? I do not have experience with that as I am a relative newbie (4yrs), but I have found that osteopathy is great for helping with posture amongst other things. \n\nMaybe some muscle strengthening exercises would help? I do my own depending on how my face feels as well as doing speech therapy. \n\nThere is also physiotherapy available for Bell\u2019s though I have yet to try that. Is this something that people usually have to do this many years later? I imagine that it is a case by case basis. I know someone who had it as a child and seems unaffected by it as an adult.", "Dizziness with Bell\u2019s palsy? I was just diagnosed with BP in the ER yesterday. Everything I read online makes it sound like it is just your face that is affected, but I really do not feel good at all. \nI am fatigued and very dizzy. \nIt started with a bad taste in my mouth on Sunday, dizziness on Monday, which I thought was my ears and then on Wednesday/Thursday I started to notice some changes in my face. \nI had a head CT to rule out anything else. \nI feel so dizzy today. Did anyone else have this? I am afraid about how long it will last. I just want to stay in bed. I am also on prednisone for five days and Valtrex for a week which I see can contribute to the dizziness. Yes, especially if your ear or eye is affected. With any jaw pain/ facial pain it can cause vertigo. Everything tasted different for me with BP, kind of like a muted taste sensation. I was REALLY dizzy with BP, and my ear was in horrible pain. Obviously keep in contact with your doctors, and let them know just in case, because i am not a medical professional. Luckily I have not had pain, but my hearing feels \u201coff.\u201d I am going to follow up with my GP on Tuesday so hopefully they can help me. Do you remember how long the dizziness lasted for you? \nSorry to hear you were in such pain! I experienced some dizziness but mostly vertigo for about 2 months AFTER I had fully recovered. Would usually feel it when laying down or switching sides in bed. It eventually went away for me. I was diagnosed Sept 19, 2020, and fully recovered in 4 weeks. A couple of days before my face got affected I got really dizzy as well, well before I got the taste in my mouth. Literary bumped into my boss at work, and we are having some real distancing rules because of covid so it got fairly awkward too!\n\nI think it is normal, and probably somewhat connected, but apparently it can hit you at different stages. For me it passed before my face got better. Awww thank you! it stills comes and goes. The dizziness thankfully is not really there anymore, that went away within a few weeks (like 2-4 weeks). The pain unfortunately stuck around. I am hoping the GP gives you some good advice! I am sorry you are going through this BP is such a jerk. Geez. Sorry to hear it lasted so long. I have been dizzy since Monday but it feels worse now. I do not even want to get out of bed. I hope it is gone soon! Scared it will not go away. Yes. For me I have been undergoing dental work since December after not going for a long time. I have had a lot of work done that is still not finished. Now I am scared to go back even though the doctor and dentist assured me it is unrelated and likely a viral issue. It took me so much nerve to go to the dentist, one of my major fears, and now this \ud83d\ude29\nThe doctor told me to try to control my stress but I have been crying a lot these past few days! I am sure it will. Wishing you the best Hey! Hoping that dizziness has subsided for you :) If you have a chance, I would just double check that you do not have Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. It is a little rarer than BP but it presents itself quite similarly.

My coworker and I used to make a lot of Elvis jokes! \n\nTip: when doing your face exercises make sure you are doing each one individually! I.e. do not blink your eye and try to move your mouth at the same time! My eye and the corner of my mouth have a weird connection that is not SUPER noticeable but if I blink the corner of my mouth will also move, the Dr. thinks the connection was made as I was relearning to move my muscles! Are you in the US? Have they started you on meds? Mine lasted 3 months and they said it was probably going to be at least 6 months. Super surprised when I got movement back so fast. I did a ton of research and used some natural products and I can share them with you! Yes I am on steroids and an antiviral. I was sent to the hospital as a stroke risk, as i did not know what was happening when i noticed the reduced movement in the right side of my face, so i had the whole work up. I would love to hear what you did to expedite your recovery. This! Thank you, very helpful. Hi there! Got Bell's in 2018, I would say after 6 weeks I was 80% recovered, 99% after a couple of months. It is a wild journey: I actually knew what it was even before the diagnose at the ER, but it still took a while for me to accept the situation, and after that every day was a balancing game between trying to relax and wanting to see some improvements.\n\nIt varies between people, but I found that the first two weeks were by far the worst, with the symptoms maybe even worsening a little in the first week, and definitely not getting better in the second one. During this time the ONLY useful thing you can do is rest. Sleep a ton if you can. Your facial nerve is super inflamed and you do not want to make it worse. Sleeping is tricky: I tried not to rest the affected side of my face on the pillow, but I do not know if that is something useful or not. I just know the nerve needs to decompress as much as possible, so I thought what the hell and gave that a try. Also, prednisone made it really hard to fall asleep. Aaand the eye patch. Man that was frustrating. Shutting the eye close had definitely its learning curve, but after a while I got there and so will you. So yes, it will be hard, but seriously try to rest as much as possible.\n\nAfter the first two weeks I started to feel a weird tingling sensation on the effected side. Nothing changed visibly, but I think it was when the nerve started to wake up again.\n\nThree weeks in I started to see some improvements, my eyelid would move a little, and I had a little more control over my mouth (I finally stopped drooling when drinking from a regular glass). I would say HERE is where I started experimenting with my facial muscles to see what I could do and what I could not do, kind of tracing the progress. I think it is important you do not start before this point, or you might risk worsening the inflammation to the nerve. Also when you do, check just one muscle at a time, or there is a chance your nerve will permanently link muscles together.\n\nIn general I think recovery will be very different depending on how badly your nerve got inflamed: basically what happens is that the facial nerve passes through a hole between the bones of your skull, and it gets so swollen that it cannot function anymore. If it \"\"only\"\" got swollen enough to not let the signal through, you should go back to normal in 2-3 months. If however it got so swollen that it got damaged (? I do not know what exactly that entails, I am not a doctor, I THINK that some nerve fibers can get cut between the bones or something like that), then you will have to wait for the fibers to grow back, and that can take a longer time, and it is not always a 100% guaranteed recovery, and there is a risk of developing synkinesis (which is the muscles being \"linked\" together by the nerve thing).\n\nListen, MOST cases are resolved in a few weeks, and even the ones that do not fully recover definitely improve over time. You got this. Right now your body is just telling you to take it easy for a while, it will heal itself if you just take your steroids and give it time.\n\nAfter I regained enough control to just close both my eyes at night I was already satisfied, it became so much easier to deal with the whole thing. And I honestly kind of miss having a bit of a crooked smile, I think it gave me a bit of an edge (kind of like Joe Mantegna, do not know if you are familiar with him). Not to mention I was halfway there to having the perfect poker face.\n\nGood luck, you are not alone in this :) This is how you comment. Thank you. Your insight and advice is amazing. I have done 12 hours of reading on this, and your comment gave me a better look into what is happening than any of it. Very encouraging. Thank you thank you. Glad I could help! Feel free to hit me up if there is anything you need Doctors and friendly advice definitely seem to prepare you for the worst. Not saying yours will be short, but based on friends and family stories, and the doc, I was sure this would last several months at least. I am less than a month in and I am at about 90% back! I would not say I did anything special. My story was similar. Went to the ER right away and got steroids and antiviral. Everyone is different, and I would agree about the severity of the nerve damage likely has a huge factor in recovery times. \n\nI had a lot of fun with my kids and they would mimick me and laugh every time I said my water tasted like salt. I was diagnosed yesterday ans have made several videos of me speaking (just for myself or for friends) and I break down laughing every time because on my faces lack of reaction... I dont think the pasy its funny but i look funny so why not laugh at myself? I find it helps me keep a positive mindset :) Do you think it is a side effect of the vaccine? Did you recently get the vaccine? I am trying to assess whether or not I should get the vaccine because several people I know got bell's palsy after the 2nd dose. Not at all. I am fully vaccinated, but had my second dose back in the first week of May. My mother and her cousin were both diagnosed in their 30s. I was also recently sick with a viral infection, similar to strep throat. Both those put me at higher risk, but mostly Bell\u2019s palsy is idiopathic. Thanks for responding Same thing happened to me! They did a stroke protocol on me and I had an MRI but it was Bells. I swear this helped me: I used a Jade roller (keep it in the fridge or run it under cold water before using) and this Chaga oil from True North Beauty - the unscented Facial Serum (it is highly concentrated Chaga oil). I would rub the oil on and then use the roller to massage it in all over my face for about 5 minutes a day. Sometimes I did it twice a day if I was feeling extra pain. \nChaga is an anti-inflammatory and that is what is happening is a nerve is inflamed. You can order the oil online, I do not know if I would trust any other brands but this stuff is legit Chaga oil. Their site is www . Truenorthbeauty . Com  you can get a jade roller from there it TJ Maxx, I got mine from her site. If you do order tell her Sarah with Bells Palsy recommended it haha she will remember me! Thank you for sharing all of it, I am about a week into my diagnosis and it is just the worst feeling waking up to find that symptoms are the same/ worse. Thanks for the spark of optimism. Just got to take it one day at a time I suppose :) Diagnosed TODAY. If I put my hand up to my mouth it looks like I have got a juicy secret to spill. The jokes are good, keep them coming! I am on day 3 after dx and I am so scared to work. I work for a call center and from home, but I cannot help but be nervous. Everyone says I am not slurring my words, but feeling my face while talking is so distracting! I am on prednisone and valtrex, but still sitting here having a pity party. I am 2 weeks in and the pity party is real. And totally normal. You are allowed to feel. This whole thing is crazy, and a bit devastating. I have to make a conscious effort to be strong through it. You are not alone &lt;3", "Just been diagnosed with BP anyone got any tips!? Hey guys found out yesterday that I have bells palsy and I have noticed there is quite a few people on here who have it too. so I was hoping to get some advice and tips off if people who have lived with this condition for some time. Any tips or advice? Make sure you start taking the steroids immediately, and finish them all the way through.  I would say minutes/hours count on this.  Best outcome is related to how quickly you do this.\n\nAlso, try not to overwork your face by trying to get it to move. It can distort your muscles to the point that the uneven-ness remains, or that some nerves/muscles will have \"over-healed\".\n\nSeverely limit sugar and alcohol intake, too.\n\nVitamin B-Complex.\n\nHope this helps, and good luck! It may get you down sometimes, but it will most likely heal considerably in the next months. all of the above. also try to not let it get to you. it probably seems like a huge deal right now, but in the grand scheme of things, it is not so bad really (and could certainly be worse). work on ways to lower stress, because this will help a lot. the odds are in your favor that you will get over most of the primary effects quickly. hang in there. Be careful anywhere with loud noises.  BP will screw up your ear muscles as well and not many people realize this.  I would wear an ear plug in my affected side anywhere loud. Thanks guys, definitely made me feel a lot better. Just feel like in going though this alone at the moment. When I was diagnosed with it none of my friends and family knew what it was. I think everybody thinks I am exaggerating how hard it is for me. It is all anyone wants to talk about and people at my work stare which does not help ", "Hello everyone I am about to be 23 and got diagnosed with BP January 9th. If you guys have any tips or tricks on recovery please let me know. I have a vlog I am doing to watch my recovery process which is below. Praying for you guys and hope to hear feedback :)  I had what I think was a minor case, looking similar to yours. Mine took 30 days before it was mostly gone. From what I was reading at the time, this was pretty quick. Good luck! Do not have much time to type right now... somewhere back in my profile there will be more info on what to do or not do, I think. This was about 6-7 months ago. Feel free to ask anything further too if you think I can help.  About 4 weeks for a full recovery. First week is the worst until you start seeing signs of recovery. Btw you are cute even with the BP. I would say if anything, just try to go about life as you usually do. Do what you can to stay relaxed and stress free. Drink lots of fluids and a take a B-complex, plus l-Lysine. I have seen folks mention acupuncture helping, but I did not try that personally. Your doctor probably prescribed some stuff... take it as prescribed. And hope for the best. It may get a bit worse before it gets better, but keep in mind it is temporary. \n\nHoping for a speedy recovery! Thank u so much for responding. I am just beginning my 3 weeks now so one more week to go hopefully lol thanks I will check out your profile:) Lol thank you makes me feel better. Yea hopefully soon I will start seeing improvement. I am having serious nerve pain on my left side now which is awful. Went to the doctors and she gave me 300mg of gabapentin (not sure how you spell it) and I am taking 2 a day and sometimes it is still not enough:( but thank you so much for replying and your words of encouragement  I will go and buy some b-complex today! Yea I do not really want to do acupuncture at all so for now I am just riding it out. They gave me the steroids and viral meds by I finished that and now I am on gabapentin for the nerve pain because it is bad lol. Thank you so much! After I was mostly better, 3rd week there was a 48 hour period of pain... and I was QUITE concerned as it was fairly painful. It went away shortly. I think it is just a sign things are reconnecting and you are getting better. The pain is normal as the nerve wakes back up I hope that is what it means:) even though it hurts haha Then I guess it is a good thing I have pain:) just hope it does not last too long Acupuncture is a scam and does no good at all. Do you know that for a fact? Can you prove it? I know I cannot. Seemed to ( and I have seen other similar reports.\n\nSure, it could just be a placebo effect, but maybe the extra stimulation of the nerves in that area helps. Who knows. ( seem to still be inconclusive either way. the nerve pain as definitely bad for me, for maybe a week and a half. it definitely ramped up, then started to get better. so hang in there. Go on NIH's website  As I said; inconclusive.\n\n&gt; Authors' conclusions: The quality of the included trials was inadequate to allow any conclusion about the efficacy of acupuncture. More research with high quality trials is needed.\n\n( Thank you I am trying it is been about a week since the pain so hopefully soon it will stop Any updates? I hope you are feeling better.  Yeah any updates? Did it go away? I just got it 5/30/17 \ud83d\ude2d", "Did anyone else's ear itch like crazy at some point in recovery? And what did you do to relieve it? So I am on day 13 (day 15 since I can pinpoint I was having symptoms) and thankfully am seeing progress that is minor but steady. I am trying to pinpoint one thing each day that has changed and keeping a log so I can track my progress and that is keeping my spirits up.\n\nThankfully, the pain in my ear/jaw/face has been gradually decreasing over the last couple days. Less thankfully, it is being replaced by an all consuming itch of doom in my ear. Which of course burns like the sun if I itch/rub it.\n\nIs this something others ran in to? How long did it last and what did you do to make it less aggravating (specifically when trying to sleep is my current issue)? Strange. I am at about a month and a half, and I never experienced that. Any itching was no more or less than the usual. Best of luck! Mine did not itch - but I always got this crackling sound in my ear on the affected side. It never went away - it is been 7 years. Thankfully no crackling yet. The itch is still coming and going, but luckily not half as bad as that first night. Everyone goes through this differently. Some have a permanent \u201cscar\u201d after the onset, some do not. I am still early enough in it that I am hoping I will be one of the lucky ones, but preparing for the possibility that things might never be completely normal. If they do not go back to normal - do not worry. You get so used to what remains you stop noticing it. It does not interfere with your life either. People do not even notice unless I try to show them what has remained on purpose. That is good to hear :)", "Facial Soreness I am on day 3 after dx and being put on prednisone and valtrex. Does anyone wake up with soreness on their affected side of the face when you inadvertently sleep on it? I am getting tired of only sleeping on my left as I am someone that usually flips back and forth when sleeping. I have used ibuprofen for the soreness, but is it just me? I had soreness too specially during the first week. I am on my 14th day now and soreness is almost gone. I started getting sore the day i was diagnosed but went away for a couple days. Now it is back worse than ever radiating from my face all the way to the back of my head and ear. I bought a face roller meant for skin care its helped a lot in working those muscles I suggest you get one if you do not already own one!! I have been using cbd cream as well but it is hard to tell if it is making a difference. This also might not be the best suggestion but it is gotten to the point where I put tiger balm on it to soothe the pain. Makes it feel so much better cause ibuprofen is not working for me at all. I am still working on finding the best sleeping position, you will find that some days are easier than others and you will occasionally be able to sleep on the side. Hope this helps a little bit \u2661 I have a jade roller, so I will try that. Thanks so much! Also just got a gel eye mask for sleeping to hold my eyelid down so I do not have to tape it. \nHope your recovery goes well! That Is a smart idea I hate taping my eye shut so I will look into that too! Any type of massaging for the face could really help, I notice a small improvement in my eye its not as droopy and it can close about 90% since I started using the roller. I hope that for you too!!", "Bell's Palsy Doctor Recommendation In Atlanta Please Hey there, \n\nIn search for a Bell's Palsy in the Atlanta area please. Preferably OTP North but will go anywhere. \n\nThanks!!! I do not live near Atlanta but suggest contacting a massage therapist, chiropractor, and acupuncturist. If there is a local community pharmacist - stop and ask their opinion on supplements, and vitamins.  \n\nTraditional Clinicians including an ENT or Neurologist will be familiar and can confirm what is happening but other than steroids to reduce inflammation do not offer much treatment.", "Do you mention that you have BP when interviewing for a new job?  No. Appear as confident as possible with it. As if you had had this for ages. Only if they ask, explain. It will be a positive shock for them that this is so new for you yet you do not let it affect you, which is great personal quality. If they do not ask, do not bring it up. For the next round of interviews you may already be recovered, so they might ask then. No, I did not. My kind of job does not require that and If an employer discriminate on the basis of how you look, I would not apply there. Back when I got BP, I had a phone interview about two days before my symptoms started. I think I sounded really great over the phone and they asked me to come to an in person interview the following week. I was at the beginning of the symptoms so I was extremely self conscious and just more nervous than I otherwise would be. My eye teared up all the time. My speech was weird because one side of my lips did not move. I was a mess. I tried to get ahead of it and asked the recruiter and first interviewer to let people know about my condition. They did not pass it on. I interviewed with 5 different people that day. Sometimes the question would come up as to what was going on. In one awkward interview my eye teared up right as I was discussing that my current role was being phased out. I think that person incorrectly assumed I was crying or trying to gain sympathy. It was all awkward as hell and did not go well, and I did not get the job. \n\nMy take away. Let each interviewer know at the beginning and get it out of the way. If your speech is weird due to limited mouth movement, practice talking as much as you can before the interview. Stay hydrated. Consider an eye patch if your eye situation is particularly uncomfortable. Right, OP. I answered before that you should not mention it. But I assumed you were past the phase where it is really uncomfortable and only the aesthetic issue remains. But if it is really still uncomfortable to talk, mention it at the beginning as mrharoharo said. I would if I am winking at the interviewer.", "Very relatable. \"RBF\" is sometimes just Bell's Palsy, amirite?

Bell's palsy started 6 months ago. My face recovered a good part of its symmetry, but there is still an awful lot of tension on the left side of my face and my eyebrow still does not raise.  \nIs it wise to plan a scuba diving trip in 2 months?   \n(I do not know a thing about scuba diving) I think doing anything too stressful is a bad idea", "Should I try Acupuncture? I have been diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy on May 25, been around 64 days now. I have gone to physiotherapy 1-2 times a week since then and I have noticed only slight improvements.\n\n I have read numerous articles online that Acupuncture helps and speeds up the recovery. However my neurologist told me that it does not really help since Acupuncture deals with the muscles and Bell\u2019s Palsy is a problem with the nerves. \n\nKindly enlighten me about the pros and cons about it and does it worsen the condition?\n\nThank you so much. I was skeptical and put it off this time (my second go). After each visit, I could see measurable progress in a day or two with more movement. \n\nThe acupuncturist told me that twice a week for six weeks is the standard, and to go as long as you are seeing progress. \n\nIf I were you, I would go to at least a few sessions to see if it helps. I started acupuncture about an hour before officially being diagnosed as I would found acupuncture helpful for other conditions (and my clinic is right next to my docs). \n\nI would say that about 90% of my overall gains happened during or immediately after an acupuncture treatment. They did not put any needles in my affected side, only the unaffected side. And often I would be in the chair for 1-2 hours, super relaxed or asleep and would start to feel something coming back.  \n\nAcupuncture is based on meridians through which Qi (life force) flows. So likely your neurologist would only look at the scientifically proven benefits - which would be as a muscle therapy.  \n\nFrom my own experience, I have nothing but good things to say about acupuncture. Look around for a clinic/acupuncturist that you feel comfortable with as that will make a big difference.\n\nThe clinic I go to is based on ( model so that the prices stay low for everyone. It does not get talked a lot, but you should absolutely try it at this point. I was skeptical, but with no other ways out I said screw it, it cannot hurt!\n\nI saw amazing progress 2-3 weeks in (I go once a week), and now almost 3 months later, my face is about 95% what it was before BP. Most people do not even know I had BP at this point, I am the only one to notice. After a month or so, I see minimal progress now, since most of the progress happened in the beginning. \n\nI would def call a acupuncturist near you, and see if they have dealt with BP before, most have, but I felt inclined to ask first. In my opinion: Do not waste your money. It is all about how long your nerves take to no longer be swollen and calm down. No amount of oils, cbd or acupuncture will \u201ccure\u201d bells. This can be argued like the chicken and the egg.  Was it a pure coincidence that I had easily visual improvements the following day after going 3 times a week for 3 weeks?  After each 3rd session, there was either my eye being able to close or my mouth being back to \"normal\".  Well worth the time in my opinion to have it done. I respect that. I did physical therapy for months and did not see improvement. My body decided to heal when it was ready. I think each case is unique and there is very little research going into bells or in my case Ramsey Hunt. I agree 100%... Very weird things Bell's is.  I took the tens unit to my face daily for 30 mins at lunch and at night along with the acupuncture.  I hope yours has healed! It did for the most part. I cannot pucker my lips or sing without my right eye closing lol. My poor husband, I look like a crazy person coming at him for a smooch!\n\nThank you for the insight! God forbid it happens again, but if it does I will remember your recommendation. I just began acupuncture the other day for the same reason and I have noticed improvement already with my eye closing. I went from 50% to 70% just after one session. I would highly recommend! I guess I could give it a shot. Thanks for the advice! Thanks for the advice. May I ask, how much does it usually cost for one session? I guess trying one session would not hurt? I will see if there are any improvements. Thank you for the advice! How was your experience? Were there a lot of needles (or idk what they are really called haha) and on which parts did the acupuncturist focused on? Try it for a month and see what you think\u2026it will not make it worse, it can only get better honestly. Plus I was desperate where I thought\u2026screw it, at this point I will try anything Honestly that is also what I am thinking. I am so desperate going into 2 months already. Also may I ask, how many days after you got diagnosed before you tried acupuncture? It is $20 or $30 per session minimum (it went up due to Covid for new clients who did not have prepaid sessions banked). But if you have the money and are able to pay more they will accept up to $40 for the session.\n\nWhen I was going to an acupuncturist for private treatments I was paying $65 for a session and that was done as sliding scale- her regular rate was more like $85 per session. I got diagnosed like beginning of feb and started going end of may? Did you see any improvements? And if you did, how long did it take? Oh yeah! Within two weeks my face was drastically better! At this point now, my face is 95% back to normal. No one knows I had BP unless I told them so How many days until you saw improvement from the acupuncture session/s? I started going the day I got Bell\u2019s Palsy, but I had zero movement for three months. For the next three months after that I had only the tiniest movement around my mouth- which showed up during a treatment. And then for the next six months I could almost guarantee that I would see some improvement during or immediately after a session. I was going at least once a week for the first 8 months I had palsy. I slowed down the frequency due to life events unrelated to palsy and kept up with at least twice a month after that. \n\nSo it was nearly six months before I saw improvement. I knew it would be slow going by the nature of nerve regeneration and I trusted in acupuncture because I would seen results with other health issues. The thing is that bell's palsy resolves for 90% of people afflicted, only 10% have some permanent symptoms. So you are likely attributing to acupuncture, improvement that would have came anyway... That could certainly be true\u2026I was doing electro stim therapy for about a month and a half and nothing happened and then I tried acupuncture and within two weeks I saw awesome results, so who knows Hi I have had acupuncture administered by my physiotherapist.\n\nThe experience is like electrical muscle stimulation but sometimes more intense. I felt that the musclea are sore and sometimes they are almost pulsating for a bit. She said it is good because it shows that the muscles are responding to stimulation.\n\nI know acupuncture is based on the \"qi\" theory but it is just like nerve stimulation. My treat had acupuncture included so no extra fee charged. \n\nThough I refused in the first visit, it did help a lot after first acupuncture session and I could feel the more significant improvement than after the first visit.\n\nIf you want to try acupuncture, be sure to find someone who is licensed. do you have any synkinesis from the tens unit? do you have any synkinesis from the electrical stim? I do have synkinesis but idk where it actually came from or when it started exactly. Are there any resources or videos out there that can help with it? yeah you can schedule a vid consultation with the crystal clinic I do not.", "I am reaching my 6th month anniversary Hey guys, I joined this group back in January when I was first diagnosed. Since  that time, I have shown no progression/recovery. I am just dropping in to see if there is anyone who saw no progression until after the 6th month mark? I am getting extremely discouraged. My doctor just keeps saying to stay positive and that \"we will get you back to normal\", but I am just slowly giving up hope. I cannot close my eye at all, and I think that is the worst part. I just want this little nightmare to go away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have tried it all - CBD, B12, antivirals, steroids, acupuncture, facial massages, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for you long recovery people out there, how long did it take you to see any recovery? It would not be so bad if I could just close my damn eye. See if you can find a doctor who works with BP and will inject Botox. When my eye would not close, I had Botox injected in the lid along the lash line. If that did not work, there was talk of inserting weights to close it. I am still wonky going on 14 years, but Botox has helped even me out. Add Lysine to your routine and consistency is key with everything. Do the doctors know what caused it? If it was Lyme or MS or just a cold sore that damaged the 7th nerve? That might help figure out what treatment plan you should visit. Good luck, I know it can be discouraging to see no improvement, just take care of yourself. I am actually going to Stanford university in June to see a Facial Nerve Specialist. I am hoping he can be more help than my current doctor and neurologist. \n\nThey do not know what caused it as I was pretty damn healthy when it happened. \n\nThank you for replying. It is discouraging reading all these posts where people are back to 100% after 21 days. I did not see any improvement until about 5 1/2 months.  I am almost 10 months, and still cannot move certain areas. is the doctor sure it is not Ramsay Hunt? I have heard that that one can take longer. It is another facial paralysis that is caused by the shingles virus.\n\nbest of luck with everything. perhaps it is worth looking into surgery? Sorry to hear! You mentioned doc and neurologist so I assumed they have done an MRI to rule out other conditions that may be similar to Bell's. \n\nGood luck with the specialist. I am in my third week and some days, I wonder if this is the best that it is going to be.", "Just curious about BP and the Covid vaccine. How many have had the Covid vaccine and which one? I was diagnosed with BP a few days ago and for now mine seems mild compared to what some of you describe. Just curious of any correlation with Covid vaccines as I have had the Pfizer vaccine, but my second dose was 5 months ago.\n\n( Have not even been vaccinated yet but I want to know if I can get my 1st doze when I am more than a week into BP now. I would talk with your doctor, but then again they will more then likely deny that the vaccine causes BP anyways. I wish I had an answer for you.\n\nI cannot say with 100% certainty that the vaccine caused mine. I am an Army Veteran who went to Iraq in 1991 and we got plenty of vaccines and were made to take a PB pill in case of chemical attack. So could it be a side effect from something years ago or the vaccine I dont know. I got BP exactly a month after my second dose of Pfizer. I had Bells back in September.   Have both shots of Moderna in April, no after affects. The connection between BP and the vaccine exists, but is weak.   \n\n\nThe connectio between BP and the actual coronavirus is *much* stronger. I have had BP twice, 2002 and 2012, I just got my first dose of Pfizer on Friday (June 11). So far, just a sore arm around the injection site.\n\nI have been so nervous to get this vaccine, not anti-vax, just worried to death about correlations to Bell's. But all the research points to \"chances are slim to none\". So, here is to hoping... There is no evidence that bp is caused by vaccines That you know of cause unless you are a scientist and doing research you cannot say for 100% certainty that your statement are correct. many things took time to determine like agent orange was found to cause cancer, but it took years to make the connection.\n\nHence why I wanted to take a poll to see. nothing wrong with that. Yes I understand, but it is just like people are saying the survival rate of it is like 99%, but for those 1% it means a whole lot more. With over 7 billion world wide population 1% is still a very large number. ( I do not believe unicorns exist. It is the same logic I think it is fair to say that the coronavirus vaccine reduces your risk of acquiring bell's palsy. I am not much of a statistician, but the correlation with increased risk in that study is enormous.   \n\n\nA weakened immune sytem from *any* serious disease greatly increases risk of bell's palsy, of course. Yes, but for those effected it makes a huge difference. That is also why I cannot say 100% due to the fact that unless I was raised and stayed inside a sterile bubble then this could be something from something else I was exposed to in my life. Like I was in the Army and I was in Iraq in 1991 so could this be part of Desert Storm Syndrome. We had to take experimental meds while there in case of chemical attack. They were called PB pills and of course who knows what long term effects of that is. I started coming down with BP about 4 hours after my first dose of Pfizer, but I also had a cold about 3 weeks prior, so I do not really think it can be pinned on the vaccine alone. i looked into this a few months ago, because i was also concerned with getting BP again. the rate of vaccinated people developing BP was not higher or lower than the general population, within a 95% confidence level. i am sure someone with google, you can find the peer reviewed and published scientific article.\n\nbasically, there is little or no statistical evidence of the vaccine causing BP. of course if a new article comes out that says otherwise, please link it\n\nalso, i got both shots of moderna, standard symptoms, no BP. got my second Pfizer shot on Feb 13th.   Had BP come on Sunday June 6th.  Started with ear pain two days prior. I cannot establish causation but I developed BP exactly 3 weeks after my second dose of Pfizer vaccine. No prior history to speak of. Coincidence?? Yeh same here, but mine was 5 months and I cannot say 100% seeing that I have a military background and was exposed to who knows what during that 7 years. i just got diagnosed with BP 6 days after I got my second dose of Pfizer. I also was sick the day after my second dose (chills, slight fever, sore arm) not sure if its related but definitely sucks. Just hoping for a speedy recovery. I hope so as well. Mine so far are mild compared to others so i am thankful. No drooping, but watery eye during the day and I can close it to sleep at night. They gave me the 60mg prednisone for 5 days and a couple of days after my effected side was slightly sore and my ear was a little swollen. Toda i see that if i smile I can see more teeth on the effected side so improvement. i am suppose to see a neurologist on the 29th, but not sure what they are going to be bale to do for me. Good luck and speedy recovery. I took the Oxford Astrazenica but I have had BP since early 2019. The vaccine has not affected it at all. Still hovering at 90% recovery", "Is twitching a good sign?  Yes it is your nerves waking up! My eye twitched like crazy lol Same here, I also told my acupuncturist and she stopped doing electricity treatment. i hope so mine is mild at this point and I have been having twitching in my upper eye lid and lip. Glad to see this :). Am at 5 weeks, with no major improvement. But past few days, I have been having a twitch above my upper lip and feeling tingles near my lip on my affected side. I really do hope this is some progress \ud83e\udd1e it took me like.... 3 months to have any visible improvement. sometimes it is a slow recovery, 5 or so years later i am still slowly recovering (or at least i hope so lol) hang in there, it gets better until it doesnt. but by then you will be more or less used to it", "Residual effects after Bell\u2019s recovery? I was diagnosed on May 6th, took all prescribed medications (steroids and anti-virals) and pretty much recovered in about 3-4 weeks. That whole experience was one of the most difficult things I have been through, physically and emotionally. \nBut since I recovered I have some twitching going on and was wondering if that is normal? There is a pretty serious twitch/tug on my bottom lip on my affected side and it is pretty weird and has been worrying me these last few days. \n\nAnyone have any lasting effects from this? So, when I am under a lot of stress, my eye twitches, but that does not happen often. When it does happen it lasts a couple days. Take an nsaid, it should help calm that blood vessel. It should go away, but if it persists, see your doctor.\n\nWhat you need to watch out for too is your affected eye drying out on sunny days, eye drops or eye gel should help. I say this because it sounds like you may have experienced some minor damage to your eye or this could just be unrelated to your bell\u2019s at all. This whole experience worsened my anxiety, and I find myself \u201cchecking\u201d to see if I am still able to move my affected side throughout the day. \n\nThanks for your input and will definitely talk to a doctor if it persists! Ah, so you do have anxiety. I was not going to assume. Me too, stay strong brother/sister! Thanks! You as well \ud83d\ude0a I have recovered most of my range of motion, but I do not blink right in my affected eye anymore. My eye kind of rolls up and half blinks, but it still has the bottom white of my eye is still exposed to air. I have also noticed a change in my affected eye's vision. Diagnosed about six months ago, recovered after about 3-4 weeks, i still have twiching about my nose and in neck on affected side. My guess is the nerves/muscles are still weak or recovering. Im just happy to have recovered at this point so i do not really concern myself with it. I was four months in, feeling much better  and finding the accupuncture helped as well as exercises and then I one day found my eye closing if I am chewing or laughing...my affected side pulls up rather than drooping. Now at almost 7 months, I have gone back to accupuncture and hoping someone else had this relapse and recovered. Hello, we are nursing students who were displaced from clinical due to COVID-19. We have found the following information to answer your question relating to Bell\u2019s Palsy.\n\nBell\u2019s Palsy is an unexplained, spontaneous condition. Individuals with Bell\u2019s Palsy usually start to notice improvements after 3 months since the onset of symptoms. Although medications, such as steroids and antivirals, work to relieve symptoms, speed the recovery process, and prevent further complications, about 30% of individuals experience residual effects after 6 months of initiating treatment (Murthy &amp; Sexana, 2011). Some of the most common residual effects include hemifacial spasms or twitching, co-contracting muscles, and synkinesis (Murthy &amp; Sexana, 2011). Synkinesis is the condition in which involuntary movements occur at the same time as voluntary movements. For example, one eye tears up while you are chewing or your eyelid winks when you open your jaw or smile (Murthy &amp; Sexana, 2011). \n\nIt is also important to note the effect of Bell\u2019s Palsy on the affected eye. Having Bell\u2019s Palsy might make it difficult for you to close your eye fully. This may cause the eye to become dry which can lead to serious problems. Make sure to protect your eyes by wearing safety goggles at all times during high impact sports, or really in any situation where there is a possibility of eye injury (Ackley, 2019). \n\nAlthough the cause of Bell\u2019s Palsy is unknown, factors affecting recovery include older age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (Murthy &amp; Sexana, 2011). If symptoms are not relieved or start to worsen, please contact your primary care physician to discuss possible factors affecting your recovery, eye care, and other possible treatment options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReferences:\n\nAckley, B.

I had bells on the left side of my face about 4 years ago and it took me about 8 months to stop taping my eye shut to sleep at night. But over the years since I can tell there is some residual effects, I cannot smile the way i used to, my left eye will slam shut whenever I yawn even if I try to keep it open. Odd feeling if I try to close that left eye but keep it open (almost like flexing those muscles) I will feel that all the way down the nerve right to my mouth.\n\nThe past couple of months I have been getting very hot flashes in my face but only on the left side, which was the effected bells side. I am 44 , male, in the US. Has anyone else experienced this?

Stay strong and keep working on it but dont stress yourself. Progress is progress Keep working at exercising those muscles!  Any progress is good progress! I had no progress, zero, from May to August. Now, over 2 years out, I am 85% recovered and people who did not know me before cannot tell. Keep on keeping on, you will get there. Thank you! I am keeping up on the daily facial exercises. :) That is awesome :)\n\nI am hopeful! do not stop, keep going. I learned that hard way. I progressed up to 80-85% then stopped but for past 4-5 months I started exercise aggressively again &amp; now I feel very good about my face and I am almost 97% recovered. Congrats on the recovery! For my recoveries, it is always been an exponential curve of recovering.

Slightly urts when i press firmly on under my cheeks bone.\n\nI do not have money to check up on doctors. \nIf anyone had this experience please let me now thank you It did hurt for me, still does despite it being a year and a half since my 95% recovery. You really should get it checked, the sooner you start treatment the better you will recover. I get pain in my right lower jaw/cheek whenever I brush my tongue, it is super annoying and like a 6/10 pain rating. I think lasting nerve damage/pain is a real thing unfortunately. Need to ask my doctor about it more I am fully recovered but my affected side is definitely more sensitive and gets sore. I would not worry too much. I am 2 years after recovery, I am a good 98% recovered but my affected side is more sensitive, when I am tired I feel that the nerves are tenser and I have to put more effort to balance emotes (smiling etc.).\n\nI am considering acupuncture as I hope I can still reduce the soreness. yeah, but personally (and this is with no research at all) when my nerves are a bit more sensitive, i take this as a sign that more nerves are coming back, so i do extra exercise/massage on that area. no idea if this is actually true, but.... 5 years later, got to hang on to some hope.\n\nand yeah, those ENT doctors are expensive. after insurance it was still 450$ per visit", "Permanent damage from this?

I hate this disorder so much, especially when I have social anxiety. Two most noticeable features are right eye closed significantly but can blink and function fine. Another annoying issue is slurred speech. These two issues coupled with social anxiety have ruined my entire life. I am just wondering, is there anything I can do to resolve these issues? For me the disorder either gets really bad when I am stressed a week or can be better when I am not stressed. Really weakens my self-confidence.

I want to give her a gift (I already sent a breathable sleeping mask through Amazon) but I have no idea what could be of use, if it could be hard for her to eat certain foods, etc.\nAny ideas, anyone? For me, I used the medical tape to tape my eyelid closed when I slept. Some people wear an eye patch during the day. Eye drops to lube the eye. Hope that helps! Give her a hug. And then give her another one. As a parent with bells at the moment I know that would be as welcome as any gift however thoughtful. Oh and a bottle of gin! Maybe a little heat pad - a lot of people find gentle heat on the affected side feels nice. \n\nIf she has a sense of humour or crazy style, you could bling up an eyepatch so it is not the boring medical black/beige.\n\nAside from that, anything you can think of that will make her feel comforted - BP really does bring your mood right down at times.

", "Diagnosed today Diagnosed with Bells Palsy today.... I had an ear infection for two days and then it totally went away and my ear started twitching for two days. Then last night my lips went numb- today I could barely smile on that side of my face. My case is extreeeemely mild and I am young and very healthy although I do have a lot of emotional stress in my life. The doctor said it would take about a month on eye drops, steroids, and antiViral medication. She said my ear infection basically caused the palsy. I am wondering, as far as Covid goes, does this count as having a compromised immune system? Scary day. Please be nice but real Basically sounds like me. Wretched ear pain, 4 days later, left side paralysis. I am 2 weeks in and about 65-70% recovered. Mine was also mild. Day 4 is when you will really see how bad your case will get. I was blinking fine until day 4, that is when I peaked. I have been using a product called systane gel to keep my eye moisturized and being mindful of my blinking. Take the prednisone, take Tylenol, take the antivirals, use eye drops, do not be negative. That is all I can tell you. Other than that, mild cases are 3-5 weeks on average, 85% of people fully recover eventually and as far as immunocompromised, prednisone and infections weaken your immune system, so just be mindful. Have you tried Refresh eye drops? If you have, would you choose Sytane Gel over it? My Bell\u2019s side eye is killing me and the Refresh drops do not do much for it. I believe while you are on the medication your immune system is effected. Keep up your cleanliness and drink lots of water every day. I bought vitamin B drops on Amazon to help boost my immune system while on the medication, and I still take it now that I have finished the meds. I think that is helped me a bit. \n\nI am youngish (30) with a stressful home life and have had Bell\u2019s with a 15% improvement since September 1. Everyone is case is different, and hopefully yours improves quickly. \ud83c\udf37 Vitamin B12* I have not. Are they liquid or gel? The gel coats the eye and kind of glues the lid shut at night. All I have used are systane and regular drops i got at Walmart Ohhhh okay, idk why I assumed the systane gel was a type of eye drops. I think \u2018cause Refresh says their product is gel drops. Had no idea an actual gel like that existed. I really think I need to buy that. Thank you! This stuff comes out almost like a clear paste. It said it was for nighttime use and lasted up to i think 8 hours or something like that. I put it in at night and then sometimes in the morning just in case Sweet, I found it online. Thanks again! I hope it does what you are looking for. Speedy recovery \u2665\ufe0f Thank you! And the same to you as well. \ud83c\udf37 I am at about 70% now. It is been a scary ride \ud83e\udd74", "4 days since diagnosis Hi everyone, I started to lose my sense of taste last week then the next day my lip started  misbehaving then blinking so obviously went straight to the doctor because everyone thought I was having a stroke. \nThe doctor soon diagnosed BP gave me steroids, eye drops and a pamphlet then sent me on my way telling me it was not too much to worry about and to tape my eye shut to sleep!\nIt is now a few days later and I am feeling really tired and ill.\nIs this normal with BP or is it the steroids (which I will be taking my last dose tomorrow) ?\nI am quite lucky as I own my business so I can just work when I can and my business partners are pretty cool.\nBut I was not told I would find working or paying attention to anything so exhausting.\nIs this normal in the first week ? It is the prednisone.  It will get better after you stop taking it. Taste comes and goes but that will eventually come back. I was diagnosed August 12th. I would say I have about 60-70% movement back on my face. Eating and drinking was a pain the first couple weeks. Definitely wear the eye patch when sleeping and keep eye drops with you wherever you go.  Just a waiting game now, it takes time, but gets better. Thanks for the reply ! That is a relief that it is the steroids. I will have to get an eye patch to give my eye a rest and maybe an ear plug because noise in my one ear is horrendous. It is taking me a while to understand this illness but I guess it is going to be a long haul . No problem, I would recommended the 3m stick on patches as I found the ones with the strap tend to fall off through the night.  I can relate with the ear issue, my ear was really sensitive to touch and would emit excruciating pain with the littlest poke of a finger.  Only lasted a week or so, on and off, but was glad when that was over lol. The steroids made me depressed. But once I was done with them, everything was okay. You have every right, if you can, to take a few sick days to get through this.\n\nI was not keen on taping my eyes and had to experiment. I ended up using clear tape with holes. There are different brands. I used Transpore, which is medical grade tape. They seem to be just be making me tired and kind of emotional but calm so it could be worse. \n\nThere seems to be hardly any real world info about what to expect with this condition. Thanks God for Reddit!\n\nThanks for the tape advice ! I was absolutely miserable the first 10 or so days. Bad headache, earache, and facial pain. It was terrible, I just laid in bed for days with a heating pad and taking a lot of ibuprofen. It did get better. It messed with my head a lot.  I already lack self esteem and having half a frozen face did not help.\n\nI have been without BP for a couple of years.  It is such a strange disease.\n\nYou are going to get through this. I wish you a speedy recovery. Thanks for that. I am looking forward to a steroid free day tomorrow which I will hopefully feel more energy and less dizzy.\nI am lucky that I have a beard and glasses so nobody really notices untill I speak.\nDid it help with your self esteem after you got through it ? It did seem a bit overwhelming yesterday but I am off the steroids tomorrow so that lifting my spirits.\nAre you back to 100% ? I had bad headaches behind my ear on the affected side and I was exhausted. Try to stay calm and stress free and do not let air from a fan, AC, or open car window hit your face because it can keep your nerves paralyzed. I got better after like 2 months. Unfortunately not but making progress. I was pregnant when I got BP and had no improvement until I gave birth 3 months later. Since I gave birth 2 months ago, I am at about 50% improved. Jesus ! You really did have it rough. It was scary enough thinking I was having a stroke, I cannot even imagine what you were going through.\nBecause of you I am not going to allow myself to any self pity.\nI hope you make a full recovery I really do . I have invested in an eye patch and an ear plug and it is made everything alot more manageable.\nGoing by what everyone else has been going through I have had it easy ! You are still allowed to grieve! BP sucks. Just because my situation sucked too does not mean yours is invalid. \ud83d\ude0a I will admit, it was really hard at the beginning, especially when I hit 3 weeks...6 weeks....3 months....with no improvement. I thought I would never recover. Then exactly a week after giving birth, my lip twitched for the first time. Now I can smile again (mostly). I am just so relieved to have any recovery. I hope it will continue to improve. I wish the best for you as well.", "Doctor Represcribed Prednisone and Antiviral 8 days later?? Hi everyone, \nI was diagnosed with Bells Palsy 8 days ago.  I had a viral infection similar to Strep Throat a week prior. I first noticed my lip moving to right side and went to the doctors right away. The doctor first prescribed me 60 mg of prednisone over 5 days and taper off with 10 mg over another 5 days (I am 110 lbs). I went back for a check up and they put me back on prednisone 60 mg for 7 day as well as an antiviral called Valtrex 1gram for 7 days. I noticed very very slight improvement on my 8th day but is it normal to start an antiviral this late in the diagnosis? Is it strange that I am taking an antiviral when I have not had any flu symptoms in 2 weeks? The prednisone was represcribed because I described twitching and tingling when I took the 60 mg so she thought it was working and would speed the process. Is it too late to take this many drugs? Also, what were your signs/symptoms before you noticed improvement? Thank you and would appreciate your feedback! Hey there! I got Bells back in 2018, so at about 30. \n\nI believe mine was stress related. \n\n**From what I understand, about Bells:**  facial nerve became swollen, it runs through a foramen (or hole) near the jaw which constricted the swollen nerve and severed/damaged it. \n\nI lost most (maybe all) movement on left side. \n\nInitially, I was only given the antiviral and NOT prednisone. Prednisone actually helps to reduce/stop the swelling. \n\nI am not a doctor but I think you are on a good mix of meds. \n\nI am going to add other stuff, not that you asked but feel like adding:\n\n**On healing:** \n\n* 85% heal normally/fully recover **(if you recover in 4-6 weeks you are in this group)**\n* 10% have some form of synkinesis (or some form of residual facial paralysis) but mostly recover **(I have read \\ anything over 6 weeks, you will probably be in this group)**\n* 5%  remain the same (more prevalent in older people, 50+)\n\n**I am in 10% group,** when you look at me straight on (and I am speaking), you can tell there is something going on, on my left side. I had no improvement at all, until about 3+ months. It is not huge enough to do surgery, but it is what it is, I have regained most of my smile which was the important thing to me. \n\nCouple things I wish I did sooner (as I had like no movement): Acupuncture! (do not do electrical acupuncture). I did not have insurance but would have maybe looked into getting some facial therapy sessions (time lost, is muscle lost). \n\n**When nerves were growing back,** I often felt tingling or like \"pulsing\" in the area. It sounds like you did not lose all your movement on your side, your post mentions only your lip, so I think you will be good. \n\nThis is probably your last round of prednisone. She will most likely not prescribe another week. There is a point the swelling of the nerve subsides and you just have to wait to heal. \n\nSpeedy recovery! Thank you so much for your reply! I am trying to stay very hopeful as I heard low stress helps. When I look back I actually think stress triggered as I was going through some very stressful things the day before I was diagnosed -was recovering from a virus but was recovering perfectly the week prior with no ear pain or issues. I will definitely try the acupuncture! I really appreciate you sharing your story, I know it can be tough some days but thank you for the tips and for simply sharing. It helped me a lot. \n\nI forgot to add that by the 6th day I could not close my left eye, and it affected my lip, nostrils, neck, taste and eyebrows. I did not get complete facial drooping but it definitely comes out when I laugh or smile really hard . I hope it gets better soon and I hope your Bell\u2019s palsy journey continues to get better and better each day even if you were that 10%. Thank you again! *Yes, low stress is important.* At the time, I worked 2 jobs, and never thought of wearing a mask! I think not giving my body time to relax and heal was huge factor in maybe not healing fully. \n\nStress was my trigger too.\n\nThanks for wishes!", "Anyone Use Marijuana To Get You Through the Headaches? Just got diagnosed this morning. Symptoms started yesterday with left side only tingling tongue and mouth and then a left side bad headache and later me realizing that my face was feeling stiff and difficult to move on that side.\n\nThe doctor said I can smoke marijuana unless it makes me paranoid of my symptoms. And it is. I am constantly checking my face in the mirror or taking pics. Constantly trying to move my face muscles.\n\nAm i supposed to just rest my face or keep moving btw? I also have anxiety disorder (in therapy but off meds for 4 years) so I am worried this is my new face forever. \n\nI do not even know how this happened besides I have been in an extremely stressful home environment the last month with constant screaming arguments.  I would recommend CBD...should be able to find it in a tincture that you put under your tongue, or there are even vape pens. Should have a nice calming effect without the high and paranoia. Helps a ton with sleep too. \n\nI think facial exercises may help some, but keep in mind it is the nerve that needs to heal, not your face. So just take it easy, and try to focus on keeping your stress at a minimum. Take the medication you probably got and maybe add in some L-Lysine and a B complex.\n\nTake care of yourself. The first days mary jane made me more anxious and over analytic, but that is how mary jane does it with everything for me. Now I barely think about it and gotten used to it.\n\nBest you can do is accept your current situation. Worrying about the future doesnt change the present and all you have to think about is making every present moment as good as it can be nomatter circumstanses.\n\nMaybe try to get used to it while sober. Then it will be easier while high, coz otherwise mary jane going to scramble up all those anxious feelings you allready have and amplify them. On the other hand mary jane can make you face these feelings and you can overcome them. \n\nYou know your body best mate, but what you gota focus on is being okay with your situation for your wellbeing. Honestly I did not really want to smoke very much because it made me paranoid that I would not heal as fast but when I did it did not help my headaches at all, other than helping me sleep through them. I pretty much just powered through them While I did not find that mj helped my migraines, girls scout cookie strain helps with the neuropathy and I used a thc infused lotion on my droopy side. My face                  Is 98percent back 18 months later. I hope you find relief. ", "Not sure if I should see a doctor Tuesday i noticed the left side of my tongue felt kind of numb. Like, almost as if i had burned it on some hot food. Ever since then my sense if taste has felt dull. Friday my left eye started twitching constantly. It lasted all day. Over the weekend my eye stopped twitching but has felt irritated and dried out. Yesterday I noticed my lips felt weird when I tried to light a cigarette - like I could not pucker correctly, like it took extra effort for my left side of my mouth. Today I realized that when I blink, my left eye does not actually blink and is why my eye has felt so dried out. Then I started experimenting and realized I cannot raise my left eyebrow as well, I cannot flare my left nostril, I can move my left ear, I cannot even flex my left cheek. Granted there is a little bit of movement on all fronts but it is very weak. \n\nI have not been sick and there is nothing else wrong with me that I know of - could this be bell's palsy? Could be. If it is you should be started on a treatment asap. Mine just started (well, the paralyzed part) on Sunday night/Monday morning. The few days before I was having weird twitches and spasms around my eye. In hindsight it was setting in. I was super stressed Sunday. I would recommend going in as soon as available- you do not want regrets. You will be ok! It sucks, but you got to know Just got out of the doctors. I have Bells :( What did they give you med wise? Prednisone. Antibiotics for if my bloodwork comes back with something That is good.  I was put on an antiviral as well.  Just make sure you keep checking in with your doc.  Your symptoms sound exactly like how mine start.  Hang in there! Mine also started very slowly. Got prednisolon and used vitamine b12 + Cannabis oil 5%. Healed in 3 week completely. Age 27. Thank you! I happen to have B12 in the house so I am starting that today, hoping it helps some Update: It is Lyme after all. I will get started on antibiotics and hopefully this will just be a bad memory Hi, I know I am late but you should look into vitamin B12 as well. How is your recovery going? Not sure if you meant to respond to me or OP, but I did not take any B12 when i had it.  Lots of steroids and an anti viral.  It took me about 3 months to fully recovery.  I honestly could not be more thankful for my quick recovery.", "\u201cHow long does it take to recover?\u201d Hi all, this thread is for all the new people coming here and trying to get some answers. We have all been there and I hope to gather some info to help out those who are in the panic period. So, please answer the following questions and I will compile the responses into a google doc for our sidebar \n\n1. How long did it take you to recover?\n2. What is, in your opinion, the best thing for recovery?\n3. What are some things you wish someone told you  about getting BP? My answers:\n\n1: I am close to 5 years since onset and I am about 85% recovered and no more improvements \n\n2: Cutting out all bad habits like drinking/smoking and allow yourself to sleep is my advice. Also do not start forcing your muscles to move until 3-6 months. You will get synkinesis and give yourself more work later on. \n\n3: Chill out! Most people recover completely and even if you have some lingering effects, people do not notice it. You notice the difference because everyone is obsessed with themselves, other people really cannot tell/do not care that much about you. They are worried about their own lives. Relax and take it as a reminder to live better than you did before and you have turned this blip into an opportunity.  1. I would say I was recovered 85% in 3 weeks and completely recovered within around 2-3 months. Mine was a very quick recovery so I want to give people hope that you might not have to suffer for long! \n\n2. Urgent treatment (my BP came on around 10pm one night and I started steroids the next morning) and rest. \n\n3. It is ok to be upset about it, it can feel traumatic. People kept telling me that it was silly to be upset but it was terrifying, I was scared that my face would change forever. Also medical tape to tape your eye closed!  1) 2 and a half years checking in with maybe 60% recovery and no chance for any more improvement (according to two neurologists). \n\n2) Rest. Advil. Darkness. Quiet. I experienced migraines when mine came on. Also immediate medical attention, sooner you get on meds the better. And someone to support you. Its scary and hard, you need someone to empathize with you and let you cry about it. \n\n3) Physical Therapy is not always helpful. It gave me synkinesis, and did not improve my muscle function. Relearning to talk, eat, drink, and blink was a long process that just took patience, not special exercises. Phono-/photophobia are real and hard. That Is hearing and vision sensitivity. No doctor can give you answers as to \u201cwhen\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d. Just estimates and guesses because no one knows when you will heal, just the general trend. No one knows why you got it either, that is why its called idiopathic bells palsy.  If you are new, make sure the doctor puts you on steroids and anti-virals. Some will tell you that there is no cure. That is true, but there are treatments that will speed healing. \n \nI am at six months and still waiting for full recovery. I look at it as moving forward in staged. The first stage was getting past the liquid diet. The \"Jaws Wired Shut Cookbook\" came in real handy for the first couple of weeks. Once I could eat, even though it was a task for a while after that, the next stage was being able to talk. I had to support my left cheek in order to be understood. The next milestone was when I no longer needed to tape my eye shut at night. As healing continued, I developed a drum solo in my left ear. The little muscle that controls volume started spasming. Last night, there was silence. It occasionally rumbles today, but things are getting better there. I have also had the muscles in my face twitch and painlessly cramp over the last two weeks.\n \nThe hardest thing is developing patience. It will take time, and if recovery is not 100%, I will adjust. One thing I have learned over the years is that life takes its toll, and no one ever seems to have exact change. I am 3.5 years since onset. With immediate medical intervention of steroids and antibiotics (they suspected Lyme disease) I had about 50% recovery in 4 weeks. Now it is at about 90% recovery and probably not going to get any better. The best advice is to rest, be patient and adapt.  Has anyone tried acupuncture? Curious to know. Thanks Yes I tried it and did not work. There is actually no evidence that acupuncture works for anything. People in desperation try it hoping for the placebo effect and I certainly was also, but it could do more damage as well Wow - did you try steroids and antiviral drugs first then acupuncture? How long did it eventually take for you to recover or see improvement?  Yes did all medicine first. It took me almost half a year to see improvement  There is considerable evidence that acupuncture can help some conditions. Below are two studies; it seems there are many others. The general impression I got from reading a few abstracts is that a) it seems to work, b) they do not know why, and c) more large, randomized trials are needed. \n\nAcupuncture reduces chemo-induced symptoms in cancer patients:\n\n\n\nAcupuncture effective for knee arthritis:\n\n\n\n\n\n My mom has been going to acupuncture for about a month now and she is seeing lots of improvement. Being 3 months in, it is definitely speeding up the healing process. As long as you find a good doctor I think it is worth a shot! :) 1. I was diagnosed on July 19, recovered now (you can see a tiny bit of unevenness when I smile and I can tell my left eye lags by a tiny tiny bit but it is not noticeable I do not think). Took almost exactly a month. \n\n\n2. I took prednisone and antivirals for a week and then found a paper about how a form of B12 (methylcobalamin) was used in a clinical trial and led to recovery of symptoms in 2 weeks vs 9 weeks for prednisone alone. In the paper they were given intramuscular methylcobalamin 3 times a day (500mg). I could not find methylcobalamin in injectable form so I bought sublingual tablets that were 5000mg. I started by taking 3 a day (way too much) but I was worried about the sublingual vs intramuscular route. Eventually I went down to one in the morning after I started being unable to sleep all night with the 3 a day (apparently a side effect of too much b12 is insomnia?). I think the B12 helped the most. If I ever got Bell's again (hopefully not going to happen) I would make sure to take the B12 with prednisone. Also, taping my eye shut every night I think helped reduce twitching during th day.  great tip with the b12, I have seen multiple people talking about it. thanks for sharing! for those who are reading these horror stories like mine, keep in mind that people who post about their stories online are a skewed population. what I mean is that the vast majority of people who recover within weeks never post their quick recoveries. it is people like me who do not recover immediately who are the one that scourer the web for help. so, do not be misled that most people with BP have these prolonged recoveries, when in fact most recover very easily and the odds are with you for your quick recovery as well. 8 months in.\nAbout 80% recovered. Mouth still wonky but I no longer frighten children. \nEye gets a bit dry but only I would notice that. \nSmile is back. Can whistle again. \nI do a fair amount of video calls so I notice the talking out of the side of the mouth but if people met me they probably would not think anything is wrong. \nFace often feels a bit funny on the bad side. \nWhen I get headaches it is the bad side that feels the worst. I guess it will improve a bit more over time but doubt I will be back to 100%.  1- My Bells Palsy started on Oct 18th 2018 and I am about 85% recovered on November 2nd 2018! Currently the only issues I have left that I really notice are that my blinking is still off a bit and there is still some pain \n\n2- I have seen my chiropractor twice, gotten acupuncture twice, seen an osteopath once, and took prednisone and Valtrex for just over a week. Out of all of the treatments I think getting acupuncture and Chiropractic together helped the most as I noticed major changes the next day after each of my sessions. \n\n3. I was given a lot of advice when I got diagnosed but I think the most important thing with Bells Palsy is just to know that although it sucks while you have it it will go away eventually  Our experience sound similar :/ 1) took about 6 months to recover for me. I still cannot pucker my lips or suck through a straw and my eye closes when I eat or smile. Never fully regained my \"old face\".\n\n2) immediate intervention with meds. I believe I took steroids, ibuprofen and antiviral meds. My ear was sensitive to sound so I wore an earplug when at concerts or loud places. Also make sure to take care of your affected eye. Keeping it closed with an eye patch, using drops, etc. Finally, even if you think it is not impacting you emotionally if it does end up being a longer recovery it probably will. Therapy and/or meditation could help with this.\n\n3) That it could take longer than 2 weeks and for many people your face will probably not recover fully. Almost everyone I have talked to who has had it has lingering effects but every article about it says you heal quickly and back to normal in no time. A little dose of reality might have helped me prepare better. Also, my docs did not offer any physical therapy options. Wish I would have tried at least. Is this something that NEEDS to be recovered from? I am super ignorant, I thought it was something you are born with and you cannot fix it cute it. Do some people by choice just live with this?", "Diagnosed (?) With BP, advice So first of all that is what the ER is inclined to believe I have.  Mine is presenting strangely.  They started be on prednisone.  I have full control of my facial muscles still.  I smile, raise my eyebrows, toothy smile, pucker my lips but the entire left half of my face feels like it is completely fallen asleep and on the inside of my mouth as well.  Mine has been caused by Covid 19.\n\nAny tips for living with this?  My faces feels cold, liquids feel cold to the point they are hard to drink.    I am not even sure if BP is what I have.  Just looking for some guidance. BP is is the inflammation of cranial nerve 7 that controls your face. Do a bit of research on that. It will help with understanding it. Prednisone is what I was prescribed and it is good getting it early on. Most of us will have it resolve in a couple weeks to a couple months. Mine resolved to 97% normal in 3 weeks. \n\nit will probably get a bit worse in the first week or two. Get some eye drops if you cannot close your eye and lubricate the shit out of it. \n\nIt is scary but you will get through this. There is a lot of success Stories in this subreddit but also some scary ones. Do not go too deep into the rabbit hole and take time off of you can. I know what you mean. Actually the cranial nerve 7 is mostly responsible for the movements of your facial muscles, and not the sensibility of your face. So I agree, that maybe its not a bells palsy but a trigeminal neuralgia (the cranial nerv that is mostly responsible for the sensibility of your face AND CHEWING)...any problems with chewing? Go and see another doctor (Neurologist). All the best! I do not have any advice, but I got the covid vaccine a week ago and I am having the same exact symptoms as you. It started with numbness on one side of my face and today the inside of my mouth and half of my tongue feels numb as well. I went to the urgent care and they basically said that it is not a symptom and sent me home. Hi RegularSoft8,\n\n In 1995 ish, I developed a case of BP a few days after a flu vaccine. I have been trying to understand this idiopathic (no known cause) condition ever since.\n\nPersonally, I would encourage you to get facial and neck massages. Schedule chiropractic and acupuncture sessions. (There may be local schools or practitioners offering discounts if money is tight.) Gentle massage - even inside your mouth with clean finger tips can help.\n\nTalk to a local community pharmacist about supplements and vitamins. Get plenty of rest. Eat well. Take care of your health better than usual because your nerves need to regrow. Your oxygen and blood levels need to be strong to heal quickly and more completely. Be kind to yourself and be patient with slow nerve regrowth. \n\nSince the outbreak of Covid-19 it seems like BP is in the news a lot more.  I am surprised and saddened that there is not more guidance or better reporting mechanisms for people. I would think that the CDC or some medical facility would be interesting in gathering more details from people that get BP. According to this article the FDA tracks BP incidents (( \n\nTwo additional articles below are worthy of review:\n\n(\n\n( I had some similar symptoms when my BP was in its early stages, but i strongly urge you to listen to your doctors since you may have BP or something else entirely...\nPrednisone (or other steroids) is a very commonly prescribed treatment. As are anti-viral meds.    \nIf it is BP, things might get a lot worse before you recover. I hate to scare you, but for me it was very hard to accept this daily/hourly loss of function and I was not prepared. \nIt can be really hard in the beginning, but things get better! Almost everyone reports good recovery eventually, with some having a relatively quick and full recovery.\nHaving said that - BP can be really difficult to handle, and there are cases where recovery takes a lot longer or is not close to complete.    \nBe prepared for whatever happens and find someone to confide in - a partner/parent/sibling/friend/colleague you trust are amazing to have.\nListen to your doctors and take it one day at a time. You will get through this!", "Pediatrician will not prescribe meds to daughter- says they just let it run its course: wth kind of bs is that? Are there OTC things I can give? Are you taking her to a pediatrician or a pediatric neurologist? I feel like one would be more helpful and understanding than the other. Just pediatrician- have follow up Friday, it will be one week since first occurrence on Saturday. She had ct scan (norm) at er and labs drawn. Lab results came back +Lyme which is cause for bp. \n\nI suppose that if things do not get better in the coming weeks she would be referred elsewhere to a specialist. Maybe make an appointment with a pediatric neurologist and stop going to the pediatrician for the bp. I do not understand your comment. What drugs do you want prescribed? Bells Palsy pretty much just has to run its course. Most people are back to normal in 4/6 weeks. Is she being treated for the Lyme disease? First diagnosed at er(it was a sat eve)\nFirst pediatrician appt is tomorrow, only spoke to them over phone \n\nI suppose that if she needs to she will be referred to specialist, but I cannot just make an appointment myself with one- it is not how our insurance works. Yes- the amoxicillin is for the Lyme disease\n\nOTC eye drops and ointment are for her eye issues due to BP I am not a pediatrician but I am pretty sure if the BP is caused by Lyme disease, then the only treatment is treating the Lyme disease. So she is on appropriate treatment. In the absence of a treatable cause, people are generally given steroids +/- antivirals. It is not unreasonable for this person to have expected that. Yes and doctors used to prescribe antibiotics to people with the flu just to basically shut them up even though they knew it did nothing. I had Bell's a few years ago and was not prescribed anything. The ER doctor told me it was not a stroke,let it run its course, follow up with my primary care doctor and sent me home. That was inappropriate, if you presented immediately and had no contraindications to steroids then they should have been prescribed. There is good evidence that outcomes are better if steroids are prescribed. Can you link to any evidence of steroids working for Bell's Palsy? When I had my Bell's I did some research looking for relief. Even N.I.H suggest no proven treatment for Bell's Palsy. And acupressure is a complete and total scam. \n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a couple links. There is a couple more I can send too if you are interested. \"Corticosteroids and antiviral agents are widely used to treat the early stages of idiopathic facial paralysis (i.e., Bell's palsy), but their effectiveness is uncertain.\"Thanks but that is all I needed and pretty much ends this discussion. READ THE REST OF THE ARTICLE. That is the question they were studying. The conclusion of their study is that the steroids did show benefit. You literally read one sentence and then stopped. If you are going to ask me to link evidence, please actually spend more than 10 seconds in the article before dismissing it. Why do I need to read an article that states it is conclusions in the opening statement? Okay. Got it. You are trolling. You had me going there for a bit. Have a nice night. I am not trolling anyone. I am simply saying that there is no clear cut treatment for Bell's. I looked at the article and it is true that cortisone does seem to help but at the end of the day Bell's is going to be different for each person and most people have recovered with no treatment in about 4/6 weeks. There is treatment: steroids. You are correct that there is no cure but there is a treatment. Everyone who presents in the first few days should be started on steroids immediately unless there are contraindications to steroids. Steroids improve outcomes.  That is what these articles say and that is what I originally said. You are correct, people will generally recover some or all of their function with or without steroids, but what I am saying is with steroids they are more likely to recover more function.  There is evidence that steroids help so they should be given. The data shows this. Yes every person is different, but why gamble? We know steroids help. I think it can really make a difference if the person's scans (CT or MRI) show inflamed nerves or tissue and they get started on steroids to help the inflammation to calm the nerves down.", "So today marks 7 months with Bells Palsy ans let me tell you its been a journey I want to say im about 90% recovered. I still have not gotten my smile back . But i have faith that i will be back to normal. You guys dont loose hope, try to relax I know its hard but not impossible! Hang in there  Does your cheek move at all when you smile? Did your eye heal 100%? I hear you :) That is great you are at 90%. It is rough it took 7 months. I am at 9 weeks and I can feel things coming together. Are you doing any acupuncture or electrical stimultation?? my cheek moves but when i do duck lips it dosent really lift which sucks but im hoping it gets better..  yes my eye is 100% I can close it without any problem! Well im hoping i have more recovery! Wish my smile comes back. Its been a long hard journey! Yay, im glad your feeling like that im sure it will. I actually did both, acupuncture and electrical stimulation. How about you? I did acupuncture for 3 weeks until I could not afford it. I am doing electrical stimulation to see if I can keep muscle tone. Right now its weird, when I attempt to smile I kind  of get tinnitus and sound is blocked out. I think it has to do with the ear canal inflammation.  I feel you its expensive especially when paying out of pocket. Electrical Stimulation I stopped because they told me that i was prone easier for synkenesis But that is my case. I still have that sometimes that when I smile my ear gets blocked out. But as time goes by that is wearing off.  I am at week 14 and still cannot blink, my smile has cracked open a little and can not move my forehead. My face looks more symmetrical though. When was your biggest breakthrough?", "Pain from Bell\u2019s palsy? Does anyone else suffer from dizziness and/or pain?? Every time I swallow something I get a sharp pain in my ear. And there is a constant dull pain in my jaw I was diagnosed on Friday and I have been very dizzy/have vertigo. I have no pain (yet) but my hearing feels off. Sometimes it feels like my ear on the unaffected side is full. I read online that Ramsay Hunt syndrome causes dizziness and ear pain along with facial drooping but I think it is treated the same as regular BP. I really do not know though this is my first time ever dealing with something like this! I am definitely alarmed by the dizziness. \nHope we both feel better soon! I am going to follow up with my regular doctor this week to see if there is anything they can do for me. I had and still have some horrible pain from it. The pain alone will make you dizzy. It is all a connected unit unfortunately. Doing the exercises helped a bit, especially the pulling up parts of the face, like for whatever reason you never realize how much tension is in the smile. TLDR; vertigo is normal for ramsey hunt but go see a physiotherapist who specialises in vertigo and neurological disorders.\n\nIll reply to you and the OP. I was diagnosed with ramsey hunt which is BP but with the underlying cause of the BP being an ear infection from the herpes zoster virus. I had extreme vertigo and major muscle and nerve pain in one side of my face and it is definitely completely normal and will subside. It took forever for my vertigo to pass but it will i promise.\n\nMy best suggestion would be to go so a Physiotherapist that specialises in neurologically disorders and vertigo. They will be able to help fix the vertigo.\n\nSee with Ramsey Hunt there can be 2 different causes of the vertigo. Due to the ear infection you can have a BPPV related vertigo which is when one of the crystalline hairs comes loose and starts triggering some of your movement sensors.\n\nThe other type is due to damage to the facial nerve and other closely related nerves that send information from the ear to the brain. This causes a mismatch in information to the brain causing your brain to go haywire and feel dizzy.\n\nHope this helped!!! Thank you! I will ask my doctor about this. I wonder if I do have Ramsey Hunt though because I do not have any pain (fingers crossed). I would give anything for the vertigo and dizziness to stop. No improvement yet despite being on a moderate dose of prednisone for several days. I do think my smile is looking a little less droopy though. I also found the prednisone made my vertigo worse but that doesnt mean to stop taking it as it is definitely the best thing to help with the BP. Ask the doc for an ear swab for Ramsey Hunt and you can get the test results to see if it is or not. Day 11 of my BP and the stabbing pain I am having is unreal behind my ear and running down my jawline I hope this means it is getting better but never had pain like this before in my life The pain in my jaw has got so much worse! And now the other side of my face keeps twitching and my ear is sore on it. (Same thing that happened before paralysis of other side) I hope I do not get it on both sides.. I am already really embarrassed about it Omg yess\nI have TMJ so I thought it was that, that was causing it.\nMy symptoms started to set like a month before, I had terrible headaches and ear pain at night whej I cried myself to sleep or even when I was stressed.\nI was dizzy before and after, it gets better though so no worries. The worst days are just the 72 onset days since you have no idea what is happening Could you please elaborate on the ear swab test for Ramsay Hunt? My husband has ear, jaw, face, and neck pain on the affected side. And he has sores on his tongue, dry mouth (severely diminished saliva production), and bad/messed up taste in his mouth. He has experienced mild dizziness from time to time since his BP diagnosis 13 days ago. He also had a mysterious rash on his toes that preceded the facial palsy and oral symptoms. The oral symptoms + mysterious toe rash has made us wonder if he has Ramsay Hunt and I would like him to get tested for it if possible. If you could look up your records and tell us what the ear swab test was called (in medical parlance) it would be hugely helpful. Thanks! I believe to my best knowledge in my case they were checking for shingles (herpes zoster virus) and if it started with a rash i would highly suggest getting a test as well. The first thing they searched on me when they were checking me for ramsey hunt was for a rash to indicate the shingles virus.\n\nI lost feeling in my mouth (taste buds), face, neck and dizziness as well that had a delayed onset.\n\nAgain id say without a doubt CONVINCE HIM TO GET A SWAB OR ANY TEST FOR THE HERPES ZOSTER VIRUS or any related viruses", "Got diagnosed today and I am honestly pretty worried. I got diagnosed today after I recently tested positive for covid (not sure if they are related). It is pretty nerve racking when just yesterday I had fun control of my face. More worried about how people will see me I think. Hopefully I fully recover. I have read instances of recovery within a few months but even that seems long and I am not sure how I will be perceived by the people around me in that time. Sorry about the rant, just writing my thoughts in case anyone has similar feelings. Take your b vitamins and also, get on prednisone ASAP. You only have like 4 days since the onset of your symptoms for prednisone to increae your chances for full recovery Hi yea, I have already gotten my steroids and antivirals. Just bought vitamin b as well. Already started the antivirals. Thanks for your input. Mostly worried about the psychological aspect of it. Find it hard to look at my face in the mirror Hi! I am sorry you are going through this. It will be tough (unfortunately) but it will pass, I promise. I did not have any sign of recovery for 3 weeks and felt very insecure and even had an identity crisis because I could not look into the mirror without crying. Had made peace with the fact that my face will not fully recover. However, now after 3 months I am healed around 95% and noone but me notices it anymore. It will get better! Even if it does not seem like it. I would recommend taking pictures/videos of yourself every day or every few days. That has helped with my mental health (because most changes are very tiny and happen over a long period so you will not notice it looking into a mirror). Take time to rest! I am wishing you a speedy recovery! I am also pretty worried how I will be viewed by others. It is not so bad meeting medical staff, receptionists or cashiers because to those people it really does not matter that much how you look and it is such a brief meeting. When I am in public I try not to move my face too much so that my condition is not too noticable and wearing masks helps. But it is better to try to move your face as much as possible so do not force yourself not to move it! I am just too selfconscious. I do not know how I will interact with friends or coworkers. Luckily I still have a week before I will go back to work. I think I can convince my boss to let me work from home exclusively for some time but before my condition she wanted me to show up in the office more often. \n\nDo not worry. Usually people recover very quickly from BP. I know of two people that quickly recovered in just two weeks. An elderly person in my family suffered from it this year and a friend of a friend about a year ago. Just do not ignore your symptoms and take plenty of rest, as much as possible and do everything that your doctors told you. I just do not have anybody to support me when I am sick and that is why I expect my recovery to take a long time. I have a family but now I know they will not do much for me. Could be worse. I have a full medical care covered by my employer, a house over my head, a borrowed car and I still have a job.\n\nI recommend that you watch a comedy movie and let yourself laugh freely to relax and exercise your facial muscles so that you will not feel selfconscious about your expression. Stay as positive as you can. I took the steroids and antivirals for 10 days as prescribed, had little to no movement for the first 2 weeks.\n\nBy week 3 everything seemed to come back within the space of 3/4 days, I was able to smile, blink, move my forehead and cheeks etc. \n\nI took B12 Vitamins every day (and continue to still take them). \n\nI also started acupuncture sessions twice a week, 6 days into being diagnosed. Whether or not this sped up my recovery I will never know, but after seeing positive reviews, I wanted to try everything I could in order to feel \u201cin control\u201d of my recovery.\n\nI used a jade roller twice a day, morning and night for 15 minutes, just to massage the areas. \n\nGet lost of rest (I seemed to sleep a lot more than usual), and try to minimise stress levels as this will only impact your recovery time. \n\nDo not think or wordy about what others are thinking. Chances are they will barely even notice. \n\nWishing you a speedy recovery! The psychological part is the hardest. I did not want to leave the house. But do not hide away, just try to carry on with your life as much as you can. \n\nBut believe me, it will disappear just as fast as it appeared.", "HELLO CAN BELLY BUTTON INFECTION CAUSE BELL'S PALSY? No no, it is Bells Palsy, not Belly's Palsy.\n\n^ I gots jokes, but I really cannot answer your question and I am not sure anyone else here could either. This is why we continue to need Yahoo Answers. Shingles can cause all sorts of unusual skin sensations, pain and irritations, sometimes located around the belly button. Bell's palsy can be shingles related. That is the only link I can see. Highly doubted but if you are concerned, see a doctor to treat your belly button and run tests on your head.", "Positivity post! It does get better I woke up one morning with a pain in my neck and just assumed I had slept funny. The next day I began to notice that my face was not moving quite as it should be. That evening I went to get checked out and was given 10 days of steroids. I would say my face got continually worse during the first week but then stabilised shortly after that. By the end of week 2 I could start to see minor improvements, my eye was no longer hurting because I could close it a little bit more. I continually noticed improvements everyday and then by the end of week 3 I was completely back to normal! \n\nMy advice would be just try not to worry. I know that is easier said than done but I spent the whole time completely miserable but looking back now there was absolutely no need. Worrying and being down in the dumps will not make it go away any faster. Also make sure you always got some decent eye drops with you, they were a life saver for me\n\nChances are it will get better and it will get better quick! Try and stay positive \u263a\ufe0f That is great to hear.  I had a similar issue. Had several health scares all at once and woke up one morning not able to open my mouth to brush my teeth.  Went to the dr the next day and he says it was mild Bells. He did not give me the steroids,  but antibiotics.  Told me not to stress about it and to try to do little facial excercises.  \n\nWorking from home so I did not have to see people, because I was embarrassed with my other issues.  Took my meds and did the little exercises.  Kept seeing minor improvements which kept me positive.  Took about 4-5 weeks till I considered myself recovered.  Been 2 months and still feel it a little,  but I have full movement of my face again and got the dimples to my smile back. Gosh that must have been awful for you, I am relieved I only had to deal with that. The little improvements are amazing, as soon as I noticed them I did not feel so deflated. I bet you are pleased to have your smile back, that is what upset me the most! I think we are both lucky to recover so quickly. As I have been in this group, we have been very lucky. It is about staying positive and not letting yourself stress out over it. I agree we are lucky! However I think people who have got over it as quickly are less likely to post about it. Wow week 3!! Good for you! May I ask if you did anything else? I am on week 4 and I have been doing acupuncture 3x/week and took steroids + antiviral and supplements.  I do not have mobility in my face but my headache and eye ache is gone and i can blink more normally No I did not really do anything different, I just tried to rest as much as possible which was not actually very much. By the sounds of it you are on your way to getting better anyway so try not to worry! Everyone recovers at different rates and it sounds like you are doing pretty well even if it does not feel like it right now", "Prednisone I was diagnosed with BP on Sunday. I started Prednisone yesterday (Monday) and just learned after 2 days of taking it that I should not have chewed the tablet. it is only a 5 day dosage of 50mg and then I take 20mg tapering prednisone. did I mess up my chance at recovery by chewing the tablet? has anybody else been treated with prednisone? how did you feel? Prednisone and acyclovir are the main drugs they give at the onset of BP. I would call your doctor and check if your dosage should be adjusted because you chewed the first couple pills. I think it should be okay, as I read chewing the tablets only increases the chances of side effects. But check with the doc anyway.", "32F in Neuro Ward, Undiagnosed.

Apologies. I am posting from my phone on the browser so I was not able to add this to the og post but heres more explanation:\nThis is my face almost 6 years since I had Bells Palsy. The recovery for me was very very slow. It took almost 2 months to regain about 50% of movement. After about 5 months I had regained the majority of my facial movement but as you can see I never fully got my normal face back. I am still very self conscious about my smile and my pucker/kissy face. I cannot suck through straws, swish water in my mouth, etc because I can hardly control my lip muscles on the affected side. my lazy eye when I smile is my least favorite. Anyone know of surgery options or physical therapy so late after the fact? I am also curious about this. I had my BP attack back in July, and I have seen little to no improvement. Maybe 20%. I am worried that it will be like this permanently. The only options that I have found (I am also 6 years post diagnosis) isa specialist in California. You can find his website ( Other places have been popping up similar to his practice but he seems to have the most experience in the field of BP, facial reanimation, and other options. If some of it is caused by synkinesis (the eye squinting might be; i have got a similar thing) then I think you can use botox to fix it.\n\nI called a dermatologist about it and never did get a consult, but I will may look into it in the future.\n\nI talked to a physiatrist and he had no ideas for how to help, so I think it is worth talking to neurologists and dermatologists/plastic surgeons to see what they can do.\n\nIf you end up getting some consults, I would love to hear about your experience.\n\nalso, you are beautiful regardless and people probably do not notice as much as you do (but I totally get why you feel this way because it is the same for me too) Thank you for posting this! I had BP 6 years ago as well and by looking at your pics, our recovery amount is really similar. \n\nI am with you on the eye being the thing that bugs me the most. I have nicknamed it \"my little eye\" and try to talk about it like it is a pet or something. Weird, yes but it makes me laugh. Dr. Panossiasian in pasadena.  Botox and filller.

Does that make sense?  Basically listen to your body!   From what I have read, they say to run due to it moving blood around and your face needs to get as much blood circulation as possible right now.  I was told to moisturize my eye even more frequently when exercising but I personally could not at all as my episode was keeping me exhausted all the bloody time almost failed that semester That was the conclusion I was thinking!! But I guess they can not officially say that since it has not been \"proven\" Yea that is the thing, I feel completely well besides the mental aspect of how I look and the eye thing.

Or other tips to adapt to sleeping with a paralyzed eye? I should also note that I do use eye lubricant regularly. I use artificial tear eye drops twice a day at least and rather than using the tape the doctor provides, I found a very similar one at the drugstore called \"Band-Aid First Aid Hurt-Free Medical Paper Tape.\" I also often put a cotton round over my eye and use minimal tape to just hold it over my eye/keep my eye closed. It is not as strong but I prefer it because it does not cause pain to remove it as needed.\n\nGood luck! I used to put artificial tears in then cover my eye with a folded up tissue and then do one wrap of tape around my whole head and go to sleep. Not the smartest but it worked every time I completely avoided tape. I used extra thick eye ointment (its called Lacrilube in UK, could just buy it over the pharmacy counter) closed my eye and used a soft sleep mask to hold it closed. The normal eye drops they give out are useless. There is another ointment that is thicker than the artificial tears but I cannot remember the name of it, ask your doctor for better drops. Get Genteal Severe Dry Eye Gel and better tape. I cleaned my cheek and forehead with alcohol to remove any oils. I put in two drops of the Genteel and put the tape on my cheek first. Then, I pulled the tape up until the eye was completely shut, pulled my forehead down, and then stuck the tape to my forehead. It held the eye closed until morning. I then relubed with Systane as soon as I awakened, and as needed after that. A little of my wife\u2019s lotion took care of any dryness of my cheek and forehead. Thank you for the advice guys, I really appreciate it! There is an eye gel in the US that was recommended to us by our eye doctor instead of taping: Systane Gel I use glad press-n-seal cause eye patches they sell at CVS eventually start irritating the skin.", "Mom recently diagnosed, had some questions My mom was diagnosed yesterday at the ER. The doctors thought she was having a stroke at first but thankfully that was ruled out via a CT. It began on her mouth/jaw area where she could not fully smile and as the day went on it (paralysis) progressed to the remainder right side of her face. The ointment really helped her sleep at night as she cannot fully close her eyelid. I got her drops for the day.  I also got her these patches to cover her lids, the tape on it is really gentle so it does not pull on her skin as much. The neurologist simply said she had a form of bell's palsy and prescribed steroids for a little over a week. She started doing these facial exercises but tommorrow we will go see her primary doctor to hopefully get a referral for physical therapy. I read the healing process is different for everyone, I hope she sees some improvement soon. For now I an trying to keep her upbeat and relaxed. The ER recommended for her to see an ENT, does anyone know why? She is able to breath and hear fine. She does not have any pain, just discomfort when eating as she cannot fully chew. She is able to taste her food as well. Have any of you seen immediate improvement after receiving physical therapy?\nThank you for your feedback!", "Eye tearing when chewing... I have been dealing with BP since last April, and I am finally starting to see some progress and my symptoms do not seem to be noticeable to others.  One thing still lingers...my left eye (affected side) tears up whenever I eat/chew. \n\nHas anyone else encountered this? Is there any way to get through a meal without having to wipe your eyes constantly?", "Bell's Palsy from Vaccine Hey guys. I have read that the vaccine from Pfizer caused Bell's Palsy in 4 patients that were participating in the tests. However, this number of people does not yet mean any causality from the vaccine since it is the normal frequency in the general population. I (25 M) have had Bell's Palsy 3 years ago. Is anyone also worried about the reoccurrence in the people that already had it? Honestly, I would rather have a recurrence than die of COVID, but yeah this is a little unpleasant to think about. I get my vaccine tomorrow. Depending on the age that is an argument to make. Good luck with the vaccine :D Yeah, I am 28 but I am a front line healthcare worker with a young child and an elderly and medically fragile parent. I agree it depends on personal circumstances, but also the larger population you might come in contact with. Thanks! Im not worried. Because it is just plain stupid to think that the vaccine will triggers Bell's Palsy. Agree to disagree. Although the success rate is pretty high, we do not know anything about the long term effects. A vaccine would normally take years, decades to be approved after it passes all the test phases. I had my vaccine on the 18th and my Bell\u2019s palsy flared up right at the 15 minute mark. It resolved after two hours. The head of Infection Control at my hospital told me that I am not allowed to take the second dose, so I am pretty bummed. Yeah that is upsetting. Have you had Bells palsy in the past? These are a new ( They are faster to develop. Ditto to the OP\u2019s question. And if you did have it before, did it resolve completely? Viruses like COVID can also cause BP. So even if the vaccine might (and that is not been established very convincingly) then I would wager the rate is still lower than getting the virus itself. It is like saying braking fast to avoid an accident can cause whiplash. Sure, but not braking fast and having an accident can cause whiplash too, and a lot worse. You have had multiple episodes before, right? Anything else you have been able to identify as a possible trigger? I saw they began working on this type of vaccine originally for SARS, tweaked it a bit for this specific virus. There is some data already. Given the enormity of the pandemic, they have had a lot of very smart people working on this, and a lot of money and motivation to figure it out quickly... Also, from what we know about modern vaccine side effects in general, they tend to show up fairly quickly, not years later. My first episode was in 2015. That lasted one week but I started medication right away. I also had one during nursing school and early this year when the pandemic started. It seems like for me it starts because of stress and does not last too long. The first time was the longest time i had symptoms. Adding an update here. I got my vaccine today and have had no changes to my face. My bell\u2019s is 1.5 years old and 80% recovered. I just made a separate post- but I got my first dose of the vaccine 1.5 days ago and have not had a BP flare up.", "Diagnosed when I was 37 weeks pregnant It has been more than 3 months since I am diagnosed. I was given steroids and was told to rest and sleep (which is impossible with a newborn). I started doing acupuncture and low level laser therapy but has not seen any improvement. I still cannot move half my face. I honestly miss my smile. \n\nFor those who recovered and had some \u201cmovement \u201c. Did it happen quickly or did you had small movement\u2019s initially? Any success stories of those who had minimal improvement after 3 months and eventually recovered? I was diagnosed at 26 weeks the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. On Friday, I started taking B-6 and B-12 in addition to prednisone and the anti-viral. I started acupuncture the following Monday. After 2 acupuncture treatments, the whooshing sound in my ear has abated, and I have a little mouth and eye movement improvement. When did you start acupuncture? Have you seen a neurologist? I have read that some started seeing improvement after a B vitamin injection - has a doctor suggested this to you? Hi. I had 2 acupuncture sessions (once a week) and I have noticed that my face is not droopy anymore. But still no movement. I was able to close my eyes and blink after I gave birth (when all the pregnancy swelling is gone). I have seen a neurologist and had MRI. I just need to see him again to discuss the MRI results. I have not researched on B12 injections. Not sure if it is available here in Australia and if it is safe with breastfeeding. It can take several months to start seeing any movement at all. Slow and steady is the recovery and it is not typical to notice improvement in a short period even with treatment. You can over do it and cause permanent synkinesis. Seboseb0: Have you only had 2 acupuncture sessions? I went for my third today. I have improvement in my smile, and my eye is less droopy. I believe the acupuncture is helping. I am on a schedule to go to acupuncture twice a week. My neurologist classified my BP as mild-moderate, but he only first saw me 13 days after onset and after 3 acupuncture sessions. He did not see me at the most acute stage. Yeah. I started late with acupuncture treatment because I was initially doing the low level laser therapy. I had a few sessions of those when I found a great acupuncturist near me. I had an assisted (forceps) normal delivery and I struggled with pain post delivery because of my episiotomy. So it took a while for me to start treatment. :( I have noticed just this morning that there is a tiny bit of movement when i try to smile and some tiny movements on my cheeks.", "One month since diagnosis.. I just wanted to vent, I guess. I have made ZERO improvement. \n\nThe only silver lining is that my dr has placed me out of work on disability for a few months so hopefully that will help somehow (less stress maybe?) \n\nUGH. I want to get better already. I do not even care if it is a little bit at a time, I just want to see some improvement! \n\nOk, I am done whining now. It is been about the same amount of time for me. I went on YouTube and found found some exercises. They are really helping I do them once a day. Little by little I can see and feel improvement. Some of my co-workers have said my face is not drooping as much. Good Luck!! Keep your chin up!! I had zero improvement for almost exactly 3 months. Very disheartening.  Then I made vast recovery within just a few weeks after that.  I am not 100% but I bet you can be! Can you tell me what one(s) you use? I am 2-3 months in and had a little bit of recovery before losing it all (very stressful events lately) That is great that your doctor gave you time off of work to recover. I was put off from work for 1.5 weeks and felt like I needed a lot more time off since my job is extremely stressful (mental health worker). When I asked my doctor she said if I used my face for work, like an actor or model, she could justify more time off, but since I do not and my speech was not super slurred (but it was slurred slightly), she could not give me more time off. It was extremely frustrating.\n\nI started going to acupuncture within the first week and went 3 times a week for the first month. I think that helped me out a lot. I am almost fully recovered and it is been about 6 weeks since onset. I had zero improvement until about 7 weeks, it was like almost over night then...hope you see some changes, best of luck! I agree with acupuncture. I had bells &amp; went every other day, it was the only thing that helped in the beginning. Just type in bell's palsy exercises and I also massage my face I have had a lot of pain in my neck so I use essential oils like lavender oil it helps heal the nerves I am at two months and I have not seen any improvement. I fell like it is a bit stronger, but I am not seeing movement.  It is frustrating. Try KT tape if you have not already!  I am on my 8th episode since 1999.  It is been exactly 2 weeks since the onset of symptoms, and I have noticed a much quicker improvement than previous episodes.  I also take vitamin B12,  turmeric, 100 mg of CBD oil, and Lions Mane mushroom capsules on a daily basis.  Have my first acupuncture appointment in 2 weeks. Thank you!!! I am going to try this :) Thank you for the kind words! I appreciate it so much. I have had a few people recommend acupuncture... I am thinking about trying it. At this point, I am sure it cannot hurt anything so I might as well. \n\nI am sorry about your doctor and the disability stuff. The first 2 doctors I saw just kind of shrugged it off and wrote me a note for work for a couple days. It was actually the 3rd doctor I saw who insisted I go off on disability and take the time to heal / De-stress. I am eternally grateful that I found her. Thank you for giving me hope!! Just looked into the KT tape... I think I am going to try that!!! Please do not spread BS like \u201clavender oil healing nerves\u201d It is not BS but I am not here to cause trouble since your a DR. It is been deleted You are welcome. It is a really tough thing to go through! Not sure if your interested in trying CBD oil...but I used it and within 15 minutes of taking it  each time I could feel my nerves twitching and trying to work in my effected side. Not sure if it actually made my recovery faster, but I do think it helped. It took me 4 months to see any improvement at all. I am. 5.5 months out now and am at least 50% improved.", "Wife's Long Term Recovery Help Hello -\n\nI just joined as I am looking for help for my wife's recovery from Bells Palsy. She is now going on a year and a half since initial diagnosis. She got the typical steroids and antivirals the moment it happened (thank goodness). She was pregnant at the time, so we induced labor at 39 weeks in the hopes that the cause was linked to our daughter hitting a nerve somehow.\n\nNow that it is past the year mark, my wife is very distraught. I feel like I am partial to blame as I was not a believer in acupuncture as a treatment at first, but then she began acupuncture treatments at 6 months since the diagnosis and it improved dramatically. The issue is that our acupuncturist was overbooked, and our health insurance would not cover any other acupuncturist, so at best she saw her two times a month. I have seen/heard people say that once a week or more often removed symptoms very quickly, but we were trying to be financially smart. In retrospect, wish we had just ponied up the cash.\n\nNow that we are all stuck inside, I am trying to think of ways I can help her recovery. She is maybe at around 75% recovered. I saw some advice on Vitamin B12 from a year ago on this sub? She uses eye ointment to keep her eye from getting dry - that is the one thing I was on top of from day one. She obviously cannot make it to the acupuncturist with shelter-in-place. Is there anything else I can do?\n\nThanks for any help/advice given. Hello,  unfortunately everybody recovers differently.  I am 13 months post-diagnosis.  I was totally stone-faced for 3 months, and then recovered from there to about 75% over the course of a month or two. So I have been living with 75% recovery for about 8 months, and I do not expect it to get better.\n\nThere is lots of conflicting information about acupuncture and BP.  Some people report improvement, some not.  \n\nThe only medically proven treatments are antivirals and steroids.  Everything else is anecdotal.  For the record, I have done everything other than acupuncture (B12, CBD, etc).  I think \\*my\\* biggest mistake was not doing my prescribed PT once healing began.  I have mild synkinesis now, and I think the PT would have helped that. Thank you - yes, I was not sure about the acupuncture...but now that it is dragged out, it is hard not to feel like we should have done more of it. This is helpful. 4 years post diagnosis. About 15% recovery over 4 years. \n\nI highly do not recommend electric stimulation therapy. It does more harm than good for the sensitive and fragile facial nerves. \n\nUnfortunately its all time based. A majority of people recover. 5% of us do not. I am in the 5% since my recovery stalled after relearning how to blink my eye. It is what it is and there is no cure or treatment. Its not very well researched in terms of finding a cause and a cure. \n\nJust keep being encouraging. My best friend keeps telling me that he only knows my broken face and its his favorite face since its the only one hes ever known.", "Did not start steroids until 48 hours after symptoms because ER doc said they were not worth it at all I researched and saw that she was wrong, but I wonder if I waited too long? I am on day 4 and right face is paralyzed I went to urgent care on a Friday and was given a very very low dose of steroids.  It was not until Monday when I saw my PCP that I was given a higher dose for longer duration plus anti-virals and I made a full recovery so I think you will be ok! Write an angry letter to the ER. Standard practice per the book is to start \\~60mg per day. My GP - having never seen it in person - checked the reference.\n\nThat kind of mistake says \"malpractice magnet,\" and hospital administration will be riding their ass like a Grand Canyon burro. Interesting i also went to urgent care and the doctor gave me 5 days of 6oMG of Prednisone and having no idea what is a low or high dose. He also gave me a referral to a neurologist. That is the standard response.   \n\n\nWhen in doubt doctors are supposed to follow the book, not send you home with no medication. Yes he stated he was 95% sure it was BP, but ordered a Cat scan to get it to 100% and rule out anything like stroke. For how long did you take antivirals? My doc only prescribed 30mg of Prednisone per day for 5 days then tapering. Am I taking too little?? Im not a doctor. But the research said yes that is too little (unless you are a very tiny person) Have you come across any research that said starting Prednisone at 7 days is too late? I can still increase my dosage. Yeah. Unfortunately. Protocol is that it needs to be started within 72 hours", "Synkenesis recovery? I am 6 months out from my diagnosis and about 80% recovered, but developed synkenesis. I read that there are different treatment options - massage, training, Botox. Has anyone tried any of these and found them helpful? Or did you find that your synkenesis improved on its own in time? Thanks! I am 5 years out and probably 75-80% recovered. Most people cannot tell, but I can. Botox helps, especially with the eye and the platysma muscle so it gives me a more even smile,  but it wears off after 3 months and is sometimes hit or miss. I tried some of the training but it really requires time and I never felt like I was making progress. \n\nLots of discussion of this topic if you Join this group on Facebook:  Bells Palsy/Facial Paralysis One Year or More That is an awesome resource, thank you!\n\nI read that the Botox, while wearing off between treatments, can also cause long term improvement at some point. Did you notice any difference after your Botox wears off or does your face go back to the way it looked before Botox? I have not had Botox yet but for the last month I have been practicing keeping my eye open when smiling and have noticed a definite decrease in synkinesis there. \n\nI have also heard that Botox is temporary, but if you use it alongside facial retraining, the results are permanent. I think there have been some mild changes, but it pretty much goes back. I have heard that Botox plus exercises can be better for permanent changes.", "Crocodile tears? Hi all! Hope you are all doing well. \n\nI have recently started having crocodile tears from my \"bad\" eye (2 months post diagnosis with not much recovery yet)... I am just wondering if this is a good sign? I would assume so... I am crossing my fingers! Things will come and go- but anything is something! \n\nIs it cold where you are recently? I live in Midwest and the first real cold really affected me , as well as the air becoming dryer- causing crocodile tears for me too!\n\nHave you tried anything yet? I have been given  advice to use everything under the sun- idk how many different oils my friend has given me (given thank god because that little bottle is $40- and does nothing 3 months in\ud83e\udd74). I am recently starting to try cbd oil, and gluten free. Just wondering if you have used anything that has or has not helped I am in CA, so it is not cold yet lol! \n\nI have tried acupuncture, physical therapy (basically making faces and getting a massage twice a week lol), B12 shots and that is it so far. \n\nI am honestly willing to try literally anything to get my face back at this point. \n\nI was thinking the tears might be a good sign because I have not really been able to produce any for months... you are right though, could have been from wind or something. Yes, it is good!! I had Bells Palsy a few months ago and fully recovered. \n\nI would practice facial exercises in addition to what your doing already. The biggest thing that I felt help was to cut out any food that caused inflammation, acupuncture, magnesium lotion, resting, tapping my eye shut at night. \n\nJust know it will heal,give it time.", "Any vegan here has ever faced bells palsy?  absolutely my friend", "Got BP after first Pfizer shot should I get the second I got bp about 11 days after first shot on July 25 it took 3 weeks to fully recover and my second shot was due 30 august my bp was pretty mild but in worries it will happen again if I get the second shot as side affects are usually worse :/ but I would also like to be fully vaccinated so idk Up to you, but Bell's Palsy is not contagious. I am double vaxxed. I got my second dose months ago. My BP came in mid August. Get the second shot but have prednisone on hand in case it starts up again that way you can use the prednisone to avoid permanent damage for bells BP sucks, but it is temporary. The side effects from COVID could last a lot longer and be more detrimental. Take the shot. BP cannot kill you, but COVID can. My doctor (and Pfizer agreed when I talked with them on the phone) suggested I get vaccinated with the second dose after fully recovering. Sounds like you are recovered and that it was a mild case, so I say you are safe. It is important to get the second dose.\n\nI am still waiting to recover fully myself... Same here. I got my first shot on July 31 and since then I am struggling with BP. Mine was not mild and it is not improving, even after almost 2 months. I am getting my second shot in October and I am REALLY REALLY scared.\nI used to be the first person to tell people to get the vaccine but now, I do not know anymore. Yeah I feel pretty much the same I also have school now so not being able to talk properly would be a real pain especially if I become fully paralysed or something Yeah that makes a ton of sense but I am pretty sure I have had covid before because my basketball coach had it and I was shaking hands with him and sitting right next to him on the bench I was probably asymptomatic tho since I did not get sick(I am 16) I feel like I might get a full paralysis on one side of my face or both because when I had bp it actually spread to the other side of my face before recovering which would be horrible as I have school now and it would fuck everything up and might take months to recover from instead of weeks so I am kind of scared but if I have had covid before I am pretty much fully vaxed and would explain the more serious side effects I had but that is just speculation on my part Yeah idk man I have had some inflammatory problems before like asthma and I cannot get full or partial paralysis now I have school some I am real conflicted I wish this never happened :/ Sounds like a solid idea I might ask my doctor but I have some other concerns you can read my other replied it is really confusing I am asthmatic as well. I would rather have BP than be dead. True but I am very unlikely to die from covid so that is kind of a false dichotomy idk Ok thanks for the advice but what if I get more serious symptoms this time I cannot afford that now I am in school", "A question about eye taping. I was diagnosed yesterday when I woke up with complete paralysis on the left side of my face after two days of what I thought was an ear infection from swimming. A scary experience for sure, but I have finally mastered the art of the single raised eyebrow, so I can look super skeptical whenever I want now. Quite useful these days.\n\nI have been told to tape my eye shut at night or whenever I am somewhere windy or it is feeling tired/dry, but I am having trouble finding a good taping technique. My eye seems very determined to drift open regardless\n\nThe doctor recommended a gauze eye pad taped over it to hold it closed, but after several tries, I cannot seem to get it taped tight enough to stop my eye from opening behind the eye pad. \n\nThe pharmacist recommended a single thin strip of tape vertically across the eyelid and the internet recommended a wide piece of tape horizontally over the whole eye area. The first one, my eyelid just kind of bent up under the tape and I was afraid the bottom of the tape would come loose and swing into my eye. The second worked well for about 10 minutes, and then the moisture in my eye loosened the tape and my eye once again popped open under the tape. \n\nSo I figured I would ask people who have been through this adventure before. Any tips/tricks/advice on successfully taping your eye shut? I call it eye glue, but its actually just Eye Gel. So really thick eye drops. Put that in, then tape your eye shut. The gel really helps keep it moist but also keep your eyelid shut at night I have a thick night time eye ointment (Systane night time eye ointment), but maybe I put it on wrong. It is a thick gel and you put a 1cm long line just under the lower lash line, and then to close the eye and move it round. Does that sound like a similar product? \n\nMy eye gets so watery when I put anything in it (which I think is 9/10ths of my problem with taping) that it might just have mostly washed away, but I did not notice it really helping to hold things shut. Make sure you dry your eye as much as possible before taping. Wipe it several times over with a dry towel or paper towel, even if it feels dry, wipe again. \nI would recommend a thin vertical strip from upper eyelid down to the cheek and then a thick horizontal strip over this to secure it in place. Let me know how you get on. \n\nQualifications to give advice:  Burns and Plastics Physiotherapist, Facial Palsy specialist That Is what I used. It made my eye so sticky. Then I shall blame it on my perpetually watery eye! Hopefully it will calm down in a few days. Thanks for the advice! I will give that a shot tonight! I hope it does too! I am 4 years out from diagnosis and now I have synkinesis. My eye cries whenever it wants for no reason. That does not sound fun at all! I switched back and forth between the thin paper tape and the wider paper tape.  The wider kind definitely provides a better \"shut,\" but is also harder to get off in the morning.\n\nMake sure the eyelid is clean and dry (Systane is a life saver at night, but it will 100% make the tape come off if there is any on your eyelid).  \n\nI tried to get a good \"stick\" on the tape, beginning at the top of the lid (basically the top of my eyeball) but not so far as to get the underside of the brow. Then draw the tape down across the whole upper lid, using my free hand to hold the lid closed, and then down across my check, down almost to the end of my nose.\n\nTear the tape before you apply it, of course.  It took me several nights to get it right, but eventually it will become second nature.  In fact, I still do it from time to time when I struggle with synkinesis.\n\nI also used these during the day when I was outside of the house.  The foam seal makes them almost like goggles, so they keep dust and wind out, but they do not look TOO goofy.  \n\n Here was my method, eye gel, thick paper tape, two strips about 1inch long. One strip vertically right down the middle, and one angling from the inside corner outward. \n\nIn the morning, I use hot soapy water to melt the glue and remove the tape. I used something like this: \n\n\nNexcare Opticlude Orthoptic Eye Patches, Regular Size, 3.18\" X 2.18\" in oval, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 4) \n\nIt is like a bandaid and under that I used a bit of gauze as a buffer between my eyelid and the band aid so it kept my eye shut! Hope it helps! This is the method I use - it is the under taping that is crucial early on. I use Nexcare (3M) Sensitive skin tape. \n\n( Hiya, I am not sure it is what the doctors would recommend but I got a large cotton wool.pad and just taped around it over the eye, seemed to do the trick Clean your forehead and cheek with alcohol. Use Genteel Severe Dry Eye gel to keep your eye comfortable. Then, put a piece of tape from your cheek to your forehead pulling your cheek up to close your eye. It will take a little practice to get it right. Once it is closed, put tape across your forehead and cheek to hold the first piece in place. This method looks the most effective. Maybe it is the pulling the cheek up bit I am missing! Thanks so much, will give that a try right now. That is what the doctor recommended, but my eye just stays open behind the pad no matter how tightly I tape it on and the feeling of my eyelashes rubbing against it drives me nuts. I think it was definitely the undertaping that I was missing. Thanks! I will have to give the angled tape a shot! Thanks :) If you get your cheek pulled up correctly, it will pull your eyebrow down enough to keep your eye closed. Good luck Those glasses look like a great idea. I have just been wearing my oversized sunglasses, but wind definitely still comes in the side. Thanks! Exactly the same here, when you can feel them touching the pad it is so weird and uncomfortable, it normally takes me a couple attempts in different positions to get it right, my eye stays open under but it just seems to help it drying out so much over night still, hope it helps mate! Glad Press and Seal. Yes I am totally serious. Cut a small square of it and put it over your eye- keeps it shut tight and no pain to take it off. I have found that if I pack a bit of non-stick gauze under the pad (as another user suggested) it helps keep the eye closed underneath thankfully. That is been what has worked best for me.", "Curious about medications/ treatments Hello,\n\nI was diagnosed on Wednesday of last week with BP.  \n\nI was prescribed naproxen by urgent care.\n\nI went to go see a PCP for a second opinion, and he put me on steroids-- I am curious why he did not also put me on antivirals.  Should I ask about antivirals?\n\nWhat was everyone else prescribed?\n\nI am also looking into acupuncture.  The pharmacist who helped me with eye drops said some people have had luck with that.\n\nI am dreading going back to work tomorrow. They give the antiviral because they are not entirely sure what causes it.  Likely herpes, but I think they really have not pinned it down.  So the antiviral is more of a precaution than anything, I think. I was prescribed anti biotics and steroids, my case was mild in comparison to others I have seen. No anti virals though, I also did acupuncture combined with facial exercises and I had a pretty successful recovery. Good luck with your treatment Did you get it from the vaccine I had gotten my second dose like two weeks prior.  So I do not think so.\n\nI am/was under a ton of pressure work wise. So  doctors are assuming stress set it off.", "Bells and Vestibular Neuritis Anyone here had both?  I believe they are caused by the same virus.

Or how I have to break the food into small bite sized pieces instead of biting bits off. \n\nI feel uncertain and a little scared, maybe. \n\nI have plenty of support from my SO and he is great but he is not going through it. \n\n  I would just like to hear how other people have dealt with the intricacies of eating? And just day to day coping, please. It takes time. The more you practice, the easier it gets. I relied heavily on straws, soft foods, and lots of napkins. It sucks in the beginning, but the more you do it, the more you are retraining your muscles. Just be gentle, be slow, have kindness towards yourself. It will be alright. Thank you, just knowing it will get easier will help, but right now, as I wipe my watering eye for the 100th time today, it feels like it will never go back to normal. \n\nI feel terribly dramatic today lol Its still early in recovery for you. It will feel overwhelming at times. But day by day. You got this! Firstly, realize an overwhelming majority recover with very little remnant effects. So you have numbers on your side. Yes, it takes time to get to becoming better and yes, eating and drinking were hard. I also was very self conscious on how I looked - but my SO was also supportive and said I still looked lovely (bless him for that!). That helped! I ate soft foods as I felt tired of constantly chewing on one side.  I also took a lot of walks to keep my mind clear of worrying about this. I also did a daily recording of my blinks, smiles, eating, winking, eye closure, etc. It tells you how much progress you are making once recovery kicks in. Sometimes, you would find it hard to realize how much further you have come and videos will offer that much needed reassurance. Most people start improving from days 8-15. (I started improvement on day 15 but was 70% better by day 20 - huge jumps each day). You will get better! My six year old keeps telling me I look like Two Face off Batman when I smile, I totally get the self conscious thing. \n\nDid yours get worse before it got better? When I seen the Dr yesterday I could fully close my eye but not squeeze it shut and my speech was fine but when I woke up this morning my speech is slightly slurred and I cannot fully close my eye when I blink. I am not too concerned about it, it would just be nice to know it is normal, so to speak. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a Yes it definitely got worse in the first week. From day 9 onwards it stabilized (no worsening symptoms but it was very irritating already to say the least) and on day 15 morning, I saw the first signs of recovery(slight movement in my cheek that I could control). I have a friend who also had BP. For her it worsened until day 8 and then she recovered from day 9 onwards. I had to use a straw stuck in my good side to drink without dribbling.  I ate my food sitting at a table slowly cutting it into teeny tiny bites and concentrated on chewing it well on my good side - that helped a lot.  Lots of knife and fork action even on things like hamburgers.\n\nOne video on Youtube had a lady that make a lot of protein and other shakes when the eating was the worst.  I did those a few times, and they helped get calories in when I did not want to eat due to the taste issue.\n\nI am on day 22 and it is getting a lot better.  Eating is almost normal, though drinking I still straw it.  There are a lot of video diaries on Youtube if you search Bell's Palsy where people documented their recovery.  I watched a few, and they lifted my spirits seeing physical evidence of getting better.\n\nHoping you a speedy recovery. Oh man this was one of the hardest things to deal with when I first had Bells!  Food popped out of my mouth at totally random times! I ended up holding a finger over my bells side lips just to keep them pressed together. I also did this when trying to pronounce  words with b's, p's and f sounds in them! (Telling People you have ' Bells Palsy' which is one of the hardest phrases to pronounce,anyone?!)\nI was working at a beach caf\u00e9 at the time, where we sold multiple flavours of ice cream ..chocolate toffee fudge was one I struggled so badly to pronounce, I ended up just pointing to it on the board!\nStraws to drink are an absolute must in my opinion. \nHope you have a swift recovery! Oh geez.. luckily I am a SAHM so do not have to worry about talking to strangers on a daily basis. I feel for you, it is hard enough telling the kids off while I am blowing through my lips! \n\nI have become best friends with my straws, (I had to buy silicone ones because the metal ones I had kept slipping out of my mouth) but have you tried drinking tea through a straw!? I almost burnt what was left of my taste buds off!! Lol \n\nBut I am a week into it now and it is becoming easier to deal with even though it is not getting better yet. The hardest thing to get used to is my eye getting worse and having to tape it shut at night. Yes, tea was one I hated! I am a drink-my-tea-as-hot-as-possible girl usually, so I had some adjusting to do. Most funny moment for me was eating a cadbury's curly wurly bar without forethought and it just popping back out of my mouth..  and discovering I could no longer blow up a balloon about 4 months in.. The hardest for me, so far, was this evening when my 6 yr old and I were watching Willy Wonka and where I normally whistle along to the \u201ccheer up Charlie\u201d song and I could not whistle. I am not saying I cried but my eyes definitely watered more than usual! Haha \n\nAnd this afternoon when I forgot I could not drink normally and spilt my drink all down me, I felt like an idiot but luckily my top was wet from working out already lol Yeah having young kids is tough aswell, my youngest son at the time was 4, but by the time he was 6 there was a brutally-honest side to him... I feel your pain entirely!  He used to cast meaningful looks my way whenever diet ads came on telly ect.. \nCan I just say you should try not to overdo it with the working out, you are still ill and rest is a vital part of recovery. Exercise by all means, but make sure you get plenty of rest aswell. Well as much rest as you can when surrounded by young kids! I never taped my eye closed as it was far too uncomfortable. Instead I got a thicker eye-lube for night time (lacrilube if you are in the UK) it was thick like vaseline and I closed my eye using my finger, then held it closed with a soft sleep mask. You have to make sure you look after your eyes. The artificial tears GP's give you are rubbish, they just blink straight out. Ask your doctor for better ones.  I had two different lubricants; one for daytime use and a thicker one as described above for nighttime. Both were an ointment style as opposed to liquid. It was easier to apply if I warmed it up in my pocket first! \nHope this helps. When I first got diagnosed I did not have much of a problem closing my eye but since the morning after I cannot fully close it. The tape is very uncomfortable but preferable to the claustrophobia the eye mask induces lol I have dry eyes on any normal day anyway, so I use eye drops for that but I am definitely going to ring the dr in the morning to see if they can write me a script for a better lubricant. I am in the UK so will ask for the one you said, thank you. I cannot remember the name of the lighter one, sorry. You can also purchase clear eye patches that look like bubbles so you can keep the eye open during the day, and it is protected from dust ect. I cannot vouch for comfort as they were not available when I got bells palsy. \nThe UK is sadly lacking in specialists in bells palsy, although this is now improving, you can get support from facial palsy UK to help you find specialists and just general support too. \nVitamin B12 is supposed to be fantastic with nerve repairs, you need to find it in a liquid form, you hold it under your tongue as it absorbs better. I get this from piping rock.com as I think it is cheaper, but you can probably find it in Holland and Barrett s or Amazon or somewhere like that. \nReally hope your recovery is fast \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "10 weeks of Lyme disease facial paralysis \u2014 no change I have had total paralysis on the right side of my face for 10 weeks. No change or improvements. I did a week of prednisone / Valtrex at first, then the doctors realized it was Lyme, after which I did three weeks of doxycycline. Blood and CSF tests are now negative for Lyme, but the MRI shows the facial nerve is still very inflamed. \n\nAny ideas of what is going on or suggestions on how to fix this? It sounds like you have taken all the right steps. The body must rebuild at its own pace. I am at about 8 weeks myself with no changes. I recommend talking with your doctor about physical therapy options to keep muscle tone and flexibility as good as possible while not in use. This will help the completeness of recovery. In most cases this affliction is not permanent - most. There is a possibility that it might be something that never changes, so I am doing my best to get on with things as if that is the case, while still being proactive and positive. After all, if I can only give half a smile, I have to do it twice as much! I hope your situation improves. Best wishes! Unfortunately you just have to wait it out. I was diagnosed on May 11th and saw zero improvement until August 10th. In the past month, I would say I have progressed from 0% to 40% recovered. It will recover at its own pace usually.  I had Bell's from Lyme too and had to take the Prednisone for 6 days.  Right now I am taking Gabapentin because I dealt with a bunch of nerve pain on my face even after the fact.  \n\nThere was a quick burst of recovery that I experienced but it is stagnant again.  I think the facial nerves just do their own thing.", "Bell\u2019s Palsy\u2026 AGAIN?! Hey guys! So I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s earlier this year (February) and it lasted until early April. I also had a complete recovery, could move my left side 100%. \n\nFour months later and I am literally having Bell\u2019s AGAIN on the same left side. I was recently diagnosed on August 29. \n\nThis is so annoying though. And university is almost starting for me. (I am 19 and going into my second year). IM JUST SO ANNOYED. \n\nHow did you make your Bell\u2019s go away fast. And pls give me some words of encouragement *cue the waterworks* Do not let it get you down man, face workouts, meds,  face roller, and rest. I got it twice this year too. :/ once on each side. I fully recovered both time. \n\nIt sucks so much!! But you got this!! You know what to do. Omg on each side?!?  I am scared my BP is going to come back on the opposite side...but I thought wait can that happen? \ud83d\ude2d Hi! First of all, I am sorry that you are getting it for the second time :( I have had it for a month now (still in recovery) so I cannot imagine how it must feel to get it another time. \n\nI am also in my second year of uni and this will be the first year of in-person teaching and so I am very nervous that my face will not be healed by then (what will people think, first impressions etc.)- I totally get that! \n\nUnfortunately, I do not know how to make BP go away fast, as I am myself in a phase where nothing is improving and I am a bit frustuated but what i would say is to REST. (and take your medications etc) I know it sucks. But you had a 100% recovery the first time, I am sure it will heal again!! Wishing you a speedy recovery! Try accupuncture. Worked for me", "Is this Bell's Palsy? &amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\nIn the past 12 months I have noticed my face is sagging on the left hand side.  My lips are drooping (I feel), there is a little bit of a change in the shape of my eye (not pictured as not as noticeable) and what I would consider drooping on my jawline as well.  I have seen a minor improvement since first noticed.\n\nI realise it is minimal but wondering if this is something I should get checked out?  If so, likely the doctors in my area will tell me not to worry about it so wondering what I should ask for (ie specialist, next steps, etc?).\n\nI can still smile however (I feel) it is still noticeable when I am smiling.\n\nNote:  I know my nose is crooked - and I am completely cool with that :)\n\nTL;DR:  Is my face crooked?", "Got Diagnosed With BP Got covid around 12/25, developed the bad ear aches with really bad pressure on my right ear and behind my ear. Yesterday morning around 10 I woke up and felt my right side side kind of numb and slow. Started blinking and smiling and freaked out. Went in to the er and Dr told me that my seventh nerve could be pressed on by the pressure. It is been 30+hrs since that happened and I still have control as in I am still able to close my eye, my frown is not that noticeable anymore. \nI got a prescription for antibiotics for my ear infections, Prednisone, and I believe an antiviral pill. \n\nQuestion is, is there such thing as a mild case of Bells Palsy or will I continue to lose function? Thanks in advance.", "Stopped Prednisone due to Coronavirus I am on Prednisone for my BP... I also had my colon removed from Ulcerative Colitis 15 years ago, so my immune system is shit to say the least.  I am thinking it is a good idea to abandon prednisone until all this hysteria is over.  \n\nEdit: Prednisone affects the body\u2019s ability to fight infections  Call your doctor. I do not think it is a good idea to change medications for anything stronger than ibuprofen without consulting one. Eh, personally the prednisone did nothing but make me miserable. I dont see it is benefit with BP. I would drop it too but that is just me.", "Should I go back to my doctor I have had Bell's palsy for 9 months now and am about 95% recovered (one side of my mouth is not fully moving when I try to round my mouth into O's for example) i have not had a check up ever since my 2nd month and do not know if I should and if that will help me recover what is left of my movements especially since I have now moved to a way colder city which I am afraid my halt improvements or bring it back. (I have been noticing small improvements after 4months of nothing) In all honesty, at this point, especially with you feeling mostly recovered, I doubt there is much anyone can do. I went to an ENT who very seriously investigated my case, I had just started recovering by the actual appointment (maybe 60%) - but there was nothing he could see on my MRI, or do. It just needs time. Today is one year from my onset, and although it is different for everyone, I am fully recovered now and if you are at 95% I bet you will in time too. Definitely be conscious of how the cold affects you and wear a scarf or a balaclava.", "Have any of you had a muscle relapse after recovering? Hey everyone. \n\nI was diagnosed four months ago and recovered fully in about a month. Recently however, I have noticed that I am involuntarily tilting my head to the right, on the same side I was affected. \n\nI tried making faces in the mirror like I used to when I was recovering and discovered that when flexing my neck, (like when you make your neck look like an old person... English is not my first language so I hope my meaning gets across) one of the 'lines' did not show and is now only barely visible. \n\nSo, like the title says, have any of you had a muscle relapse after recovering? There was no buildup or twitching, before or after. \n\n\nP.S.\nI have posted here before, when I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, and want to thank everyone who replied. The comments really helped me get through it! I am so glad this community exists. I have has one bout. My brother has had two incidents. He told me they came on with the same symptoms so he was able to catch it early. \n\nKeep a close eye and ask a friend to look  at you. I stress about whenever I feel something weird and have my partner look at it. He see's my face the most and would notice a change.\n\nGood luck.", "Another one with Bell's palsy for 2nd time =( I got Bell's palsy this January on my left side of the face,same ear pain was there mostly in ear,took 3months to heal fully I think but I think I got some permanent damage on left,tears always come from left eye whenever I eat and eye still looks small/big sometimes ,I stopped doing  exercise as I felt my eyes kept getting smaller than my right my right one/also had done therapy/electric stimulation lot which I think caused sykinsins .Anyway since 2days I started having ear pain on my right side outter area .I think it is because of cold climate last time it was also cold.1st day when I had lunch I noticed taste changed , figured it is because of fever next morning I wake up drink water and it was difficult and I figured it is palsy and am losing control of my right face slowly,went in ER and neurologist doctor said it is beginning of palsys, prescribed me Prednisone 40mg for 3 day,30mg for 3day,20mg for 3day,and 10mg for 3 day (unable to remember another medicine name will edit here in the morning).When I went to hospital I had 80\u2105control and right now it is down to 20% of my right side.i am depressed again ,I have imp exams after 2month and I will probably not leave house for 2-3weeks.i am confused if I should do electric stimulation therapy this time.doc said it is very important to.i am scared if I will recover or not (this can be permanent ) Same fears as first time.i had read when I first got palsys that it only happens once .I am not sure why I got it again,in same cold season,I think my nerves are weak?,btw I am currently 19year old .\n Anyway I will wrap this long post I doubt if anyone is going to read my broken English \n\nThank you all if you have read this,I do not speak English and behind in studies.\n\nAlso I feel like saying \nFuck Bell's palsy!But thankful at same time that it is not cancer or something.they are some amazing people out there that cannot be let down by cancer or terminal diseases , salute to you people  :D\n-------\nUpdate after 10days: decided against therapy ,steroids course is over going for consultation tomorrow,as for face no improvement,\n\n\nUpdate after 12 days: Shouldnt have gone to neuro with my brother, doctor was not happy that i have not started therapy and advised strictly to start from today,he has stopped anti viral medicine and wrote steroids for another 10days,even though I do not want to but family will not listen to me and apparently I am dumb ,who is doctor me or him?They have paid for 2 sections /14days :/. Therapy starts from tomorrow..Doctor's qualification is :MBBS,MD (General Medicine),DM (Neurology) ,Director Department of neuroscience.i still have pain outside of ears and he said he has prescribed Prednisone for that,and to take pain killer if it gets worse..On the good side I think I am able to move 1\u2105tiny bit of my lips on the right side i am not sure if I was able to do that before though.\n\n\n\nUpdate 15 days later and 3 therapies,no improvement in movement on right face,still on steroids for next 7days &gt;The circumstances that caused Bell's Palsy the first time are likely still there. I say 'likely' because the cause is not known with 100% certainty... but *possible* causes include influenza virus (\"the flu\") or viral ear infections, both of which can affect more people in the winter, herpes simplex virus ('cold sores'), which can go to sleep but never goes away, and/or pretty much anything that causes sickness or trauma, including depression, stress, or other emotional turmoil. There might be environmental factors, too. (Living in Oregon, I think of 'winter' as an environmental factor... in addition to greater susceptibility to sickness, the lack of sunlight and constant rain or snow can be depressing.) *Something* causes swelling that compresses or irritates the nerve in your face, and you have got Bell's Palsy. It is not the kind of thing that your body builds up a resistance to, or that can be prevented by vaccination... it appears to be a more mechanical side-effect - the result of some other thing squeezing or irritating the facial nerve - rather than a specific disease.\n--\nThe first time I got Bell's palsy I was in another country and it was cold had windows open before sleeping and was also having ear pain on left side at the time,next morning I noticed taste change and did not go to hospital until I pretty much lost full control of left side,people did over there say I should have covered my ears because it is cold.\n I still have palsys on my left side, smile,lips position changed and tears come whenever I eat or move nerves, tears end up coming very often.\n-\n\n\n\n&gt;But: most people who get Bell's Palsy only have it once. Some of those who do have a recurrence have it within a year or two after the first; others have a recurrence decades later. It seems to require a 'perfect storm' of possible causes or contributing factors. I know that getting hit with it again so soon, it may feel like a pattern is developing... but the odds are high that your health and life are just similar now to what they were a year ago. This might make it more like a continuation of the first time, rather than a completely separate event. And that actually gives cause for hope: since it seems to require such a perfect storm of contributing factors, you might be able to help it along (and hopefully avoid it in the future) by changing some of those factors.\n-\nMaybe,I am not exactly 'healthy person\",I have a terrible diet same as year ago,I am not veg or non veg,I pretty much eat curry,rice,Dal ,only and 1ltr or 1.5ltr of milk daily with different flavours.i am aware of this and have to do something as I feel like am having more health issues I.E muscle pain, weakness etc.\n-\n\n\n&gt;I have only heard of electric stimulation for BP from people who are in Europe... it does not seem to be done much in the US. It is not even mentioned on most sites that talk about treatment of BP. Wikipedia says \"There is no high quality evidence to support the role of electrical stimulation for Bell's palsy.\" Another site says (\n\n&gt;&gt; ... there is mounting evidence that  may be contraindicated. It has been suggested that electrical stimulation may interfere with neural regeneration post peripheral nerve injury, and studies proving its efficacy with facial muscles are lacking in the literature. A 1984 report by the National Center for Health Services Research concluded that \u201cElectrotherapy treatment for Bell\u2019s palsy\u2026 has no demonstrable beneficial effect in enhancing the functional or cosmetic outcomes in patients with Bell\u2019s palsy.\u201d\n\n&gt;&gt; Additionally, patients who undergo electrical stimulation acutely may demonstrate more synkinesis and mass action than those who do not. It is difficult to produce an isolated contraction of the facial muscles using electrical stimulation due to their small size and close proximity to each other. The contraction produced causes mass action which reinforces abnormal motor patterns and can be painful.\n\n&gt;It is hard to completely rule out treatment options when the causes of BP are not completely known, but I would think twice about the electrical stimulation thing. Nerves are basically little wires; facial paralysis happens when one specific nerve is not working correctly due to swelling, compression, or inflammation; and possible side-effects of electrical stimulation devices include irritation and/or hypersensitivity. Using electrical stimulation in hopes of helping the problematic nerve seems like pushing more electricity into a wire when a light bulb burns out.\n\nI have appointment for physiotherapy this Monday,Doctor here said physiotherapy \"very important\",I am not sure what type of therapy they are going to do this time but it is most likely electric stimulation just as last time,which I had done lot and caused sykensis I believe.i am aware of it but my parents do not have much information on this subject they are in more panic than i and will send me for therapy every 2day just as last time.\nI will see what I can do ,will check if therapy is any different in this hospital first.i am doing the message,using heat bag on the face for now\n-\n&gt;The day I woke up with BP, after dealing with the hospital the first thing I did is come here. I got a lot of good advice, but the absolute best advice was this: do not let it bring you down. I am the kind of person who thinks most \"think positive\" bullshit comes from people who are not, for example, dealing with stuff like BP at the time. But many of the various factors that can cause or affect BP can also be affected by your attitude. Stress, anxiety, and depression - things that start out mostly in our heads - can weaken the immune system, increasing our risk of other physical illness. We tend to be less physically active. Our sleep gets messed up. It all just piles up. This is like giving BP a free kick.\n-\nI have not stepped out since yesterday and been playing games and watching TV ,it is hard to communicate i do not feel like talking to anyone,or going to class because I will be made fun at\nThere is lot of stress i should be in university right now but still in secondary school,makes me depress but avoiding it all now by playing games etc.\n-\n\n&gt;You want that nerve to have the best possible recovery. Eat right. Take vitamins and electrolytes. Get enough sleep. (But not *too much* sleep.) Avoid as many irritants as you can: smoking, alcohol, annoying neighbors. Keep the blood flowing with exercise (even if it is just taking a walk, do *something*). Massage your face every day (then leave it alone; irritation is a likely cause of BP, but it is not known exactly what qualifies as an irritant). Meditate, if you meditate; at the very least, put headphones on and listen to relaxing music. Breathe. (This sounded like ridiculous advice to me, until I started observing how I was breathing when I was stressed or depressed. Breathe *intentionally*.) Move the muscles in your face that you *do* control, and try to find the lines between them and the parts that BP took out. Then try to push past those lines.\n\nAmazing advices here, thank you.\nI have lost full control on right side since 2days now,makes me more stressed since there is a chance that it may be permanent but I will have to give it time currently am.not able to move even one nerve on right:/.But hopefully i will see improvement in 3-4days time.\n\n\n\n&gt;I know how much BP sucks, and I *think* I know how much a positive attitude helped my recovery. It *might* have been a coincidence that I recovered faster than predicted, but others have reported the same thing... you want to be healthy, and attitude affects health. So give yourself, and your beseiged nerve, every possible incentive to be healthy and fully functional. It cannot *hurt*, and it might help. Either way, there are worse ways to get through the coming days. Do what you can to avoid those worse ways, and do everything you can to get better.\n\nWill do!\u263a\n\n&gt;And take care of your eye. Right now you have the perfect excuse to wear an eye-patch... such opportunities do not come along very often, we must seize them when we can.\n-\nI am surprised i do not feel like wearing eye patch this time it closes if you close both of the eyes,I think I was not able to do this last time and had to wear patch.it is getting a bit dry tho ,will have to use eye drops doc prescribed 4times a day on both.i will get the patch if it gets any worse and look like a captain:p\n-\n&gt;Hrmmm... looking back at this, I wonder if Reddit has a limit on how long comments can be. I am going to click the 'Save' button and find out.\n\nHaha,thank you for your big post,learned lot and will be useful to others too.also sorry for my broken English,.\n-\n\n\n Hey, just wondering how you are doing.\n\nTake care. Hi Benny :)\n\nSo far it is been 1week and 2days since palsys,reduced steroids to 20mg ,intense ear pain and no improvement on right face,makes me worried if i will recover or not ..I cannot seem to remember how long it took me last time to make movement on my left.i have not been doing therapy family is not really happy because I am not listening to doctors and that I recovered last time because of it.  Hey :)\n\nI am not a doctor, and I only have my own experience and the things people have shared here, but this is what it sounds like to me:\n\nYou got an ear infection. Something viral. Some viruses like to dig down into nerves, and do the sorts of things that are thought to cause BP.\n\nYou have been taking steroids, to hopefully get the inflammation down. But it is possible that the ear thing, if it was an infection and not a side-effect of the BP, is still a problem. You did not mention being given antivirals, which kind of surprised me (though I know doctors have different ideas in different places). If the ear pain is bad - inside your ear, deep, near the spot behind your ear at the top of the back of your jaw - tell your doctor. If it is something viral... hearing is important. At least bring it up with your doctor if it is causing you pain.\n\nIf it is that weird kind of pain that the spazzy nerves cause, a surface feeling like your skin has been sandpapered, that could be a side-effect of the BP.\n\nYou have been through 9 days of hell, but you got through this once before. It is *way* too early to worry about permanent damage, though I must admit I would be worrying about the same thing.\n\nThe types of therapy you go to a specialist for, eh, people seem to be about 30% saying it helped, 20% saying it made things worse, 50% saying it did nothing that they could see to hasten recovery.\n\nBut the types of therapy you can do on your own - even laying in bed, if that is how your days are going - seem to be helpful for a lot of people. Range of motion, trying to 'find' the nerves, keeping the blood flowing well in your face with massage and maybe a cloth soaked in hot water draped over your face. Take vitamins and electrolytes. (Vitamins... I do not know, seems like most people do not experience obvious changes from taking vitamins - everyone, not just people dealing with BP. I take vitamins because I do not eat meat, and I do not get a whole lot of B vitamins from vegetables.) But our nerves basically run on electrolytes... they cannot hurt, they may help. (I get these orangish-flavored packets, drop a few in a cup of water and I feel great.) Move the muscles you *can* move, and try to 'find' the ones that have disappeared.\n\nBut mostly just take care of yourself. And do not worry too much. The percentage of people who see results after a week is pretty low. I know it sucks to think \"great, more weeks of *this*\", but realistically that is the way it usually goes.\n\nI feel like about half of the stuff I have written is depressing, so I will stop here.\n\nTake care of yourself. Be kind to yourself. Be kind to that nerve, even if you want to hate it. &gt;Hey :)\n\n&gt;I am not a doctor, and I only have my own experience and the things people have shared here, but this is what it sounds like to me:\n\n&gt;You got an ear infection.

Hopefully the doctor will be able to prescribe vitamin medicine by looking at the reports of the tests he had said for.\n\n\n&gt;But mostly just take care of yourself. And do not worry too much. The percentage of people who see results after a week is pretty low. I know it sucks to think \"great, more weeks of *this*\", but realistically that is the way it usually goes.\n\n&gt;I feel like about half of the stuff I have written is depressing, so I will stop here.\n\n&gt;Take care of yourself.

I always think \"I am miserable *and* I have to go to the doctor? Could this day get any worse?\"  The answer is: yes, this day could get much, much worse. But if the doctor can help, then tomorrow or the day after or next week or next month there will be a day that is better. I do not know when, or what will happen between now and then, but those better days are coming. Do everything you can to hasten their arrival, and to be ready for them.\n\n&gt; my diet is horrible...

Did your BP go away? I just got it 2 and a half weeks ago \ud83d\ude2d I think I recovered 80% in 6month,this time the recovery was very slow and I did not feel anything,my MRI was also normal just done 15days ago.my left ear has been paining again too hope i  I will not get it for the 3rd time.15%damage from first time and 20% this time ...I have lost all confidence in me tbh.... anyway do not worry ,you will recover ,take meds,do exercises every 4 hours  20each time,the more the better,do as your physiotherapist said.cover your ears from cold and wind,take care of your eyes cover it at night and use the ointment when it is dry ,do not stress (you probably are)it takes time so just rest .hopping a speedy recovery for you \ud83d\ude42 Wow. I am so sorry to hear that. I need to get that through my mind that there is people worse off than I am.. I am over here complaining about small stuff like this, and there is people like you that have had it twice and each time not getting back to 100%.. I appreciate the reply. It is just I too have not got much movement or improvement and tomorrow will mark the 3 week mark.. it just really sucks emotionally wise.. Hey.\nDo not worry ,I did not have any real movements till 6weeks,I was so afraid that if it is permanent but it just takes lot of time ,I can understand the emotional toll,I remember I did not go for class for 2months lol.Do Exercises ,Eat Healthy,Take Vitamin Meds they help,I was also given \"Synacten\"injection by my neurologist doctor.also I think Kinesiology Tape helps,I did not have any improvement on my eyes for 2month,using the tape did help but sometimes it just felt \"is it even working\",who knows but ask your physiotherapist about it,and if you cannot that is fine too because many people even recover without any treatment,it is just different for everyone. Ok thank you for the hope! I really appreciate it. But like you said there is just a little fear that this will be permanent. As of late my eye has been doing a little better so I will take whatever improvement I can get. ", "Blinking So, serious question. What is a good thing to do to help with the blinking? The delayed eye reaction is probably the worst part of this - next to consuming anything liquid. \n\nOn a lighter note, I have adopted this as my BP emoji \ud83e\udd74 I ended up using my hand to replace a lot of my paralyzed muscles.\n\nUsed my fingertips to \"blink\" when I needed to, poked my cheek in a particular place to make the \"s\" sounds relatively normal.  Poked a particular place near my upper lip to make those B's and P's sound normal.\n\nSo...I used my hand to do a lot of things.  I wore an eye patch outside (even when driving). Finger. Like, that is what my physical therapist said too lol. Finger to blink, massage the muscles. It took me four months of PT to blink again. Manual blinking (using you finger to facilitate full eye closure) is essential to prevent the eye drying and infections. Tape your eye closed at nighttime too. Mine will close fully but i need to really give it a second. Involuntary blinks do not close fully so I just have to think about them. I have been using drops every few hours and I use the overnight gel, which seems to help. Curious if there is a way to jumpstart it to work properly again \ud83e\udd74 Bells palsy is one of those things - when it heals it heals, unfortunately there is no way of guess how long it will take. Take some vitamin B supplements, particularly B12 as there is some evidence this helps with nerve healing. I used that emoji all the time and I just used eye drops and my finger to close it Use your eyebrow to lift and close your eyelid. I have 3NP so my eyelid has zero function. The eyebrow method works really well. Do not touch your eyes during a pandemic. Stay safe. My physical therapist had me close both eyes, and then slightly (very slight) relax them. Not so much that they open, just so you are right on the edge. Then fully close again. Imagine you are pinching a sheet of paper under the eye lashes. Over time this strengthens both the muscles and neural pathways. \n\nI am suffering from really bad palsy - Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. It took me 5 months to fully  close the eye, and once I could I repeated this exercise for 3 months and now my eyes are in near perfect sync. The involuntary blink came back very slowly - it is not perfect but it is functional and I do not need eyedrops every hour anymore. Also, would stretch the eyelid down on the affected side (hold for about 10 seconds, 5 times / day), to avoid it getting tight. Good luck", "Hello! A little personal introduction, I am 19 and I work as a freelance artist while attending college. \n\nI joined this sub to get to know more people with my type of birth defect. Specifically facial paralysis at birth. The doctors originally thought it was Bell\u2019s Palsy due to it being semi common for infants. Unfortunately all the nerves on the left side of my face (except my temporal) never formed properly, therefore, never connecting to my brain stem.\nI have had several surgeries such as muscle and nerve transfers. \n\nPlease let me know if you or someone you know has the same condition as me.", "Does it ever get easier ? When does it emotionally get easier to cope with this ? I feel as if I have a roller coaster of emotions. I am grateful for everyone around me. And some days I want to push everyone away and just shut away. What are some things you do to not shut away ? It is been mentally hard for me and feel very insecure. Does anyone else feel like you get better at dealing with this but have those hard days where you feel like shutting out?", "Does anyone experience fatigue related to their Bell\u2019s Palsy? And if so, how do you cope?\n\nFor some background, I had to stop work for a few months due to being unable to stay awake for more than a few hours at a time when I was first diagnosed. Four years on and I am back to work and a fairly normal sleep schedule but every now and again the fatigue seems to come back. I have been diagnosed grade IV but still see improvements every few months.", "Almost been a month and I am improving; Could I still leave in this condition? Before I had Bell's palsy I was planning on leaving  my narcissistic, dysfunctional family for good. I failed out of school as well, and was pretending to go so that my parents would not suspect anything. I am still keeping it a secret, and planning on writing a letter and leaving it in plain sight when I finally leave forever. \n\nIn 2 days it will be a month since I have had this condition. I can blink with the affected eye and I am starting to see some movement in my cheek. My mouth is almost healed up as well, and I am almost able to fully smile again. However the situation with my family has gotten worse. The bullying has Increased and I am still getting blamed for causing this condition that I have no control over. They know that this is caused most likely by stress but they keep saying its because of how unhealthy I am and that I am overweight. Which could be a factor, but I personally know that it is the stress that is caused by being in this family. They always find a way to blame me for everything even when it is not my fault. I am sick and tired of it. Things will never get better as long as I am around them. So I have decided to cut the whole family off. \n\n  Is it a good idea to leave in my condition? I am afraid that it might start up again due to the stress of leaving. Leave for your overall health and sanity more than anything else. Bells Palsy will not get in the way of you living a normal life. Sounds like your stress will be better if you leave just follow your gut. And always stay true to who you are Thank you Thanks If your family is causing you so much stress that your face got paralyzed, you need to get out of that situation. Good luck! Thank you Good luck with everything. Does recovery happen slowly. From what I thought, it goes like it came - almost immediately.\n\nI kind of thought I will wake up one morning normal. \n\nNothing yet, though. 4 weeks tomorrow. it comes immidiately, recovery however is abit slower. it took me atleast 2 weeks before i could see any improvements. but it will get better. luckily for me i made a 100% recovery after a month or so.\n\nTo the OP, my doctor did advise that i change my lifestyle, like you i also am overweight and living unhealthly so i understand that bit. My family also made fun of me because of that though. so i understand but my family likes to joke around so its fine by me. You should do what you need to do in order to live better. Hang in there and good luck!", "my best friend realized something was wrong before his face was visibly effected ", "Celebrating progress!! ", "What do you think caused your bell's? What do you think caused it?\n\nI will start, I think it was stress, how about yall? I think ear infection Ear infection almost definitely caused mine. Ear infection even if like two doctors thinks its herpes, or even Lyme. Weirdly enough, i really dont have any sign of both.\nAll im wondering now is if the pain in my jaw/temple is due to that or the palsy. I think it was stress, too. I had chicken pox as a kid, when I was 23 I got a mild case of shingles brought out by stress, 3 years later I got Bell\u2019s palsy. This was after a terrible stomach virus so my immune system was weak and during another very stressful time. I think the virus was dormant in my body and flares up I think stress plus a very strong allergic reaction in my nose and eye on the affected side the same day BP developed. Had influenza a+b a month before.  I would prefer to have that back. Stress, not eating properly, partying way too much (initially thought my bells was the after effects of sniffing something dodgy!!!). Def a wake up call to look after ourselves a little bit better \ud83e\udd74 I am getting the same pain from the palsy. Feels tender like a fell and hit my head or got slapped hard or something. I would say stress &amp; anxiety \n\nI was also very sleep deprived, barely ate anything within the day. Pretty sure its the infection. Its so close to the ear when i try to see where it specifically come from that it just has to be that.\nMy other conclusion would just be because we adapt our movement facial movement. But i go for the infection first. Mine was likely caused by pregnancy. Bell's Palsy onset for me was at 25 weeks into pregnancy. This year it was COVID, the other times I had a pretty bad cough and then an ear infection. Two of my doctors agree, I was exposed to a virus. I was just diagnosed today, I think it is definitely due to stress and eating too much junk food the past few days but I will have to go to a PCP and find out for sure. I am a couple days ahead of you December 23rd. They have no idea what caused it still, but I know I was probably under the most stress in my life from work the past two weeks before the year end. truth, I thought my fiance was exposed to covid this past week so that is caused tons of headaches but I have also eaten a lot of sugar with the holidays so I guess I will never know what caused it. probably a combo of both. praying for a fast recovery for all of us. Stress. 100% Stress. Watched my Mom die of cancer 2 months earlier and had to deal with that and her estate/house afterwards while working full time.

Does anyone have any advice for someone who has experienced this for the first time?  I am a little scared because I still feel nerve pain (I am taking steroids now for the inflammation) and have this irrational fear that I will become paralyzed in other regions of my body.\n\nOn the bright side, the eye patch gave me Halloween costume ideas and I like making funny faces in videos and selfies. Same thing for me I have got one week left on Doxicyclin and then the doctor thinks I will be good. The Bells was on my right side then went to my left side. I took a week of prednisone and valtrex before they knew it was lymes. Then after a week off started on prednisone valtrex and doxicyclin. My lymes was caught in the first three months so the infectious disease doctor does not think it will be a big deal. Make sure you have your lyme evaluated so you know how long you have had it.

I still have follow ups for my bloodwork for the Lyme disease in a couple weeks so we will see on that but physically I feel fine sorry to hear about your face the doctor stressed to me in the beginning that everyone is different but as long as you found the cause then I am sure the rest will clear up in time! Good to hear yours cleared up! And thanks :)", "Any advice on Food to eat? I just got diagnosed yesterday and need advice on food that is easier to eat. Last night I made the poor decision to try to eat pizza. Definitely cannot do that. Had to cut it up into small pieces.

Have a pretty important day on Sunday but worried it will get worse. Any weakness in one side of the face is pretty much assumed to be BP. Recovery varies. Some say a week. Some say 6 weeks. Some say 3 months. Then there is 5% of us that never recovers. Steroids do not always help. They made it worse for me. Sorry. I cant really offer anything positive here. It could definitely get worse before it gets better. Even though it sounds like you have a mild case, why not treat it like an extreme case so that you recover faster. Also keep in mind that most people are on this sub because it just happened to them or they never recovered. Most people who recover do not stick around in support groups, but I do Well I have had symptoms since Saturday. It is Wednesday night here now. It feels like my eye is closing a bit further than it was on Monday so I am hoping it is a mild case. My job requires extensive talking to so I am extremely worried I started with a very mild case of it, it got worse over the next few days. I am on day 20 now and I can raise my eyebrows and move my mouth a bit more. Hopefully things will just keep getting better for you. Well I have had this since Saturday and it seemed to be worse yesterday compared to today. So I am really hoping it gets better Mine too, I teach. I had to take 8 weeks off because i could not see or speak properly. Sounds like a really mild case....you are \u201clucky\u201d! Lol BP is calculated on a scale of 1-6. You may have a 1 or 2. I came down with a 4 five weeks ago and have recovered about 90% I had mild BP. Sadly, even though I was already on medication and PT, it got worst before it got better. It started to get better after 2 weeks. \n\nI madde full recovery after 6 weeks. But there are still some signs... like I find it hard to smile for pictures after 5 seconds. At what point would you say it got worse? Like in a few days? Or weeks? I had B.P. like two years ago. I started recovering after a month and I needed more time to be full recovered but not 100%.

I was diagnosed with Bell's a month ago but a few days ago I started getting weakness on the opposite side as well. After 3 nights in the hospital, I am finally getting answers and starting treatment for Lyme disease. I am frustrated to have Bell's on both sides of my face but grateful to have caught the disease this time. I do not actually recall being bitten by a tick and I never had the rash associated with Lyme. If you spend time outdoors and have Bell's I would encourage you to get tested for Lyme. Is it an expensive test? I got a false positive for Lyme disease once. I am not sure, my insurance paid it. The doctor just added it on to my blood test orders Interesting, I guess that is why the doctors had to do 3 different tests to confirm it for me. Makes sense now Yep. And to be clear it was to rule out me having Bells 3 times because of it. It sent us on a wild goose chase of seeing a specialist who concluded that a certain protein masquerades as another that can be a positive indicator for Lyme.", "Nerve in face hurting bad My fianc\u00e9 went to the ER last week on Thursday because we thought he was having a stroke. Turns out it was Bell\u2019s palsy. Today he is noticed the nerve on that side where it is at hurts really bad. He is had horrible migraines since last Wednesday. He said today the pain has been the worst it is ever been. Any advice? He has an apt with his doctor Friday. Gabapentin was the only thing that helped me for the pain. Ooo I think I have some of that. Maybe I will have him try it. Thanks!

Press all the air out the bag and then zip it up then wrap it in the hand towel and put that in a pillowcase and put it on the face for 20minutes doing this daily will help heal and also reduce pain Everyone is different but for me, it was a sign that it was healing.

It is a very mild case, facial paralysis, slight ear pain and numb tongue. I do not know, i am having a super weird time dealing with tbh talk to me you all! Its weird at first, but it gets better, just remember to exercise ur face muscle. Theres a couple of exercise on youtube. And dont forget to take ur meds and follow what your doctors tell you do. Rest as much as you can! Tape you eye shut at night. ( makes all the difference while sleeping. Get an eye patch matey for daytime naps and eye gel to keep it moist. You will be ok, rest, avoid stress and do facial exercises and self massage. You will start seeing improvement in a few weeks I too had recently gotten diagnosed, my case was sort of mild as well. The left side of my face in the span of 12 hours became paralyzed and I could not taste anything on the left side of my tongue. I went to the hospital the next day and got on prednisone and since then I have noticed some improvement. I can smile 60% but my forehead and eyelids are lagging behind and I still cannot taste anything on the left side of my tongue.\n\nI think it mostly depends on how quickly you are seen by a doctor as it can greatly change the course you are headed on. It was really hard the first 5 days when water would drip out of my mouth from drinking or brushing teeth but staying positive **will only help!** get some rest and try not to stress too much, do something relaxing to take your mind off of your situation. For me, it is exercising, and on that note try doing facial exercises. I like to think that those have helped me as well. \n\nI wish you good luck and a speedy recovery. I had my diagnosis 5 months ago and I was able to recover! But I did have a really hard time dealing with it. It really brought my self esteem down and not to mention it was so painful. Every day it did get a tiny bit better until it was completely gone. 5 months later thankfully no more pain, but I still have soreness on certain areas of my face muscles. No one can tell I even had it, of course I still see remnants of it in how my face looks, specially when I smile, but it just might be in my head.

Eating and drinking is somewhat of a challenge and talking really has not been a huge issue. Unfortunately I cannot get in to see a doctor for at least 2 weeks, so I am unlikely to be put on steroids or an anti-viral. I have been taking vitamin b-12, b-6, fish oil, and zinc to speed my recovery and healing. I am also getting Accupuncture twice a week, with electrical stimulation.

LOL) I recall when mine started coming back, it felt kind of like electrical shocks and soreness in the muscles and whatnots that had not been used in awhile. So I think it is normal?

I am sure there have been other things.\n\n\nSo, on to the good news and questions: a close friend recently started a gluten free diet and I noticed a positive change in her overall. She encouraged me to try, and ultimately bought a weeks worth of food to get me to give it an honest chance! Back of my mind I was thinking maybe it could help BP, but was not my primary goal. \n\nGluten free ended up being good for me on an increased energy level, as well as much better digestion issues. I am only going on three weeks- and I have had slipups due to ignorance about what has gluten (soy sauce? Really?!). Also on thanksgiving I caved and ate a bit of gluten (turkey was served all in gravy- no dry turkey available so I said whatever and went for stuffing too... I am weak:(). \n\nRelated or not- yesterday (the day after I ate gluten on thanksgiving) I noticed I could feel control over a cheek muscle. I could not tell if it was a new development at first, or just something I had not noticed before. After obsessing all day and going back to previous selfies and videos, I am now confident that I am actually starting to improve!!!\n\nMy smile is coming back! My eye... well still do not have control over that one. But it is something- most of all it is hope. I needed that.\n\nI am not saying that gluten caused my BP or that eliminating it is what started helping it. I am just giving the circumstances and sharing so that others can detail their experiences as well. It is such a hopeless feeling having something with no known cause, and no known cure. My doc has never had anyone with it as long as I have had it. We got to learn together! \n\nKeep your spirits up! It can always comeback! \n\nOh- I should also note that once I ran out of b12 the last time- I stopped taking that. That also was within the last few weeks. I was taking a b complex though. Not sure if that is helpful or not Hi. I read an article while researching saying that a high lysine and low arginine diet showed beneficial results to those with BP. It is due to reducing inflammation ultimately. I wish I could find a link, but basically reducing refined carbs and sugars should definitely have an anti inflammatory effect.", "Is there anything you can do to stop eye-twitching? ", "Does anyone know what we are supposed to do about boosters if we got bells palsy as a (possible) vaccine side effect? Please do not bash me, I am absolutely pro-vaccine and my whole family got vaccinated as soon as it was possible. I just encountered a side effect, and I would like some help with my next steps.\n\nI developed partial facial paralysis about a month AFTER my second shot, and it was the emergency doctor that told me it was likely a side effect since it matched the same timeline as in the trials (I was just relieved I was not having a stroke). My symptoms were relatively mild as Bell's Palsy goes - pain in back right of head and inner right ear for four days, then muscle paralysis on half my face. I only had to wear an eyepatch at night to keep my eye closed. Prednisone for one week then some physio with a recovery team on zoom - nearly full recovery after about five weeks (I would say about 98%).\nAgain, definitely still pro vaccine and if I could do it again I would still get the vaccine. We had some covid close calls and vaccine may well have saved my life.\n\nWhich brings me to my two concerns:\n\n1) I plan to get a booster as soon as it is available, but I do not know if it is recommended for people that got bells palsy to take the same one or switch to a different vaccine.\n\n2) the pain that preceded my paralysis has been returning sporadically for months, well past when my muscle functioned returned. Everything I have read suggests the underlying problem should have been resolved (be it inflammation from the vaccine or a virus).\n\nSo that is where I am at. It is hard to get access to a doctor where I live, but I have a call in a couple of days and I am hoping to ask what tests I should get to see if I have an underlying issue, and to ask about the booster recommendations. I just wanted to check in here first to see if I am missing something, and/or to see if anyone else has had a similar experience from which I can draw insight. Or even just a reliable source of information - I am having a hard time cutting through all the anti-vax nonsense. Got a reaction to the first shot, waited until I got my second (last month), and no effects.\n\nI think what people have been saying is that it is not typical to react twice.\n\nI hope no one hates on my response either. I am very much pro-vaccine, but there are very rare side effects that occur. This is my second bout of bell's palsy, so I assume I am more prone to getting it anyways.\n\nRegarding lingering pain. I am ten years on from my first bout of BP and I still get pain in the affected side. It seems like when I get tired, my face muscles there tighten up. It seems to be the first thing to be affected when I get pain and stress. Is your pain in the areas where your paralysis occured? I would say I am 98% recovered because I still have a tiny bit of residual tightness, but before I could not move the right lower lips or jaw or close my eye all the way so I am definitely thrilled with where I am at. My pain, though, is in the back right of my skull and inner right ear, very much like the pain I felt *before* my palsy kicked in and not at all in my jaw or zones of former paralysis. I think the doc might send me for an MRI, but before I go that route I am hoping to see if my situation is normal for people that also got their palsy after their shot. And just to be clear I am still not absolutely certain my palsy is from the vaccine - that is just what the doctor said, but he did not have any way of doing a test to confirm. yes, I think the pain is in the paralysis zones, mostly in the cheeks and jaw\n\nmy husband (yes, he was lucky enough to have this too but a mild case that was finished up in two weeks) has tightness and weakness under his eye. He gets pulsing in this zone too. We both get weird pulses/ twitches/sensations in the ear. So no residual pain where you have it near the ear, but weirdness.  As I understand it the rate of Bell's Palsy is incredibly small. Two of twenty-four getting facial paralysis seems really high to me, actually - I was under the impression it was more like 1:10,000.\n\nWould you mind asking if your colleagues that developed Bell's Palsy could join this conversation or message me? I would really like to know more about their experiences.", "I have a salty taste in my mouth on the BP side. I am on day 5, BTW. Since waking, I have a distinctly salt taste on the left side of my mouth. My wife is telling me it is a good sign, that buds are re-awakening. She could be right, I have no idea.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? I had no taste for a few days on my bad side, and then everything started tasting like melted butter. It took a month or so for that to go away. Taste disturbance is normal. Not sure if it really indicated any sort of recovery for me, though. It is more commonly described as metallic but yes many of us get that. The guy who said melted butter was pretty close to the mark with what I am tasting. Hi tasting., I am dad. At onset I could tell that things tasted \"off\" for me, particularly on the BP side, but I would describe mine more as metallic and numb than salty.", "Final update A little late but as of a month ago I really stopped noticing a difference in my smile!! My right cheek is not completely parallel with my left, which does make my right eye look a little bigger than the left when I smile, but it is not noticeable to anyone but me. \n\nFor reference I was diagnosed in the very beginning of February. This recovery was much longer than my last time but I am grateful to feel back to \u201cnormal\u201d. \n\nFor anyone new here the best thing you can do is try as hard as possible to be patient. Recovery is different for everyone.", "Should I get a second opinion? I was just diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy this morning. I tried sleeping with a medical tape on my left eye, but it is really uncomfortable and it sort of hurt sometimes. The pain in my jaw areas are keeping me awake and when I finally slept, the pain woke me up again. Is there anyway to sleep more comfortably? \n\nBesides that, should I get a second opinion from another doctor? This morning, I went to a local clinic here and it took less than a minute for him to diagnose. I did not go through any MRI/CT scan or EMG. I was then given steroids to take twice a day. Although, when I googled Bell\u2019s Palsy, my symptoms matched with what were written. \n\nI read a few posts mentioning about vitamin B12. Can I take it now together with the mediation? BP is pretty distinctive where it only affects one side of your face. The difference between BP and a stroke is that you dont lose control over an entire half of your body (the arm drop test). If you still have control over everything but your face, its BP. \n\nJaw pain is normal. The nerve that is responsible for BP runs behind your ear, down your jaw. It hurts because the nerve is inflamed. The steroids help with the inflammation with that nerve. \n\nInstead of taping your eye, use eye gel. Its different than eye drops. Its for long periods of moisture like during sleep. They use it on people in comas too, to keep their eyes moist. The eye gel is thick and, in my opinion, acts like a glue and helped me keep my eye lid shut at night. Its ok if it gets into your eye. Its safe. Its just thicker eye drops. The pain will go away soon. It may get worse again for a few days once you stop taking the steroids. That was the worse of it for me- I had to keep it iced constantly and it was miserable. \n\nI am getting my first mri today, but I am ~4 months in. \n\nI second the eye gel recommendation. I have not had to tape my eye since. \n\nSorry you are going through it- it is such a strange thing and I know it makes you feel helpless. You will hear to be patient a lot. It is annoying to hear, but accurate. Best of luck! I was diagnosed a week ago and also had jaw pain, symptoms usually reach their worse about 48 hours in. The steroids should help with the pain, but you can also try over the counter pain meds. Schedule an appointment with a doctor near the end of your steroid treatment or if the pain gets worse/will not go away. Go get a blood test done for Lyme Disease it is the biggest cause of Bells Palsy and once they started me on meds to treat the Lyme I showed improvement in a couple days and started feeling better overall the next day Eye gel and a sleep mask helped me with my eye. For the pain in my face I found a warm wheatie bag/ hot water bottle worked better than any painkillers did! Thank you for your suggestion! I went out to buy the eye gel just now, I will try using it tonight! Thank you for your suggestion! I tried icing my jaw just now, it had sorta calm down the pain for a while. \n\nCan I know prior to your MRI, did u do any scanning at the hospital? Currently on Day two now, the symptoms are much stronger than yesterday! Cannot really move my mouth now, which I could yesterday. Will try to take some pain killer to see if it helps. Never thought of using the sleep mask, I will definitely try this out tonight! It definitely sounds much better than the tape I used last night. The doctor at my local clinic here was very sure that I had Bell\u2019s Palsy. But I think I would get a second opinion next Monday! Thanks for sharing! I really found heat from a wheat bag or hot water bottle the most effective pain relief, better than any pain killers. Your facial movement may get worse over the next few days. Try not to keep checking it by trying to move it too much, you are ill and need to rest up. It needs a chance to rest and let the inflammation of the nerve recover. Lyme Disease often comes with a bite that has a large red 'target' weal around it, its very distinctive. The tape was incredibly uncomfortable! I used Lacrilube at night, (UK) which is thicker again, almost same consistency as Vaseline. I warmed the tube by putting it my pocket and that helped with the application. There are different thicknesses of eye gel. There is the artificial tears, (useless in my opinion!) Then a thicker gel that I used for daytimes. Then lacrilube (not sure if its called that anywhere other than UK) which is super-thick for night time use. Hey! Yes, I did have a CT scan because I mentioned headaches. They wanted to see if it was something other than BP. \n\nI do not think the headaches were related. I did have ear pain the night before onset. My headaches were stress related and I believe BP was also stress related. \n\nWhether it is coincidence or not- I had no improvement for months, and then the day after thanksgiving I noticed the first improvement; it just so happened I had started a gluten free diet (for unrelated reasons) about two weeks before! I have no idea if the new diet helped my face- but I am curious if anyone else shares a similar scenario. If you have no results for a long time, maybe try that (not saying it will help, but I am dying to know if it could be a cause!). I did not notice one on myself at any point before I was diagnosed with it. It is still good to just get the blood work done That is why I said often, not always.  There are always exceptions. Also if you do not have weakness in your arms, but a droopy face on one side, you can tell if its a stroke by raising your eyebrows. If one eyebrow moves, its likely to be bells palsy or a similar facial palsy.  If both eyebrows move you are most likely having a stroke. A stroke is affecting one side of the brain, which apparently does not affect eyebrow/forehead movement, whereas Bells Palsy is caused by swelling of the facial nerve, which controls all movement to one side of the face.", "Anyone tried cbd oil? It is an anti inflammatory, supposedly a great one- but never see it mentioned for bells. Anyone try it? I used it daily for months.  Did not seem to help me (nor did anything else tbh). But it is not harmful so have at it! Others on this sub have reported benefits. Thank you so much! How did recovery work for you? Was it a sudden thing or did things come and go slowly? I am getting discouraged:( Please do not be discouraged.  Everyone heals differently.  Scroll through the sub and you will see lots of people making full recoveries within weeks.  Understand that a lot of people who recover quickly probably un-sub so you are not getting a real representative sample of BP suffers.\n\nMine was basically zero recovery at all for 3 months. And then I started to recover rather quickly after that. Maybe over the course of another month I went from no recovery to maybe 75%? And I have been stuck at 75% since then. But I am satisfied with my recovery. Full spectrum cbd tincture under the tongue helped releive the strained muscles in my face. I believe it was 350mg around that much.", "Ramsey Hunt Syndrome Hi guys I have a Dr apt today for bells palsy its been two weeks and the extreme pain and dizziness has only gotten worse. Anyone else have experience with this At the peak of my rhs I could not walk from the pain What Is RHS? Ramsay hunt syndrome Yes. Gabapentin helps with neurological pain and many people in this sub have benefited from taking it, including me. I thought I had Ramsay Hunt at first but was relieved that it was only BP because the recovery rate is much higher.", "Two weeks 2 weeks since diagnosis.

I would say we are 25% of the way there. I cannot close my eye still and it dries out when I am on my computer which can be frustrating, but it is definitely on the mend. Taking everyones' advice with the light face massages and happy to see steady progress.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, the taste in the left side of my tongue is coming back! Woohoo!!\n\nHope you are all having smooth recoveries \u270c\ud83c\udffd Slowly getting there dude, you could try picking up a cheap pair of blue light filter glasses to help with the glare Glad to see your getting there.

Glad you are seeing improvement! \ud83d\udcaa You will be 100% soon! Just be positive and do not stress. Mine lasted about a month and I was back to normal \ud83d\ude42\nGood luck", "Uneven eye due to Bell's Palsy? Hi all - thank you for the info on Bell's Palsy! I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy about 2 months ago. I believe it was caused by a viral infection due to allergies and most likely stress from work. :( My doctor prescribed a steroid to cure the viral infection and an anti-inflammatory medication to help with the swelling. I am happy to say that I am about 95% back to normal after 2 months! \n\nOne area that has not recovered is my right eye (of the affected side). Before BP, my eyes were completely symmetrical when I smiled, but now my right eye does not react to my smile so it is much more \"open\" than my left eye. It is very noticeable in photos. \n\nHas anyone here experienced an \"uneven eye\" or a \"smaller eye\" when they tried to small after getting Bell's Palsy? If so, how long did it take to cure?   \n\n\nThanks! \n\n  \nP.S. for those of you going through Bell's Palsy, stay strong! It took me a lot of rest (8 hours) and medication to cure it eventually it went away. :) Yes I have an uneven eye as well, I agree it is so noticeable in photos and makes me so upset. I have have BP for 5 months ago and my eye still does not close and bottom lip does not budge. Yes, this happens, and it will probably continue until your eyelid heals more fully. The eyelids of the affected eye are loose and do not contract, making your eye appear bigger or more bug eyed.\n\nIn the future, your affected eye might look smaller due to synkinesis. (I have this a decade later and I hate it!). What happens is that the nerves regrow and connect in a different way, so when you smile your eye closes more, and when you close your eyes, your mouth will turn up.\n\nThere are exercises you can do to minimize synkinesis. Check them out on youtube when you are more healed.\n\nI believe that trying too hard to get your eye to close earlier in recovery can cause some issues with synkinesis. \n\nHang in there! How long after onset did you feel the eye got smaller? I cannot recall exactly, but it was after I had recovered. It was after a year you think? do you mean shrinking back to normal or getting smaller due to synkinesis?\n\nif you mean getting back to normal, I think it looks pretty normal when you are at the point where you can fully close your eye again, and that is different for every person. I am still waiting this time (second bells palsy episode) to fully recover eye function at 6 months. First time around it was more like 6-8 weeks. \n\nsynkinesis probably started to become noticeable after 6 months first time. This time I feel like i am seeing some synkinesis already. u/gingermontreal thanks! I hope that my eye gets smaller to match my healthy eye, but it is already been 2 months. Fingers crossed. Hang in there! Thank you for replying.  My question was regarding synkinesis. So you feel your eye got smaller after 6 months? yes, I think synkinesis set in after 6 months do not worry, most people recover completely! It will likely get there! This time around I hardly started to recover around 2 months, but at 6 months I am a lot better I have sybkinesis. I think mine started at week 10 I am going to be 6 months. I wonder when it will stabilize. I hate it.  I noticed last month or this month that when I blink my lip slightly moves. I hope by month 6 everything stabilizes I am scared I do not think it stabilizes. I think you have to work to try to not get the muscles to do what they are doing. Go look at youtube for some exercises. I am trying them now. Wish I had them 10 years ago. So you think the body keeps developing them Which exercises if I may ask? And does that mean you have every single synkinesis or just a few I just have the one type, I think?\n\nGo on youtube a google bells palsy synkinesis. there is a bunch on there. I do not know if they work, but I am trying some. I think the muscles and nerves get used to the new pathways they make and that becomes the thing the muscles are trained to do. so you have to train them in new ways to undo the synkinesis. I am not a doctor though, so you should talk to someone who is an expert. I have and no one has given me answers So you only have the eye close with smile? I am still at the point where I can close my eye but it does not blink. I also have the bigger eye. Will doing those synkinesis excersises now help prevent me from getting synkinesis? Or are those something I would wait to do until after it happens? \n\nAlso it is alarming to read that trying to force myself to close my eye early on causes synkinesis. I did this a lot until my eye muscles felt strained because I thought it would help speed up recovery :/ I have the bigger eye too. It is finally starting to get smaller again, I am on month 4. But especially at the beginning, it looked so huge. I am hoping it will continue to even out. I hope yours does too. Ok that is encouraging! Hope it keeps getting better for you too :)", "What to do after medications run out? I was only given a week supply of prednisone &amp; acyclovir. The doctors told me I do not need any more to just wait it out &amp; basically hope for the best. I am taking all the supplements I have researched that helps like lysine &amp; b-12. What are some other things to take to hopefully speed up the healing process? I am also looking into cbd balm since cbd oil does not mix well with prednisone. Thanks so much in advance, this really sucks but I am glad there is such a helpful community on here it really means a lot People do B vitamins, CBD, tumeric, acupuncture, etc.\n\nIts entirely anecdotal.  I did all of that except acupuncture and I stalled out at about 85% recovery.\n\nOthers in this sub make a full recovery within weeks, even without any additional \"treatments.\"  I am sorry to say that there really just is not much science about BP beyond the antiviral and steroid. \n\nChin up, you will probably be fine! I also got only a week of prednisone and valtrex. I was one of the profoundly lucky ones that made a near-full recovery in just a few weeks, but it really was frustrating not knowing. (I am still having issues with my right eye 7 months later). \n\nPatience, do not push yourself to \"get better sooner\", because you do not want to damage the nerve itself. \n\nUnfortunately there really is not anything that is going to speed up or guarantee recovery from BP. Definitely do not do anything that is going to interfere with the prednisone or the acyclovir, those are the key medications that will help you.\n\nGood luck, and hopefully it will move on and you will get a full recovery sooner than later! So glad to see this!! I have been rushing my healing (has been 3 weeks) and this is the second time I got it. Patience is so important, and need to remind myself this daily! Thank you all for the suggestions &amp; kind words. This is the first time it is happened to me &amp; it is only been a week. I am coming to terms with it more each day but it is just been heavy on my low self esteem &amp; already damaged mental health. The pain comes &amp; goes but its mostly frustrating not knowing when this will end if it ever will. But reading everyone is experience has definitely made me feel less alone so thank you so much \u2661", "Is it weird that I am thankful that I got Bells Palsy ? I was diagnosed almost 2 years ago. I was unknowingly in depression for about 8-9 months, the reason I say this is because I do not remember anything much in those initial 8-9 months and I do not have any pictures of me during that time. Something happened after that and now I look at it I have greatly improved myself in terms of physical health, financially, socially, mind. I am in best shape of my life and people do not even notice that I have BP (I feel like I have recovered 95% and I am no going to stop ever), I have noticed changes in my face, my jawline is more chiseled than 2 years ago. I look good than ever I have been in my life before BP. I look back at my life and it is been a bumpy ride but it is been pretty good since I got BP. I do not want to get BP again in life but I am truly thankful that I got BP and it gave me a kick to be better in all aspects of my life. Hey I was wondering if you had a link to the exercises you mentioned There are tons of youtube videos about it, but one thing I realized that you should focus on those muscles where movement is weak.  I have used multiple videos and even consulted Dr. Meghana mentioned here in few posts. I started with this ( I realized that my eyes and cheeks were not recovering like other so I started looking on exercises particularly on eyes and cheeks. For eyes I followed (  and for cheeks ( .Once I got consultation from the doctor Meghana (she also has a ( I started following the exercises recommended by her, it is now become a part of daily routine and I am seeing great changes so far. Surprisingly the ( video I watched has most of the exercises recommended by Dr. Meghana, maybe it varies for you but if your eyes and cheeks are still tight you can start with the first video, otherwise I would highly recommend to reaching to a specialist who can recommend you the right exercise if you are not seeing results with your current routine. Wow thanks for the great reply. My BP was actually caused by a motorcycle accident that led to a fracture through my facial nerve canal. It will be 3 years since the accident tomorrow. I have not done any facial exercises and have not seen much improvement since a year after the accident. I would say most of my face is 80% recovered with my lips being the least. Do you think I can still improve despite the long time it is been since my accident? I am not expert about this but do not give up man ! I stopped for 8-9 months and did not saw any progress but in past 4-5 months I started exercises aggressively &amp; consulted another doctor and I am seeing improvements. So I recommend you to hope for the best and do exercises regularly as a daily routine. You should be seeing some improvement. Good luck.", "HELL PLEASE.  Does not look like bells palsy to me.  Bells Palsy is UNMISTAKABLE.  I guess there is a slim chance that you are catching a (very) early onset or something but that is very unlikely.\n\nA good test is to try and fill your cheeks with air, puff them out.  Or even fill your mouth with water.  If you are unable to hold air or water then you have bells palsy.  Another test is simply moving your eyebrows up and down, if they both move you do not have it.\n\nBells Palsy (for me) did not hurt until a few weeks after it came on.\n\nBased on your picture alone, i would say there is a 99.99% chance that you DO NOT have Bells Palsy.

Thank you!! I experienced the same until I tried acupunture. I went from an expected 6- 12 month heal to a 6- 8 weeks expected heal time with the acupunture sessions twice a week. That is good to hear. I did do 6 sessions of acupuncture, but about 3 weeks ago to see if it sped up the healing. I think it did help slightly but it is hard to tell. Would you recommend continuing the acupuncture? Yes. I am doing a total of 10 sessions. My doctor added some type of electrical stimulation to help awaken the nerves. It seems to really help.\nHe suggested daily facial exercises which involves smiling (using as many facial muscles as possible) and frowning (again, using as many muscles as possible).\nI am here for you anytime \ud83d\ude0a \u2764 Thanks I really appreciate it!!

I still look funny and I still have a hard time eating talking and drinking but just this little improvement has me over the moon \u2665\ufe0f\n\nI know it may get worse again but I am holding onto hope The blinking was my first sign of recovery, but kissy faces took a lot longer.  The one upside to Bells is being able to appreciate the little things like being able to blow out a candle. Congrats!! I miss whistling", "How do you help facial nerves after Bell's Palsy. Around the age of 10 I had a small case of Bell's Palsy, which caused the nerves on one side of my face to stop working. I took some medicine and it got better, but 14 years later you can still see a difference. Is there anything to assist the nerves? Or is it too late now? I would also like to know  Look into facial retraining. Jackie Diels OT is well known for her work in this area.  I would consult your doctor about mixing vitamins B6 and B12 into your diet. My doc encouraged me to take supplements during my BP spell. I hope this helps!", "11th day of BP. I started to feel discomfort and pain near my ear. Should I get it checked out at the ER? I went to the Urgent Care on Friday as the inflammation meds ran out and they said everything was going fine. They did not prescribe any meds and around the same time I started to feel a sting along the 7th cranial nerve. Is this normal? The first week I was not feeling any pain or discomfort. Now I am getting this sting and it is also giving me little aches on the back of my head.\n\nI was wondering if this is normal or if I should get it checked out right away. I am not a doctor, but I do like to play one at home. Any time you have questions, it is best to consult a real professional. With that said, many people feel pain as the nerves begin to recover. It can range from aggravating to debilitating. If it gets bad, have it checked. Hopefully, it is just a sign of a complete recovery. I think it is a good thing if you are feeling things along that nerve. I think it is normal, but I am not a doctor, obviously. This is my second time with it, and I remember that some pain/sensation when things were coming back. \n\nSome of it is muscle pain for things being out of whack, so make sure to massage your face, neck, and head. I had the same symptoms flare up a few days into having BP. I work near train tracks and the horn would almost bring me to my knees. I also had lingering headaches from dull to painful. Some light pain relievers helped and so did taking B12 (for inflammation). \n\nI would always suggest consulting a doctor but I understand if you do not or cannot.\n\nJust saying I had the exact same thing and it went away right before I was able to move my face again. Thanks, it helps to hear its part of the \u201cprocess\u201d. I have not seen much on BP from week 2-4. It mainly what occurs in the beginning and when it is prolonged.\n\nI entered my self into the ER and for the most part just waiting on getting scanned before I go but DR says everything is going well and I am doing everything I can already. Thank you for the advice, I hope your second time goes well. I am hoping it just the nerve recovering too. Thanks My gp told me that with BP your jaw joint gets inflamed too, causing pain, if it is coming from there (which is just below your ear) it is possibly that.\n\nI got given some strong pain killers and it went after a couple of weeks Thanks, I got a cat scan and everything seems fine. The pain is heavy for me unfortunately, I was not prescribed pain pills so for now it is just going to have to be Advil. Try cocodamol, but it is addictive so only use for 3 days Thanks, I will see if at tomorrow\u2019s neurology visit they will prescribe me something. How long did you have BP? Still got it, three months and counting. Bilateral too\n\nBut the pain has gone, so that is a plus I am glad your pain went away.

I am glad a few peeps have responded to my post so far.", "Could A Colon Cleanse Be The Answer?? 2-Week Recovery Hi everyone, first and foremost I want to thank all of you guys for your input and suggestions to help speed up my recovery. I also want to note that although I did not see a doctor, this advice is not to be used in place of a medical professionals advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy onset of Bell's Palsy happened on May 25th and it is now June 10th and I am happy to say that I am 98% recovered. My case included severe eye sensitivity and one side of my mouth relaxed so it was hard for me to talk and eat. But even with that being said, it was pretty mild as compared to most other people that suffer. Also I decided to ditch the doctor and try to heal myself holistically. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started a colon cleanse 3 days after my onset and adopted a raw vegan diet for the duration of this cleanse. I also made sure to get more sleep then usual and stayed out of the light. I noticed symptoms starting to clear up on the 4th day of the cleanse and I am pretty much back to normal 14 days into my cleanse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not sure how much this contributed to my recovery, but I was able to heal without using steroids. Hopefully  I was able to provide people who are currently experiencing this with some hope that it will not last forever. \ud83d\ude0a Gut health controls way more than we know I think, so who knows... Certainly does not hurt to give it a try! Congrats on the speedy recovery. I fasted for 2 weeks, 12-14h nothing special.. it should promote healing in general, I am also 2 weeks now almost fully recovered but took steroids and all that..\n\nYeah it should pass on it is own, looks like people who have it permanently had some failed surgery and BP is just generic diagnosis for everything related to face nerves", "(f30) Genetic BP and worried about getting covid vaccine I have signed up to get the Pfizer vaccine but at that time I did not know it could possibly trigger BP. My mom told me she spoke to her doctor that recommended I should not vaccinate against covid because of my medical history. Now I am a little worried as I have had BP two times already when I was 8 and 13 yo. I have recovered 100% since then but BP runs in the family. My grandma got it once and my uncle (m53) three times, the last time was two years ago. \nHow was your experience post covid vaccination? \nThanks! I had it ten years ago, got it again after the covid vaccine, pfizer.\n\nI read this article last night: (\n\neta: for what it is worth, my husband got bell's palsy two years ago (lucky us, right?! we should buy a lottery ticket), but he is going to go get his vaccine. Oh ok, sorry about that.. Thank you for sharing, it looks like we are more likely to get it again. edited my response, but I will reply in case you do not see\n\nFor what it is worth, my husband got bell's palsy two years ago (lucky us, right?! we should buy a lottery ticket), but he is going to go get his vaccine. We figure the risk is still quite low. If he gets bell's after it, we will definitely report back!\n\nI would speak with your doctor, especially since you have had it twice. It is a hard choice for sure. Ugh. Wish we did not have to deal with this! As much as I absolutely hate having BP, and had never even heard of it before, I think I still would have gotten the vaccine because I am afraid of getting COVID more. 32 (f) had bells at 29.5 and got the Pfizer vaccine, felt really sick for a day but no other effects 41m got bells in May of 2020. Got Moderna vaccine 2 months ago without any issue. 32 (f) Bells since February. Pfizer 2nd shot Tuesday. So far so good Great, Thanks for sharing! Thank you! Sounds good! Thank you for sharing, I hope you are recovering well! Hey, thank you for your words. I am prone to getting the vaccine but I think I will wait a little and get a second opinion. What are the odds that you both had BP?! I hope all will be well for your husband !  Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me :) I have had it twice.  I am still recovering from the second episode.  I went ahead and had  Pfizer vaccine. It has not caused any issues with Bell's Palsy.", "Severe pain on affected side I am on day 11 of BP and I did not expect it to hurt this much. The entire left side of my face is affected and my tongue/taste buds. It feels like someone hit me in the face with a 2x4 or an old bruise healing kind of pain. And it is pretty much constant. Oh, and the ringing in my ear, also constant. \n\nDo either of these go away? I know healing is not linear and there is no one way it all goes down. I guess I am wondering what the first signs of healing are, and if this ends up taking longer, do I have to deal with the severe pain and ear ringing just as long? I had absolutely horrible pain from days 3 to 14 ish. It did go away. I do not know why it was as bad as it was. It really brought me to my knees. I am sorry you are going through this as well.\n\nI am slowly getting better, but I am six weeks in. \n\nNothing would help the pain so I had to use cannabis to help it calm down. it was excruciating. I am sorry you are going through this. I could not get in to see a doctor, but if you can talk to someone that would be best. One of my friends thought it might be the shingles virus, but I did not have any rash, so I am not sure. Maybe the pain was from tension or general nerve pain. I started stretching out my jaw manually with my hands because I thought it might be tight and cramped up. That seemed to give me a little relief. The same happened to me after I got off the steroids meds. It lasted about 4-6 days. Take warm showers and drink lots of water. Hope you feel better soon I had it too one of my times, but for longer. It freaking sucks, but it goes away eventually That is nerve pain and it is excruciating! My doctor prescribed naproxen and gabapentin for me and within hours of taking it, I had relief. I am so sorry you are going through this. \n\nI had horrible pain for about 2 weeks. There were days where I just laid in the dark because it hurt to do anything else. \n\nThe ear ringing took longer to die down. IMO, I do not think it went away 100% for me. I still have some nerve damage 6 years later so it makes sense it never went away. I know most people get back to 100% so I am not the norm. Thanks, here is hoping. Thank you. Sorry to hear yours has not healed 100% that is got to be rough Glad you found something that worked for you Glad to hear your getting better even if it is slow. How many times did you get BP? It is not really noticable if you do not know me/are not looking closely. But it is noticable to me. My eye and my mouth are like weirdly connected. For example, if I like pucker my lips my eyelid closes halfway. It does the same thing while chewing. I have to work really hard while using mouthwash or it will just dribble out. My mouth and eye are crooked when my face is in a neutral position. Like I said, it is not that is obvious but I do not like the way I look anymore. \n\nI can joke about it now. I call it \"my little eye\" and treat it like it is own entity. \"My little eye decided to droop today.\" \"That pic really highlights my little eye.\" \"My little eye is sure little today.\"  So annoying. 3 times on my right side, and then the most recent time I had it on both sides. Also the only time I ever had this pain, was the most recent time. It is random I can only imagine. I am glad you found some humor in it. Goodness. That sounds so hard. Doctors have no leads or ideas on what is causing it? Not really lol. Though their knowledge about it seems to have been getting better through the years That absolutely sucks. BP sucks. If you are not on any meds then be sure to take Advil to lower the painz", "So I am on day 8 of my recovery I can feel the muscles in my face wanting to move more and more each day and can smile a little bit more from yesterday. I also wanted to know if anyone get headaches in the back of head, is that normal? That is too normal. It is more like a throbbing pain? Or constant? Very normal Sounds like you are recovering quickly. I did not notice a change for a few months and I had constant headaches behind my ear. Never had headaches before, it was not very pleasant.", "Causes of bells I got diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy about 3 weeks ago, I was getting ready for a dentist appointment when I noticed the facial paralysis got terrified and went to the er :( got prescription for prednisone for 7 days plus lowering dose for 4 days . \nSituation got better, still not fully healed, but making progress. About a day or 2 after finishing prednisone I woke up in the middle of the night shaking with high fever \ud83e\udd12 I took 2 ibuprofens and tried to sleep , next day I felt weak and still had symptoms of fever, for which I took paracetamol cold (for 3 days) I assumed this was withdrawal symptoms since I was out on a very high dose compared to my weight. On the third day all the symptoms passed (face still not back to normal but I mean the fever and stuff) \nBut on the 4 th day I felt an itch in my nose so I looked only to find a cold sore \ud83e\udd74(wtf) this was this morning, and this evening I have been feeling sharp passing pain in ear and scalp\ud83d\ude2d I was reading about it and cold sore virus can be a cause of Bell\u2019s palsy , personally I had it since I was a child but very little outbreaks, and now it only appeared after I had the fever, anyone else has this ? Could this be the cause of my bells ?  \ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23this whole situation is really scary and seems so unpredictable\ud83d\ude14 You should get on antivirals promptly. They should have been administered when you presented with Bells to the ER. Viral infections like the kind that can cause cold sores are the most common cause of BP. Like the comment before this, did they give you the antivirus? I did not get it day one and so I went to urgent care and they gave it to me then on my 3rd day of BP. \n\nI am on week 2 and I have been taking B12 pills, doing acupuncture 2x a week and just started testing with a neurologist. Today I am trying CBD oil.\n\nBetween day 8-11 I had sever pain in the ear and back of my head next to that ear on the affected side. Today it has calmed down.\n\nIf you are having issue go to an urgent care or ER just to be sure. The cold sore virus can also be transmitted to the genitals via oral sex. They did not give me any since they are not proven to improve outcome of Bell\u2019s palsy compared to steroids alone\ud83d\ude14 I am considering L lysine 3 grams a day. \n\nHow is your progress? Do you find cbd oil useful? I am taking L carnitine.\n\nI also went to a neurologist a few days ago that basically said to me all I can do is wait lol They do not hurt to take in case you do have some virus but that is only during the first 72hrs to get on them. Hopefully they do not make a difference.\nI also had aches and pain in the back of my head and ear on the affected side after I left my meds it been a week since then and now I am feeling well. So hopefully anything extra will leave you soon too. Wish you the best. Thank you \u263a\ufe0fwish you the best as well!

While I would say I am about 95% healed, I am still overcoming challenges and insecurities. My biggest insecurity is how my eye has healed. I can finally close it all the way and blink, meaning I do not have to fill my eye with gobs of ointment to keep it from getting damaged (i can finally wear eye makeup again without it running down my cheek). However, when I talk or chew, my eyelids constantly twitches- opening and closing on its on. I work in the childcare field, and kids are brutally honest. They are always asking what is wrong with my eye, and why it keeps going up and down. It is made me very self conscious when I speak to people, especially if I am speaking to someone professionally, because I know what my eye is doing as I am talking. While I am glad my smile is almost back to normal, and my speech is getting closer to normal (I only have issues occasionally with the letter F), it is still frustrating that my eye in my opinion, has healed incorrectly. So that is my year long journey in a nutshell with bells. It is an extremely frustrating condition Sounds like you are experiencing synkinesis. I am about to hit my 6th month mark from diagnosis. I have not seen any progress or healing since. How long did it take you to see progress? Have you tried b12 and or massage? Im 3 weeks since diagnosis and have recovered at least 50% mostly my eye and nose. My ear is still thinking outside the box and the left side of my mouth is just as dead as when it started. Wish you and the op lots of luck in your recovery! I have tried what feels like everything so far. Three different neurologist, acupuncture, B12, turmeric, anti-virals, steroids, facial exercises and therapy, etc. \n\nI am feeling a bit hopeless now It took a good four to five months to see anything. I tried acupuncture, but did not see any results from that. At least six months until I could blink my eye This gives me hope And progress was extremely slow. You may be having improvement, but not noticing anything because it is so slight. Please do not ever give up hope. You will healed. Be consistent with facial exercises and massages. I personally massaged my face and muscles around my head (trigger point therapy). I also included vitamin b6, which helps supports the nervous system. I hope it helps with anything \u2764\ufe0f Man im sorry. I wish you the best. I know my mouth is really getting me now and you have been dealing with yours way longer. We just got to keep our head up. It could be worse. At least that what they say.... Exactly. My first few weeks were really hard on my mental health. But I am slowly accepting my ailment. Hi slowly accepting my ailment, I am dad.", "Question about BP I was diagnosed yesterday with a mild form of BP. Luckily I caught it very early so doc prescribed the steroids and antibacterial meds and sent me on my way. The only real struggles I have are with my eye not closing fully and my nose not being able to wrinkle. However, I was in class today and above my right eyebrow (affected side), I noticed almost like a muscle contraction with a rather visible line on my forehead. Has anyone experienced this? ", "Time off work? Coping tips? Curious how much time you took off work after your diagnosis? I had 3 days off plus the weekend and now trying to get back into the swing of things today. I am struggling so much. Talking is hard and very tiring. I am on meeting #2 and already need a nap. My vision is super blurry in my BP eye so it is hard to focus on the screen. Thankfully I am working from home but I can tell it is going to be a long week. \n\nI have an upcoming maternity leave so need to focus on transferring projects and do not want to take too much time from away from PTO to save for Mat leave. \n\nAny tips for coping at work? You should tape your BP eye closed - that will protect it from damage because of dryness.  If not tape, get an eye patch.\n\nI only missed 1/2 day when I was diagnosed.  I had a meeting I did not want to miss so I went, eye patched, slurring speech and all.  I also discovered I could not drink out of a straw at the meeting.  \n\nIf you are wearing out that much, the virus must be taking a toll on you.  see if you do a few 1/2 days till you get built up.  Are you on an antiviral and steroids? Good context for sure. Maybe it is the virus that is getting me down more. On top of that, I am pregnant so it is all kinds of factors. I am on the steroid and antiviral as of Friday so hopefully will start to see some improvements in the next few weeks. Fingers crossed. At the time of my diagnosis I was adjunct faculty at a community college and a pilates/yoga teacher. \n\nI was diagnosed on a Friday night. I taught a pilates class on Saturday morning, 2 pilates/yoga classes on Monday, a lecture on Tuesday and another pilates/yoga class on Wednesday. The department I was in had a performance on Tuesday night which I had to go to. I explained the situation but talking was SO HARD. Luckily, it was the end of the semester so I had a few weeks off from school. I think I got subs for my 4 pilates/yoga classes for a week but it was really hard to teach those. If I had been in a different situation (no paid time off) I would have taken as much time as possible. I was miserable. \n\nEdit- I wore sunglasses during my classes. It helped with the light.\n\nI am sorry you are dealing with this! I hope you feel better soon. I was \"lucky\" enough to be out of a job when my BP hit. I felt like I was sort of ready to work again after 10-14 days or so. Being done with the steroid treatment definitely gave me a boost of energy.\n\nAs for tips at work:\n\n* Use eye drops liberally, and do manual blinks (where you use your fingers to close your BP eye) and do that often. You do not want your eye drying out.\n\n* If you have online meetings and want to slur your words less, you can help your pronunciations by helping your BP side of the mouth with your fingers.\n\nI rgink those are the best tips I have since I did not personally try working while being afflicted by BP.\n\nBest of luck on your recovery :) Wow I just tried your tip of helping the BP side with my fingers and that really does work. Thanks for you input!!!\n\nI feel \u201clucky\u201d that I am going through this I am the world of covid so that I can be uncomfortable at home vs showing my face at work and having to explain all the time. You are welcome :)\n\nI see that someone has suggested taping your eye shut during work. Personally I do not recommend that during the day. For the nights to keep it shut, sure. But you do not want to train your BP eye to be shut when your brain is sending \"open eye signal\", if you know what I mean. \n\nDuring the day I highly recommend using eye drops and doing manual blinks with your fingers. You can also use an eye patch, but I mostly recommend using that when you are either outside, or doing stuff that will put your exposed eye at risk (cooking and cleaning for example). I think I took 1-2 days off work due to the head ache. But I carried on going to work as normal. \nI was open about my BP with my colleagues. I tried not to let it change my life too much. \n\nI held up my cheek to talk, for the P\u2019s and B\u2019s. Manually blinked my eye etc. I share this same concern about the eye patch during the day. This is unrelated, but my personal struggle is that I already had some vision focus issues where I used to inadvertently cover an eye when trying to focus. My glasses correct for that. So having an eye patch during the day could reverse some of the \u201ctraining\u201d I have been doing.\n\nIt sure is a lot easier to put the eye patch on instead of the drops and manually shutting, but have to find the right balance all things considered!!! I like that approach of being open with my colleagues. Everyone has been very supportive so far which is a blessing. \n\nThose dang B\u2019s and P\u2019s really are the struggle!!!", "Another \"cool\" trick Blowing on something hot to cool it off, only wherever the air from your mouth actually goes does not get anywhere near the hot thing, and then you dog shovel it in to your mouth to avoid the normal food fall that occurs while eating and it is hot as blazes and you spit it out. Good times. My favorite trick was being able to eat spicy food that normally I could not handle... Cannot think something is too spicy if I cannot taste anything lol. Yup. Second favorite trick, bitting the side of my cheek.", "(6 years) with half a smile I was diagnosed with it 6 years ago now i am 23 years old so at first it was really bad my right side of my face was hurting and the right ear was always peeping i hated loud noises and bright lights i got to therapy did massage to it and trained my face with movement and some sessions with electric shock thingy and the meds i did all that for like 3 months straight 2 sessions a week so in the end maybe like 20%-30% of the movement came back my hearing on the right ear is about 40% i can hear but its like there a plug in my ear  so after the 3 months i was depressed I shutdown everyone close to me I really did not want anyone to see me like that did not want anyone asking questions about it so 6 years later if i smile u can see it but otherwise you really could not i kind of learned how to deal with in public it still not that great but hey i finish law school in a couple months. I am glad you have learned how to make the best of things. BP is no picnic. Do you still have pain from it? Do you find yourself avoiding smiling in public? Not pain but sometimes it is uncomfortable and yes in public if i see someone really curious about it and staring i tend to avoid smiling or cover my face or  move my head to cover it Unfortunately some people never fully recover. 15 years here and it still affects me daily.

Was diagnosed about a month after it happened. My face is about 70% back to normal now. Trying to get an appointment with my doctor to find out what I can do now to help get that last bit better but its impossible to see anyone right now. My eye waters a lot when I eat too which is frustrating. What can I do to help my face fully heal? Thanks &gt;My eye waters a lot when I eat too which is frustrating.\n\ndoes your nose get runny while you eat too? because mine does, IN ADDITION to the tearing. its really annoying. \n\nAnyways, hopefully people will chime in because im in the same boat, especially with the synkenisis. im about 2years post diagnosis for bilateral BP. Probably going to go to a speech therapist to help I am now 16 months after onset.  Had BP twice before, both times were quick and complete recoveries.  Face has now recovered quite a bit, but smile not quite there on affected side.  Synkinesis is most annoying at this point.  Eye we  watering and runny nose after eating ad well.  Doing facial exercises and stretches under care of a therapist at the U of Michigan Facial Nerve Clinic.    \n\nVery slow progress, but trying to stay optimistic that full recovery is still possible.", "Trying to take it in stride with a bit of humor I woke up this morning and immediately realized I could not use the left side of my face. Cannot blink, cannot smile, nada. I knew it was BP. My ear had been bothering me a few days, but I thought it was an ear infection except I did not have a fever or drainage. Vertigo had me bedridden for 3 days. As I have a family history of strokes, I went to the ER and was seen quickly. The attending doctor told me upfront I had a severe case of Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (a type of BP triggered by the shingles virus) that I may not fully recover the functionality in my face, and if I do, it may take me longer than others. Nonetheless, I met with the neurologists, had an MRI, everything came back clear thankfully.\n\nThey wrote me some scripts and recommended an eye patch. My first thought was \"Great! I always wanted to be a pirate,\" pair that with the fact I think I look like a cartoon character talking out the side of my mouth, I have decided it adds to my quirky charm. As someone that makes content for a living, it definitely occured to me how this would affect the way other people see me, but I have decided to do my best to have some fun with it while I recover. I do not want to let it get me down; I know that is easier said than done.\n\nI can understand other people's hard feelings they may have dealing with this, and that is valid. I wish everyone the best in their recovery. If anyone has links/sites for cool eye patches (preferably that fit under glasses) please let me know \ud83d\udc9b Go you! Attitude totally plays a big roll in this. Make sure to get lots of rest, even if you do not think you need it. \nAs for eye patches. I think I bought about 5 different ones and was never happy. All I can say is do not buy the domed ones because they do not actually help the situation. I ended up buying disposable Stick on ones. Oh and eye drops, lots of eye drops! Thank you! I was considering the stick on patches, so I appreciate your input on that Im taping my eye every night for now. I wish i could just wear a patch that fit perfectly, but alas!\n\nI also take all of this with a (big) grain of humor. At first, when i was joking and then laughing, it was fun to see my gf laugh and then cry because she was sad for me. Now it is just normal (even tho  it is just been 2 weeks and a half). \n\nAlso, about the ear pain, its nice for you that they found nothing. Im waiting for a neurologist call anytime soon to get it check because i would have the 5th nerve also affected (bp affecting the 7th) and i am in constant pain. They gave me medication until then but i dont know if they are doing enough of their job, cuz it still hurt like a bitch sometimes.\n\nAnyway, lets just hope my interview in 3 hours go well haha. That Is the only thing i care about for now! I was diagnosed with BP yesterday, so weird is not it? Wake up one morning and bam, it is there, I love you are approach to this! Might have to back pocket some of that charm you have and style out a pirate popeye myself!\n\nJoking aside I have got the classic keynote symptoms, reduced motor function in my left eye lid (constantly watering) cannot smile, frown etc. Pain Inside my left ear canal (thinking it was the onset of an ear infection) and loss of feeling/sensation on my tongue. Just started my 10 day course of steroids. I am sorry you have to deal with this (definitely adds a new meaning to 'I woke up like this') but Welcome aboard, matey! Lol You are officially the main character. You know how in every great story they have to go through something seemingly tragic that ultimately ends up making them more cool? THIS IS YOUR MOMENT! An eye patch? Facial paralysis? Definite protagonist energy. \n\nI hope you feel better soon, get lots of rest, and do your best not to stress. If you need assistance, do not be afraid to ask those around you for help. Wishing you all the best in your recovery, friend. That is a pretty good overview! Well, I have always toyed with the idea of looking as cool as Big Boss from the Metal Gear Solid franchise. Now I get to play out that role!\n\n\n\nThanks Buddy, I will do the best I can. i was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt a week ago - also rocking the eye tape + eye patch combo. i think the eye patch looks kind of cool actually, and since my pre-parlysed face was smiling most of the time - i know take some small joy in looking like a bit of a bad  \n\nso - how are you doing, one month in? Curious to hear from another Ramsay Hunt diagnosed. For me - I am 7 days in from symptom onset, 6 days in from steroids/valtrex - and no movements yet on the paralyzed side. Hey! One month in I am doing great. My smile is nearly 100% but I am still not able to blink (though my lid will move slightly.) The sores from the inside of my ear are gone but the inside is still very sensitive if I scratch it. At this point, I am still having some light sensitivity, but I no longer need an eye patch. that is great! and hopes your eye  continues to heal  quickly!", "thicker cheek? While doing my stretch exercises for my synkinesis, I have noticed that the upper part of my paralysed cheek a bit thicker is than the healthy side. Its not so thick that you can notice it without feeling, but its definetely thicker. Is this a common side effect, or could this be a inflammation? I first thought it was fat because it did not obviously move as much as my healthy side, but then it would'nt be on the upperside of my cheek i think. Anybody knows something about this? If you are taking Prednisone, it may be a side effect. I am not. I have used it, but that is like 2,5 months ago...", "Exhausted with occasional chills I got BP about 2 1/2 weeks ago. I am feeling super tired and randomly get chills that go away-- I have not had a fever at any point. Wondering if this is normal, or if others have experienced something similar to this? I have been sleeping 7-8 hrs every night so it is not sleep deprivation. I feel exhausted for sure, which surprised me given the steroids. I do find myself feeling cold even when my partner is not. House is set at 72, we live in Texas and I am still walking around in thick socks. \n\nMostly I get the random bouts of heat and then chills when I am sleeping though. \n\nSorry not much help here but I feel you! No this is great! Thanks for sharing, at least I can feel like it is not completely out of norm to feel this way. I have been thinking about the timeline...and I am also thinking I may not have tapered off the steroids long enough. All the withdrawal symptoms for Prednisone (the steroid we all took at the beginning) match what I am feeling as well...and they align with when I took my last \"taper\" pill. Guess we will see. Feel better soon! I just finished off my 6-day steroids course, but I did not have anything to taper off from. How long was your course? So by the end of my steroid Rx I felt like I was dying! I could not sleep, I was sweaty all the time and so exhausted I felt like could sleep standing up. So I asked the pharmacist at my store (I work in a grocery store), and she said I was dehydrated, and that I needed to drink as much Gatorade (or anything with electrolytes) as I could, and water of course. So I did and it really helped! I have had BP now for 18 days now and I can see improvements everyday. Ive also added Vitamin B12 everyday, so I think that has also helped a lot. I still try to take it easy and rest when I can, anything to speed up this slow healing process! I first did a 7 day course of 60mg a day and then did a 6 day tapering program. Starting with 6 (15mg) - 1 (15mg). That is great! I have been drinking a lot of water but maybe I need an electrolyte boost. Thanks for sharing and glad you are seeing improvements! I did a B 12 shot the other day, not super sure it made a difference.", "Bedoyecta Tri justifies 2 wks Mexico? Had  BP several times most case has been  almost  2 years  duration.\nIn  DFW last week a friend  told  me  she  and  her  daughter had  experienced  a Full recovery from  bells  palsy after receiving a series of  facial  injections of Bedoyecta TRI.\nIs  anyone  else  familiar with  this treatment that  is  not  available in  the  US?\nReady  to  head  to  Mexico but need more info regarding price...where to  go...Any info  appreciated. I should mention I have had the steroids, antibiotics, electrical stimulation, done facial exercises even had  accupuncture last week. I have seen a neurologist had MRI etc... Nothing has fixed it. Hesitate to go the surgical route.\nThis is my 4 th episode. I recovered fully from all previous bouts with Bell's palsy but not this time. \nHas anyone heard anything about Bedoyecta as a treatment? I am desperate. Hi. This is true. I have seen many cases like yours even in family members and bedoyecta works. I am skeptical but I saw it several times.  You should try it!!", "Newly Diagnosed, should I be at work? I was diagnosed yesterday a Sunday with Bells Palsy yesterday by a doctor in medical clinic. He did not really offer lots of follow up information like whether I should be working or not. So today I returned to my job as an Early Childhood Teacher. I guess I am asking if other people were recommended to have time off, how much time off and how did those with time off manage being bored at home? (I love working and get bad anxiety and depression when home for too long). Thanks My doctor said it was ok if I go back to work immediately. You might just find yourself peppered with questions. But aside from that and some minor talking disability (+/- eye problems), you should be all good I went to work the next day.  Just be ready to answer the same question 500 times... My experience was also accompanied by a migraine a few days later. If you start to get a headache, take the day off so it doesnt turn into a migraine. The doctor who saw me at ER told me I should get absolute rest after I asked her if I could work for the rest of the week (it was tuesday then, I had quit one month before and my last day would be Friday! I asked if I could work for 3 more days, basically)... Ofc, it was also because I was not able to close my left eye and had to work with computers... I could not hurt my eye.\nThe thing is, on the first days, when you are taking meds, you may be suggested to rest in order to see if it gets better. Obviously, the big majority of the cases only get cured with physiotherapy, meds will not really get you cured right away... So it is a matter of choice for you.\nWhat I suggest you is to be aware of stressful situations. More than working or staying home, you should avoid stressing yourself, and that is the thing you should take in consideration before making a decision.\nDo you know when I moved for the first time? 3 weeks after being on physiotherapy, during my holidays in another country. I was not able to stress over my condition - I actually was stressed with the travel itself, but let us forget that lol -, and I suddenly saw I could move my face a lot better.\nHowever, I remember working from home with some difficult people (not organized people who forget things till the timeline is due and avoid ur contact most of the times), stressing a lot because of it.... Even my physiotherapist noticed that and warned me I was too tense and worried while I should not be.\nI believe that is up to you. If you feel the need to rest and recharge, I would suggest you to take a break. If your work is not stressful and/or staying home would be worse for you, then I believe you should go to work.\nJust prepare yourself for the questions. I would teach little kids at the time during the weekends, for example, yet no one really asked me about it, just the children. But that is kind of normal on my country, they do not ask those things in the opening. Just get ready to feel others' eyes on you. Be ready for a lot of questions and have meds ready for pain management! I found the migraines and facial pain made it hard to concentrate I went to work right away and I work face-to-face with no customers.  Doctors all said that was fine, could not hurt, and all that speaking might be therapeutic for my face muscles.  However, I certainly felt much better whenever I was resting, so I got as much sleep as possible outside of work. I am not the type to take off work (I own the company), but found that I needed some time to adjust, rest, and recover for the first few weeks. I worked shortened days. I had a lot of pain for the first three weeks or so. I guess that had something to do with my decision. I am a training manager and I went on disability for 8 weeks because I was told to rest and relax and I could not while training. I also had bad headaches and could speak properly so I could not train employees. I was diagnosed yesterday too, I went to the Dr cause I thought I might have had a stroke, the few days before yesterday I had been having bad headaches, My doctor recommend me to do my life as usual and take care of my eye. I was a little bit depressed so my boss give me a week off as we did not have to much work at that moment. I still take my classes at university but I had a hard time concentrating due to the high doses of medecin I was taking. I was surprised when people started asking and almost everybody know a relative or colleague who had the same issue. If you have the time take leave. I am retired and staying home doing absolutely nothing helped me. I am almost at 4 weeks and about 85% recovered. Rest rest rest and avoid stress You could go to work. I was told MANY times.rest..rest..rest. when I didnt rest it showed in my face, my speech and I would be totally exhausted. Thanks for the reply\u2019s everyone. I took today off work to see another GP (doctor) who told me to avoid stress mostly but he explained that it was my choice. I decided to only take an another off tommorow and go back on Thursday. For me being at home alone bored with nothing but my thoughts to occupy me would only make me more stressed and anxious. My boss has been understanding so far so I will talk to her on Thursday about what dr said and go form there. How is your recovery going? Thanks for asking, its been two weeks and I am trying to take it one day at a time. Some days I am sad and soo tired and others its just a mild annoyance. How bad are your symptoms? Total paralysis? I am on day 8 now and I am still lucky enough to have about 60% of my face free to move My face is not totally paralysis and I am thankful that my eye is more free to close and not really watering anymore. I am mostly just annoyed by being tired, having pain and discomfort especially at night when I am trying to sleep.", "Just diagnosed yesterday :/ Some thoughts that got me through: - I am now a living \ud83d\ude15 emoji\n- If I do not recover by Halloween I will have the best Two-Face costume\n- 50% off Botox when I get old\n- really good at making the Dreamworks face\n- I have medical cause to wear an eyepatch AND a monocle Good job staying positive. It will help! You will get better.  Just takes time. Finding this sub helped a lot. I read a lot of stories and though it is still daunting, hearing from other people makes this a little less so. \ud83e\udd74 is my emoji! Also love the two-face reference.

Of the flip side, I personally know a guy who made a total recovery in less than 3 weeks.  Recovery is all over the board.  Rest as much as you can! Such a good one! I forgot about that! That was me in front of the mirror trying to get my face to work lol If you have not gotten tested for Lyme Disease yet do it I just found out a couple days ago that is what caused mine and the standard anti viral medication did not help it at all. The steroids will help in a short term way but will not fix the problem itself. \ud83d\ude17 my face when I try to drink a soda This was it for me, except that the meds did work and my face was back to mostly normal a month after it started. I still have some odd sensations, like the affected side of my face is more sensitive to pain than the other, but over all it is much better. Lyme's sucks tho. I have a follow up with with a physician on Monday, the soonest they said they could get me in. I will be sure to bring it up. \ud83e\udd28\ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\udd24 trying to have a conversation Dude, I love your sense of humor. Brought a smile to my face!\n\nKeep it up - you will get better!!

I still get problems with face twitches once in a while though.", "Dizziness/Vertigo Did anyone experience a lot of dizziness or vertigo with their Bell\u2019s palsy? Is there anything you did to help it? It looks like the vestibular nerves can sometimes be intertwined with the facial nerves which may be the cause of your vertigo/dizziness. ( \n\nI have had vertigo for about ten years (I developed it after a fall). The best thing is to rest and relax as much as possible. I found a( be helpful to limit head movement when I sleep. Ginger tablets, pickled ginger and ginger-ale were all helpful as was gravol when the nausea became too much. Watching a lot of tv or video games seems to aggravate symptoms. \n\nSince my vertigo is in part because of body structure I found osteopathy to be really helpful in the long run. \n\nTake everything as easy as possible- to have both at the same time must be very frustrating. Wishing you a speedy recovery!", "Today my eye on my good side was twitching what does this mean?  Nothing...  it is twitched before, it will twitch again. Same currently happening to me", "Help Ringing noise in ear I was wondering if any of you guys know any ways I can reduce the ringiness and ear pain when I am exposed to loud noises? usually ringing in the ear is called Tinnitus and I am not sure if there is anything you can do. I did not get mine from the Bell Palsy, but from medication i took. It is a high pitched low volume sound that mainly I dont notice unless I actually think about and focus on like right now. Ear pain may be from swelling as I noticed this when I had my symptoms. Maybe try putting ice on that ear, but not more the  20 minutes at a time. Have the doctors given you any medications? Prednisone is usually given for  swelling/inflammation. It is called hyperacusis and as other symptoms improve, it should too. I used cotton in the effected ear or a soft ear plug to reduce the ringing. I have a toddler so it is constantly loud around the house and this saved me from a lot of the pain the constant ringing can cause. I used earplugs too. I still have minor tinnitus but I do not notice it anymore. The sensitivity went away. My dog\u2019s bark used to echo in my head and now it is just loud and obnoxious (so normal for her lol) Ear plug is the best, mine took about a month and a half to go back to normal My tactic was just to try and avoid the types of noises that I was sensitive too. Had to be real careful with plates, pots and pans, and my wife did her best to be careful as well.\n\nBut if you are in a situation where those noises are impossible to keep few and far between, earplugs are probably a good bet. Otherwise, good active noise canceling headphones could help a bit. The good ones also have \"voice modes\" where they will try to allow voices to be audible for you while filtering out noise. Not sure how great it works though, just a thought.\n\nBest of luck with it though :) earplugs\n\nbut also just ignore it. the more you focus the worse it gets, but ignoring it takes a lot of practice. had tinnitus for 20 years, before BP", "Bell's Palsy Twice? I had Bell's Palsy at the beginning of 2011, so almost exactly 10 years ago. My first symptoms back then were a pain in the base of my right ear and a weird taste in the right side of my tongue, and it lasted for one month I think. Now, since yesterday, I am feeling the same pain in the same spot and this morning I noticed a weird taste on my tongue again, I am worried that it is happening again, is it common to happen twice? should I be worried?", "Repeated inflammation 2 weeks after BP episode I already wrote a post here about my sister who contracted BP more than two weeks ago. She got medical help with steroids and everything relatively late (on the 5th day) and from then on she started healing (albeit with a spasm on the unaffected side of the face). But for several days now (right after she stopped taking steroids) she started having severe headaches to the point where she just wanted to crack her skull open. Moreover she noticed that her skull on the paralysed side of the face got bigger as if its bones were swollen. Our guess is that she caught a cold (the weather rather cooled down lately) and the inflammation picked up again. Also she started doing face exercises for a couple of days before it all started, could it also be due to that? Pain is easing up in the meantime, tomorrow we will ask the doctor if she should start taking Acyclovir again (she took it for only 5 days before, in my opinion it should have been longer). However I am really worried about her, and since the doctors in our town are upon my observation not quite competent, I want to know myself which steps she should take next. It is not common that she felt her skull expanding on one side, is it now? And if it was indeed just resumed inflammation, could it in any way affect her recovery? Could it bring any further damage to the nerve? We, like everyone else, want to minimize the risks of complication, so we are wondering, is there any way of making sure that this minor episode does not bring disruption into the process of nerve regeneration? Thanks a lot in advance. I stopped taking my steroids  last Wednesday. I am on my second bp episode and found that the steroids made me feel somewhat normal and made me think I was improving. But as soon as I finished the paralysis got worse and I started to get nerve pain. Most people also have withdrawal post steroids. I felt sooooo exhausted after I finished them. \n\nIF THE AREA AROUND HER EAR IS VISIBLY SWELLING that is something to worry about. Look up mastoiditis. My doc told me to keep an eye out for that. Definitely see her primary care doc. My acupuncturist told me that after the initial numbness, pain and swelling is what I should expect in week 2. I definitely felt swollen, pain, headaches and even into weeks 3 and 4, I sometimes get headaches and pain behind my ear. Acupuncture helped a lot with the pain and lymphatic drainage. Massaging gently from the middle of the face to the ears, then downwards towards the neck helps. A hard bristle comb and just brushing my scalp helped too as will massaging the ear lobe. I started taking CBD oil to help with the ear and head pain. At the beginning of my BP diagnosis, I noticed my face would sometimes be very swollen when I would wake up in the morning. I never noticed any inflammation of my head, however; so I would definitely look into that. I hope she feels better soon! I was just diagnosed with BP and have seen several posts about pain management around the face, head and behind the ear. I can say that, for me, the behind the ear pain was excruciating for 2 days. Then I was prescribed Gabapentin, for neurological pain, and it was gone just like that. It has helped me 100% with pain management and even anxiety. The main side effect is grogginess and you may get sleepy which is fine by me. the area around her ear got indeed swollen but it is not anymore. We went to the doctor and he said everything was fine, however he did not look into the swelling around the ear. Should we still be worried since all's gone now?", "Diagnosed again on the other side, 5 months after initial diagnosis. Just the title. I was finally seeing progress on the right, just to have this nightmare start all over again on the left. I barely have words. I am so sad, and frustrated. This sucks. Fuck.", "Diagnosed Today I just got diagnosed today and have not stopped crying and shaking in fear. Had a routine covid test due to work policy then a day later my taste was off and then two days later I cannot lift my eyebrows or control my left eye. \n\nPlease tell me it gets better It definitely gets better! Talk to a doctor and find the best course of action He did not do much for me at all It definitely gets better, But it is going to get worse over the next few days and you are going to get pain. Did your doctor prescribe you medication? No they did not they told me to go to the ER but that is silly considering he diagnosed me Okay well on a positive note I have read that 85% of people recovery fully within a month with or without medication  See if you can get prescribed Prednisone. It is been just over a month for me now and I am about 95% recovered. I recommend B complex vitamin, Turmeric/Ginger supplements and a week after you are done the prednisone take CBD oil and use Cbd cream. You are also going to want some kind of eye patch or sleep mask, I used a gel sleep mask as it was heavy enough to keep my eye closed. See I have no issues sleeping, it is mainly facial functions and sinus pressure and pain. About day 4 or 5 my affected side went fully paralyzed and the pain got so bad that I could not sleep. Just try to be prepared This is day 5 for me as it started last wednesday as I thought it was a sinus infection Wait, am I understanding you correct...\n\nyour doctor told you to go to the ER... and you decided it was silly so you did not? Acuputure It is silly cause he already diagnosed the cause and gave me a course of action I did not ask why it was silly, I asked if your doctor told you to go to the ER and you decided not to I decided not. There. Happy? Why would I go to the er if I was diagnosed and given a course of action? Is not that the point of seeing the doctor? He said there was nothing out of the ordinary Look, I do not want to be mean or scare you, in all likelyhood you are going to be just fine, especially since it is been five days. But if a doctor tells you to go to the ER, *you get your ass to the ER.* \n\nYour face being paralyzed is a very serious symptom that could indicate other things than Bell's and any other possibility must be ruled out immediately. Your standard procedure when someone presents with symptoms of Bells usually includes a brain scan, checking your blood and sometimes even a spinal tap to rule out something more serious going on.\n\nOnce everything else has been excluded, that is when you get your prescriptions. ( 83% recover with prednisole, and only 63% recover completely without prednisole. The only reasons I can see for you not getting a prescription is that your doctor wanted you in the ER to rule out anything else, or he is just incompetent. Either way you need to talk to doctors ASAP. That really is the only sensible advice anyone can give you right now. Get tested for other causes of your symptoms, and get prednisole. I am trying to see another doctor who is willing to actually help and listen to my issues and prescribe the necessary meds. I know exactly what the root cause is. I know its not Lyme Disease or a tumor. Did your doctor prescribe you anti vitals and prednisolone? Hopefully they did, since it works best if given early.\n\nOther than that, my best advice is to take it easy and try not to stress too much about it. Once you feel ready for it, you can start doing face exercises where you try your hardest to make an expression with your entire face, and then use your fingers to help your BP side mirror your healthy side.\n\nIf you want, I can send a link with the brochure I got for my BP and the exercises in it. It is in Danish though, but there are lots of pictures of the exercises, and you should be able to copy paste the text into a translator. Please help me out On 40mg of prednisole \n\nI did these exercises 3 times a day (15 minutes per session), and then did random exercises throughout the day. Making sure to do the blinking exercise when watching TV and such.\n\nI recovered within a month. Everyone has a different story though. It does get better! I was diagnosed on the 20th and I am probably back at 80% and still feeling constant improvement. It is very scary at the beginning, I am a 30M and have not cried that much in a long time. But it will get better. Get some rest, sleep as much as you can, take your meds, and in due time you will start to recover. Pm me if you want to talk. YOU GOT THIS 2 years after diagnosis and I am at about 80% recovered. Dr. says that is about the best I can achieve, It seems that so little is understood about Bell\u2019s palsy. I developed Bells a few days after a pfizer vaccine shot. Docs put me on the steroids and anit virals. Symptoms kept getting worse for 10 days - pretty much paralyzed left side of my face. Left side of face pain and very tired . Eye lid was worst - i went to eye doc who told me it was very important to keep eye moist - gave me drops for during the day and had me tape eye closed at night - sounds worse then it is, Methods to tape eye is easy to find on utube. I was very worried about how long it would last, However good news after 10 days i started recovering and it has really picked up speed. I would say i am 85 to 90% recovered 20 days later. Everyone is different but what i learned is that it does recover in most people in 1 to 3 months. Hang in there it is extremely scary. Focus on care of your eye - if you get an ulcer on the cornea you will have lots of complications. \n\nAt same time bells started on left right side of mouth went numb - like leaving dentist after numbing shot.  ER docs never saw this happen at same time? This went away almost completely and got better quickly. All this related to the vaccine shot - well we will never know for sure but my Nuerolgist told me to hold off on second shot. If your insurance covers acupuncture or you can afford the treatments, get acupuncture and take herbal medicine. It maybe more budget friendly to just get herbal prescription alone.", "Headaches Hey all! I am just about 4 weeks in and I am starting to show progress! I was just wondering how long your guys headaches lasted. There not as bad as they were during the 1st week or so but there still really bugging me. Did anyone else have the same experience? Took maybe 2 months for me to feel like I did not have the occasional headaches or pain behind my ear. I am 6 months past now and feel the occasional headache or pain if I do not sleep well or feel stressed out. Getting a lymphatic massage helps, as does applying CBD cream or oil (for me). I have been considering some CBD cream, thanks for the advice. It is always nice to know other people have felt what your feeling lol. If you do not mind me asking, have you seen steady improvement through the 6 months? I am 4 weeks too, the headaches are much less frequent! what does the CBD do? Yes I have. I felt 99% healed at month 2 and slacked off on the exercises but was told by my acupuncturist to do them till month 3 was done. I have been fine mostly and none of my friends can tell I had Bell's. I do get the occasional pain behind my ear when under a lot of stress but it goes away once I take a step back and just rest more. I still take all my supplements just to be sure and recently restarted going to the acupuncturist once a week. CBD allegedly helps with inflammation. I think it is a roll of dice here depending on concentration and acknowledge it is not well accepted science on the benefits. \n\nPersonal anecdote that it helped for me in terms of pain relief. Just like acupuncture did. All that said and done, always see a doctor, get the steroids prescribed as that is key to recovery. 3 weeks here and headaches less frequent. But when get them use CBD oil cream. It helps the pain faster than prescribed medicine and ibuprofen. I read up on CBD creams and got recommended to one, before trying it. Good luck to you!", "Experiences on prednisone? Physical/mental I was given a 6-day course of 40mg prednisone for my palsy which they still are not entirely sure that is what it is. The doctors say it is consistent with BP but yeah they just call it \"facial nerve weakness\" in my medical chart and an MRI/bloodwork did not find anything abnormal. Anyway, I have been having extreme mental health side effects from the pred and minimal if any, improvement in my face since being on it. I am about 9 days in to BP and today is the 6th and last day of pred (unless they extend or do a taper). Also on Valtrex, and clindamycin from the tooth infection that caused this. Was wondering about others' experiences. Steroids are supposed to jumpstart improvement, but I think I waited too long. I am also having hyperacusis which has been incredibly difficult to deal with as well. My anxiety was already bad but has been intolerable on the steroids. I also have muscle weakness, shaking, and emotional numbness. Would appreciate any comments/thoughts/answers about your steroid experience (pls include dosage and duration as well as physical and mental effects), thank you.", "Post recovery complication I have had Bell's palsy on my left face in May and recovered in a month after many physiotherapy sessions including acupuncture.\n\nHowever I still have some issues:\n1. Twitching muscle: almost never happened lately but I was told it is not uncommon during recovery.\n2. (Still having) left eye shut harder when yawning\n3. Having troubles achieving symmetrical facial expressions, i.e. smiling\n\nHas any of you had the above issues? How long did it take to go away or do you still have them? Mine started in October of last year and I am still dealing with all these issues. That said, my recovery has been slower overall. Wow that is slow. My physiotherapist told me full recovery usually takes place in three months. I am quite worried that it is going to be permanent even though it will not have any significant impact to daily life. I had Bell's in may too. It is gradual but I felt twitching randomly a few days ago. Symmetry does improve and my friend who saw me in June when I was 70% healed said she can see improvement now when I met her in late July. So hang in there. \n\nNgl, I sometimes get aches behind my ear on the affected side and my jaw hurt the other day. Usually i take it as a sign to eat better/avoid foods that will give me inflammation and to take it easier at work.\n\nIt will improve but it may not be obvious to you. Just keep doing what you have been doing. I have heard of several different timeline from several different sources. I would suggest to try not worrying about what will be so much and focus on what is.

After doing some research I saw my GP today who confirmed that I have BP, however since I have already had my symptoms for so long he opted not to prescribe steroids. I have been referred to a neurologist but cannot get an appointment for several weeks given the COVID situation. \n\nWhat can I do to help get over these symptoms on my own? I have been doing some facial exercises and massaging which seems to be helping a bit. Anything else I can do? For some reason I have found very little info on treatments on this sub aside from the steroids immediately after diagnosis. Thank you! Unfortunately, the reason you are finding that is because that is the only prescription there is...\n\nThe only medically-proven treatment is a combination of antivirals and steroids as soon as possible. And the goal of that is to PREVENT/REDUCE damage, not repair it.\n\nOur 7th cranial nerves are dead/damaged.  I am not sure science has quite figured out a way to make them grow back. At least not for us.\n\nEdit: did not mean to come off so dark and gloomy. Lots of people, on this sub and elsewhere, report success with things like acupuncture and physical therapy and massage. B vitamins or CBD.  It is all anecdotal though. What this guy said. \n\nBP is considered a rare condition. It is not well studied, funded, or researched. I feel like the antivirals and steroids are just standard for anything that is unexplained. BP is unexplained. It sucks but that is the world we live in. At this point, do not be surprised if the neurologist says they cannot help you. \n\nAt the one year mark, I was told that if I lost weight, it would help. It did not. I am in the 5% that never recovers function. Most people do on their own! But I was also told that electric stimulation therapy would help. It didnt. It made it worse. And that is because there is no research or studies to prove if its beneficial or not. There is no research on BP and acupuncture or BP and Physical Therapy. Its all just.. trying. \n\nIt sucks.. but, welcome to the club! Yes.  There are some studies that give doctors some decent confidence in the virus/inflammatory response theory, but in general BP has not received much scientific attention, apparently.  It is a (relatively) minor affliction for most sufferers. \n\nI am sorry you have not recovered.  I plateaued at about 85% or so, and that took around 6 months. It is alright. Im at 4 years now and I dont remember what it was like to not have a broken face. I did not realize how bad that sounds until I added in the \u201ci dont remember\u201d part. Jeez. o_0 Thanks for the reply, although I will admit I am slightly perplexed. I have read that more than 85% of people regain full functioning, which runs a bit contrary to what you are saying. Surely not all 85% of those people received the steroid treatment. What I am saying is that, so far as I know, the only \"medically proven treatment\" are the antivirals and steroids.  Meaning, scientists have not done studies that produced results with any other medical treatment.  have you looked into any supplements? \n\nI would highly suggest Tumeric &amp; Lysine, also B complex ( b12 etc ) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nare you having issues with your eyes? dry eyes, them not closing properly? I have not. I will look into those.\n\nStrangely I have a difficult time keeping my eyes open rather than keeping them closed. It feels like the muscles that are supposed to pull / keep my eye open are not working properly.  It feels very droopy. \n\nAlso yes I have been dealing with terribly dry eyes", "If you fully recovered, open this x How long did it take for yous pouts to come back? I had it for 9~ weeks.  I went and had acupuncture done 3 times a week along with doing electrolysis on myself twice a day.  I used like that gliding massage ball on it from time to time, but acupuncture was the thing that made it most noticeable.  A day or so after the third session of the week I had new movement I had control over.  I am like 95% back to normal where only I can see what does not move and that has not changed for over a year. What is not back for you may I ask? I have everything back except my pout. Thank you for your comment! Right below my eye there is an unevenness when you stare real close to a mirror when I try to open both eyes as wide as possible. Thank you! Hi, an acupuncturist here. You should try to go back to have that addressed by the acupuncturist. Or something else I would recommend is to get mini moxa sticks (you can get it on amazon. Preferably Kanghwa brand) and stick it on your eye brows. Not directly on the brows but slightly above the hairline. One on either end of the brow and one at the center. Burn 3 sticks consecutively on each point. Repeat every other day to get the most benefit.", "One week update! Hey everyone! I wanted to share some news about my journey through this.\n\nI was diagnosed with Bells on July 23rd and started treatment start away!\n\nNow, after 10 days, I am proud to say that I have recovered about 80% of movement in my left face! \n\nThe only thing is that my frown is still pretty uneven and so is my laugh but I can now blink (but it pretty uneven and slow) which saves the dry eyes. /\u2572/( \u0361\u00b0 \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0 \u0361\u00b0)/\\\u2571\\\n\nI know I got really fortunate with a hecking quick recovery and I am praying for others who are not as fortunate, I wish the best! &lt;3\n\nThank you so much for helping me with my questions! Yall so nice &lt;&lt;3333", "I am a 2%er! Anyone else on here that fell into the 2% of those with Bell's Palsy that still has residual symptoms or side effects? I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy in 2011 and my smile is still crooked, my left eye is only about 70% better and the muscles in my forehead only work on one side. Ya I am with ya Same here. Its been since 2004 for me. Im still a little self conscious about it especially when i smile. Raises hand!  2014 with my second attack. My husband irks me as I hate taking pictures now because I cannot smile properly and he gets offended when I step out when friends try to take selfies Yep, i hate taking pics now too! 18 months and no improvement after 9 months. I still talk out of the side of my mouth, my left eye closes when I smile (no, I am not winking at you sailor) and I have a twitch in my left nostril that drives me insane. Ugh! Annoying for sure! My left eye semi closes when i smile too. Sailor lol! I did the \"argh matey\"  for a bit after diagnosed in 2011 lol Since 2000 for me! \n\nNobody really ever notices now, but I see it in every picture I take. It does become more pronounced when I have been drinking according to my wife. She just says \u201cone side of your face looks more relaxed than the other\u201d. I have the exact same problem! Hardly ever drink now as a consequence! I will have a beer or two out, but anything more than that is typically reserved for home, and with close friends only. I do not notice it most of the time. But I get super anxious when a camera comes out. I have ruined my fair share of photos with my attempts at smiling. I have to consciously think about opening both my eyes the same amount and making sure I do not smile too wide so I do not look like Two-Face from Batman! Same here. I always wear my hair so it falls over the left side of my face. I did that for a while especially when it was still really noticeable but not anymore. Ive sort of come to terms with it because I know it is not going to go away completely. Checking in! 3 years and counting! I have only had it now for 10 weeks but I am kind of terrified that I will end up with you all.  I have not seen any real improvement yet, so every day that passes without any change just makes me feel that much more hopeless.\n\nBetter than cancer, etc, etc, is what what I have been telling myself. Since 1997 here. My smile never returned but I did regain about half the function of my eye. Having it so long has changed the shape of my jaw (from tongue pressing to one side) leading to dental problems and TMJ dysfunction. \n\nCurrently having the largest flair up/episode I have had since then. Oh man that is rough, Im sorry! I guess my flairs up some when Im upset or really happy. Late to the party, but I have been rocking a crooked face since 1999! Got BP when I was 3, so I am pretty used to it by now. Had it when I was 18 months old for 8 months....I have many effects still showing....one eye drops down and one eyebrow stays up...as I age I notice the side of my face that was effected now has way more wrinkles then the other side. I have major eye twitching when tired.  Now I am in my 30s and am terrified to go get my wisdom teeth removed. As I have heard it can make it come back. I am in the same boat I am 17 and I cannot raise my eyebrows or full smile and I have had it for about a year and a half now", "Reoccurrence???? Hi! I had BP over 4 years ago and my eye has been twitching off the charts the past few days and I have been drooling at night (same symptoms that happened during my onset).\n\nHas anyone here experienced a BP reoccurrence?? \n\n\ud83e\udd74 I have not (yet), but getting it more than once, or having it \"come back,\" seems to be rather common, especially on this sub.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n:-( I have, many times over 20+ years. Treat it like the first occurrence. Go to your doctor ASAP and start your medications for best recovery. This will usually involve antivirals and prednisone. Good luck! \n\n(It is also wise for BP patients to get checked to rule out stroke) I had it June 2018 - August 2018. My eyes been twitching again for a month now and I started getting the headaches on that side too. I went to the doctor and he said it is probably a relapse but this time without the facial paralysis. He said I could do an MRI if I want but it will only show the facial nerve inflamed like the last time. I opted to hold off on the mri and I am starting to get better. He said steroids were not necessary, but it is worth going back to your doctor to get an opinion. I am just the Internet.", "Trying to gauge how much longer it will last. Hi Guys,\n\n* Age 25 and otherwise perfect health\n* 7 weeks in to Bell Palsy\n* Hearing and taste are back to normal\n* Still no change in mouth (no drooping but unable to smile) or eye (closes about 50&amp;#37;)\n* Still using drops constantly and taping eye shut at night\n* Neurologist said I do not need MRI\n\nFeels like I have plateaued and am wondering if there is any way to understand how long this might last? Otherwise, is there anyway to know if it will be permanent. It is getting to the sort of hopeless point where I do not expect any improvement and am trying to figure out if it is something I need to live with from now on. I have had BP for nearly 3 years. Probably 85% recovered. My muscle tone is 98% so if you walked by me on the street you could not tell but I still cannot smile or move my eyebrow and if you looked you could see for sure.\n\nI had very little recover until about 2 months in with the most significant coming around 4 months.\n\nI met a friend who had no recovery until 6 months and appears fully recovered. I have met another (through Facebook granted) who is nearly a decade in and just started whistling.\n\nThe bottom line is recovery usually begins to appear in the first 2 weeks and accelerates either immediately or a few months in but is not relegated to that.\n\nThat said a few pieces of advise for someone who is been there\n\n1) I am not sure if Accupuncture helped me or my recovery was coincident but I certainly did have some recovery after a few of my sessions (some showed no recovery).\n\n2) after my recovery completely stopped around 20 months in I began intermittent fasting. I was not thinking about my BP just trying to get back into shape. I later learned that it does increase neurological function. In any case I did begin (and continue) to have significant recovery even a few days in and still continue to.\n\nIt could be coincidence however I had seen no recovery at that point for roughly six months so I do believe it helped\n\n3) (and most important). DO NOT stand in the mirror and try to force movement! It causes synkenesiss which is awful. I learned that I was able to force movement but I was doing it the wrong way. When I finally was able to move those parts of my face I I had inadvertently trained many other muscles to act with them. Now when I chew my eye closes. When I smile my neck flexes pulling the smile down. I really urge this. Do not make my mistake.\n  Just hang in there.  I am eight months in and still recovering.  It seems like certain parts of my face recovered suddenly (e.g. mouth area) where other parts (e.g. have progressed very slow/steady). I have been using a stimulator after work with my physical therapist showed improvement - but it is hard to know if the recovery would have occurred naturally or if the stim accelerated it.  I would recommend work with a PT for sure.  Here is what I ended up buying (would not recommend use without working with a PT first):  (\n\nBottom line:  think marathon not sprint. 5 month in.  I had no significant improvement for the first 8 week.  Most improvement came at about 3 1/2 to 4 month.  Now people do not notice it. To others it looks cured.  But my eye still is not back to normal and my bottom lip is still not fixed all though I am starting to get feeling in it.\nIt is a slow process, you just have to go with it.  And do not forget your body us repairing itself so sometimes you might need to rest up a bit. \nI think it is going to take 3-6 months more to get back to normal but it is now just a minor irritation.  thanks everyone. Really uplifting to hear from you. Practical advice and will refer back when I start to feel down about it. Appreciate the level perspectives.  Hey all.  Im actually in the hospital right now.  Thought I had or was possibly having stroke.  Im 51, awesome shape, so cal living, surfing, all good stuff.  ER docs think I have got Bell's, about to have MRI (already had ct) to rule out bigger and badder stuff. As I wait, symptoms are getting more pronounced.  Info here is great.  Sucks to be in this position right now but from what I am reading here I will recover. So weird! ", "Top Cannabis Strains for Bell\u2019s Palsy ", "Severe neck pain ", "I got diagnosed on Friday. Today it is a totally paralysed right side. Please tell me it gets better!  Yes, it will gets better. Consult a doctor asap and get some prescription like vitamins &amp; steroids.  After doctor's consultation try working on exercise to heal faster. Do not worry we are with you and you will be all right. Hang in there - the first few days are the most difficult and things can only get better from here...Make sure you are taking the right medicines and have a lot of rest! I am like 2 weeks in, and almost completely recovered. Make sure you get prescribed the steroids and antivirals and TAKE THEM. They help alot It gets worse before it gets better, though if your totally paralyzed, assuming you do not start having pain, that is the worst of it typically I was healed in a month. Got streroids and anti viral at onset. Take b12! hi! it gets better, i promise. i am 6 weeks in and not FULLY healed, but everything is so much easier now, eating, drinking, talking feels normal and my family/friends tell me they almost do not notice any difference anymore. i am still going to physio and still seeing improvements. what i wish i would known though is that recovery can be slow - but steady! you got this! For me it slowly worse for 2 weeks. But at 4 weeks I started quickly healing. Within 4 days I hand 98% movement and taste back! \n\nIt will get better, but may still get worse. Rest. Take time to process what is going on. Be true to yourself. You have got this.  I am totally recovered after 2 months. I never had any pain.  The day I noticed drooping right side of face, I thought stroke or Bell\u2019s palsy.  I rushed my self to the ER and threw down my drivers license and insurance card and said \u201ceither I am having a  stroke or Bells Palsy\u201d\n\nYou would not believe how fast the ER team acts when that \u201cstroke\u201d word is spoken. I am no doctor, but I was treated like I had a stroke.  Thankfully it turned out to be Bells Palsy rather then a stroke. Got a MRI and lots of blood tests. Turns out it was Bells Palsy. \n\nI never had any pain what to ever. I was given oral steroids and Valtrex. After 6-8 weeks I was back to normal. No pain, just had to take it easy eating.", "2nd time Is it common to have BP twice? I had it about 20 years ago. Same side. Is it best to see a neurologist?", "How long before first signs of recovery? I know it varies for everyone but i am curious how long it took for others to notice the very first improvement in movement. Did things get better quickly after that? Did you experience any regression along the way? Did not see any signs of recovery until 3 month mark. Once it started, it was w slow\nprogression, started to see more snd more teeth when I smiled. Then I kind of leveled off after about a month I would say and have not seen much change since. I would say I am at 85%. I can pass a real smile, but my mouth still is not fully functioning. My eyebrow does not raise but it does move now. My eye shuts way more than it did before but does not all the way. I am hoping I will Continue to see slow progress. I am mostly happy I can smile again even if it is not totally back to normal. \n\n I think the thing that worked for me is massaging the sensitive areas. I had a mild Case and saw improvements within the first week (I was able to close my eye, eat for the most part) but then between weeks 2-3 I did not and after I made a fast recovery. MY BP lasted about a month. A good acupuncturist helped a lot and I recommend it. 2-3 weeks in I felt a little more movement in my affected lip, mouth felt a lot better, able to chew food on that side without feeling like I was drowning Basically 5+ months on all of my cases. Then it happened basically within a month, or less. Not really any regression. Besides of course, getting it 3 different times. I think it was on day 15 for me. I noticed that I could now lift my eyebrow on the affected side 1mm or so. Very subtle. After that, I saw pretty steady progress every day, and was 99% recovered by day 30. I am on day 15 today, so hopefully soon I notice something I am on day 15 so I am hoping I notice something soon I need to look into acupuncture I think. I see a lot of people recommend it but I do not know much about it It will likely be very minor things, so do not be discouraged. I am almost 5 weeks in and still mostly paralyzed on the affected side. It does get better though, it just takes soooo long. (I have had it before, so it gives me some context. I know how horrendous the wait can be.) It is different for everyone, so do not feel too discouraged if it takes a little longer for you to see signs of improvement :)\n\nI wish you all the best on your recovery. The earlier you do acupuncture the better I recovered in a month. Tbh when I was recovering I took steroids, so many vitamins (because of them I recovered so quickly). But the \u201crecovery symptoms\u201d that i had was after 2/3 weeks of BP, my face started twitching, it hurt ALOT, like i had to take pain killers. I had physical therapy. But even 2 weeks free from BP my face sometimes hurts (the cheek area that is near the ear) or it just randomly twitches. So my recommendation is to take vitamin B and it will boost your recovery! Wow, did you recover fully each time?", "How to deal with the pain Does anyone have any suggestions or remedies to deal with the excruciating pain. Extra strength Tylenol does nothing, a warm compress does not relive it either. My doctor prescribed me muscle relaxer which I will be picking up today. The pain is the strongest at night when I am trying to sleep. I am open to any and all suggestions. Thanks! only thing that worked for me was gabapentin I was prescribed anti depressents for the pain. They did not work very well. I also have a history of mental illness which the anti depressants amplified to its worst in ten years. Just some food for thought", "Early BP Hey guys, I have been diagnosed with BP today and while I am not trying to stress too hard I was curious if it gets worse before it gets better. \n\nI had a severe ear infection beforehand but the specialist thinks they are separate. I had it for 2-3 days before getting steroids. At this stage I have an eye that does not close completely and a lopsided smile and I do not believe it is too severe at the moment. \n\nI was wondering if a. I was early to getting it diagnosed and b. does everyone is get worse before it gets better? Mine got worse over the first few days. I am on day 15 of BP and I am just starting to see a little bit of improvement. \n\nI have read catching it with the first 3 days is best for an optimal recovery. And of course the sooner the better. Mine got worse the second day. After that, 12 weeks nothing, now I am recovering slowly. Expect to wake up and have it worse... Good luck! Thank you! Glad to hear you are recovering. Are you on steroids or anything? Glad to hear you are improving. Were you prescribed any medication or are you partaking in acupuncture? i have used prednisolon but it didnt help. just wait. i stressed out the weeks without recovering, but now im here. im already really happy with how far i got... just stay calm. even when it wouldnt recover, im sure your friends will still like you. but hopefully you will fully recover. Good luck! Mine got worse over the first two days, then nothing for about two weeks or so. After that I started seeing improvements and was back to 99% mobility within a month (although my BP side still felt fatigued. That is better now).\n\nBest wishes on your recovery. Thank you. Glad to hear your recovery was so good! Were you on steroids immediately? Mine took about 5 days of getting worse before it was at its peak. I noticed so early that the doctors did not even think anything was wrong with me Glad to hear you recognised it early. Do you think this helped with recovery? Not a bit. I was turned away when I first went to the ER after an MRI and confirming it was not a stroke, went back the next day, confirmed BP. By this point I would had it about 72 hours, so anti virals were not prescribed. \nI was however prescribed steroids, but did not take them for another 2 days. In the end, I saw improvement when I started taking vitamin B12 I have heard a few people mention B12. Did the steroids help? Unfortunately not. They just made me hungry angry and clean the house all the time lol I appreciate the insight. I will definitely look into B12. Did you take tablets or just eat food with B12? I think I started steroid + anti viral treatment about 24-30 hours after symptom onset. So many pills. But oh well, they seemed to help :) Yes I was prescribed just prednisone (a steroid for inflammation) at first. And then I went to a 2nd doctor and he lengthened my prednisone and I also convinced him to give me an antiviral which I do not remember the name of. \n\nI go in for accupuncture tomorrow for the first time. I will be sure to share what I think about it once I have gone in. Hi mate! Fellow BP person here. I was diagnosed on 31/01/21. It got worse over the next 48 hours. I am generally a very healthy person. Never ill etc. Last night I noticed my first sign of improvement and being able to keep air in my cheeks. All I can say is try not to stress, take as much time off as you can for recovery.\n\nHope you recover soon! Keep us posted \ud83d\ude42 I thought this was just me! How odd! Mine got worse for the first 3 days then I started recovering within 3 weeks. I am on month 2 and 95% recovered. I only took steroids and let nature do it is thing instead of forcing my face to move about. \n\nWhen I started getting my movement back slowly, I started massaging to help speed up the process with olive oil. \n\nPlease be patient with yourself. I heard acupuncture helps but I just wanted to keep it simple and let it do it is thing and within 3 weeks I healed so much. After about a month, my face was normal but it is little things like my nose I am waiting for that will come back with time. \n\nI wish you a speedy recovery! Gws\u2764 Tablets What daily/weekly dose of vitamin B12 did you take? Thanks! 1000mcg once a day in the morning. It boosts energy, so I would not recommend it in the evening. Thank you! Hey, how are you now? I am on my week 8 and only my eye has improvement.. The mouth is still fully paralyzed, everything is going so slow.. You give me courage, that after 12 weeks you start to recover. :)", "Question About Relapsing? I got diagnosed with BP on the 8th this month, but I have mostly recovered. Unfortunately, I am showing some beginning signs of a cold and cannot take the only medicine I have because I am still on gabapentin and the two will interact, so I was wondering - has anyone ever relapsed from getting sick soon after recovering from BP?", "Is this Bell's Palsy? \n\nIn the past 12 months I have noticed my face is sagging on the left hand side.  My lips are drooping (I feel noticeably), there is a little bit of a change in the shape of my eye (not pictured as not as noticeable) and what I would consider drooping on my jawline as well.\n\nI have asked my family and a number of friends and they assure me my face is symmetrical however I am worried they are just being nice.  I realise it is minimal but wondering if this is something I should get checked out?  If so, likely the doctors in my area will blow me off / tell me not to worry about it so wondering what I should ask for (ie specialist, next steps, etc?).\n\nI can still smile however (I feel) it is still noticeable when I am smiling.\n\nNote:  I know my nose is crooked - and I am completely cool with that :)\n\nTL;DR:  Is my face crooked?", "I am so self-conscious I wear an eye patch frequently so I do not scratch my cornea.  Today I was at the store and 2 kids pointed at me asking their parents what is wrong with me.  A week ago a kid pointed and laughed at me.  I know it is kids being kids most of the time so I ignore it.\n\nWhat hurts the most are the adults staring at me with weird pity or this patronizing look.  People talk to me differently now.  I thought I could handle the self-consciousness but this has triggered the PTSD I have from past bullying.\n\nThis is more of a vent because I am nearly 2 weeks into having this.  How does everyone else here handle it? The truth is, it is easier said than done. That said, the answer is to own that shit. Think of all the badass characters who have had an eye patch. Characters like Snake Plissken, Rooster Cogburn, Nick Fury, Elle Driver, and countless pirates of lore. None of them would give to farts what anyone thought about their eye patch. And neither should you. Your eye patch is distinctive. Hold your head high; when you see someone looking at it, think to yourself, \"You only wish you could pull this off as well as I do.\" Thank you for this.  I try to think of characters like this who look cool with the eye patch.  It feels like this is how villains are made.\n\nA lot of the confidence issues are things I am already trying to fix with professional help and with this happening to me it is like the icing on the cake. I understand. Truly. \n\nDealing with an eye patch was a turning point in my life where I really learned not to worry as much about other people's expectations for me. I dealt with bullying a lot when I was younger, too. I am glad you are getting professional help; it is not easy to do but it shows that you are on the right path. \n\nI am proof that it is possible to get to a place where you will be far more comfortable in your own shoes, where you will not be so worried about what strangers think about you. I used to be very self-conscious. These days I dress like a pirate and go out on the town just for fun. Some people stare, some people laugh, some people tell me I look awesome, a lot of people want their picture with me and a lot of people come on to me (male and female both, seriously it is weird but I guess the pirate look has appeal that crosses gender lines). \n\nI do not worry about the haters, I figure they are just jealous that they do not have the confidence to follow their bliss and have as much fun as I am having because they are too worried about what other people might think of them. But if I did not have to wear an eye patch for a few months all those years ago, I probably never would have developed the confidence to pull it off. Thank you for your story, this really helps a lot.  Hopefully I can reach that level of confidence you are at now.  I did get a pirate outfit as a gag gift too.\n\nHow long did your BP last?  Mine started a week and a half ago.  I sometimes feel twitches on my cheek just under my eye, I can slightly close my eye a little more, and this morning I can feel slight movement on the side of my mouth.  It is weird, when I dream, I still have full use of my entire face. Mine lasted about 3 months until I was about 85% recovered, then slow recovery over the next few years to near 100%. I would say 100% but I still occasionally get twitches/spasms around my eye, and pain near my ear some 20 years later. I gotcha.  I will need to be patient.  I feel hopeful because a tiny corner of my mouth can move.  Thanks again for all the advice, I truly appreciate it. They are strangers you will never see them again in your life ignore them. Invest in a fake parrot and have fun with it. I already have the pirate costume, I suppose the parrot is the next logical step. I always felt like a bad ass wearing the eye patch, honestly. It was when I tried to smile and could only move half my mouth that I felt like an idiot. Funny that a couple weeks after this post I am starting to recover a bit.  If I smile it is still obvious and I have to consciously blink now which is weird.  It is like 50-60% returned in the past week and a half then stopped a bit.\n\nI am still wearing an eyepatch until I do not have to think blink anymore but thanks to this sub I can own what happened to me and how I look.", "joined the BP club this past weekend... Started with what I thought was an ear-ache, then a numb tongue a day and a half later (thought maybe I burned it?), then it was clear I needed to a see a doctor when I smiled in the mirror. Probably saw the doctor on the 4th day. The have me on AZITHROMYCIN, PREDNISONE, and VALACYCLOVIR (I do not have herpes, but the Dr. thought it prudent). He said it was good that I came in so early and that it was a very light case, so I am hopeful.\n\nAside from the subtle but slightly annoying pain in my jaw, the worst aspect by far is the constantly running tears from the affected eye. I took off my contacts and have been wearing glasses so I can constantly dab the corner of my eye every couple minutes. I have had to re-learn how to drink (straws help) and chew (mostly on the ok side of my mouth) too.\n\nCurious if anyone has had any success with acupuncture? I am generally not a big proponent on the practice, but for some reason I feel like it might have some effect in this case? Maybe it is just wishful thinking for a miracle cure now that I am afflicted.\n\nAnyway...hope you are all hanging in there.", "For people who had Bell\u2019s palsy So I had Bell\u2019s palsy a couple years ago, but one thing I just want to know is that did everyone have constant migraines and once they had it they hardly have migraines. \nAlso did anybody have like a weird ear sound or a popping noise in their ear like a day before it happened?\n\nI never really thought about this when I had it but now I am curious I only had one migraine associated with BP. But my ear on the damaged side does have some weird issues every now and again. I had both things you are describing. I got migraines horribly as a child. (2-4 days a week). As I got older, they slowed down (1 a week most weeks, but less severe). The day before my BP started, I had one or the worst migraines of my adult life. Throwing up, vertigo, aura, etc. Took a half day off work to sleep it off.\nThat night, was turning my head and my neck, right by my ear, popped in a way that it never had before, and has not since. My symptoms started the following day.\nI have had a few migraines since then, but only 1 each year, on average. I had some pretty severe migraines as a teen, but they stopped around when I turned 20. I am 26 now, and am in week 3 of recovery from BP. Oddly, I have not had any migraines in quite some time, but now I wonder if there was  correlation between my migraines when I was younger and developing BP now. I have it about a week now and have pretty severe migraines for a while, not too often luckily but a week before I got it I had the most intense one I ever had which caused me to lose sight for about 2-3 minutes then blurred for about an hour\n\nI usually get ocular migraines so vision goes blurry before but this was so sudden it seemed more like I was fainting than having a migraine \n\nHopefully after this I am like yourself and do not have them again or to less of an extent, on the upside I do not need a mask for Halloween, can answer the door to trick or treaters (if there are any with covid) and just say I am rocky Balboa or two face from batman I definitely had some weird sounds in my ear the day before it happened. I had been dealing with an ear infection for a week or so before the BP, and the day before BP I was out eating dinner with my wife. Throughout the dinner I would toss and turn my head to see what was making a weird sound, but it turned out it was only me hearing it. I do not recall having any ear issues, it is been almost 3 years since my episode. I did have frequent headaches and migraines from childhood up to my early 30's, and I rarely get them at all anymore, but that changed a couple years before my BP. In hindsight my first symptom was my upper lip twitching strangely the day before onset. sorry to hear that.\n\ni have not had any migraines after two episodes of BP - however I did develop some minor neurological issues (tinnitus, facial muscle twitching, etc.) over the years. As it was just in March I remember it very well, 4-5 days leading up to the facial paralysis I would had constant headaches. I would assumed due to covid and work relocating to our homes that I was just overworking.. Appears I was incorrect, haha. After that though no headaches or migraines. Honestly it is not bad as you think, but my migraines decreased by a lot I always think that to, the doctor goes it was due to chicken pox virus still left in my body which I do not think it is true I thought the chicken pox virus always stays in your body. Using shingles just a activation of that Virus? I did not have migraines, but I had TERRIBLE ear pain that shot down to my jaw. It was absolutely horrible leading up to the morning I actually got the paralysis. I went to the doctor the day before it happened because the pain was so bad it was interfering with work, but of course they did not know what it was. Ruled out infection and said maybe it was sinus pressure; take some allergy meds and pain pills and let it work itself out. Woke up the next morning and thought I had a stroke. I still have ear pain pretty regularly but it does not last long, as well as nerve damage on my affected side so I cannot apply too much pressure without it feeling tender. That maybe the case, but honestly they do not know the real cause of Bell\u2019s palsy so it is all a mystery I have had it twice, the first time I made a 100% recovery after a few days, second time was definitely what most experience... like symptoms leading up to paralysis which took a couple months to recover from.\n\nThe day of onset, and for a day or two after, my left ear was VERY sensitive to noise. I remember my neighbor talking to me outside and it sounded like he was yelling in my ear at a normal volume. \n\nDecided the day after I got treated for it to go out (St. Patty's day, had a friend in town so I thought \"why not\") and had to go home after 20 minutes because it was just brutal.\n\nNothing now, but face has made about a 85-90% recovery. No real long-term side effects aside from crocodile tears (if I eat something really savory, my left eye will start tearing up. The biggest cause of this is a chipotle burrito). I get crocodile tears I think it is gotten better for me, last time I had bells palsy was almost 3 years ago.\n\nI remember my nose would run too, and I would actively cry. Now, it is pretty much subsided. No one ever asked me why I was crying, but I always made jokes about I would cry if your cooking is good. Same here! Did you have enlarged lymph nodes along your neck as well? I believe I did, this was Easter of last year and I blocked a lot of it out lol but it was pretty traumatizing!", "Bell\u2019s Palsy from trauma So I was in a motorcycle accident on Sept 13 of this year. I woke up in the hospital with a bunch of injuries including several skull/face fractures. \n\n\nOne or more of these fractures caused me to have facial paralysis on one side of my face. When I first woke up I could not move anything on the right side of my face. By the end of my hospital stay (3 weeks) I was able to move my cheek muscle enough that movement was visible, nothing more. \n\nSince then I have regained a lot of movement but my smile is still asymmetrical and my eyebrow only moves a little bit. It also seems like theres a lot of small muscles around the mouth that are recovering much more slowly than everything else. These muscles are involved in stuff like trying to pucker or flaring the outsides of my lips up.\n\nI am wondering if there is anyone else here that has paralysis from a traumatic injury and how their recovery has gone. Have you recovered fully? Are there things I should be doing to help my nerve recover? I did not suffer mine from a head injury but the doctor explained that it was a possibility when he diagnosed me. I apologize I cannot be more of help in that department. However, I got BP in April of this year and by September, 95% of my face had gone back to normal. The things that helped me were obviously the medication I was given, Vitamin B12 shots, acupuncture, and massaging my face every night but you can search up different methods online and try them to see what works for you. I wish you a speedy recovery and hopefully you get through this quickly! :)  Did you go to a specialized acupuncture clinic or will any do? Also is this the same as electric stimulation therapy cause some were saying that does more harm than good. My 1st attack of Bells I recovered 95%.  The 2nd one 17 years later I only recovered 65%. My eyes are off and I still can only half smile 3 years later. I tried the shock therapy the second time and I think it is what ruined my face.", "Bell's Palsy 3 years ago. Fixing some left over eyelid drooping/incongruities with an eye patch over un-affected side/eye. Anyone have success with this? Bell's Palsy 3 years ago. Fixing some left over eyelid drooping/incongruities with an eye patch over un-affected side/eye. Anyone have success with this?\n\nMy left side is droopy and the eyelid closes more easily. I am trying to retrain the muscles around my eye to open up more, by forcing the left eye to do all the work with the patch on.\n\nI do not recommend this for someone who has just been diagnosed!!!!\n\nHas anyone had success doing this? Or has this ever been recommended to you? I have had bells palsy for over 2 years now, I have not tried this. I keep doing the close your eyes real tight for 10 seconds and open wide for 10 seconds.. the lower part of my eyelid or the muscle below thay in my face does not want to work so I only look half surprised at things I think I have this too.  My upper eyelid seems to droop though, and does not widen the same amount at the same time as my other eye, unless I really try hard. So it works, just not at the same time or with the same effort. I read somewhere that patching one eye automatically forces the muscles in the other eye to do work to open, since it is the only one doing the work now. When I was doing facial retraining with Jackie Diels. She had me focus on entirely relaxing my face and opening and closing my eyes together. But being mindful of all of the muscles in the affected side of my face. As soon as one of those muscles started working out of order I would stop and go back to complete relaxation and start over. Jackie said that we can train our brain to mirror the unaffected side of our face but it takes patience and practice.  I mean at this point, it is worth a shot", "Best smile.  Today is my fifth day with Bell\u2019s Palsy.  I know this could be much worse, could have been a stroke.  So I will consider myself lucky.   I am married my kids are almost grown.  \n   I am trying not to focus on this too much, it starts to make me sad. Just posting to let others know they are not the only ones that this is happening too. If any one want to talk please message me.  \n I am still going through it.. read my back posts. If you have any questions PM me. I know brother, this sucks. But it is not the end of the world and there is people out there that have had it way worse than us. Just keep your head up and relax as much as you can. Let that nerve relax and do its thing for a few weeks before you try working it out even though you want to! I think it is does more damage than good at first. It will test your character though, you have to be strong. It broke me and now I feel like a much stronger person. But trust me, I cried for a long time. GL I had it last summer. I always get summer sickness and bells palsy was the one last year. I went to a doctor right away and the pharmacist told me to start taking the med right away. And I also took lysine, which is a supplement. Look into it on google if you are wondering but that is what I did and it said it will help heal faster. I was so worried that I might not get full recovery, but slowly it started recovering and it was completely gone fortunately. You need to act fast. Do not lose hope and try to relax as much as possible.  Thanks for your advice. I was looking for physical therapy exercises but I will wait and relax for now. The doctors put me on a steroid and an antiviral. Eight pills a day. Hopefully it helps. I got it a year ago when 5 months pregnant - 21st Sept, and I remember it took 3 weeks before anything moved, and seeing my eyebrow twitch after those three long weeks of nothing was the most amazing feeling. Cos you do not know. Everyone says that it will come back but until I got to see the movement yourself I did not believe it. A year on my face is almost back to the way it was, slight weakness in my eye but only noticeable to me and close family, mainly when I am tired. I know its scary and worrying, but try to keep positive, take the antivirals/steroids, use a straw to drink, take your time and rest/relax and if you are getting physio, do the exercises! I think \"Bells Palsy\" is the worst name for it, so hard to say when you actually have it!! This was my smiley face at the time :-/ haha! Had to try to make light of it, otherwise  it is easy to get down about it. Hey man just checking up on how you are doing, hope you are seeing a little improvement!  My wife is in the first 24 hours, she just started noticing that her eye wont shut properly,  last night her smile was crooked, i didnt think anything of it bc the rest of her face was normal, but her eye is coming into play and shes having a hard time eating, I am not in America right now, so I am hoping these 3rd worlders have what she will need.. Hope everything goes well with you, and I have an idea of what is to come because of you. So thanks :)", "Bell's palsy - Day 3  Interesting to watch dear! I am in month 3 going on month 4 and it is getting better. I just wanted to commend you on the things you said and the fact that you decided to do a video because when I was at day 3, I was a total mess! I could not do it with all the discomfort and insecurities. Now that I am back at work ( I am a teacher and my onset was during the summer) I talk so much to my young minds and they have really been supportive. I had not shown any weakness to them, but the funniest thing I have noticed is during spelling test it is difficult to pronounce words and my higher students will repeat the words for me. Initially I was fearful of the talking during a test, but they are just trying to help because they see that I can not speak as well. Overall I am happy with progress and look forward to a full recovery. Praying for us both! Best wishes!!!", "My dad might have bell's palsy? My dad has been acting very strange the past few days. He is been quiet, sitting around and doing nothing but staring at a wall for hours, and very confused. This is totally out of character for him. He also is doing lots of small things that he would not normally do or not doing things he would usually do. He just seems like a different person entirely sometimes. When confronted about it, he claims there is nothing wrong and he feels absolutely normal. His face is also drooping, especially at night. After fighting him a lot my mom and I tricked him into going to the doctor this morning. He said that it is probably bells palsy but he is not sure until he can get a cat scan. The Doctor said that bells palsy does affect his memory and cause confusion, but I cannot find anything confirming that online. It is really hard to see him like this and I am not sure what to do. If anyone here can tell me more or maybe if it is something else? He claims there is nothing wrong, like I said. But he also seems to be severely in denial and also has said that he has not looked in a mirror which I feel is strange? I personally would look right away but idk. Any information would be super helpful. Also to all the people here who do have it, I hope you all are okay and have a speedy recovery \ud83d\udc9c Well typically bells palsy doesnt impact memory/cause confusion.  However, he may be scared and in denial and worried he is having a brain aneurysm or stroke. When is his scan? I would go ASAP, to rule out any other neurological issues. Having BP can be a little disorienting and I definitely felt \"out of sorts\" for a few days, but I would never have described myself as being \"confused\" and I did not find myself staring at walls for hours.\n\nI would be much more concerned about stroke or some other brain issue.  I would do what I could to get him some brain imaging ASAP. I think the scan is sometime this coming week. I am not sure what day. Do you think we should take him to an ER? It comes in waves so it is kind of weird. Like this morning he seemed mostly like his usual self but still off. It is difficult because I do not know if he has any symptoms, so I cannot try to figure out what it could be. As I said, he claims he is fine but I not in his head or body so I do not know and he could be denying it or he is confused so he does not know what is wrong if that makes sense. I am just really concerned and do not know how to go about this The window to treat a stroke is small (24 hours if I remember correctly) and same with BP has diminishing results the longer you wait. A scan is needed to rule out other neurological emergencies ASAP. Treatment for BP needs to also be started right away. \n\nMy doctors advised me to always go to the ER for Bell\u2019s Palsy episodes (I have them repeatedly) even though we are confident in what they are, we have to rule out strokes etc. \n\nIf you want, tell him about how I did not get treatment for one of my episodes when I was 14 and now I have a permanent deformed face (for 23 years now). This has even led to dental problems. The sub is full of people saying start treatment early, and follow the treatment plan. Usually prednisone (steroid) and antivirals. He just went to the doctor today and according to him he has not looked in the mirror at all recently, so he would not know that he had BP until this morning. And he was acting weird before we said anything so I feel like it cannot be that. This has been going on for like 3 days-ish. I feel like if it was a stroke it would have happened by now? I do not know though because I know very little about strokes except for what I researched when this first started happening. His speech is not slurred at all and he does not seem to have any body weakness really so I am not sure The doctor prescribed him the steroids. We are going to pick them up in a little bit so he will be getting treatment. He is been like this for at least three days so I do not think it is a stroke but I am not a doctor so I do not know. But he does not seem to have the other symptoms like slurred speech and arm/body weakness How long has this been going on, and has he had episodes before? It is worth exploring mental health options as well. I am sorry you are going through this. You are a good person to look after him so He went on a trip out of state for two days (he had to take his father to do an eye surgery and he could not drive until the next day) and when he came back he was like this. My mom said he was fine when he called her during his trip and on his way home, but as I said in one of the other comments, it comes in waves so he could have just had okay moments at those times. I think it is been about four days that he is been home now but I am not sure because my timeline is all screwed up from this and corona and summer and everything. I am not sure if he is had episodes before. Definitely nothing this extreme or long. If he has, it was more minor and it went unnoticed because we were not looking for it. I am really not sure. He is going for the cat scan sometime in the next week and we will have to go from there. Thank you so much for your support and silver! This is random, but has your father had substance abuse issues? It could be he grabbed some of your grandpa\u2019s pain meds from surgery- and that is why he is been out of sorts lately and denied anything is wrong. It is purely projection on my part as I had opiate dependency. Just another option to keep in mind. Everything you describe is not what I have come to know about Bell\u2019s palsy I totally understand why you think that but I definitely do not think he would do that. As far as I am aware he has never had an issue with drugs. His mother is addicted to opioids and I think that has helped keep him away from any of those issues because she is a jerk lol. But I know the confusion stuff is not BP and that is why I am super confused. This whole situation is very frustrating I can imagine! It has to be extremely frustrating trying to figure out what is going on with him. I am glad it is not the opiate thing. My heart kind of sank when I thought of that. \n\nDid you or your mom go to the doc with him? I am surprised the doc said confusion and whatnot were a part of it. That would lean more heavily on a stroke I would assume? I do not really know. For the time being, I would make sure a person was with him during appointments. And in the room. It is all so strange!! Keep us updated and best of luck to you all. I will send positive thoughts your way! Thank you so much! And yes, my mom went into the room with him because he is denying everything to the doctors as well as everyone else. Even when she was in there with him and stuff he was telling the doctor he was fine. Also I just remembered they took a blood sample to check for Lyme since facial palsy is a potential symptom for that. On the off chance it is drugs, I think they would find it. I will totally keep you updated though if anything new come up! Awesome, thanks! Yea Bell\u2019s palsy does not cause any metal symptoms... it is just physical facial paralysis. Sounds like he had a mini stroke", "10 years post bells palsy Even now I have residual changes on my side. The worse thing is, my smile is uneven and it looks so weird.\n\nAre there any treatment options for me? Electric stimuli? \n\nFor context, I live in east coast, USA. Thank you. I have had BP since 2000\n\nIt will only get so much better and then that is it. Once the nerve dies it cannot be brought back. Make your peace with it. My face returned to 85% normal. It was crushing to my self esteem but for whatever reason I was still able to date hot chicks and have normal life. Play the hand you were dealt. Same here. I have 85-90% control back. Just my smile is crooked and my eyelid acts weird sometimes. Ditto. My right eye is almost always a little squinty and my smile is crooked too, especially when I laugh. It is what it is Same here..I basically tell everyone I cant smile. There are rare moments when my smile lines up involuntarily. Hi! \n\nI am one of those rare cases that has had BP since birth. I thought I had no form of treatment available to me since my muscles had atrophied. It was not until, at the age of 25, my dentist of all people recommended I look into some plastic surgeons who had made headway in the field of \u201cfacial reanimation\u201d. I am lucky that I live right outside nyc, because I found an incredible surgeon who performed a surgery that allows me to show all of my top front teeth, snarl, and pucker more \u201cnormally\u201d. And your surgeon will work with your insurance to cover most of the surgical costs. \n\nHowever, a HUGE aspect to my success was working with a physical therapist who specializes in bells. These are harder to find, but a good PT can make all the difference. Luckily for me, I found one whose had a recurring case of bp! Anyway, I have been seeing her twice a week for the last 6 months and I do not think I could have made the progress I did without her expertise. \n\nSo, yeah, e-stim contributes to success in some cases, but I would couple that with finding a PT who understands BP, if surgery is not an option. \n\nGood luck! Same! I hate seeing myself in photos or videos because of how my smile looks, my eye also does the weird thing. It sucks we have not got full control over our face back :( Sometimes insurance will cover Botox for your affected side which can help with dropping of the eye and mouth Could you DM your PTs name? Since 2005 for me. Have since recovered to about 85% like you. I still have a wonky smile and often cry when eating. I hate having photos taken and my work ID badge reminds me of this most days :( Nothing I can do about it now so I try to just get on with it I am also one of those rare cases, I have had Bell\u2019s palsy since birth. I am jealous of those who can smile and laugh in public. explore your options! if you are open to surgery, most insurances will cover all of it, if not a good chunk of it since it is technically reconstructive surgery!", "15 months after Bell's palsy ", "Can Bell's Palsy happen gradually? I noticed the right side of my face is a little hard to control, and there is a little drooling happens when I am sleeping.\n\nI just noticed my face today and have an appointment to the doctor on Friday. Is it okay to wait that long? I have never heard of it happening slow like that.  For me I noticed i was unable to hold water in my mouth the night before but thought i was just tired... woke up and it was unable to control anything on that side of the face.  The next day was worse... then after a week or so it slowly started to get better. Hey for me it was a headache that lastest over a week and then the night before one eye was really lazy For me it happened throughout the day. My neck hurt and then I was spitting out water because my lips could not seal. It gradually took place for me until I had full paralysis Usually bp happens very quickly for me it 24hours  If you cannot move your forehead in the affected area it most likely BP if u can you want to go asap to see a doctor might be a stroke. However I do the believe it gets gradual. Most cases its at it is worst in the first 24 hours and then gradually goes away. Either way go see a doctor asap. ", "Horrible hearing sensitivity Diagnosed two days ago post tooth abscess/root canal, though the doctor was not \"100% sure\" I have BP but nothing on my MRI or bloodwork to suggest anything else. It is a very long story but so far it is been a \"mild\" case on the right side of my face. Currently on antibiotics, steroids, and Valtrex. My question for you all is, my hearing is SO sensitive now. It started the several days ago and it is distressing and seems to be getting worse. It is mostly in the right ear. Mostly certain sounds, particularly sharp sounds like glass or dishes clinking, a door shutting, keyboard typing, etc. Even people talking or throat clearing sounds that other people make sometimes. And scariest of all is, sometimes even if I make a \"mhm\" noise or something like that, it feels uncomfortable inside my head, like overly vibrational. All of these noises feel like they are bashing me on the head and it can cause a strong adrenaline/anxious reaction (I am also struggling with severe anxiety). I have not seen much on this thread about hearing sensitivity with Bells. I read that it can happen. It is not painful exactly but it is very uncomfortable and distressing. This whole experience has been hell...but first I just wanted to ask if anyone had insight/advice on dealing with this. Thank you.", "My early morning attempt at taping a patch over my eye post-diagnosis  I think I am just going to tape my eyelid closed until I get an eyepatch. Any tips on taping gauze patches down? Any suggestions for a more permanent eyepatch or sleeping mask? I tried to do what you did and it did not work. I just tape my eyelid directly now. I have tried eye patches but they do not actually keep my eyelid closed. So sorry you are going through this!\n\nTo get my eye to stay shut, I would gently close my eyelid with my fingers, put a large chunk of gauze over my eye, and then put an eye patch on. Having the gauze there made enough pressure to keep the lid shut and not be uncomfortable, so I could keep it on all day. Then at night you could do the same but with an eye mask for when you sleep. Being able to have it shut as long as I could take it helped take the stress off of having to constantly put in eyedrops. Hope this helps and that you heal quickly! I honestly never had any luck with getting my  eye to stay taped shut.  I bought disposable sticky eye patches and an eye ointment.  So my eye never shut fully but stayed hydrated or whatever because of the ointment.  Just an option if you cannot get the taping to work either. Not a doctor so take it for what it is worth but I tried something similar to what you did, patches, etc.   Nothing worked better for me than just using a three inch or so piece of masking tape and putting it straight on the lid.  Sound lime it might rip out one\u2019s eyelashes but it never did.  Good luck. What kind of tape are you using? I used the tape I was given at the hospital seen in the picture directly over my eye and this morning was quite the struggle removing it. I am going to see what the effects are of using painter's tape instead. They have a cleaner release and might be fine for more sensitive skin. Masking tape would likely be better than the tape I used, though. Thanks! This is a great tip! Did you have a specific brand/type eye patch that you would buy? I just went to Walgreens and got paper tape from the first aid section. Once you get good at applying it and you only have to put it on once a day instead of taping and re-taping 3 times to get it right, it is not bad at all. Took me about a week to get the hang of it. I had not even thought of adhesive eye patches. I will probably pick a pack of these up on the way home tonight. Thanks! When I was in the hospital they just gave me one of those regular \"pirate patch\" looking ones haha. The black one with a stretchy elastic band. If you do not have gauze on hand, something like a clean folded up microfiber cloth or cut up face cloth could work, too. Also, I am pretty nearsighted so sometimes I had to take a break from having my bad eye closed all the time, so I also used moisture chamber eye patches. The stick on like a bandaid and its like a goggle over your eye and it keeps it protected from being scratched and from drying out. You can maybe find that stuff on amazon if you cannot get out to the pharmacy or if the ones by you do not have everything! Sorry you are going through this. I am on day 4 right now (2nd BP episode). This part of the process has been a challenge for me but I think I found something that works and is fairly comfortable. I use Nexcare transpore tape to tape my lid completely shut and then put a sleeping mask on at night. During the day I rock an eye patch with my lid taped down underneath. I change it a few times a day to put some drops in just in case.  Have not ripped out any eyelashes yet. Just try and be careful when removing the tape. Pick the tape off on the edge and gently pull the eyelid away from the tape, not the tape off of the eyelid. Wishing you a speedy recovery! I am fortunate enough that I was able make myself blink my eye if I focused on doing it so I did not need to rock an eyepatch during the day (though my coworkers encouraged me to be a pirate at work). Thanks for the tip, I will look for the Nexcore and try that.\n\nSo far I have had success taping gauze into an eyepatch and securing that around my face. It seems to have worked pretty decently but I would really like the extra security of knowing the eyelid will stay shut without the pain of my first attempt. Thankfully I am starting to get motion back in different parts of my face (the nerve above my right eyebrow just started twitching as I was typing this). \n\nI am so sorry to hear that you are going through this again. Good luck on your recovery!", "Hey Yall (New Guy) So had Bell's Palsy for a little over a week now, Doctor said since I caught it within the firsr 24 hours I should only last anywhere from a couple weeks to 6 months. I wanted to do exercises for my face to keep my muscles from going bad but do not want to stress my face as it recovers. What are good exercises? My taste and eye sight are fine. But the whole left half of my face is paralzyed, also doctor said that acupuncture could help with symptoms. Has anyone tried this and did it make a difference? So sorry about your diagnosis. Hang in there! I know there are lot of opinions out there so this is all just my experience and what I was told by my Dr.\n\nI started exercises the day after I got home from the ER. I was told to do these 100 times a day for each exercise. Raise and lower eyebrows. Puff out cheeks. Smiling.\n\nI did acupuncture about 6-7 weeks after my diagnosis and that is when I did the most healing. I had not made much progress and I was still dealing with pain which I why I tried it. Again, I think it worked for me because I started to see changes once  I started.  It also helped with the pain.\n\nI did other stuff with supplements, food and oils. I was willing to try almost anything at that point!\n\nGood luck with your healing!\n I did acupuncture as well, and it really helped me. Especially for the pain, but my face did start moving more. I did mine about 11 days after I was diagnosed. \n\nIt is been about 3 weeks now and I am completely better  Oo been about 6 years since I got bells. I am going to be truthful here, acupunture helps a little with the feeling. Exercises help a little bit with the muscle weakness but... be prepared to never be the same. I am as healed as can be and will always have a slightly crooked forced smile. My eyes will always water when I eat anything heated. My eye will always slightly close when im talking or eating and I hated it for a long time. Until I accepted( being real) I am now less natural with my smile and facial gestures it all needs a little effort I do not feel as confident as I did but do your exercises every day go acupunture twice a month but at some point accept your new face. Sorry you got bells it is a really shit one. Completely better in three weeks! Congratulations you are very lucky! 5 months in.  The only thing that is not back near normal is my bottom lip but now people do not react when I speak or try a (half face) smile. \nBut...\nEye - still very conscious that its not back to normal. It can gum up at the end of the day because I am not blinking enough.  It gets tired if I drive for over an hour. \nEar - it started with an ear infection and my hearing is only about 70% in that ear\nTop half of face - regularly feels tight\nCheek and nose - I usually have a feeling that I can only describe as pre sneeze. That can also extend to around the eye. \nMouth - my smile is almost back but still not 100% in control of my face. My wife comments that my half interested look actually comes across as a look of distain.  I have no control over half my bottom lip so when I try to speak at volume I get brrrrrs instead of B. \nNormally of any one of those things happened you would be  a bit concerned but after bells I just have to live with it and try to ignore it until the tightness gets too uncomfortable. \nNot being in control of my face and not being able to speak in my own voice impacts mentally. While it is better I still am very conscious of it, especially when I meet new people. \nI have been hit a few times with post viral exhaustion so do not forget your body is healing. \n I had acupuncture and it really worked for me, so based on my experiences I would really recommend. I had it for about 2 weeks before it started to clear up and I am completely ok 2 months later ", "I miss my smile. My smile and pucker still are not back and I am starting to feel really discouraged. My movement started coming back just under a month of my diagnoses and each day things were getting better but now I feel like I have been at a stalemate this last month. I just do not know what to do now. It is going to be ok. My lips took forever to comeback to normal. I swear I was holding my lips together with my fingers for weeks before they finally started to work again. This is a process and it takes time. You are going to be ok. Take it one day at a time and notice any small victories. I laughed my damn head off the first time I actually moved my mouth because I meant to. It is going to be ok, you are doing just fine. I am almost 2 years in and still do not have my full smile back. But my recent physio appointment included another physio attending who has a bit more expertise in dealing with bells. She straight up was like, 'We will get your smile back. Trust me. I have brought it back for others in worse states than yours.'\n\nShe identified some problem areas and I am working on them now.\n\nDo not beat yourself up. Keep plugging away with exercises. And if you feel you are not getting the right treatment, keep trying new specialists. Stop panicking, please. My smile took 2 months to come back and my pucker took 4 months. But all in all, it took me around 4 months and 20 days to fully recover. You will be okay. Trust me. The fact that it took you under a month to start healing is a really good sign. Some people do not start healing until 3 months, and normally it stops healing for them. Not people like you. Your smile WILL come back. \n\nI was just like you, VERY discouraged. I am such a pessimistic person which made things 100x worse lol. Sit in front of a mirror and massage your face. \n\nSmile as hard as you can and pull the rest with your fingers. In terms of your pucker - exercise one side more by pulling the weaker side to one side only. Massages really help. \n\nI thought I stopped healing at around 3 months ( I did not, things were just recovering annoyingly slow) - until I started taking B12 you see. B12 really sped up my recovery process a lot. I can almost guarantee that if I did not take it, I would still be in the woods right now in terms of my bells. \n\nYou can message me at any time you want. I will be more than happy to sit here and get you feeling optimistic again! Wishing you a speedy recovery, all the best beautiful \ud83e\udd70\u2764\ufe0f", "Can hear spasms in inner ear? It is week 7 of a severe case  and I am still recovering with 0 movement, but I recently started hearing what I would guess is muscle spasms in what I would guess is the bony ear canal that is inflammed. I was just curious if anyone else had the same experience in which they could hear what sounds to be like muscle twitching. I believe it to be a good sign but was just curious as I could not find anything that showed this as a symptom or potential recovery(I believe it is the beginning sign of nerve regen but i am not a doctor) I am 3 months out with pretty decent recovery so far and I started hearing an intermittent stretching-like sound about 2-3 weeks ago, I am not sure if that is what you are talking about. I had guessed it was related to recovery as well, but I only hear the sound on the left (my Bells was bilateral) so I am not entirely sure if that is it or not.  &gt; I had guessed it was related to recovery as well, but I only hear the sound on the left (my Bells was bilateral) so I am not entirely sure if that is it or not.\n\nYea it is hard to describe the sound, but it is also on my affected side. Its like low pulsing noise that cuts in and out. I can only sort of hear it when it is really quite. Perhaps you have ramsay hunt syndrome recovery is longer in that case You know I thought that aswell, but I really do no have any of the symptoms of a rash or deafness or vertigo. It really is actually pretty painless outside of a pain behind the ear every once in a while or some minor jaw pain I have read that sometime there is no visible rash , something it is inside the ear. Have you been to a physio ?, tried facial exercise? I got BP on the 25 february and got the med on the same day it took 2 week to start to see improvement I did feel like I had a sore throat and you are right there could be a rash in my ear, however I feel like I would have felt that as I am pretty sensitive to anything going on in my body. I have been doing massages and electrical facial massages about 30-45 min a day. I am going to see a Neurologist on wednsday. Not sure what a Physio is. I have seen my GP if that is what you are referring to. \n\nI have seen improvements for sure, my hearing sensitivity has subsided, my face is symmetrical again, and I can talk a little better, the only thing i seems to be lacking is movement. So now it has changed that when I attempt to smile or move that side of my face, it blocks off my hearing a little. If I were to guess, it is like my inflamed ear canal is blocking off hearing when attempting to move muscles I have a sound in my ear when I blink and smile. My guess is synkenesis causing the inner ear muscle to twitch when I blink To update: This has turned into that when I attempt to smile, my hearing is blocked out. Not completely, but a noticeable amount. I think it has been gradually started happening less and less, but hard to notice due to how slowly the healing is", "Eye drops recall  Thought I would share. Seems like the ones that I purchased were recalled. Thanks for sharing this Welcome! Better safe than sorry", "Second week of recovery from my Bell's Palsy  Looking heaps better. Well done! And thanks again for sharing the videos. Thank you so much for following my progress. I am seeing great improvement.", "My dad was diagnosed with it today after going to the ER. Is there any advice you guys could give us?  I was diagnosed in the ER as well but this was a few years ago. I really recommend doing the facial exercises they give you. I wore sunglasses all the time for a few days since me eye was so sensitive. Get the hardcore eye lubricant. It is like a jelly and feels gross but it helps when you are sleeping. I know some people wear an eye patch. That did not work for me. I pulled it off while sleeping. I tried a lot of things that may not be appealing to everyone but you can look into essential oils, facial massage, and acupuncture. I think the most important part is REST!\n\nI wish your dad well! Thanks! Do not waste your money on acupuncture. Take 5 minutes Google it and look up research done by the national institution of Health on acupuncture. It is basically just a scam. There is a Facebook group with a lot of activity - suggest one of you join that for support and ideas - name is Bell\u2019s palsy and facial paralysis support.  I was told to wait a few weeks before doing exercises so you do not fatigue your facial muscles. Basically all the nerves have to die before new ones can make connections. Once that happens, that is when you should be doing facial exercises (after about a week). \n\nWhen the nerves die it causes a lot of pain. I took a lot of ibuprofen and I got a heating pad that I kept on my face 99% of the time-- it helped a lot. I also highly recommend eye drops, I just used cheap stuff from CVS. I also taped my eye shut at night to keep it from drying out. Bandaids and cotton worked the best for me bc they did not tear out eyelashes!\n\nBest of luck, I hope for a speedy recovery. I know I felt a lot worse than I looked-- which was reassuring to me because I thought the whole world could tell my face was wonky.  Definitely medical tape to tape the eye closed at night and lots of rest - it is a very stressful and upsetting time! Taking care of the eye is the most important and just be patient. I started recovering after two weeks but I know people that recovered after two months I would have to respectfully disagree with this. I started acupuncture a little late in the game but it is the only thing that has significantly made a difference for me. \n\nI was incredibly skeptical of this to be honest and was trying it as a last resort after seeing no improvements. Since I have started, the day after the first appointment really, there were improvements. My face has become significantly more symmetrical. The marble sized knots that were in my jaw are essentially gone. \n\nMy acupuncturist manipulates the needles in my muscles which hurts like hell but helped loosen the muscles. Then she massages them out and helps to realign and massage out my jaw.  \n\nIt may depend on the strategy the acupuncturist uses, but I have found great help in it! I would not completely count it out \u263a\ufe0f Good for you but I stand by my statement. There is no empirical evidence that acupuncture does anything. When I had Bell's I tried acupuncture but at $75 a treatment I decided to do a little research.As I stated go to NIH's website and you will learn that when people who try acupuncture compared to those who do not there is no significant difference in healing time. Bell's Palsy pretty much is not treatable and needs to just run it is course. My bells was fairly typical and I healed within 4 to 6 weeks but I understand that some people are impacted quite significantly harder by this disease and will reach out to try to find some kind of relief.  I can see your point of view, and I will not argue with you there, but I honestly do not think there has been enough study done on Bells to justify that answer. Maybe a wider test group may be needed? I am going on nearly 4 months with this now. The only relief and improvement I saw was after beginning acupuncture. Maybe it helps different strains more? Or more severe cases. I think it would be beneficial if there was more research put into it.  Just realized I did not reply to your comment, reposting as a reply \n\nI can see your point of view, and I will not argue with you there, but I honestly do not think there has been enough study done on Bells to justify that answer.

May 25th will be 2 years since I was diagnosed with BP and I still have not fully recovered. \n\nI guess I have learned to live with it at this point. After the 7th month no one has really noticed uess I have had to point it out. I remember going on my first date on month 11. I was doing most of the talking, and about 20 minutes I to the date I pointed it out. \"hey just in case I seem to look off it is because I am recovering from BP\". She analyzed me and said  \"no I do not notice anything\". I then go on an explain what it is. \n\nAfter that I mentioned it to some other people and got the same reaction. They did not notice it till I mentioned it. I can smile but not fully and when I eat I still have some trouble keeping  the food in my mouth. Im not really self conscious about it as I guess I have learned to live with it. \n\nI never took the steroids as I opted out for natural healing. I also did face massages and acupuncture in the real early stages. I recommend you do not do that. I have done research and found it might actually disrupt the nerves even more. \n\nPeople this is not the end of the world. It will get better at some point. Some faster th as n others, but please go on with your lives. I did I never stayed in I empraced it. I loved educating people about it. \n\nStay positive.  It is been 20 years and I am only 85%  recovered. I was a freshman in highschool, never did the exercises and never took the steroids regularly. Looking back now I wish I did.\n\nThat being said I must say I have had a nice life regardless. It is what you make it The steroid is to stop the nerve from having severe damage when you went the natural way there was nothing to stop it It is really just to strengthen the muscles not the nerves. Tissue regeneration occurs with time    The steroids reduce inflammation, taking the pressure off the nerve, in turn reducing potential damage. When I had it I did everything the doctor and physio said and within 2 months I had full recovery. To be fair my case was considered minor, however it could have gotten worse if I didnt get on it quickly as I am sure we all know. 13 months here and 85% back but still not got my smile. I also wink when I smile which is not always appropriate! \nAs you said no one notices.  But you know.  I got BP back in 2015 and I am maybe 85% recovered. ", "Any luck with progress after it is stalled? I got bell's palsy almost three years ago.  I had known other people that got it.  Mine felt pretty severe.  I had a migraine for 2.5 weeks at the beginning and it took 6 months before I finally felt like I did not have to explain to people that I had not had a stroke.  I feel like I did everything.  At the beginning I did antibiotics (for possible strep), antivirals, and steroids, along with muscle relaxers after a few weeks because of the headache.  Then I did a round of the Whole 30 to help \"cleanse\" my system and get my body back on track.  Then I did several rounds of acupuncture.  I did massage and Reiki healing. I have been taking methylated B vitamins.  For a while I tried facial exercises and massage.  I went to a chiropractor for several months and he used this machine to stimulate my nerves.  And I never fully recovered.  My smile is still crooked and I have a lot less control over one eye when I am yawning or eating, weird stuff like that.  But now I have this weird \"cleft\" in my chin and I feel like it is getting worse.  I am sure it is because my healthy side is compensating for my Palsy side.  And I know it is just vanity.  Is there anything I can do?  I probably need to go back to daily facial exercises, but I am a mom, a business owner and I am in grad school and I just do not feel like I have time.  Plus I do not want to invest a ton of time if it will not work.  Anyone else had any success with something specific?", "I feel like I am falling apart I have lupus and just developed Bell\u2019s palsy a couple days ago. Since then I woke up throwing up, I have this terrible zing feeling inside my left nostril up in sinuses both my knees hurt so bad to walk, my left shoulder I can hardly move or it feels like joint will pop or break . I really cant handle much more right now. I cannot eat or drink normally. I have an appointment Monday. I feel like my entire body is under attack on some level. I already developed social anxiety during this pandemic and now this? How do you cope? I do not know how to help you, other than saying that it will hopefully get easier soon. \n\nI have had the 'nobody knows why' version of Bell's palsy 10 months after an accident that changed my ability to use my right leg forever. \n\nI wore a lot of mouth masks, send messages to everyone I knew that I was meeting of what was happening and that I am not dying and it is not contagious.\n\nFor all the strangers I met, it was pretty much one of the first things out of my mouth. 'Hey, I have something called Bell's palsy that makes me temporarily unable to move half my face. My speach is a bit weird ar the moment, if it is too unclear do not hesitate to tell me!' I think being vocally upfront about it, made people less tempted to stare strangely at me. Most stares are curiousity anyway.\n\nPrivately I was depressed, upset, angry and frustrated. I could not handle much stimulation, such as bright light and loud sounds. I could not close my eye, taste anything and I had a permanent migraine on one side of my head. But publicly I delt with it. For me, nipping the outside world's comments in the bud certainly helped lessen my personal anxiety. It took time, clinging on to little improvements and a lot of rest. But slowly I felt better again. \n\nI am 95% back to normal a year and a few months since the onset, if you do not know you would not notice anymore. And that is good enough for me.\n\nI hope you feel a bit better soon. I really fell apart too. The people around me were like \u2018it is temporary, right?\u2019 Yes, but right now sucks a whole lot. The first week is so rough. And for me, the most painful part was when the nerve started coming back.  But each day I saw the tiniest bit of improvement and I am at about 95% after 4 weeks. Hang in there, I wish you a speedy recovery, and it is totally ok to feel sorry for yourself! did you ever use electrical stimulation on your face? It is under attack and it is ok to cry, fall apart then pick yourself up. I am sorry, it sounds painful and I hope your doctor can get you some meds to alleviate the pain. A cold compress to the areas that feel swollen can help. If you have any anti-inflammation gel like voltaren, that with CBD massaged onto the area helped for me. If you can, rest helps a lot. I did not feel like eating much at all when I had Bell's but healed after the 30 days. I only took a 10 day 50mg per dag prednisolon treatment, as I am Dutch and that is the standard treatment here. I did have eye Vaseline which helped greatly keeping my eye intact. Do you have any synkinesis? which is involuntary movement for example if you try to smile your eye closes or if you try to poke your lips out your eye closes None whatsoever! The movement on my affected side is just a fraction of a second slower and when I smile 'big', you can see the left side of my face does not open as far as the right side anymore. But nobody notices unless I tell them.\n\nOh, and my left side is, all though I do not have many at my age, slightly less wrinkly :p when did you first start seeing signs of recovery? After 12 days I started seeing tiny muscle responses above my eyebrow. From there on out, I regained about 80% in the next 2-3 weeks. In the next 2 or 3 months most of everything came back again. You are probably wondering it it causes synkinesis.  I did it and have synkinesis \n. Yet my friend did nothing and has the same synkinsis\n\nIt really has to do with the length of recovery. The longer u take to recover the likelihood of synkinesis. I am almost at 6 months and have not seen physical improvement in 2 months maybe. My top lip on effected side is flat so it looks weird when I pucker and my eyebrow on the effected side is weaker. I would say I am 85 to 90 percent back and so is my friend. I know tons of people who did electrical stimulation and had no synkinesis because they had a quick recovery and I know those who did nothing and still got synkinesis Thank you for your kind words. Only thing I keep thinking is at least masks are in right now. I feel so self conscious Yes! Masks make it a little easier:) How is your recovery?   I feel for you.  I have RA and now Bell\u2019s palsy. I mean wtf. It is one thing after another for me.  I am not overweight and am mostly healthy besides for probably drinking to much. But I recently cut that out because I have put on so much weight in the 6 it so months (maybe from meds) or not being able to be active because of my arthritis. As this time both of my legs really hurt. Plus my eyes are tired so I guess I should put the phone down.  Anyway I hope you are recovering", "Pain Behind Ear I am 2 weeks after dx. The pain behind my ear on the affected side is excruciating. I get it a few times during the day, but it is worst at night. Keeps me up and nothing helps. I will take any tips you all have. Ibuprofen does not help. TIA Unfortunately the only thing that helped me and the pain i experienced was time. It was awful, but I did finally get some relief about 3 weeks after dx. I did notice that letting the hot water in a shower run behind my ear on that side of my head would help for a bit. Good luck. Try a heating pad - that helped me! Heating pad, or some kind of pain reliever like an icy hot. Tylenol too  It will go away after a week or two. \n\nThe jaw nerve is inflamed and because of that, it expands. But because it runs through the jaw bone, and bones do not expand,...the nerve is just putting pressure on the jaw bones. It will go down Massages, I used a jade roller - the cold of the jade and the rollers helped. Hair snagging on the rollers was real though. I added some CBD balm and anti-inflammation topical (voltaren which you can get OTC) too. Time and acupuncture helped the most for me. I would feel immediate relief after an acupuncture session. I use a CBD roller, I also have balm. That and the jade roller helps. Use the smaller size for behind your ear. And heat too. I found the stuffed animal heating pads on Amazon that are really gentle for your face. A heating pad was too strong for me. When the pain comes back, repeat the process.  I hope that helps.", "My Chin / Please Help! Hi to you all, I am new here,\nSince I was 6-9 my Chin is twitching but after a couple of time it disappeared. It happens every time if I am really concentrated like on football or basketball. The last time I got the chin twitching was on September but I could remove it by relaxing. Now since 7 days I got the tic again and it does not want to disappear anymore and I am getting anxious to be honest. I even lost visibility, my eyes cannot focus properly anymore since last week, i just see blurry, I do not know if it is because the tic or something different. I am now 15, I can perfectly control my face but the only issue is my chin that is jumping and twitching all day 24/7 and I cannot really sleep well because it is annoying. I do not really get why I got the twitching again, I fall asleep and then on 3 am I wake up with it and since then it just permanently there. I hope someone knows a solution for me, I really cannot live anymore with this and I am falling into depression now. I would give anything to remove the twitching. \nHave a nice day. Deep breath. Everything will be ok. Please let your parents or caregivers know. When I was young I had eye twitches that would come and go. \nRecently, blurred vision, frozen chin/ mouth area etc...it was diagnosed as Bell's Palsy.  It was explained to me that it is a temporary situation, but could last a while. I became depressed, too.\nSo after consulting with a doctor,  I am now taking vitamin supplements..specially B- complex.\nAlso am receiving acupunture.  This has helped considerably.  \nPlease speak with your caregivers so you can get proper diagnosis and go from there.\nAdditionally,  please reach out anytime. Support and genuine caring is important. Please know we are here for you. There are many of us dealing with this right now.  We care. \u2764 Thank you very much for the support, it really means a lot for me \u2764\ufe0f. My mom keeps telling me that the twitching is normal, my mom even had it     on the past. I keep telling her every time that it is not ok to have that. Tomorrow I will go to the doctor, I hope he has a solution for me or something. It is so irritating because I cannot enjoy things since last week. Evert time I breath or make a move the twitching just accelerate but if I stop the twitching just calms down. I did stop going to school since last Tuesday, I could not take it anymore. In how much days did you recovery the most part? Recovery varies from person to person. It is those nerves that have to heal. If the doctor diagnosis it as Bell's palsy...and that is what it sounds like...ask what he/ she suggests as further steps to take.\nI am thinking doc will suggest a good multi-vitamin and de-stressing. Onset of my episode was Sept. 24, but my case was very severe.  I am still in recovery, but coming right along. It requires patience and just relaxing and letting healing take over...at its own pace. That is the tough part. \nThe deal changer for me was acupunture. I am not sure it is for everyone , but it made all the difference for me. Just remember, we all heal at different rates. Be kind to yourself and relax. The situation will improve.  I would not lie to you. Eat healthy. Relax. And please rest. Resting allows your nerves to heal quicker. I almost forgot...I put warm compresses on the affected areas.  You can soak a washcloth in warm water. Ring out excess water and place it on chin and over eyes. This is very therapeutic, decreases inflammation and eases discomfort.  Please let me know how you are doing later. Praying for you.", "Is this pain normal? Please help. Hi guys. Day 8 of Bell's Palsy.\n I am dealing with the mental side of it okay but the pain is destroying me..I feel like someone is stabbing me up my neck behind my ear and in the back of my head.\nI just need to know if this is normal or if maybe I need to get it further looked into? It is almost debilitating. I also feel very dizzy. \nThank you so much for your help. I had the same pain and was not able to sleep for a week because it got worse when I laid down. I was prescribed Gabapentin and the pain stopped. Pretty sure the doctor called it neuralgia and it is common with Bell\u2019s Palsy. I am sorry you are going through that, I would definitely mention it because that part is treatable (at least in my case). Oh my goodness thank you for your reply! I feel so relieved that it probably is just Bell's pain and not something more! You are welcome! There are so many things that suck with it, I hope you get the pain part out of the way early on at least Yeah! No worries! It is where your damaged nerv is. Mine appeared a month before the paralysis. Pain is so sharp that sleeping on that side is painful and the headaches combined does not make it better but it does get better after a couple of weeks :) That will make a massive difference for sure and in my ability to be positive too as it is a wee bit difficult when someone is stabbing your head with a knife. \ud83d\ude0a Oh that perfectly describes my pain. And now you mention it I had terrible neck pain in the lead up too. Thank you so much for taking time to reply. I feel so much better just knowing it is normal. Really appreciate it. No problem bud :)\nAnd I feel that too, I had a lot anxiety with it but we gotchu For sure! I am glad you are staying positive, best of luck! I had the same thing! Lasted about a week and slowly died down. I found a heat pack helped me  sleep. Good luck! I hope it disappears soon \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d I had the same pain, I was told it was normal for bells, \nTalk to your doctor about strong pain relief but In the mean time heat packs will be your best friend one of the only things that relived my pain.\n\nI found sleeping on the opposite helped too keeping pressure off the sore side but my saving grace was definitely the heat packs.\n\nSorry you are going through this pain, it does get better friend Thank you for replying! It is so good to know. I will definitely go get my heat packs out now! Thank you! My husband was diagnosed at the ER on February 12. He is on day 13 post diagnosis. He is been experiencing pain on the left side of his face (the affected side) and in his left jaw bone (to the point that he had to pull out his dental retainers) and around his left ear. Also, down his neck on the left side and his left shoulder. His neurologist told him it was safe for him to take OTC pain meds because he is off Prednisone and Valacyclovir now. So, he takes Advil before bed. He had his first telemedicine PT appointment. His physiotherapist told him the left-sided facial/jaw/ear/neck pain is due to the paralyzed muscles stiffening. He has started to do some very basic facial exercises like manually lifting his left eyebrow, gently pulling a smile and a frown, etc. Thank you for your reply. Hearing all these other experiences is helping me so much. Appreciate it. You are welcome! I have learned over the last 13 days that even though this illness is not life-threatening or permanent in most cases, it sure is a truly miserable experience. So much physical and mental pain/discomfort. I hope you feel better soon! \n\nMy husband went to the ER one more time, a few days after his diagnosis for heart palpitations, elevated heart rate, anxiety, and dizziness. The bloodwork showed that the high dose of Prednisone (60 mg) and Valacyclovir that he was on at that time made his potassium levels drop. He was given IV fluids and an oral potassium tablet, and he felt a little better for the next few days. It might be worth going to your primary care doctor or local urgent care/ER if you continue to feel dizzy. There could be a simple fix for those problems. Good luck!", "Importance of steroids Hello, I took my partner to the ER today to make sure she was not having a stroke.  \n\nShe was told it is Bells Palsy and prescribed an antiviral.  \n\nShe turned down the prescription for steroids because of the negative effects it can have.  \n\nI worry that is the wrong decision.  \n\nIs there anyone here who could share their experience taking steroids, in particular any women?  \n\nThank you. Her decision not to take it *probably* will not affect her outcome much if at all. There is limited evidence that it maybe, kind of helps, sometimes, which is why doctors prescribe it in most cases, but if you are someone who has bad reactions to it then it is probably not worth taking. I could share my experience with taking it (I hated it, it made me feel extremely jumpy and made it impossible to sleep) but I am not a woman. I did not take the steroids as prescribed and did not do the facial excises because I was a dummy and my face only healed 85%. Do EVERYTHING you can right away because everyday the amount you can recover gets smaller I am married to an ER doc. I have Bell\u2019s palsy. I took the steroids based on medical evidence that they can help. Eeey, same. Also married to a doctor.\n\nI also did everything they told me from the hospital. I was a 5/6 on the BP severity scale. It is been 19 days since my diagnosis. After day 9 I noticed I had regained a tiny bit of control in my eyebrow, and since then my recovery has continued to rapidly improve. I now feel like I have 90% control of my face, and it is still getting better by the day.\n\nI did not get any bad side affects from the steroids. A little trouble sleeping (but that could also have been due to eyepatch/medical tape on my eye), and sensitive skin, which made me ditch the medical tape approach to keep the eye closed at night.\n\nTo OP, maybe check with the hospital/doctor if it would be okay start the steroid treatment now (note that if it had been more than 72 hours since paralysis start, the steroids will not have an effect. They need to be taken early on), and also check if it would be okay to stop taking them mid treatment IF she should start to experience some bad side effects. I do not know if that is an option, just a thought to have a little security net during the treatment.\n\nRegardless, I wish you guys all the best :) Thanks for the info. I followed doctor\u2019s orders and took steroids. 4 years later and I still have no movement in my face. Probably unrelated but you do not know if you will actually recover until about the 6 week mark. I wish I would have refused the steroids and gabapentin. I have recurring episodes, but steroids and the antiviral always help me recover. Every body is different. E.R. doc told me that if I only take one, take the steroids over the antiviral. I am taking both. I hate the very idea of steroids, but I hate the idea of limiting my recovery more.", "Is hurting a good sign? I have had BP for about a week and the bad side has started twitching a little and MIGHT be getting very subtly better (cannot see a difference in the mirror though). One thing I notice is if I touch the muscles they feel a little tender, especially around my temple and sinus area. Is this from overworking the muscles (been trying very few assisted massages) or a sign things are getting better ? Hi! I am 4 weeks in and the tenderness also started around that time (and i still have it, also the same areas as you as well as around my nostril and cheek). My doctors have told me it is generally a good sign as it shows that something is happening.  \nWhat i would recommend is to take pictures/videos of yourself - sometimes you do not see the difference in the mirror but you will see it on video. Wishing you a speedy recovery :) Thanks you too :) ", "Contact wearers Are there any contact wearers in this group? Any suggestions? Should I stick with glasses? Not a contact wearer but have worked for optometrists...most likely would suggest sticking to glasses until your blink is back as contacts themselves can be drying. This is not advice in any way shape or form, but when I had BP I just took the contact out on the affected side. The glasses I had were an outdated pair and my vision was worse with them on than just being able to see out of the one \u201cgood\u201d eye. I honestly would not do that again but somehow I managed to survive like that for about 4 months. If you have glasses that you are able to use then you should probably just wear those. Contact wearer here \ud83d\udc4b I am on day 12\n\nI am sticking with glasses only until my eye is almost back to normal. At the moment it is drying out much too quickly with the limited blinking I am over the eye dryness and loss of taste. Good signs I hope Just woke up with BP on Sunday. I hate the burnt tongue feeling so much!", "Woke up with Tightness and sore face I was diagnosed with BP 6 days ago, and today I woke up with tightness and some sore areas on the affected side of the face (mostly near my ear). \nIs this a sign of recovery? I have also heard mixed comments about massages/exercises as it could rewire the nerves wrong and cause issues. \n\nAny advice on how to navigate the recovery process? What worked for you?", "my experience with bp Hey everyone so I dealt with bp during my freshman year of high school back in 2015. It did not hit me as hard as it has for others but I did notice my smile changed and became very insecure of that. But what I wanted to ask if anyone else developed jerks/ticks? As if you had Tourette\u2019s? I also developed horrible headaches and my speech was completely ruined. I mess up words a lot now and stutter so much. I never went to any type of therapy for it was really just given some pills in the ER and told to do facial exercises. I still do not like my smile. I feel as if I am getting it again because I do feel some numbness to half of my face. My jaw has also moved and my teeth are no longer perfectly aligned. I am stressing because I got bullied for my face in high school and I am scared this time it will hit me harder. Should I start doing facial exercises again and see my doctor? If pain begins or symptoms worsen I would suggest getting into doctor ASAP. Begin treatment-- antiviral and possibly a steroid (doctor will RX one). Also, consider acupunture. I recommend seeing a doc if you can just go get a peace of mind. The earlier you address it, I feel the better the chances. Exercises definitely help. It sounds like you could get your doc to at least recommend some physical therapy for your speech if you find yourself stuttering. I have only had BP for 3 days and found that taking a pause between sentences helps. Good luck and take care of yourself!", "Woke up with Bells Palsy on Tuesday morning. We are on day 4. Woke up with some numbness 3 days ago, the first thing I noticed was my right eye was tearing up way more than usual. Later on that day I really noticed the numbness. Day 2 everything was very noticeable, the droopy face, unable to puff my cheeks out, my resting face was clearly sagging. Came home from work and started to develop a headache and feeling pressure behind my right ear. Went to the doctor and she said it was most likely Bells Palsy after examining me for any ear/nose/throat problems and ruling out the possibility of a stroke (I am 35). Day 3 we are still waiting for a CT scan of my brain to determine the cause of the swelling that is causing the compression of that facial nerve. Day 4 I woke up with a bit of a headache but I feel like I have a little bit more mobility if my face. I am able to close my eyes and my resting face is not sagging a much as it was on day 2.  We will see how day 4 goes and find out what the CT scan of my brain says. I was getting a bit depressed yesterday thinking that my face will never return to normal but I am trying to remain positive and I am constantly doing facial exercises to try and get my movement back. Found this sub just looking for answers or others experiences dealing with this. Thanks for reading and I plan to follow up daily with my experiences to hopefully help others and alleviate some of the uncertainties that come from a diagnosis like this. Unfortunately patience is the key. Rest and take care of yourself. It will get better. Thanks, I will be doing that. Stayed home from work today because of the headache and have no plans for the weekend. Will be laying low for the the next few days, kind of looking forward to doing nothing but watching tv and staying hydrated. Antivirals and steroids would not hurt either. Hang in there. Doc just wrote a script for a tapering dose of steroids. We will see how it goes. Highly recommend the steroid AND antiviral medication. I started my treatment within 48 hours of Symptons onset. After 10\u2019day medication I noticed significant improvement. I am now almost 2 weeks finished and 98% normal. \n\nStress induced also, so do not stress. It can take months to slowly recover but do not worry. Sounds like you have a more mild case like I did :) Best of luck, patience with all of it is the key. Acupuncture perhaps. Glad you are on your way back to \u201cnormal\u201d. I started the steroid treatment today and that was 72 hours after my symptoms showed up. I will be doing my best in the future to keep the stress to a minimum. Thanks for sharing your experience, I am definitely optimistic about my recovery from this :)", "What did I do to deserve this Fuuuuck. I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy on March 20th and had a full recovery. But I woke up yesterday with the throbbing ear pain and went to my normal doc. They said without the dropping it is probably not bells again. \n\nWell guess who woke up with weakness on the left side of their face? This fucking guy. It is on the opposite side this time but can you imagine?? Barely two months from my initial diagnosis and it is back. Anyone else had this happen. Feeling defeated but not quite as scared as last time. \n\nTrying not to let it get to me. ugh, I am so sorry. it is really hard.\n\nI had it one side a decade ago, and now on the other.\n\nHave they done MRIs or anything to rule things out?\n\nDid you get the covid vaccine recently? Hey, sorry to hear that. I just wanted to say I was diagnosed January this year with no progress whatsoever. \n\nI am going soon to have metal weights implanted into my eyelids so I can shut my eye. It is been since 2020 the last time I was able to blink without help from my own hand/fingers.\n\nWhat I am trying to say here is try to stay positive. You had a full recovery from March, so there is a great chance you will have another full recovery as long as you stay healthy and positive. \n\nThere are some that do not show any progress. I have high hopes you will be recovered again soon. Again, I am sorry that happened to you especially on the opposite side. \n\nBut I would trade places with you in a heartbeat. Next week for me is 10 months.  Sucks majorly...  cannot imagine having it twice. Sorry to hear dude... Yes sadly I have experience it 3 times total since 2017. The first time lasted about 2 weeks, then about a week later I got it one the opposite side for another 2 weeks! It was a nightmare.. but you are not alone in this. The third time just occurred for me in late April and while I am mostly recovered there is still a slight weakness in my eye and smile. I wish you a quick recovery tho. Do not forget your b-12! Thanks. I appreciate it. It is comforting to hear others have gotten it so close the the first instance. Good luck with the rest of your recovery. Sorry to hear that. Wish you get better Many thanks for the kind words. Wishing you a recovery soon. No MRI\u2019s but doc is worried about meningitis if I develop a headache that is 10/10, neck stiffness to the point of not moving it, and throwing up. But I am not worried about that. It feels too similar to bells. \n\nThe first time I got bells was pre vaccine. I actually had the shot scheduled the same day I was diagnosed. \n\nGot the vaccine after I was 100% in early may. I would not wish this illness on my worst enemy. Look up bi-lateral Bell\u2019s palsy, that is where it looks very scary! &gt;Anyone else had this happen. \n\nwell. i got it on BOTH sides at the same time. Full facial paralysis.. so.. kind of lol. That sucks. I have had it start to come back as well too. What helps me is extra sleep, eating well, and sunshine. Just trying to stay as healthy as possible so the body can focus on fighting whatever is inflaming those nerves I got it on my right side, was about 60% recovered exactly a month later when I got it on the left. I was so used to a numb face, I had not even noticed the left side went weak for hours after I woke up. Both sides were healed in about six weeks, but the second time was frustrating. Sometimes it felt faster since I would been through it already and I was less scary, but other times it felt so slow since I knew about how long it should take to recover. It is definitely less scary the second time, but also way more frustrating. Good luck, I hope you get better soon. Sorry to hear that Bell's came back. :( Did your doc root cause to see what caused the Bell's the first time and this time? From my very cursory google reading and going through the recovery process, it is made me realized getting Bell's required a lifestyle change - getting enough quality sleep, avoiding a bunch of food that would amp up inflammation, reducing my stress levels. \n\nThe good news is that you have recovered quickly from it before, so stay the course and do all you have done before. You have got this!\n\nAlso wry humor: if it is on the opposite side now, it will balance things up with the prior Bell's side? I have always had a lopsided smile and Bell's has corrected it for me. :S Does anyone We have not been able to figure out your root cause. I try and live a healthy lifestyle. Im only 30 go to the gym a couple times a week and a healthy BMI.  I hope it is not anything serious that is causing it. That is the scarier part. \n\nI get by on humor so I appreciate the comment ^_^ maybe i just needed to balance things out Thank you for sharing! You are giving me some much needed hope and inspiration. Question for you how long ago was this? Have you had any other episodes since? Did you are docs ever give you any explanation?\n\nJust curious why some people get it twice so close to each other. Yikes. Sorry you went through that. Did you heal ok? happened almost 2 years ago and im still not 100%. probably 80%. =\\ This was just before Thanksgiving and then just before Christmas this past year. It has not come back for me since. My doctors had no idea why it happened and said that they did not even know what caused it. I was regularly told that they had no explanation for me. It definitely sucks. The whole time I was wondering if I did something to cause it either time, but there really is not anything that they know of. I am in a similar situation as you were. It is been exactly a month since I have been diagnosed with Bell's. I am probably 20% recovered but now I have weakness on the opposite side of my face. I am very stressed. Currently I am waiting to have tests done. Did you have any tests done? Were they able to tell you the root cause? How are you doing now? I am in a similar situation as you were. It is been exactly a month since I have been diagnosed with Bell's. I am probably 20% recovered but now I have weakness on the opposite side of my face. I am very stressed. Currently I am waiting to have tests done. Did you have any tests done? Were they able to tell you the root cause? How are you doing now? I am a month in and 20% recovered but now I have weakness on the opposite side as well. Do you have any updates? How are you feeling today? Did you get tests done? Oh no! You are getting Bell\u2019s on the other side as well? \n\nIm on day 19 and just started to feel some movement yesterday. Definitely starting to see noticeable improvement. I would say in at 10-20%. \n\nThe docs did not recommend any tests. They did consider testing for Lyme disease since it can cause bilateral bp. I am glad you are showing improvement! I am just hoping I do not loose the little bit of progress I made on my first side. Also fingers crossed that the other side is not as bad, I already struggle to eat haha Dude! I have bitten myself soooo much. I really hope you get better. Keep me posted on how you are doing. Well I tested positive for Lyme. I am frustrated that I now have Bell's on both sides but if I did not we probably would not have caught Lyme before it progressed to be more serious. If you spend a lot of time outdoors like me then I would push your doc to do the test too. Was it an expensive test", "Bilateral bells palsy Originally avoided coming on this sub as I did not want to accept how long bells palsy might last or anything like that. But this morning, 2 weeks after my diagnosis for the left side, my right side began to lose muscle function as well and was confirmed this afternoon to be another bells palsy on my right side.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has had/currently has this and how you cope/what additional care you took whilst recovering (such as how you manage to eat)?\n\nIf anyone wants to ask me about my experience with bilateral bells palsy, as it is quite rare, I am happy to answer ( I have an mri tomorrow, cannot say I am not worried Also, the odd thing is one came on, then the other 2 weeks later I had bilateral BP. Both sides of my face experienced paralysis at the same rate/time. I used a straw to drink and held my lips around it. I had to take smaller bites and hold my lips shut while chewing. That Is what I am doing right now, I hate it\n\nI appreciate the advice though It is probably nothing to worry about, but glad you are making sure! Update:\n\nMRI is done and I find out within 10 days whether they find anything\n\nAlso I realised I can put my finger below my bottom lip and manually pronounce my b's m's and p's Can you talk properly? Not really, all the letters are fine except for the plosives (I think they are called that), the b's m's etc, any that need my lips.\n\nWhat i have to do is use a free hand to push my bottom lip shut to pronounce these letters, if I cannot do that I have to try to force my lips shut, often by sucking in causing a bit of a stammer, or just miss out the letter entirely and hope that the message gets across.\n\nMy mouth not working is possibly the hardest part of bilateral palsy for me I only have it on one side. Bilateral seems terrible. Can you blink both your eyes or is it really Severe? It is at first as you get used to what you can and cannot do, it was important for me to preserve energy for the daily tasks I normally find easy, like meal times, as these do become more exhausting\n\nI cannot blink both eyes, but this is both a blessing and a curse. As I cannot blink either of them it is more obvious to my subconscious that my blink reflex has not worked. As a result I have found myself shutting my eyes consciously more often, meaning my left eye which was affected before is now getting moistened a little more.\n\nHowever they still do not shut properly, and so I still have to care for them both, and each eye responds differently for me. My right over waters, so im often having to stop the corner of my eye becoming irritated due to loads of tears, my left dries out so I have to keep putting in eye drops. I also have to put in eye drops at night to help them repair, and tape both eyes shut Can you move your lips at all? Or is both sides like stuck? They move with my jaw but no more than that. So if I open my jaw my lips open, which means when I chew they also open so I have to hold them shut when chewing. Likewise trying to drink something\n\nI cannot smile or purse my lips or anything more than open and shut along with my jaw That must be incredibly frustrating! I am going mad and I only have it on one side hahah Do you have Lyme disease? Or anything that can cause the bilateral palsy? Because it is very rare for both sides I did think the only way my bells palsy could get worse is if the other side went too, be careful what you wish for I guess\n\nHonestly for me getting into the routine of it helped, I always had a straw with me for drinks and eye drops for my eye. Whenever my eye got uncomfortable I would use the drops, and if it was really bad I would tape it up for the day. I also always taped it up before bed.\n\nThe other thing is to try to accept your limitations, what you and your body needs right now is time and rest, realise what you can still do, and what you find difficult and adjust. This is why I am off work, I could maybe have tried to do my job with one side gone, but the stress would have been too much so I got signed off. And likewise I realised that I could not take as big bites of food as I used to I have been staying up playing my playstation for hours \ud83e\udd23 I probably should get some sleep so it can heal Its unlikely I have Lyme disease as I havent been bitten by any ticks, but you are right it is rare. There is a chance its 2 separate causes, an infection on the left and the vaccine on the right (the covid vaccine has a very very very rare chance of causing bells palsy) it could be something worse which is why I had the MRI but until it comes back I simply do not know Me too, its good to distract but remember that screen time dries out eyes, so you have to be extra attentive to your BP eye, and take more regular breaks, even if its just to get a drink Yeah. It is 1:23 am here as well \ud83d\ude02 I am in Ireland and I have never seen somebody else with bp. Do you ever feel embarrassed? I am staying inside loads now since I got it Yeah, I am in the UK. Masks help, but most people do not actually care. I am also trans so I learned a while ago how to deal with those feelings.\n\nIf you are on steroids (like prednislone) they impact you are immune system so its important to stay home as much as possible during the pandemic Yeah, I have only been going out for shopping really I just wanted to comment and let you know that you are definitely not alone! I was diagnosed on the left side of my face in August 2019 and almost four weeks ago now on my right side. My left side took four months to heal and I ended up with synkinesis, while my right side has already healed perfectly and completely, well within three weeks. My neurologist also referred me to get an MRI, and I did so about two weeks ago; I struggle with anxiety, and was extremely panicked about the situation as I am sure you are to some extent. Though our situations are obviously not the same as your diagnoses are more concurrent, my MRI result came back clean the next day, and I have confidence yours will as well! My regular doctor told me that anything in the brain big enough to cause paralysis on both sides of the face would likely be extremely uncomfortable for you and you would be experiencing more concerning neurological symptoms than just the paralysis, so I hope all this will allow you to rest easy for now. How did the symptoms for your other side come about? Do not know yet, still not heard back. It could be from the Pfizer vaccine I had as it is listed as a very very rare side effect, could be im just unlucky No as in, did you get an earache or anything? \n\nI am 2 months in, 95% recovered and I am a bit paranoid. I have an earache on the opposite side and my anxiety is killing me Ahhh, I get you\n\nIt was exactly the same as my left. I began to feel a tingling in the corner of my right eye which spread across my face, followed by a reduction in muscle movement until I could not move at all\n\nThe tingling was my warning sign Okay thank u!! No problem, hope the earache gets better soon! Can I ask how the recovery started for you? I have begun to have random twitching every now and again, but do not want to get prematurely excited Yep sure!! \n\nI started with alot of twitching in my eye area then about 2 weeks later my blinking came back. The next thing was my smile, it was slowly coming. \n\nThe next was my eyebrows and then my nose lastly. The only thing that still needs to come back is my pucker which is 95% back. Twitching was the one thing that got me so happy because I knew my nerves were regenerating!! So twitching was good for me, and it is for most people! I hope you recover soon and feel free to message me about anything!! \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\u2764\u2764 Thank you, that does make me feel better\n\nAnd I may just do that when recovery really gets going \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\u2764 Heya turns out I have a got a bloody tooth infection \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f hence why my ear was killing me LOOOL Yeah, i know from personal experience that with anxiety its easy to presume the worst, I am glad its not bells palsy again, I hope the tooth heals quick", "Face twitching, good? I was diagnosed with bell's palsy yesterday. Doctor put me on Steroids, antivirals, and eye gel with eye patch for nights. My question is, I have been doing the face massages thought the day and Ive noticed certain parts of my face start to twitch. Is this goood or bad? Let your face rest for awhile. Your facial nerve is damaged and you have to be easy with it so it can heal. It heals just millimeters a day but the rest is just as important as the exercises and massages. Ok, thank you. zinc is also antiviral and over the counter and safe Thank you, I bought Zinc, B Complex, Ginger Root, Tumeric, Omegas. I also went to get acupuncture. I can chew and talk. My eye still does not close, but it is been twitching non stop. Fingers crossed.", "It is my Official One Year and I did a side by side. One if the photos is flipped. The day before, the night of diagnosis, and today.  Thanks for sharing this, EricaM13. I know it is not easy.\n\nIf you do not mind answering: are you still doing any therapies/exercises/treatments? Or after a year is it kind of a 'it would be nice if it works itself out, but I need to get on with my life' sort of thing?\n\nWhat were the most recent things you did (do?) in that regard?\n\nHow has your functionality changed over the past few months?\n\nFrom the pics it looks like you have regained some (admittedly small) amount of control: your eye closes more, your cheek responds a little better to smiling (a more defined nasolabial fold on the affected side). (I suppose those could both be due to synkinesis - is that still a problem?)\n\nWhen I was dealing with BP it was the little gains - so subtle that I could see them, even when others could not - that eventually added up to something useful. But I was working on it all day every day, and you probably have a life, so YMMV. And everyone has a unique experience; the most pronounced common factor being that everyone agrees this sucks.\n\nSorry for the barrage of questions, I have been mostly AFK (dealing with my spinal cord problem, *yay*) for about a month.", "Question I have had Bell\u2019s palsy for about 9 days now. I am recovering pretty good. I could\nMove my eyebrow a bit and move my cheek a slight bit. But now I am getting bad ear pains and burning scalp pains on my head on just one spot on the affected spot. Is this a normal symptom? Anyone else experience this? I had some wicked ear pain, and some in my jaw and neck. It was awhile ago, but I feel like that was about the halfway mark to my recovery (total a bit over a month). By the end, I got a horrendous ear infection out of the blue (so more antibiotics); definitely keep an eye on it.\n\nHope you feel better. Yes headaches and pain behind the ear of the affected side are normal. I am on day 10 and am experiencing something similar.  I get an ache at the base of my jaw and then a pain around the back and over my ear on the side that is affected by Bell's palsy.  \nI had a follow up with my Dr. yesterday and told him what I was experiencing and how I was dealing and he said it was normal and what I was doing was totally fine.\nI had been self treating it with a cold compress.  My wife got me a simple freezable eye mask with an elastic strap that I have been freezing then targeting it on the spots that hurt when they flare up. Something like (\nThat is my experience, but definitely check with your Dr.", "Diagnosed with Bells today After a night of sweating, chest pains, back pains, and my stomach feeling tender, I wake up with my lip being swollen and itchy. Thought it was an allergic reaction at first even tho I am not allergic to anything, and just took some medicine and out it off. But after a while and it just got worse and my face was red I got it checked out. They diagnosed me with bells and I was horrified. I know this is very surface but it made me feel really insecure with how I look and do not know how to overcome that. I am glad for masks and I can wear that during class but otherwise if I am around new people I feel like they are just staring. It is all new to me and still has not completely registered. They said 3-4 weeks until improvement otherwise if steroids do not work I need physical therapy and can take up to 6 months. I just feel unattractive and thinking of the worse. This was just a rant and just wanted to know how others have dealt with it?", "Eye Protection How can I protect my affected eye from infection? I thought about wearing an eye patch  but wont it make people think that I am over reacting or I am over the top? It will only get infected if you get bacteria in it.  You will be touching your eyelid often, so make sure your hands are clean.   Otherwise you should not have to worry about eye INFECTION too much.  Eye patch will keep it from getting dusty and dry.  I personally just used my fingers to \"blink\" during the day, used a ton of artificial tears, and then taped it shut at night.  I wore sunglasses that had a foam seal around the edge when outside. The worry is about the eye getting too dry and causing permanent damage to your cornea.\nI wear glasses so my struggle was finding a way to patch left eye and still use glasses for right eye. I would put gel or ointment in eye then tape shut. Then put a little bit of cotton on top. Then tape a patch on top. I found that the cotton helped the eye stay shut.\nI found that when I did not tape eye shut, my good side would try to overcompensate and I would get tired fast. (good side trying to stay open and bad side unable to close when good side was open) Taping bad eye shut made it easier to get through the day. I did not like the eye sticker patch without taping eye shut. I used to wear an eye patch at night when I went to sleep and would keep a bottle of artificial tears in my pocket during the day. As long as you are good about using then frequently you should not need the eye patch on all day.", "I do not want to feel this way I am being induced into labor in 4 days. \nLast night my eye was bothering me I thought it was my contact or makeup but it was nothing like I have ever experienced. Noticed my eye was not closing all the way. This morning I could not smile and it is only gotten worse. I had a really beautiful smile that I feel like I totally took for granted. I hate how I look. How can I take pictures of my son minimizing the visibility of this condition? Congrats and best wishes on the new baby! Do not worry about pics. Your face will be the last thing on your mind when the baby gets here. Have you officially been diagnosed? It happened to me when I was 34 weeks pregnant with my 3rd. Most important thing is to get to the doctor and get meds ASAP. Meds are fine when pregnant and increase chance of it going away. Tape your eye shut at night. And get as much rest as possible (I know it is hard with a newborn). \n\nPhotographers can work with you on poses and angles that make you feel good. Most people resolve within a few months and you can do lots of pictures then. Try to focus on your baby - they are worth it. Yes The good news is catching it early will help you recover more quickly and more fully. By the time you are ready for full blown family pics, like the newborn pics etc. you might be fully recovered if not very close. I was diagnosed two weeks prior to our wedding day. I was probably 50% better by then and fully recovered in 6 weeks. My wife and I had our daughter in April and my niece just had her son yesterday. Also, the hospital pics are not the ones where the parents want to look their best; they are the ones in which you are still being worked on while they put baby on your chest for skin to skin and you and dad are crying, and then you are back in your room taking pics of the first outfit etc. I am sure you will be a beautiful family with beautiful pics and you will be ready for those professional newborn pics in a months time. Again, congrats! Thank you very much- how bad was yours? When I was googling it I saw extreme cases are when you cannot blink and that was the first thing that happened to me so I am a little bit worried It was bad enough that I thought I had a mini-stroke. I went to work anyway because my boss was a volunteer EMT/Fireman so I let him check me out with the stroke test. The entire left side of my face was paralyzed. I noticed it felt weird as I was getting ready for work, but just thought I slept wrong or something. Then when I went to brush my teeth that is when I realized something was very wrong because toothpaste just poured out and I could not close my mouth on the left side nor could I smile at all. I remember my eye was watery but I cannot remember if I had a hard time blinking/closing my eye. I do remember not being able to scrunch my face up, like it was just completely deadened. \n\nFunny thing is it happened on a Friday and Saturday we visited my step sister whom I would not seen for about a decade and she had it years earlier as well. That is why she mentioned it as we said our goodbyes and she instructed me to go to the doctor ASAP so I went that next morning, which was two days later. I am so sorry you are going through this nightmare! And so soon before bringing your beautiful son into the world. Hoping that it is not weighing you down too much. Know that it is really normal if you are feeling down by it! For me:   \n1) It got worse before it got better  \n2) I hated not being able to smile (I smile a lot!)   \n3) It took the better half of a week to start feeling good again \n\nThese words might ring hollow for a while, but you will get through this. Take each day as it comes, your beautiful smile should come back soon!", "New Diagnosis Lifestyle Tips Anyone out there have tips or things they discovered that made their lives easier while dealing with this? I just got stricken 4 days ago and I am still reeling a bit. I got fun colored eye patches but somehow that does not make me feel less embarrassed in public.\n\nI am grateful this community exists! I chose not to wear a patch indoors.  I worked face-to-face with customers (pre-covid of course).  Put in high quality eye drops constantly and used my fingers to blink.  Outdoors I either wore a patch, or a pair of 3m tinted safety glasses that have a foam seal (they look pretty close to regular sunglasses).  Wear eye ointment and tape it shut at night.\n\nYou can use your finger to help your cheek and lips move correctly when speaking, so you can sound normal.  Works fine on the phone, of course.  \n\nSleep as much as possible, take your medicine.  I recommend against massage unless it is very light.  Just my own experience.\n\nEdit: chin up! Odds are you will be back to normal in no time. This just happened to me last Saturday.  I emphasize with you \u2764 Buy some straws ;) Chew a piece of gum and hold it between your cheek and gums on the affected side. It helped me with P, B and F for some reason. \n\nJust make light of it. Search around for my posts on this page, you will see what i mean. Thanks! what is the brand of eyedrops you use? I was told to go with the \"Tears\" kind but it was hard to choose among the zillion options at the store. Also, for sleeping a lot, do you mean to take frequent naps? Ah man, it is crazy how this can just happen out of no where. I hope you are feeling alright! I used TheraTears Extra.  There is also more of a gel-kind in a blue bottle that I liked, but its name is escaping me at the moment.  But TheraTears Extra was in my pocket 12 hours a day.\n\nYeah, just naps and stuff.  I always felt my best right after waking up, whether that was in the morning or after a 5 to 10 minute nap. That is not a bad idea lol. In the initial onset I was wondering why the hell I kept squirting water out of my mouth on a big gulp like some fish water fountain lol That is clever, I will have to give it a go. I have a full day of meetings tomorrow and did not deliver my best work product last week \ud83d\ude2c I am going to have to get over my hatred of napping lol. And thanks for the tips!! On day 4 I was on a phone conference and realized a few minutes into explaining something and I realized I was having a hell of a time with the word \"wall\" and just made light of it. I broke character for a second and was like \"jeez, my face learned a new trick the other day where it is paralyzed on the left side and I am having a hell of a time saying the word wall, so bear with me\" I spent the first week laughing so hard about my BP that I swear it got the muscles jumpstarted to work again \ud83e\udd23. Speedy recovery \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f I wish the same for you, my friend.  Let us stay in touch and console each other. And, yes. It was a surprise out of the blue for me as well. \u2764\ufe0f laughter is a powerful medicine lol Hey friend! I hope being 13 days in, you are a little more hopeful. I also had a fun eye-patch! It took me two weeks to feel less embarassed - I wrote a guide that might be helpful for you and any of your loved ones! Best of luck. Hope you are feeling a little more like you. \n\n( Hey! Definitely more hopeful, though today is not great as I have slid back from 30% to 0%, but my doctor says that is still \"normal\" within the first few weeks. Great article! I think that will really help people who are encountering this for the first time. And I am glad to read that you are almost all the way recovered!! Ah it sucks when it slides back! How are you going now? I had a small setback two weeks ago (related to RHS and not Bell's Palsy) and it is really hard to go back and forth on the yo-yo. Hoping that this will be over for you soon! Yeah going back and forth takes a toll! I am very slowly building back up so that is good, though it is far slower than before. And same, hope it is all behind you soon! You got this! Slow and steady wins the race :) The amount of patience that is built with experiencing this is unbelievable and I really think it will help us in the long run!", "Head pain persistenting Hey all\nI contracted BP back in March, and recovered to 95% by about end of May. However, I still cute acute inner and outer ear aches and dry eyes. Has anyone else that is mostly recovered had lingering effects like this? Yes!  When I get stressed or cold, I have eye tics and it feels like someone is pinching the edge of my ear.  Occasionally I will have nerve pain on my head in the area between my ear and the back of my head.  I also have dry eye in the winter when the furnace kicks on.  I keep a little humidifier in my office and it helps. I was diagnosed about 5 weeks ago and the facial paralysis is pretty much completely gone, but the headaches and ear pain are off the charts. I have not been able to wear my glasses on a month and cannot continue this way. I have got an appointment this evening for an eye exam so I can get contacts.\n\nI thought the drooling was annoying, but it is got nothing on not being able to see due to pain from wearing glasses.\n\nHope everything works out for you. Same. I also wear hearing aids. Add a mask, and it is pure hell. The contacts help. I was worried I would not be able to wear them because of the eye/head pain, but so far so good. I am at week 4. About 90-95 % recovered, but still get head and neck pain, and bad headaches.  Hopefully it gets better for all of us\u2026", "Bells Palsy Day 16 ***UPDATE** ", "Bell's Palsy for the second time! OK. So.. I just got my second onset of BP about a week and a half ago. It was quite difficult for me considering I got the first onset around early March this year and I developed some synkinesis (my eye twitches when I move my mouth).  Docs have outruled anything neurological and well basically it is stress related. \n\nThe first time was on the right side and now it is on the left side. I felt the pains behind my ear a day before and went to the doctor mainly because I was familiar and somehow knew it was going to happen and I guess I got there early because it was not until the next day that I got droopy. This time around I am recovering so much quicker. \nTbh, I felt like giving up the first two days because I do not think anyone expects this to happen to them twice, let alone months apart. You know, the typical \"Why me?\"  I just want to let anyone out there not to give up, it may take some time and a lot work but if you went through it once, you can do it again.  ", "Bell\u2019s Palsy: The Mysterious Syndrome You Need To Know about ", "Recently Diagnosed Friday I woke up with the right side of my face being number and droopy. Went to the ED and was diagnosed with Bells after ruling out a stroke. Today I woke up and severe vertigo and  hearing a swhoosing in my ear followed by nausea and vomiting. I had the flu last Friday\u2019s be have been recovering with a lot of congestion \n\nThursday night I decided to do a Neti pot to try and help with the congestion. I boiled well water but only for 10-15 seconds and turned off the stove. I then then performed the Neti on both nostrils. My question is could this Bells have been caused by not boiling the water? My left side is fine and only right is impacted. I guess I do not want this to be anything else like some brain amoeba. Thank you in advance.", "Could it be the start of Bell\u2019s palsy? For the last hour my lips have been numb and now it is getting harder to move the right side of my face. And my eye keeps twitching uncontrollably Potentially. I would still call your emergency services just for peace of mind. Catching it early is key to recovery! Keep us updated and fingers crossed you are okay! Yes. I would suggest going into get a diagnosis ASAP That is exactly how mine started, twitching eye and lip and my affected side was moving slightly less than my normal side. Woke up the next day and affected side was almost completely paralyzed. Numb is not the same as paralyzed.  \n\n\nParalyzed: unable to move  \n\n\nNumb: Unable to feel  \n\n\nusually, numbness in lips is not a symptom of BP, however having a hard time moving the rest of your face sounds like it could be the onset of BP, or something worse. I hope you have taken the advice from the other people who commented and have called or gone to see a medical professional. Because of covid I am only going In to the doctors now. I cannot raise my eyebrow really now, they said it seems like Bell\u2019s palsy on the phone. But they also said that numbness is not common like you said It is how mine came on as well. I had pins and needles and numbness leading up to the paralysis. It was bp. I cannot raise my eyebrow at all now and my smile is maybe 5% of what it was on the right side. Nearly impossible to move it I got bell's palsy about 2 weeks ago and I had numbness in my lip prior too also. Not sure why Hang in there, the first two weeks are the worst, but it will get better again. Did they give you steroids? They asked me if I wanted them but they said no because they told me that there is no proof they help It is true that they do not make a difference for everyone, but most studies agree that outcomes are ~15% better if steroid treatment is started within 72 hours of onset.\n\nIt depends on the cause, though. Mine was of viral origin and I had heavy swelling in the area. Steroids immediately reversed the swelling and prevented further damage to the nerve. If there is no inflammation near your nerve, it may not matter.\n\n(\n\n( Thanks, I will go back Tommorow and get some. It is 10pm here so a little late to go to the doctors again Start an antiviral and steroid rx asap, do you feel a pain behind the ear as well? I am on my 5th day now. I have a constant earache and my jaw occasionally hurts Possibly a viral infection, ask your doctor about antiviral and steroid combination therapy if not already given. He offered me steroids but i said no because he told me there is no proof they work, but I am going back today to get them just in case they help them There are several trials conducted which have shown steroid and antiviral treatment significantly improves recoverytime. Same here. Antivirals in there own seem to have no effect, but the combination of steroid and antiviral together does seem to help. Something like 80% of the time things clear up on their own anyway, but I can tell you that I personally have a lifetime of falling into the minority did not-heal-up-the-way-we-expected groups. Do not take the chance. Get a referral and immediately go see an ENT or neurologist who \u201cspecializes\u201d in Bell\u2019s Palsy/facial nerve paralysis. I never want to here a doctor say \u201cIf you would only come see me a month ago.\u201d", "In the early stages Hey folks, just got the diagnosis yesterday and figured I would come here for some support and to share my story. Sunday May 10th the twitching started in my right eyelid and I assumed I was just tired and didnt think much of it. Since then its spread through the rest of the right side of my face. I have muscle weakness by my eye and bottom lip and its causing issues with my vision.\nBecause my vision is really bad lately they have put me off work for the next month and they will see how I am doing then. I also have an MRI scheduled for Monday after having a CT and bloodwork done this past Thursday.\nI will be honest, I feel really anxious and overwhelmed by all this. This isnt the first time I have had a health issue pop up out of no where and change my life (I also have endometriosis) but it is so different this time. The doctors all want me to come in asap and are doing so much testing which helps me feel reassured that were doing all we can.\nI am not sure what to expect in the future but I am glad I have a month off work to rest and figure out what my new normal may look like. I am open to any suggestions and advice \ud83d\ude0a I had issues blinking fully on my own so I was recommended to keep it taped shut and use eye drops A LOT. You risk drying your eyes out and that is no good!\n\nI made myself a lot of soups cause I found them easier to eat. And drank everything through either a straw or even better, I got one of those water bottles with the \u201csuck\u201d nozzle???? Idk how to explain it but I was able to stick it in my good side and not make a mess lol!\n\nI have said this before, I used a jade roller on my face when I was just on the couch chilling and I really feel like it helped me. \n\nGood luck and hope you have a speedy recovery! It is hard to be patient, but it does get better. My one regret was chewing gum during my healing period. I think it contributed to the miswiring of my nerve and I got synkinesia. \n\nI had a partial recovery, but the change was still dramatic. For me, it took 4 months before any change, which was unusually long. But one day, my mouth moved the tiniest bit. It was amazing. \n\nI am glad you are getting prompt care. Best wishes for your recovery. Hi there, I love to see your optimism. I am a student nurse and would like to touch on a few things about this diagnosis. Bell's palsy, also known as acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause, can occur at any age. The exact cause is unknown. It is believed to be the result of swelling and inflammation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of your face, the 7th cranial nerve aka the facial nerve. It might also be a reaction that occurs after a viral infection.\n\nsigns and symptoms include - \n\n* Rapid onset of mild weakness to total paralysis on one side of your face \u2014 occurring within hours to days\n* Facial droop and difficulty making facial expressions, such as closing your eye or smiling\n* Drooling\n* Pain around the jaw or in or behind your ear on the affected side\n* Increased sensitivity to sound on the affected side\n* Headache\n* A loss of taste\n* Changes in the amount of tears and saliva you produce\n\nRisk factors include people that - \n\n* Are pregnant, especially during the third trimester, or who are in the first week after giving birth\n* Have an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold\n* Have diabetes", "This this Bell's Palsy or am I just seeing things? In the past 12 months I have noticed my face is sagging on the left hand side.  My lips are drooping (I feel noticeably), there is a little bit of a change in the shape of my eye (not pictured as not as noticeable) and what I would consider drooping on my jawline as well.  \n\nI have asked my family and a number of friends and they assure me my face is symmetrical however I am worried they are just being nice.  I realise it is minimal but wondering if this is something I should get checked out?  If so, likely the doctors in my area will blow me off / tell me not to worry about it so wondering what I should ask for (ie specialist, next steps, etc?).\n\nI can still smile however (I feel) it is still noticeable when I am smiling.\n\nNote:  I know my nose is crooked - and I am completely cool with that :)\n\n TL;DR:  Is my face crooked?", "Tarsorrhaphy Anyone else had this procedure done?  I just had a temporary tarsorrhaphy done today, both corners sutured.  The injections to numb the eye were horrible, extremely painful.  The sutures were no big deal.  Now that the numbness is wearing off, having very intense pain.  I am just hopeful that this is worth it and will allow me to be more comfortable for the next few weeks until I get my function back?  Right this moment, I am definitely regretting having the procedure done because I am in so much post-op pain.", "BP and Hearing Loss? I was diagnosed with BP about a week ago (7/14) after getting the typical symptoms of facial weakness on one side with some double vision. However, I had also been experiencing muffled hearing on my effected side about 2 weeks prior to my diagnosis. Has this happened to anyone else or have you had other symptoms outside of the standard facial weakness? I had hearing loss (about 60% gone in left ear) and tinnitus as well as intermittent vertigo. All ear symptoms went away after about a month. That is about the hearing loss that I have too. These symptoms are so weird. Thanks for sharing and glad that you made a full recovery! I got (and still get) kind of a \"fluttering\" sound/sensation in that ear.  And terrible pain at only certain loud sounds.  Stacking dishes in the cabinet, my dog barking indoors.  Both of those sounds caused me physical pain.\n\nNot quite deafness though.  I bet you will get it all back! Thanks. :) The ear made a full recovery. The face is likely permanently stuck at 95% with some very mild synkinesis. I cannot complain, no one but me notices. Lost the ability to whistle, but that is a small sacrifice. \n\nThings will get better! Just takes a lot of patience, but you have got this. Ahh I see, well sorry it was not 100% for you but that is awesome to hear that it was pretty close. I am sure anything is better than full blown BP symptoms. Thanks again for the words of encouragement :) \n\nAlso your art is amazing!! I get the same thing with my hearing it seems to react different to louder sounds. Super annoying but comforting to know I am not alone with that one. Thanks for sharing :) I also had some hearing loss in my affected side before my diagnosis. I also ended up having an ear infection which was probably what ended up causing the inflammation on the facial nerve and therefore giving me BP.\n\nThe hearing loss went away after about 3-4 weeks after my diagnosis. I am currently recovering from BP (Mar 19th, third time for those that are counting, 2x right (2011, 2017), 1x left (current)).\n\nI would say I am about 35% recovered with more hopefully on the way.\n\nStarting about 6 weeks ago I noticed what could be called a ringing sensation in the ear on my affected side.  It then progressed into what you described as \"muffled\".  Not real loss of hearing, but more like the ear is trying to send too much data down the wire and some of the true signal is lost.  Each day is a little different, some good, some bad with respect to the hearing issue.  I would say that it makes my hear feel \"unbalanced\" when compared to the right ear.  \n\nI have noticed an overall improvement in hearing of the left ear with the passage of time. I am hoping with more time, along with the healing of the rest of the left side my of face, that most of the hearing issue will resolve itself.", "Feeling unwell Hi all, just reaching out.\n\nI am almost 2 weeks since diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy. Finished my steroids and I feel AWFUL. Headaches, pressure and stabbing. Feeling sick. Face feels tender. Do not like feeling like this, is it normal ? I hope I feel normal again soon The week after I finished my steroids was absolutely horrible. I was so rundown, I literally fell asleep in my car in the car park after I would been shopping. Stay positive mate, it will get better \ud83d\udc4d The days after I finished my steroids was the worst. I also had tenderness and stabbing ear pain for about a week after I finished my meds. Stay strong! I ended up taking ibuprofen for a few days after the steroids just to sleep through the pain.  It got better eventually.", "Day 6. Of facial nerve simulation.Feeling alot better. Will post a video later today. Guys, its a request.. If its your initial days, do consult a MD or neurologist.. Take meds and go for facial nerve simulation therapy. And always remmber, you are stronger than you think you are.  I was told stim was counterintuitive and could lead to synkinesis. I am 18 days and 80% recovered with just antivirals, prednisone, b12 and multivitamins \ud83d\udc4c Buyer Beware.... that is all I have to say. \n\nElectric stimulation may work for some, but it can also do more harm than good. \n\nHopefully it works for you, OP! Same. I also swear by CBD oil. I took it around week 3 and within 15 minutes could feel my nerves twitching in my effected side. But I also used everything you listed also, so who knows!", "Just discharged from hospital. Here is my situation and some questions Saturday I woke up with numbness in my left side of my face, and numbness in my right eye. The muscles around the left side of my mouth felt like I just came out of anesthesia. Decided it was not something to worry about, so I took the family to the zoo and set up a video consultation for the next day with my GP. \n\nThe next day the GP told me to go to the accident and emergency ward immediately at my local hospital. They triaged me and excluded stroke, but I had a battery of blood tests, xrays and CT scans. I stayed there the night, was given steroids (prednisolone), 60mg for 6 days and discharged. \n\nSo 3 days later its a little worse, and I am still trying to figure out why i have this numbness in my left side of my mouth, while I cant lift a smile on the right side. My right side eye can close about 60%, and I can get it closed if i shut both eyes down hard. My tongue has weird sensation - I can taste but food feels \u2018smooth\u2019, like textureless. Loud noises hurt alot. \n\nThey gave me exercises to do like blowing a balloon and doing some massages. The balloon thing feels like it can really help if I keep at it regularly. I also got 1000mg B12 from a suggestion I read here. \n\nI am feeling positive right now but I have ups and downs. This morning I had crazy anxiety. Also worth mentioning that 400mg ibuprofen really helps my face feel more normal so I take it in the morning to set a good mood. \n\nHas anyone else experienced a mix of loss of sensation from both sides of the face/mouth? Its really confusing. Another thing worth mentioning is that I had a cold a week ago, so I think that might be the upper respiratory infection that triggered it, which seems typical from what I have read. I also recall having a spasm in my neck under my jaw the day before, but I am not sure if its related. All your symptoms are the same symptoms I had. The tongue feeling strange, not being able to shut my right eye, etc. \n\nI was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy January 25th and have not had any progress at all since. \n\nBut most people recover in 3-5 weeks. Just take the steroids and the B12. \n\nDo not try to exercise too hard in the first couple days. Just rest as much as you can. Good luck! It is a little strange that you felt numbness on the left side of your face and your right eye. Usually it is just one side for everything.\n\n\nMy doc told me to go easy on the ibuprofen when mixing it with prednisone. Apparently it can cause peptic ulcers. Could end up being Melkersson-Rosenthal.\n\n That is weird the numbness is on the left and right but losing control is on the right only. Have you considered seeking a second opinion from another GP? \n\nLoud noises definitely affect my BP side, it is more pronounced when I am close to the cause of the noise. It does sound like BP to me. I have tried to avoid painkillers as much as I can (personal choice with no rational explanation) and found that voltaren with topical CBD oil/balm helps with the pain - in case you would like to try that. :)", "Quick question about vaccines Hello,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been diagnosed with Bell's Palsy on the 9th of June. It is gotten a lot better until now, still have issues blinking, there is a little stiffness in the cheek and also I cannot fully open my mouth. It is not that noticeable, but as you can imagine, I can see it.\n\nThe thing is that I would like to get vaccinated against Covid. I saw the list of possible adverse effects on some of the available vaccines in my country and it is like all of them have Bell's Palsy as a possible side effect (a chance of 1 in 1000, but that seems like a lot in my mind now that I already had it). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid you guys got vaccinated after getting better from Bell's Palsy? Or did you guys talked to a doctor or have any info regarding this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot in advance. I have had bells twice, did the same research and decided to get the vaccine.  No proof of the connection, but I developed severe nerve pain down the length of one arm (not the injected arm which is very slowly resolving itself.  Now they are saying that\nGuillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a risk. I got vaccinated mid December 2020 with the 2nd shot in January. No adverse effects besides a sore arm for a few days. I got diagnosed with bells palsy July 1st. I was sick the week before so for me there is no connection. Oh, I see. Then I guess it is what it is. Anything should be better than catching Covid. Where is the list where it says bp is a possible side effect of the vaccine? I found it on the vaccination platform in my country (it is not in english however, but you can find it ( ( you can see that cases of Bell's Palsy were reported following vaccination. The cdc link goes on to say they have not concluded and do not consider vaccine causes bp There are studies that clearly suggest a link between vaccines and bell's palsy. If you know anything about the scientific process is that causality is hard to officially determine unless the vaccine is wreaking havoc among people. So this becomes just a technicality. \n\nYou removed my post regarding this issue but this subreddit should be a safe space to talk about these stuff. People like me are genuinely worried and just because CDC said that it will not stop someone from getting Bell's Palsy. Stop being authoritarian! I got it when I was younger after getting flu vaccine. My dad has had it 3 times and got it every time after getting a vaccine\u2026", "I can taste!

I am three weeks today and last night I was like, \u201cwait a minute, I can taste this!\u201d \n\nIt comes back so gradually that you probably will not pinpoint the exact moment, but it is a GOOD feeling to have some kind of change. That is a great feeling or sensation when your taste buds return! Congrats!", "First Real Flair Up in Over Ten Years ", "Bell\u2019s Palsy Symptoms, Causes &amp; Treatment ", "So I was diagnosed 2 days ago and I have a question. How do you drink? I cannot get a good lock around anything I drink out of water bottle, straw, or cup. I usually drink around a gallon of water a day. But the last couple of days I just have not been able to drink without making a mess. This has gone very quickly from scary as hell to aggravating very fast.  So any recommendations would be helpful. Yes\u2026 the struggle is real. I also drink a lot of water. For me, throughout the days I learned the following tricks:\n- I tried to incline my head upwards while drinking. Just a little bit, so that gravity helps.\n- It also works if you incline your heads towards your good side.\n- Put the bottle or the glass in the affected side, so that the good side can hold the water without spilling.\n- Finally, I realized I made a mess because I usually put a lot of water in my mouth and then I swallow in bits. This will not work with BP. I learned to swallow as the water enters the mouth so the lips do not need to hold any water in. It was uncomfortable at first but this was the only way I could drink the same amount of water through the day.\n\nAnd yes, straws never worked for me either.\n\nI hope it is clear, English is not my first language.\n\nBe patient, you will get better :) I was fully recovered by week 4. Thank you! I will try these. I am hopeful for a quick recovery myself fingers crossed When I drink I try position and press down the bottle/mug on the affected side/lip as I am unable to create tension with the mouth myself. Slowly, and with dribbles. These seemed to help a little thanks yall. I just have to remember to drink more frequently I think. I used to pound a bottle or 2 at a time. Now I have to sip throughout the day. I was officially diagnosed on oct 26. My Simptkms were showing since the 24 but ignored it. I recommend staying away from drinking out of a straw until the swelling goes down. It is more of a struggle forcing yourself to do normal things during the process. It will tire you out. Especially eating. It was the worst. It took me 2 weeks for the swelling to go down. It was best for me to drink sips out of a cup ir water bottle due to not making a mess. It was easier with a water bottle. After taking a sip id pull the bottom of my lip shut to not make a mess. Always keep napkins around while eating or drinking. And do not rush take your time eating and drinking as it gets very tiring adjusting to how to eat all over again. After the swelling goes down I was able to drink out of those silicone straws because I squished my lips shut in the paralyzed side. And only then I was able to chug a lot of water. Please stay hydrated as it is easier to drink liquids as it is to eat.", "Bells Palsy headaches Hi all, \n\n7 days ago I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy and as you all know it is really shitty to deal with.. I have asked all my questions to my doctor and reading through the threats in this group has helped me a lot as well. Nevertheless I am still struggling with one thing and I am hoping someone might have an answer. I keep having these horrible strikes of headaches lasting for hours, as if I can feel the virus is active. Paracetamol is not working at all. Any tips? It is just like any other injury. The nerve must repair itself and it does hurt quite a bit. Try to relax and meditate there is an app on IG called headspace. I tried it and it helped a bit. Good luck feel better soon. Thanks. I will check it out for sure :) I am sorry, I do not have an answer for you.  I had a really bad headache leading up to my diagnosis, then it kind of subsided while the other symptoms kicked in.\n\nThen I had a \\*different\\* kind of headache for a while (off and on for several days) but I am fairly certain that was from the prednisone. Hard to explain, but there were times when I just felt like my entire head was under about 12 feet of water, along with the headache pain.  \n\nI took ibuprofen and that seemed to help. I found that heat was sometimes helpful. Also ibuprofen can be taken with paracetamol and they work well together because they use different pathways to alleviate pain. Gentle massage can also sometimes help, even if it is very painful to do it. Best of luck to you. I had terrible headaches during the first month of my diagnosis as well.  I wish I had a great answer for you! I know I took as much pain meds as possible...ibproufin and acetaminophen. Since I was taking a lot of medications I made sure to eat/drink foods that we are beneficial for my liver and kidneys. I also used heat and kept the lights low/curtains closed all the time. I am so sorry you are dealing with this right now. Hang in there! Headaches likely caused by inflammation around facial nerve in brain. Ramsay Hint considered more painful than bells.\n\nAre you experiencing blisters/itchiness, ear ringing,  vertigo or noise sensitivity? \n\nIf so, may be Ramsay hunt and may need antivirals.

It is been 20 years so I do not think it is going to ever look like it used to.\n\nHowever I have come to terms with my perfectly asymmetrical, very unique pucker \ud83d\udc8b Can u explain a bit more, like what is not there for u? I got a lot of movement back but for whatever reason, the nerve attached to the top of my lip on my affected side did not grow back, so there is really no movement / wrinkles there when I try to pucker. \n\nCombined with the synkinesis I have, the more I try to push the corner of my mouth into a pucker, the more my eye closes. So in order to keep my eye open, I do not try to pucker too hard normally. Oh I do not have synkensis thank god, I am on month 1 and 22 days  and I have around 85% control over the other side of my lip do you think my pucker will come back? It is just a bit demotivating hearing other people's experiences about not getting movement back Please remember that 95% of cases heal fully in 6 months or less. Theres a 5% of us that do not heal fully and have visible BP and synkinesis for the rest of our lives. \n\nThe chances of you healing and being \u201cnormal\u201d again are high. Those of us in the 5% have accepted this is our life and we dont want our experiences to be a factor that scares or stresses people out over their own recovery. \n\nBe gentle with yourself, let your face heal.

I am just waiting for this to come back and it is stressing me out.\n\nI do facial massages.\n\nI started healing at like 3 weeks in, so I guess that is good?? I just cannot wait to get over this, it is a bit annoying.", "48 hour treatment delay? Sertraline connection? My question is: how did you know you had it?  I started getting symptoms I think on tuesday of this past week.  No \"paralysis\" per se, but just did not feel well.  When I could not spit my toothpaste out correctly on Wednesday morning, I was unnerved.  As my eye burned throughout the day I got really nervous, but did not think I was having a stroke or anything.  As I was getting ready for bed that night I realized my eye was not blinking.  Thursday morning all was the same, so I was off to the ER, where, after ruling out stroke with a battery of bloodwork, scans, and tests, they shot me full of steroids and sent me out the door with a prescription for prednisone and a BP diagnosis.  \nI am hoping my delay is not detrimental to healing... any word on that?  It was partially denial, and partially fear that kept me from racing off sooner.  \nI am trying to ignore it, and sift through all the experiences on here to make sound decisions, but it is certainly nervewracking.  \n\nHas anyone else read anything about a connection between BP and sertraline (Zoloft)? Ps, thank you to whomever started this thread.  I really need this space! Have not read anything about a connection between Zoloft and BP! I was on Zoloft for about 2 years and no problem. Switched to Lexapro about a year ago, and actually had my dose upped from 10mg to 15mg 2 days before I got BP. Wondered if there was a connection. I did find a case study about one side facial spasms and Lexapro. But not paralysis or weakness. I had cold sores on my tongue the week before that were awful, and the doctor said the BP was clearly triggered by that virus. I completely understand how you are feeling, it is been emotionally and mentally exhausting. I thought I was having a stroke at first and had several full blown panic attacks. Would wake up in the middle of the night panicking. My symptoms started last Saturday afternoon, and I did not go to the doctor until Monday morning (because I knew enough to know it was not a stroke and I was not having any other symptoms... did not want the drama and expense of the ER). But I just finished my 5 days of steroids and have already seen noticeable improvement. Hang in there! Let me know if you have any questions. You will be okay. You are stronger than you know! \n\nThis is why I ask.  I took lexapro years ago without issue.  Started Zoloft for anxiety about a year ago, between 25 and 100 mg/day.  \n\nSeems that the linked cases turned up a lot faster than a year later, and slightly more likely for men.  Just wondered if anyone else had tracked this back. I started showing symptoms Friday (I was on antibiotics for suspected sinus infection), but just thought I was having a reaction to meds. I got worse Saturday, and went to the ER Sunday, started meds Sunday afternoon/evening (the whole day was a blur, honestly, so I do not remember what time I started them). My symptoms got worse before they got better, and by day three (?) of meds the whole half of my face was totally paralyzed. I am on day 21 and am about 95% recovered \n\nFor data\u2019s purpose, I am a 37 year old mom of three with no underlying health conditions outside of being severely anemic and about 25 pounds overweight (in other words, I am not on any meds other than an iron supplement, so I do not know about any possible drug interactions) My BP was triggered by a shingles infection in my ear Oh no!  Your WHOLE face?  Not just one side?\nI am 49, mom of 3 adults, no underlying health conditions.  Other than a possible sertraline interaction, this came out od the blue.  I hear it is related to stress...  I wonder if it is spiking with covid because of anxiety??? Just half! Lol! I guess I could have worded that better. What I meant was that the paralysis was total on that side of my face. It can be triggered by stress, but there are some other causes, but it is one of those things doctors just do not have a ton of info on. I am constantly swimming in stress, and I do not feel like my recent bit was any more stressful than any other time in my life Phew!!! Thanks for clarifying.  I am on day 3 of meds, and I feel like it is still getting worse, if anything... I have a follow-up scheduled with my PCP on Monday...  I will update after I talk to her... From what I have read, and experienced myself, it gets worse before it gets better, but most people get better Have you experienced it before? This was my first time. My improvements came between day 15 and 21 (I am on day 21 now). Before then, I could only slightly move my affected eyebrow Ok.  I am just going to have to take a breath then. If you are in the US and have Disney plus, I binge watched all of the avenger movies and am totally convinced they helped me heal. Lol! (There are 23 movies, though a few are not available on Disney plus) \n\nThe best piece of advice I read, though, was to make sure to chill as much as you can while on steroids. Definitely do not push it. I went as far as asking friends from church for a few dinners so I could just throw something in the microwave, and lived off of sandwiches and other things I could make without any effort. And take that breath a LOT! This year I got hit with the dreaded Bells for the 2nd time. Almost 12months after the 1st time.\n\nThis time I knew it was coming, first thing to go was my taste. I did not go to the docs this time as I hated taking the steroids the first time. \n\nLasted 3 weeks, but it never fully recovered. Slight delay in blinking and smile can only reach 70% on one side So, I met with my PCP on Monday.  No change to my facial \"mobility;\" I finished the 6-day prednisone pack on Tuesday.  PCP added Valtrex antiviral 3x/day for 10 days.  I am on the 5th day of that now, and I guess this would be day 11 since onset of symptoms (7/21).\n\nMy PCP ordered a Neuro consult, which, due to covid, will be virtual and not until September 8th.  That delay is a bit infuriating, but I guess in the grand scheme of things, this is not \"urgent\" (at least not to anyone but me).\n\nMy PCP also mentioned possibly starting me on a 2nd round of steroids...  did any of you do 2 rounds?  If so, how soon after the first, and did it help, do you think? Also, the affected side of my face aches... anyone else experience this?  I suppose that could be attributed to my constant \"encouragement\" of it to get back to work... prodding, massaging, rubbing.  If you have had this achy feeling, do you have any advice for alleviating it?\n\nAffected cheek muscles seem to be reacting the tiniest bit more than they were.  Nothing still in my lips or eye/eyebrow (in fact, my eyelid has started to sag).  I am aiding response with my fingers to try and match what the left side of my face is doing.", "I am new I can still move the infected side but not as much as the other. Is there anything I can do to prevent it from getting worse? Steriods to help reduce inflammation of the nerve. Your doctor should have you on steroids and antiviral medication ASAP. Also, take vitamin B complex, drink plenty of water, get lots of sleep and try to avoid stress (if that is possible). Generally pamper yourself as much as you can. Take warm baths, avoid cold air on your face, and just take it easy. Thanks", "Hi everyone. I understand that this community is for Bell's Palsy specifically. Does anyone know if there is a reddit community for any of the many variations of permanent cranial nerve palsy? I have third nerve palsy, traumatic, causation uncertain, I have had several surgeries that did not work, and want to connect with others about my experience. Thank you for your patience in guiding me to the right community. So sorry for everything you are going through. I know there is a massive Bell\u2019s palsy group on Facebook with about 16k members. I would post this there and see where they direct you. I would be surprised to find subreddits specific to these conditions, there is much more likely to be one on Facebook though. Best of luck to you Thanks, I will look into that!", "Jaw/Neck/Ear Pain Currently in week 2 of BP. I realize the facial paralysis is going to get better and I will just have to wait. What really is bugging me is the pain around my jaw line/bottom of ear/back of neck. It is just frustrating since I have to work long hours right now.\n\nHas anyone experienced this as well? Anything I can do besides take Tylenol/Advil? The pain has definitely subsided since 2 days ago, but wanted to see if I am alone on this lol I did. Use any oil to massage around the area and the pain goes away. Not only that, it encourages blood flow in your face which speeds up recovery. You will be fine, trust me! \u2764\n\nEdit: and take time off work!! I had it really bad too. It went away after a month, I could not really figure out anything to help fix it. Goodluck, it sucks Hot compresses helped me with the pain I was advised to take ibuprofen for that specific pain. It definitely helped quite a bit as far as I remember. I had the same pain, but mostly only at the beginning.  A shoulder heating pad helped a lot with mine.", "Question Regarding Blinking Hello, I have been diagnosed with BP around five days ago. Everywhere I look I see people who has dealt with BP talk about how they have to wear an eye patch. Is it normal to still be able to blink at this point? Or will it probably get worse from here? I have already bought an eye patch just in case. Usually you can blink partially, so your eyelid will not go down all the way. This ends in your eye drying out. You really do not need to wear an eye patch except if your asleep, or maybe using screens for a long time. I never used the eye patch and I would wake up with major eye crust Right now, I think my blinking is getting worse. So I probably spoke too soon. Haha yeah it happens. It gets worse before it gets better. Did you go to urgent care to get your steroid and anti-viral?\nEdit - I assume so because you where diagnosed lol I was totally unable to blink without using my finger for 3 months.  I used a pair of tinted 3M safety glasses with a foam seal outside rather than a patch (usually).  Looked almost like normal sunglasses.\n\nUsed a ton of eye gel drops and \"blinked\" with my finger when it felt dry.  Indoors or out.\n\nTaped it shut, used eye OINTMENT, at night. \n\nEventually regained control of my eyelid, most of my lip, and some of my eyebrow/cheek back.  It will be 2 years in March 2021. Yes I have been on steroids for 5 days now. I think I caught on to it early on. Personally, every day, in my mind, I was fully capable of fully closing my eye, until shower time came and ended up with shampoo on my eye. Every single day this disappointment (and pain). When this stopped happening is when I knew I was recovering. That is great. Yeah the earlier you catch it the easier and faster the recovery goes. Goodluck! I am still healing, but I am almost back to normal.  I carried lubricating eye drops in my purse. At night, I used a lubricating ointment. Covered the eye. Mine still water in cold weather, though. I am a week in and my eye is just now able to close all the way, slowly. But I still use an eye \\*pillow\\* at night. Yeah, got sick of taping the lid shut- even with the special adhesive eye patches you can get at the pharmacy. The pillow is a lot easier to put on and take off. Thanks for the support! Best wishes on your recovery! This happened to me today. Water easily gets in my eye. How long was your recovery? How long ago have you been diagnosed? I am 5 days in, and I am still able to blink which is unusual. I have not used my eye patches yet. I hope you have speedy recovery! Now I know what not to do. Thanks! Around this past September 23 Good luck on your recovery! Thank you. You as well! \u2764\ud83e\udd0d It was very sudden. I was losing hope because I did daily exercises and things were not improving and then, suddenly it started improving drastically. \nI took photos everyday and even noticed it got worse on the first week. \n\nI ended up recovering in about ~20 days. \nWish you a speedy recovery! If you have any questions be free to ask! Thank you! I tape my eye shut when I sleep. I highly recommend using the 3M waterproof tape. It is beige colored and a little foamy. It is been the gentlest on my skin while still protecting my eye. Thanks for the tip. I am still able to blink at this point.", "Muh face \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2c  My husband told me to \u201cembrace the face\u201d which lasted for approximately one selfie. Hahaha this is great!!

And I got facial synkinesis problems that started quite suddenly, or at least I think so.\n\nIt all started one morning during a Zoom call. With some lag helping, I noticed that every time I blinked, my lower lip on the right side of my  face kept moving as well. If I close my eyes slowly, it is less  pronounced, but if I put a finger on the muscle and/or near my chin I can still feel that there is a connection between the two. And doing it rapidly makes my right lip and chin move in a strange way. I never  noticed that before about last week, and I have been in a lot of videos  since, yeah, I got Bell's Palsy. So I would have noticed before.\n\nI had Bell's Palsy like 5-6 years ago, but my recovery was  almost 100% apart from a not so noticeable symmetry issue, and some temporary twitching in my cheek about two years later. Could the  synkinesis be temporary like the twitching or is the connection between  those (I guess) regrown nerves permanent? It is not really a matter of  life and death, but it is really not pleasing to the eye, and I can feel some muscle tension in this area. I fear that the muscles will get  stronger and that the movement will get more and more noticeable over  time. I am my area of work, not looking like I am on coke every time I blink would be great. I can live with a slightly small eye when I smile, but that is scary.\n\nA friend of mine is a doctor, and said that nerves ususally regrow in less than a year, so I would have this twitch for the last 4-5 years, but it seems impossible that no one close to me would have noticed.\n\nAny similar experiences here?", "My partner and his unwavering holiday cheer ", "Pain in back of head I am currently on day 10. We suspect that my bells has been triggered by Lyme disease. Does anybody else suffer from a constant pain in the back of the head? It started to go away while I was on steroids but now I have stopped it has returned and its making me so miserable I was diagnosed 2 days ago and the back of my head is pounding! It comes and goes. Nothing seems to help. Being checked for Lyme disease but have to wait a few weeks. That is common.  Pain behind the ear or back of head.  I had it the night before I for Bells Palsy.  It subsided a bit while on meds but when I was done them it came back a bit.  That and pain in my face. Yep that pain was horrible it was the reason why I could not go to work Same here. It just seems constant, I find it much worse towards the end of the day too. Will be glad once its over, feel so miserable Try the heating pad as someone suggested.  It helped me.  I am just over 4 months with this. It is fucking terrible and yes I had it. Only recently has it begun to go away but it is still mildly there. It is something that has to go away on it is own, it is the pain from your facial nerve being so inflamed and being choked (I would assume).\n\nI first started having Bell's symptoms 2 weeks ago about and it is now been about a week since I have reached the \"peak\" of the symptoms (with full facial paralysis on the right side of my face, etc). And like I said, only recently (in the last 2 or so days) has the pain been going away thankfully. It is so uncomfortable, I hope yours goes away soon. Along with your Bell's as a whole, of course. I just started to recover from Lyme that I had 2 months ago.  I had this exact thing happen too when the BP started; it can hit your nervous system pretty hard so the pain is normal.  I was given meds for the pain because it was intense.\n\nEven now I feel small pain here and there but I have recovered most of my face to a point where it is hardly noticeable. Strange you should have angler in your name, mine happened while fishing lol What worked wonders for my pain was Gabapentin.  It works wonders for nerve pain, which is usually what you have with Bell\u2019s Palsy.\n\nAsk your doctor for it ...", "10 days in- my story so far On June 30th I started to feel my mouth on the right side go numb, almost as though frozen from the dentist. I figured that since I had a pretty serious ear infection on that side at the time that it had caused my jaw to become inflamed which in turn affected my mouth. The next day I could still move most of the features on my face but I noticed my blinking was out of sync and my nose felt weird. Again, it was like I had been frozen at the dentist. Then that evening, the whole side of my face was \u201cfrozen\u201d and I could not move anything.\n\nI went to the ER in my town the following evening when I started getting neck pains. I of course had started googling before that and already come to the conclusion that what I was experiencing was BP. Once the pains started I got a little bit spooked and wanted to make sure I was not having a stroke. All was well with the rest of my body so I was promptly diagnosed with BP. \n\nI started taking the antiviral medication that night (July 2nd), and started looking into other ways to speed things along. I was not prescribed prednisone and I am okay with that. I have decided that will be a last resort option. I was also taking antibiotics for my ear infection and corticosteroid drops in my infected ear. \n\nAs I was reading possible helpful ways to speed BP along I came across acupuncture. A friend of mine who also had BP said it helped his lots. I figured what the heck it is worth a shot. I called the day after my diagnoses and was able to get in the next day. I have since had 3 treatments. I have also been eating a high B6 and B12 diet, and have been getting lots of rest. I am a teacher so it is nice that I am on summer holidays right now. \n\n12 days from first symptom and 10 days since diagnoses and I am already having some good gains. I can move my nostril a bit, I can close my eye and keep it closed, I can open my eyelid just as wide as my other one, the corner of my mouth is starting to slightly turn up in the corner when I smile, and I feel twinges under my eyebrow when I try to move it. I go for acupuncture again today, and I am so excited to show my acupuncturist the movement I have even since our last session! \n\nMy biggest complaint right now is the stupid pain in my jaw/neck that comes along with BP. It is so bad that Advil does not even help it. I have noticed it is the worst if I am tired or if I have been talking lots. But that pain can go away any day now.\n\nBP is different for everyone, and I feel very lucky I am seeing the gains I am only 10 days after diagnoses. I hope everyone has a speedy recovery! Am also considering acupuncture - but if you do not mind, can you lemme know if it is pricey? And how many sessions would you need in order to fully recover?  Mine costs $50 each session, but I have great benefits and it is covered 80% for me so it only costs me $10 each time I go. Acupuncture is not a quick fix and of course it would be different for everyone. It is unknown how many treatments would be needed to recover.

Are you taking drugs and doing acupuncture treatments together?  I am taking the antiviral medication that I was prescribed, but only for 1 more day. I will continue with acupuncture until I am recovered. My acupuncturist recommends twice a week treatments.", "I was diagnosed a year ago and am 95% recovered but I have noticed that the effects tend to come back when I drink alcohol. Is that normal?  Many people report the same.  My BP \"symptoms\" do not return with alcohol, but the resulting synkinesis I have ramps up to 11 whenever I am drunk, high, or tired.  If I chew gum while inebriated, for instance, my eyelid just does whatever my jaw is doing, too.  So I just wink over and over and over, lol. I do not know, but personally, I was diagnosed on Christmas Eve and have recovered a ton since then. I just went to a gaming convention last weekend and I got... let us say not always as much sleep as I should have. When I got really tired, it would seem like I lost a week or two of progress in those moments. It was real weird and unexpected. It is fine now, though. Lol sorry but I laughed at this That is the point! It is funny looking and funny feeling.  As long as my condition is manageable, I am happy to laugh at it! \ud83d\ude02 Yeah when I am really tired I will feel twitching in my lip or below my eyebrow I drank today for the first time since my BP happened a little over 2 weeks ago.  All I know is I am drunk and happy I can finally get back to normal Yes when you drink alcohol and smoke weed.

No drooping or anything. Was this a sign for anyone. I am so worried but I do not know what is going on I started with face twitching. \n\nBut if there is no twitching, unable to close your eye, or trouble drinking from a cup/bottle/straw, make certain facial expressions.. its most likely not BP. \n\nAre you really stressed out or tired? Being stressed or tired can make your face feel weird even if you do not have BP Mine started with a one-sided headache and an earache on the same side. Then I noticed I could not taste food on that side. Then I could not blink. Then the droop. All over the course of three or so days. Seconding what some ppl are saying, I suggest this:\n1: try smiling really really hard. Does it feel normal? Do your eyes close the same amount as normal?\n\n2: Blow a bubble in your mouth, like you are a child. Just try to put as much air in your mouth and hold it. Does it feel harder than normal? Does the air come out easier than normal? You can try doing the same with water or mouthwash, does the water or mouthwash come out really easy or on accident. \n\n3: eat something spicy or salty. The day I went to the doctor to see if I had it I noticed Burger King's tater tots were super undersalted that day. Like normally they put way too much salt but that morning I was like \"huh they forgot to put salt on them\" and also I ate a habenero pepper cause I thought my mouth was acting funny and it hardly tasted spicy at all. \n\n4: lastly, do eyebrow raises, does one eyebrow go up higher or not? \n\nThose are a few little tests you can do on every part of your face that will tell you. Even if it is a slight or mild case, one of those should reveal something The smiling one is the first one I notice it feels awkward. Like I do not even know how to explain how awkward it feels. Everything else I tried feels normal/ seems normal. My right side of my face just feels hard to smile It just feels like harder to smile like my face feels so awkward I started with jaw pain and then ear ache on that side, my lip went numb like after injection at the dentist and was more difficult to drink. I went to sleep and woke up and the full side had gone dramatically. Since then every so often it feels tight and I become nervous about it, I think when usually goes it is quite dramatic but I understand the fear! Unfortunately I do not think doctors will prescribe anything unless it is noticeable x How long did it take for all of it to happen?? I am so nervous and scared", "Bells Palsy advice for school I had TMJ surgery on both sides of my face and it left my left side paralyzed maybe due to swelling. I am super anxious about it and my depression is returning. I have heard that it takes months to years for this to heal, and I am a freshman in college. I have a speech in class in three weeks but what if it does not heal before than? What do I do? Explain to your professor that due to medical conditions, you may sound like you are slurring your words, having trouble with the pronunciation of words, and all together have to speak slower. \n\nI went through college with BP, and I am still not recovered- coming up on 4 years in February 2020. I wore the darkest sunglasses in class and even had noise reducing ear plugs in. I was so sensitive to light and sound. I hope your professor is supportive of you. Talk to him/her. Your recovery is the most important thing. You are already under a lot of stress. You do not need more.\n\nCome up with a plan with the professor. Maybe do an alternate assignment. Or do the speech with the support of your professor and the class. You may be surprised how many people will support you. I would not worry too much.  I am a high school teacher and, obviously, need to talk a lot.  I have trouble with \"B\" and \"P\" and \"F\" sounds.  My cheek puffs out and it sounds bad.  So, when I speak, I actually just hold my cheek in with my hand.  It probably looks weird but it sounds quite clear.  \n\nAlso, if you need a topic for your speech, you can speak about Bell's Palsy and you will likely find out that either some of your fellow students have had it or they know someone who has.  \n\nYou will do just fine and it will make for a funny story to tell the grandchildren some day.", "On week 2 Hi everyone, \nI am currently on week 2 going into week 3. \nHere is my story, 2 weeks ago I woke up and grabbed a bag of chips to watch my favorite tv show and I noticed the decease in taste, did not invest much time and went to the gym. Everything was normal and in place. A few hours later I still was not able to taste anything then I noticed a change in my smile, I got concerned and went to the Urgent care. They diagnosed me and gave me steroids and eye drops and sent me home. \n24 hours went by and suddenly my face was 40% paralyzed and it continued to get worse and worse. I schedule a appointment with my neurologist even though I knew he would not be able to do anything, he examined me and schedule me for nerve studies. Had those done a week and 2 days. He wanted to see if there was any nerve damage. He said it would take up to a month or 3 to fully recover. Not really what i wanted to hear since the holidays were coming. \nAnyways, I have started noticing my face returning back to normal and I can almost close my left eye and I have movement on the left side of my cheek. My smile is not perfect but I look almost myself again. My speech is not affected as much anymore. \nTrust me I cried the first couple of days and I was in so much pain it was unbearable, I felt my face on fire and the inflammation, it was so uncomfortable, I had to take 4 days off work. I slept and got a lot of rest and I am still giving my body the proper rest it needs. I also started to take CBD pills about 4 days ago and I noticed a little change. (Disclaimer: I am not a doctor this is only my experience and things that worked for me) So here is some tips and tricks I did. \n\n1. Rest!!! Rest as much as possible.\n2. Ice the side(s) that are affected\n3. Protect the eye, tape it down! \n4. Constantly use eye drops \n5. Take vitamin B-12\n6. I took CBD pills \n7. Only use lubricant eye cream at night \n8. Avoid bright lights and lower phone and computer screen lights down. \n9. Be patient, stay positive \n10. Sing and talk. Get that face moving! \n11. Get a eye mask \n12. Sleep on the non affected side \n\nI hope your recovery is fast, please stay positive. Thank you for this. I appreciate the tips at the end too. Can I ask what the thought with taking CBD was? Sure, it was recommended by a friend that takes CBD on a daily basis. He said CBD is known to help reduce inflammation. Since this is my first time having Bell\u2019s palsy I was willing to try anything to speed the healing process. I am not 100% sure the CBD is the reason I am recovery fast but ever since I started to take it after I finished my steroids I noticed improvement right away and this was 2 weeks in. I been taking CBD 3x a day. The capsule are 50MG/Serving 1500MG 99%CBD 0%THC. Also, after I finished my steroids the next day I started to experience very sharp pain on the left side of my face, soon after starting CBD I noticed the inflammation going down and was in less pain. \nJust keep in thought I am not a doctor and this was just something i was willing to try since the pain was unbearable. I am still taking the CBD. The CBD I bought is called DreamCBD, it is a blue bottle. \nI hope this helps and I wish you a fast recovery. Thanks for the response. I will have to look into it. The sharp head pains are definitely a big issue right now.", "Sore Pain on BP side Hello about a few days ago I started to have pain on my right side which is my BP side. I was diagnosed a little over 2 weeks ago. I feel the pain when I touch underneath my eye, my cheek, and bottom of my jaw. Is it sore because the muscles are not moving anymore? Is there a way to make it stop hurting or is it something I just have to deal with from time to time? The pain should go as the nerve recovers. It is not uncommon. Someone I know said their head hurt to touch, could not brush her hair. O had pains behind my right ear (bp side) which subsided as I recovered. Hope this helps My face was sore about a week after diagnosis, and I think it was because I was massaging the hell out of my face without realizing it. Very common. Try some Tylenol for the mail. Ramsay hunt is more painful than bells. Make sure you do not have RH because may need antivirals if you do", "Diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, but I have really bad hand pain. My hands hurt and my arms hurting too. I feel pretty weak and tired.\n\nCould it be that I got the wrong diagnosis? My face, right side, got really droopy but it went back to normal after like 2 hours. I had Bell's Palsy a couple months ago. I did not have any weakness anywhere other than my face. Bell's Palsy affects your facial nerve. So not sure why you are experiencing pain in you hand. Maybe you should go back and get evaluated more. thanks! i am thinking about getting a second opinion. because besides the pain i also have needles pinching me type of sensation on the right side of my body. Hi not to scare you but Bell\u2019s palsy is caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. It is common to experience headache and pain on the paralyzed side of the face head and neck however it is not normal to feel it in your hand or arms. You may have Bell\u2019s palsy And something different or you may not have it at all. I would go back to a doctor and make sure you mention the pain in your hand and arms. You should be referred to a cardiologist and get an MRI to rule out stroke. Again not trying to scare you but you should get tested for everything just to make sure Did your face go back to normal after a couple hours or the pain in the hands?\n\nI have never heard of BP going away immediately I would get a second opinion- this does not sound like a typical case. Not trying to scare you, but other diagnoses should be considered my face went back to normal after 2 or 3 hours but the arm and hand are still hurting. I did mention the arm and hand pain but the doctor just said that was unusual and that i have a \"mild case of bells palsy\".?. With Bells, your face will lasts weeks to months... sounds like it may be something else I got 3 opinions when I had Bell\u2019s palsy because I am paranoid and wanted to make sure they were not missing any symptoms. If you have insurance and can afford it, I would get an MRI and see a cardiologist", "What does it feel like to recover? I posted about 11 days ago about BP coming on, getting on meds etc. I just talked to a neurologist who said it is \"classic BP\" and the only thing to do is wait.\n\nSo I am anxiously looking forward to first signs of recovery. Right now, there is literally no independent movement on the left side of my face. I feel little involuntary twitches/flutters in those muscles, which I can see in the mirror, so I am hoping the wiring is still there, and it is just a matter of the inflammation going away as opposed to the nerves growing back.\n\nHow did recovery start for you? Just like small eyebrow raises and smile widening? Full function in one area first? Where did recovery start? I am with you. Mine just came down last Wednesday. Definitely have twitches and twinges.\n\nI have been taking the meds prescribed, but also had already been taking turmeric/ginger gummies, and had but had not been taking CBD, so I have started that up again. All to try and reduce inflammation.\n\nEvery time I start exercising again, I get something, but this is the worst so far. Getting old sucks. At first, my ability to drink without dribbling came back. Absolute win. Then my eyebrows a few days later. I felt like the twitches were a sign I was starting to recover. Each day I improved the tiniest bit.  I could start to see the wrinkles in my forehead, could open my mouth a tiny bit more.  I am going on my 5th week and I am about 95%, my mouth does not work perfectly, I cannot work the affected eye independently (I cannot wink on that side).  I have had a lot of neck, shoulder, and head pain. And headaches. Not constant, but I work in a noisy environment, so. Hoping you get better soon :) I am ancient. Getting old does suck, but it beats the alternative! :) Yeah you just described my experience exactly, I am on week 4 with maybe 50% improvement. Here is to hoping I am 95% by next week like you! Lol For me everything came back in the inverse order in which I lost it all Keep your stress level down as much as possible :) hope you are 100% soon! I do not know... Getting younger might be ok Twitches. My right side was the side that was affected. So, on the right corner of my lip was a slight twitch, then it began to move. In a month I was able to move my lips a bit and make closed lip smile. Then gradually, other areas began to improve. Not completely healed but still much better than before. Took two months to see my first sign. Hi! I have had BP for almost 3 months now, and am about 90-95% recovered. My recovery started around 3 weeks and it was veeeeeery slow. For some reason I expected that my eyebrow is going to gain all movement back overnight, lol. Some recovery signs for me were: -twitching - pain (like soreness), tingling\n\nI would recommend taking pictures/videos, because at times my recovery was so slow that i did not notice by just looking into the mirror. My first movement was a tiny movement on my eyebrow (really tiny, tiny movement) and then the corner of my lip (also tiny, after 5 weeks).\n\nEdit: Ah! Another thing. Sometimes you do not even notice things have improved, until you realise you can drink properly again or blink again or whistle again!\n\nI hope you have a speedy recovery :) If you have any questions, feel free to ask! Thanks for the info! Since I posted this the recovery has started, along with a lot fatigue and soreness which I was not expecting (though I am happy it means progress). I am getting some smiling and eyebrow movement back and it feels like rapid improvement after just nothing for 2 weeks.\n\nGlad you are feeling better! I try to whistle everyday lol. Another good sign I noticed is just a less droopy appearance, independent from any range of motion progress. Glad to hear your recovery has started!!! At 2 and a half weeks in I could start to very very slightly move the corner of my mouth if I really tried. The muscles on that side got tired so quickly but I just kept doing it as much as I could as I would read a lot about muscle memory and how the nerves needed to be worked. \n\nI am now 3.5 weeks in and I would say I am 95% recovered. It felt like once the mouth started to move, the rest of my face just followed. I can blink my eye independently, however there is still a very slight gap when I close it. Hang in there you will be recovered in no time!", "Bells palsy sucks! Check out my blog about it. Really want to hear from other people about it ", "Hells Bell's! Two days ago I noticed that I was having a difficult time smiling, eating, drinking and blinking. Just got back from the doc today and it is Bell's Palsy likely brought on by a viral infection. They gave me a Steroid shot and some antibiotics there and a prescription for Acyclovir and Prednisone. ", "One year on, bilateral bells palsy TW: suicidal ideation\n\n\n\n\nThis time last year my BP began, 2 weeks later and both sides of my face had stopped working\n\nI had to take time off work and eventually move jobs, and lost one of my favourite hobbies, eventually falling into a pretty deep depression\n\nI remember telling myself if I still had this after a year I would give up and end things, as it was already proving too difficult to live with\n\nA year on and I am still here, I have seen some recovery such as being able to shut my eyes, but I still cannot pout, or eat with my mouth shut and as such my hobby remains out of reach, and so I can feel those dark thoughts returning\n\nI am quickly running out of hope, the neurology department I was referred to have not contacted me and are not picking up the phone and I have had no other support at all and for each day that passes I feel more and more like it will not ever go away", "Am I done for? My Story? Idk So I got Bell\u2019s Palsy last year I think beginning of August? But I did not notice that something was up for a week till my siblings called me out for having a cricket face and I could not spit properly or drink without spilling. Me being dumb I thought I broke my jaw so i tried doing something about it on my own (which did not work) then my parents found out and they took me to our family doctor first and he said I was finished then I panicked that my life will be like this forever because I waited almost weeks and did not get immediate help! Then I got pills (my first experience) they were so huge that I did not always take my medication and I had to deal with another pain in the butt (literally I was constipated) after some time I just stopped taking the medication after reading that you can recover without it in 6 months? I felt kind of normal after 4 weeks? I was worried people will make fun of me since I was starting Highschool. But I am not recovered still, my smile is not normal. I still do not feel the same, I lost motion on one side and it feels slower when I close my eyes it is hard to describe but I just have not recovered all and I do not know when??\u00bf Help should I seek medical attention again? Imo taking medication  is what helped me the most. I would go back to the doctor- better to do as much as you can to improve as fast as you can 1. It cannot hurt to seek medical attention again and get a professionals opinion.\n\n2. As far as I understand, the adrenal cortex hormone treatment and anti biotics have the best chance of helping if the treatment is started within 72 hours from symptom onset. Seems like you are well beyond that, but who knows, it might be worth a try. Again, talk to your doctor about it.\n\n3. Try doing face exercises. Sounds to me like you have not lost full motor function in the afflicted half of your face, so you might be able to get more control by exercising your face muscles. If you want, I can find a PDF with the exercises my doctor gave me. It is in Danish, but there are pictures of the exercises as well, and you should be able to copy paste the text into google translate or similar. Although medication supposedly only works on the first 72h I think? First of all, do not panic. We all recover at different rates. No two people are quite the same.\nSecondly, seeing your doctor again is a good idea. They can decide what may be appropriate to do right now.\nThirdly, I personally went to get acupunture. I cannot speak for anyone else, but this was a deal changer for me.\nNot only did the procedure encourage the nerves to heal more quickly,  it gave me a sense of control by doing something proactive regarding my situation.  \nMy doctor showed me proper facial exercises which I can share with you and he advised a good multivitamin along with B- complex. Warm compresses applied to affected areas helps as well with swelling and pain. Just dampen a wash cloth with warm water. Squeeze out excess water. Then, apply to face. \nOne of the highly beneficial things you can do is get plenty of rest so those nerves can heal.\nPraying for you. If you want a review of facial exercises or more advice, PM me. Yup this is basically correct. I doubt a doctor would prescribe more meds after a week or 2 How long has it been? My first time took 9 months to recover, and it only really felt like I was recovering in the last month It is been a year and 6 months? That is a long time. I would go and see if you can get some physical therapy to help it come back. Your nerve should be basically fully healed by now. in 1999 when i was a freshmen in high school i got PB. I thought I had pink eye and i didnt get meds until 2 weeks later, also, when i was prescribed pills i barely took them. I also didnt do my facial exercises. My face only recovered about 85-90%. I still have squinty eye and my smile is kind of fucked up.  It was awful. I hated myself. That being said I was still able to have a normal life and I still was able to get with hot chicks. Would people comment on my eye and crack jokes, yes. Was I still able to have a normal and fulfilling life, yes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmaybe look into electro therapy and you should do the facial exercises because once the nerve and muscle are gone they dont recover. Also, learn to love and embrace your flaws instead of trying to hide them. Try acupuncture, that helped me recover quickly", "One week in Hi! I came on this thread today, I ended up with my first symptoms of BP about a week ago, I had a sudden, intense pain behind my right ear, and numbness along the same side of my tongue. I am a nurse and I asked a couple of doctors about my symptoms,(and Google). Docs were not sure, but I do work with cardiologists lol! Google pointed to BP, I said I would wait and watch. Next morning I could not purse my lips to spit out my toothpaste...yup...figures. I was not 100% sure though, I still had facial movement, and no drooping. I worked and then went to urgent care, I was getting worse as the day went on. Sure enough, BP. I was started on steroids and anti-viral meds. I do not have much of an obvious facial or eye droop, (I cannot close my eye all the way though), but when I talk and smile it is pretty obvious. I had thought though that by now I would have gained some movement back because I started steroids so fast, I have had two rounds of acupuncture, (some of the docs I work with have been certified), and my brother is a physical therapist, and is going to try a tens unit on the affected side. I am still having ear pain, headaches, and I feel just exhausted...I have not taken any time off from work, I wish I could...I really would love time to feel like I am actually recovering, and not just hoping for the best. Hey, I just went through all of this recently I am now about a month on and everything\u2019s cleared up.\n\nI am not a doctor nor nurse this is just from experience.\n\nMine was caused by shingles but no symptoms were present so by the time they found out about it it was too late for medication and it had to clear up itself.\n\nBut I had the exact same symptoms as you, maybe ask if that could be what is causing it?\n\nIf you have had chickenpox as a kid you have a chance of having shingles as an adult I am told.\n\nIf it is maybe antiviral medication will help clear it up.\n\nI wish you a speedy recovery.\n\nHeat packs helped soothe my pain behind the ear when it was really intense. Three weeks today for me and have already recovered a little. Rest, rest, rest and avoid stress AVOID STRESS. get regular massages, stay home and nap all day, eat healthy and just relax. That is how I got mine to go away. Physical therapy also helped. And do not let cold air hit your affected side or the back of your head.", "Acupuncture? I just had my first acupuncture appointment today &amp; have another one scheduled for the end of the week. What is your experience with it? Good, bad or no change? I felt that getting accupuncture helped me greatly.  Not only did o feel better, but I really do believe it helped me overcome the paralysis in my face and eye.  I started treatment within a week of starting my BP and by 40 days I was 95% back to normal. Like the other poster, acupuncture helped me a lot. I was 90% recovered in 30 days. Especially with the pain I felt behind my ear and on my jaw. I felt relief for the pain immediately after the session. I was going through a lot of stress at the time and it triggered my Bell's so the acupuncture session made me put aside my work stress and just absolutely tune out and rest when the needles were in. Plus my acupuncturist gave wonderful tips and the face exercises to do and gave me herbs to take with my prescription. Overall I found it slightly painful and did not think it improved anything. I also suspect the person I went to did not know what they were doing. \n\nI heard that acupuncture is mostly for muscle relief - so it might help relax muscles around the nerve, but it does not help stimulate the nerve directly. \n\nI attribute my recovery to time, vitamin B, regular facial exercises, and some minor behavioral changes reduce pressure on my cheek/ear area (e.g stop wearing over ear headphones all day at work, stop sleeping on that side) Huuuuge change for me I was\nDoing three times a\nWeek Thank you all for your feedback!! Unfortunately I started acupuncture late its been a little over a month since I have been diagnosed so hopefully even with the late start it will help a bit. It was a bit painful for me but at this point I am just super desperate so I am trying just about every remedy I have researched It helped and hurt me. I think I am a rare case because most people benefit from it. It increases circulation in your face, relaxes muscles and opens pathways or meridians to allow accelerated nerve growth (at least that is what research says). I had great improvement within 3 sessions as I went from not being able to blink to full eye closure in 10 days. I was also able to get movement in all parts of my face after 5 weeks. I had a very experienced acupuncturist who trained in China and had vast BP experience. However, I did suffer some damage to my lips. There is a serious problem in 2 areas where needling was done. My beard hair fell out around one insertion site and lip has been weak and spasmodic for a month. So I take the good with the bad and would still recommend it. I have had BP for a month now, I did not see any signs of improvement until my second acupuncture session yesterday. So, for me, it is being the best treatment option so far.", "Few days in. New twitching on bad side if I lay on my side. Good/bad? I am on day 3ish. No twitches prior. But when I lay on my bad side there is small nose / bottom lip chin area but mostly under eye/nose region kind of spasm/twitch. \nJust wondering if I should therefore no lay on infected side/paralysed side so it does not induce it? What are thought on this kind of thing or does it not do anything laying/making pillow contact? I had twitching a week in. It is normal or at least I was told it was normal. I would say massages and keep with your meds. And maybe light face exercises after a week? I was diagnosed at the end of June and I would say I am about 80% recovered now. For me, the twitches were a good sign because I started seeing recovery a few days after. When I started feeling the twitches, I would lightly massage and do the facial exercises. I had it on January this year, the strange thing is that I had twitches on the other side of the face (the good side). I had a little pain too so I avoided as much as possible to lay on the paralyzed side. Anyway, you might probably end up dragging or pulling your muscles if you do it and you might get your eye opened (and dry) or mouth. \n\nI recently wrote about ( in case it is useful for anybody. It is in Spanish but it can be translated. Tomorrow makes 3 weeks since my Balls Palsy settled in. I too had twitching towards end of first week and luckly stsrted to see recovery after that. It was also around the time I started doing face exercises (there are some great videos on youtube).\n\nI would say I am 70% recovered now but my lower lip and neck muscles on that side are taking their sweet time. There is still some difference in the performance of the other muscles but they have improved a lot already, so hang in there, do face exercises and massage you face, take it easy to reduce stress levels, take your meds and rest a lot. Also I found that CBD oil seems to have helped me, and I also had a couple of chiropractic adjustments which might have helped also. \n\nGood luck on the recovery!! I have read conflicting stuff on massaging etc vs rest early on. I was told nothing either way at hospital. Either way glad to hear this twitch is a good sign Ahh yes dragging and pulling makes sense. Also last nights also had weird feelings/twitch on good side too. Cheers for linking I will read up I completely understand your hesitancy. I was the same way so I rested but eventually got frustrated with no improvement so I started to massage and literally the next day I was able to move my cheek a little. I am not a doctor though, so do whatever you feel comfortable with. I am hoping you have a speedy recovery!", "Lips Tingling when laughing - Recovery or Synkinesis? Hi everyone, I got Bell's Palsy around 5 weeks ago and have been treated with the usual medication (prednisolone, antivirals etc) and I have also had some improvements (can close my eye, raise my corner of the mouth, raise my eye brow a bit). Yesterday I have noticed a tingling feeling when I am trying to smile really widely on the affected side. It sort of feels like the \"pins and needles\" effect that you get on your feet sometimes. I am now wondering if anyone else has had these sympoms and whether it could be a sign of recovery, synkinesis or maybe anything else? I am not on medication anymore and seeing a physiotherapist.", "Got diagnosed with bells palsy...now what? I get really bad migraines most of the time. Well last Sunday I had one that topped most and on Monday my left face stopped working. Eye would not close, one side of mouth working and some numbness. Went to the er, scans were normal. Stress was the cause possibly. Started me on steroids and antivirals.  Anything else I can do to help the situation? Be patient. You did good by getting to the doc as quickly as you did. Hopefully you will be completely healed in 4-6 weeks. Any tips for the cheeks? I keep biting them. Eat soft foods so that you do not really have to chew that much and just try to be careful. I just thought about something. You can call up your dentist, tell them your situation, and see if they have something you can put between your cheek and teeth to keep them separated throughout the day. 1) Tape your eye shut at night, or get an eyepatch.  There are a few videos on YouTube on how to do it, you want to protect your eye from getting scratched or damaged at night if you cannot shut it.  Also eye drops - keep that baby moist.\n\n2) Take care of your self.  Lots of sleep, relax as much as you can, eat healthy.  All the stuff you can do to baby yourself.  You are healing, help your body out.\n\n3) Do not freak out!  Most cases get better.  For me watching videos of people documenting their recovery helped me keep things in perspective. Get a second opinion/MRI ......I was diagnosed with BP for a year...turned out I actually had a cancerous tumor in a facial gland....would have been critical to have not spent that year letting the tumor increase in size......good luck!!     MRI of entire face! Do face exercises. I did that 3 times a day (each session lasting about 15 minutes), and also just did some random face exercises throughout the day while watching TV and stuff. Like practicing blinking, while helping the afflicted side with a hand. Dont get electro therapy of any kind straight away. It actually does more harm then good and can lead to synergy (as my physio calls it). Even if your face isnt sore yet. \n\nMassage all muscles in your effected side of face. If you keep on top of it your muscles shouldnt get sore. Not a biggy but wish i did it.\n\nI found i had the most progress when i would look in the mirror and try and move my affected side. Helps visualise it a bit better. Could have just been a coincidence that i started improving then but wont cause any harm to do it anyways. Appreciate all the help. Just trying to stay positive and not dwell on it.", "Online resources I woke up with Bell\u2019s palsy June 5th. I immediately started acupuncture and was following all his self massage guides after appointments.

I was wondering if anyone has any online resources for exercise or self massages or the like the would recommend?

Im no doctor.\nGood luck, stay strong", "My Bell's Palsy story (there is hope) Hi all,\nFigured I should share my story in the hope that it could help the next person who is in this position.\n\nIt all started on a Friday afternoon. When eating lunch, my jaw felt funny. Nothing crazy, but I had some trouble eating.\nI was on my own, and did not check the mirror until later that evening, so I did not realize anything was really wrong.\nBefore I headed off to bed that night I went to wash my face and then something looked funny. I tried to smile, then I realized something was really wrong.\nImmediately a stroke came to my mind and panic set in.\nMy wife had gotten home by then and she was pretty confident it was Bell's and not a stroke. She was right, though in retrospect I should not have risked it and went to the ER immediately.\nAnyway, I went in the following morning - got the Bell's Palsy diagnosis, got a script for steroids (7 days of Prednisone at 60mg/day, then a slow drop rate of 10mg/5 days), an anti-viral drug (Aciclovir 800m, 5 times a day for 7 days), a moderate heartburn medication (due to the steroids possibly upsetting my stomach), and finally -  eye drops and an eye gel as a tear replacement.\nWas instructed to tape my eye shut at night.\n\nWent on my \"merry\" way and cried for two weeks because there was next to no progress (in fact, over the first week or so I went from having a tiny bit of muscle tone and control on the affected side to absolutely nothing). \nEating was hard. Speech came out poorly. My face was not me. I had a hard time with the body image issues. This was the hardest part of this illness for me. \n\nThen it started. I felt a bit of a tremor occasionally on the muscles around my lower lip or somewhere else.\nI was scared this was the start of Synkinesis, but I am happy to report it was not - a few days later I could start moving my cheek muscle a tiny bit. And from that point, every day or two I could control another muscle, or get more control. My speech improved. Food was easy to handle. My ear did not hurt as much when my kid cried. Things were getting better!\nA week after the one month mark I felt normal. Still could not wink (or close that eye perfectly), still had an asymmetric smile, but felt alright.\nIt is been almost 2 months and I would say I am 98% back. I can still see a tiny bit of a difference if I try hard but most people cannot even see that.\n\nThis thing sucks, and your case may be different - but there is hope guys! Great to hear! I have noticed how truly different everyone is case is. I was back to 99% after 2 weeks and then 100% after a few years. Hey that is great, well done. Hello, did you have any headaches , pains, pain behind ear, eye blurred during your first Month x If there was anything loud, I got really bad pains in my ear on the affected side.        \n\nBlurred vision - I am not so sure, but maybe. I definitely remember having difficulty working at my computer all day or driving for a long time.\nEye pain - lots of uncomfortable feeling anytime I forgot to take my eye drops in time or was getting close to the end of the interval between them. Felt a bit like a burning / sand in my eye kind of thing. Not fun at all. \nI think this one is super important to pay attention to. I actually still apply eye drops before going to bed (I will stop soon, just wanted to be safe). Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "synkinesis Has anyone here not completely healed and also does not have synkinesis? (at least had bell\u2019s palsy for longer than 5 months) because a lot of doctors say after a couple months if you have not completely healed you are likely to develop it so just wondering Almost 6 years. Synkinesis and trigeminal neuralgia developed since diagnosis. Mine was almost 3 years ago and I would say I am probably 90-95% healed. Not sure if that counts as maybe \u2018too much\u2019 to answer your question but no I do not have synkinesis. what still has not completely recovered for you? how much would you say you have recovered % wise? Probably about 30-35% My upper eyelid area droops a bit, it is most noticeable when I have makeup on since it highlights any symmetry issues. The very corner of my smile does not go quite up as far as it should/used to. Nothing major and I probably notice it way more than anybody else would. Does not bother me much I still consider myself pretty lucky. I am about 2.5 years post-diagnosis.  Maybe 85% healed (lip not completely back, I cannot whistle or draw that side all the way back for a sneer -- it is not really noticeable to anybody but me) but I DID get synkinesis.  Eyelid and check/lip are a little mixed up.  Again, really only noticeable to me.\n\nI know I am not who you are looking for, I am sorry. But just thought my situation would be informative.  I did not begin healing for about 3 months. So I was completely stone-faced for 90 days almost exactly.\n\nI think the issue is that, if you begin healing early, your nerves are likely repairing themselves, or regaining normal function. If you begin healing later, your nerves are literally regrowing, and your body's not great at doing that apparently. how long did it take you to reach that 90-95% ? did you ever do electrical stimulation in your recovery? Significant improvement started around 5 or 6 weeks I think, then better and better for another week or two, and now this is just my face. I did, but I did it myself (TENS unit   Might have made my face worse? Did you already realise you had synkinesis before you started electrical stimulation or after? I started the TENS unit about a 3-5 weeks into my diagnosis but did not notice the synkinesis until I had mostly healed (about 12 weeks).\n\nEdit: I did not use the TENS unit that much.  It mostly just hurt, and it did not actually cause my muscles to contract, like you might see on the internet. I would not recommend doing it yourself.\n\nMaybe having a doctor do it would produce different results. when placing the pads for the tens unit did you put them in different places of the face at the same time for example one on the eyebrows and one on the mouth or did you put them both in one same area and do one movement at a time I tried 2 pads and then 4.  Like eyebrow/forehead, temple, cheek, and jaw.  were you trying to move your facial muscles at the same time or just letting the tens unit do it? My face was totally paralyzed on that side for almost exactly 90 days.  I could not make anything move on its own, so I was hoping the TENS unit would at least prevent atrophy of my face muscles while the nerves healed.    \n\n\nIt did not work, for me, but that could be for any number of reasons. did you ever take electrical stimulation in your recovery? Nope. I did, but it only stressed my facial muscle... Would recommend acupuncture instead do you have synkinesis? No, only sporadic involuntary movement... But not very often how long did you use the electrical stimulation for and did you use a TENS unit with the sticky pads? Yes I used Tens with the pads, they really stressed my muscles, my face was swollen and hurt a lot for a week. To be honest I would not recommend them for Bell's palsy... I am using now acupuncture (this really helped a lot), vitamin B and a vitamin for the nervous system called: Nucleo CMP Forte and a lot of homeopathic medicine like: curcumine, dandelion, echinacea, thyme infusion and lemon balm. Curcumine helped a lot when my face was swollen. Wish you the best in this journey, hang in there....  how long did you end up using this TENS unit and where did you place the pads for example mouth and eyebrow at the same time or did you put both pads in one area and work one muscle group at a time? I had a therapist helped me with that, he placed the pads one in the jaw and other one in the temple of the paralyzed side... I used them 4 times during the course of 2 weeks... By the last session my face really hurt. How long after getting bell\u2019s palsy did you start that electrical stimulation and how long did sessions go for? I started the sessions one week after getting it. And it was two 1hr-sessions per week, for 2 weeks... But again, I would suggest consulting with your doctor, my doctor had already warned me of the possible damage it could cause to my muscles, but I was desperate and tried it anyway. what did your doctor say it could do? What it actually did, the muscle gets swollen and he said the recovery would be slower  oh so he had nothing good to say about it and what muscle got swollen for you? The one in the middle, I think it is called facial muscle... Do you think electrical stimulation increases the muscle tone in the cheek and makes it bigger? Not increase the tone, it felt like the muscle was stressed and swollen, not a good feeling... okay so it does not matter how much a person does electrical stimulation on cheek area it will not grow bigger/increase tone? To be honest I am not sure, people in sports do it... But I would recommend consulting with proper medical resources. Did you also try to force your facial expressions while you used the tens unit Doing kind of exercise, yes  did you ever have one stuck on the eyebrow/temple area and one around mouth/jaw area and force the movements at the same time so try to move your eyebrows and smile at the same time with the tens unit on? Do you have a picture of just the swollen muscle? No, I did not take one... But really really would recommend consulting with a doctor  did your muscle ever go back to its original size? like the same size it was before you got bell\u2019s palsy or do you feel it is changed? I am still recovering (I hope) I feel it has changed, I feel stiffness and like it is not as strong as the other side, my jaw feels weird, like I cannot find how I used to close my mouth. I am about 5,5 months in and starting to develop synkinesis now. Kind Of depressing as healing seems to has plateaued and now it is taking a turn for the worst with side effects. Did you do any electrical stimulation in your recovery? Latest acupuncture session, which included ES was the 17th of July. That was th 2nd ES sessionl, but then I quitted acupuncture altogether.\nMaybe it was just me, but I felt it was possibly doing more harm than benefit for my recovery. What type of sykensis do you have? Well I have BP on the right side of my face, in normal rest, the right mouth corner instead of drooping or in neutral, it is slightly lifting up, like having a faint smile.\nNow when I try to pull up my eyebrows, the right mouth corner moves up as well, my right upper lip and my right cheek move as well. As if the right side is squinting ir trying to smile, while I just try to pull up my eyebrows. \nI also have quite a lot of tension in my face, so I am trying to reduce the tension and synkinesis by massaging and stretching.", "Anyone here who had been diagnosed with BP contract COVID? I am wondering to see if it generally affects us differently. So if you have been diagnosed, what were your symptoms? My symptoms were a huge migraine  then pain behind my eye I actually barely recovered from Co-vid when about 1-2weeks later i was diagnosed with BP God damn.", "Palsy clearing up considerably after wisdom tooth removal? I had the Palsy a couple of years ago, and it healed as best it could after 4-6 months.  One side was still noticeably different, though.  After I had my wisdom teeth removed a couple of weeks ago, the palsy side of my face seems a lot better.  My eye is not as droopy, and opens and closes congruently with the other eye, and my smile is more symmetrical.\n\nIs it all in my head, or has someone had a similar experience, whether after wisdom tooth surgery or something else?", "lil update, my bell's palsy is starting to go away as u can see!

Hope you will have a speedy full recovery as well. Keep smiling \ud83d\ude2c Good to hear mate. Looks like it was a.pretty mild case then if it is already starting to heal. The nerve must have suffered much damage from the inflammation. Congrats \ud83d\udc4f", "hey so going on day 10 here no really noticeable signs of improvement, been taking vitamins eating better, i guess my question is and i know everyone is different, when did u see signs of improvement, this is really hurting me mentally, i just want some hope. and i am sure it gradual signs no one has fully healed over night right lol also have had a lot of twitching in my face on the affected side. is this a good sign, thanks, sarah I did not see any improvement until roughly two weeks in. Then I noticed that I could raise my eye brow 1 mm. Very slight improvement.\n\nAfter that it was a steady recovery for me, and I was 99% recovered by day 30.\n\nKeep in mind that everyone is different though.\n\nBut I just wanted to say that even with a pretty fast recovery like I had, the first signs of improvement were extremely small.\n\nI cannot remember if I had twitching. Maybe a tiny bit, but it could not have been major since I do not really remember.\n\nSide note: I did face exercises 3 times a day, each session taking about 15 minutes.\n\nBest of luck with your recovery. Feel free to ask if you have any questions :) Did you do anything else besides facial exercises? \n\nI am currently on day 6 and have done 2 acupuncture sessions and 1 cupping sessions as well as taking b12 vitamins. Do not know if those help out with recovery any faster. \n\nBut have not had much improvement yet since it is still the first week. All I really did was take the medication I was prescribed and then do my face exercises. I did not have a chance to try acupuncture, although I was open to trying it. \n\nI would however massage the face before starting the exercises, and then stretch the face muscles when done with the exercises. I also often felt twitching in my face during the first 10 days. Today it is day 14 and it is gone now as well as the pain that I felt on the affected half of my face. It felt like a bruise when I touched it. I do not think it is a good sign but it is nothing you should panic about.\n\nBesides exercising a very gentle face massage and a hot compress can help. I think that using those two methods decreased the pain and the twitching in my face the most. I heard that relaxation or meditation can help recovery in general. Unfortunately I did not sleep much during the first week because of a strong pain in my ear and a headache and maybe that is why my recovery is slow.\n\nI use a jade face roller and I think it helped me with pain by relaxing my muscles that were very tense and painful. The pain tends to make the muscles more tense which in turn causes more pain and so on. I felt less tension in my face right after a massage. I use it starting from the middle of my face and gently move it towards my ear:  Do not forget about massaging and streching your good side because it is over worked and now it is trying to compensate for your bad side. \nI am also thinking about buying a gua sha stone:  just because the whole process looks very relaxing.\n\nA hot compress gives similar results in that it should help with relaxing tense areas which should decrease the pain and potential swelling in that area. I bought hot and cold compress that can be eighter put in the fridge or in warm water depending how you want to use it so it is very versatile and can be used for bruises. I use it twice a day in the morning and evening for 15 minutes and I put it mostly on my ear and cheek. The facial nerve goes out from around the ear so that is where the swelling is located and that is why you should focus on warming up that area. You should keep your neck and ear warm all the time. I went as far as wearing a warm hat and a scarf in my home all the time because in the fall and the winter my home is not very hot.\n\nI am on day 14 and there is no improvement in movement on the side of my face yet. So far I have been taking steroids and vitamins and I started doing physiotherapy: electrostimulation, laser therapy and sollux lamp. Four appointments each. I immediately felt better after using the sollux lamp so I think that warming up the area around the ear helps a lot.\n\nI strongly recommend using a massage and a\u00a0 hot compress for the twitching. Good luck with your recovery. I am lucky. My Bell's Palsy developed as a side effect to TMJ. I still had about 20-25% movement in the paralysis half of my face. After about 4 days of steroids and antivirals I am at about 50 or 60%. Personally, I did notice twitching when it started working.  So that could be a good sign!", "Medication Question about Prednisone I wanted to ask the community about the dosage of Prednisone prescribed to them and time initiated. I was diagnosed with BP and put on 30mg/day (a moderate dose) within 48 hours of onset. I was wondering why my doc, who claimed to have experience with treating BP, only put me on 30mg instead of 60mg which seems to be the standard?\nHas anyone been prescribed less than 60mg/day for a week with 100% paralysis? And did it work?\nAlso, I am 7 days in and is it too late to increase my dosage? I have had bp twice in the last 4 months. The first time I got 60 mg for 5 days. Second time I only got 40 mg for 5 days. \n\nBoth times has been less than what I have found online. The first time I got better in 3 weeks. The second time is still going on for me. I am 11 days in and full paralysis. \n\nMy understanding is that prednisone is a really strong drug and has a lot of side effects. I think they take into account your size, general health, and severity of BP when prescribing. I have seen people on here who did not get any meds and got better. I have yet to find anyone who did not receive any medication and got better. Thanks for that information. I do not feel the Prednisone has done anything for me. I know I have seen some comments here and there about no meds or maybe I just imagined it. Idk.\n\nWhat I can share from my experience. While on prednisone. I felt somewhat normal and it kept my face from total paralysis. After I finished the prednisone things got even worse. I am at at 100% paralysis with only minimal eyelid control. \n\nAre you still on it? Yes, I am on it at day 7. After I started taking it, it went from about 80% paralysis to 100% within 48 hours. From what a specialist told me, that is completely normal even if you are on Pred. I just feel like my chances may have been reduced for recovery because he prescribed half the recommended dosage. But I am likely just being paranoid. He also wants me to get an MRI to see the extent of the nerve damage. I think that will help me a lot to know what I am looking at in the future. How are you doing psychologically? 7 days is more than I got! I think it is normal to get paranoid. I am doing much better this time around. The first time I was a mess. It is really scary stuff... going down the rabbit hole of thinking  this is going to be your face for the rest of your life. It messes with your identity. \n\nI try not to let it get in my head but I was comparing where was like time and I had more movement so obviously I am freaking out. Trying to take it one day at a time and not future trip. \n\nAnd yes it is completely normal for the paralysis to get worse before it gets better. Even if you catch it early. I was on meds 24 hours after first symptoms showed up. \n\n\nJust try and get some rest and not make things worse by going into a negative place! Easier said than done but remember around 85% recover one 3 weeks. You got this. Thanks for the encouragement. I am doing pretty good to be honest. I have an excuse to get out of going to any functions or obligations I may have that I dread going to! That part is good but does not outweigh the possibility of permanent damage which I try really hard not to consider. Plus, the Gabapentin really relieves my anxiety. Inflammation is your immune system's response to invaders like bacteria or a virus. Your body sends extra blood flow and a bunch of white blood cells to the area, the white blood cells unleash a bunch of chemical defenses, and nearby cells absorb the fluids and byproducts.  \n\nBut sometimes this process gets triggered when it is not strictly needed, like when someone has an autoimmune disorder or, as the case may be in Bell's Palsy, when viruses such as herpes ('cold sores') and chicken-pox ('shingles') are not so much *attacking* as just camping out along the nerve pathways, where they can remain dormant for months or years or even decades. The immune system's response is not going to kill off these invaders, but your body does not know that. So when they *do* flare up your body tries to fight them, nearby tissues swell up, and you lose control and sensation in half of your face.  \n\nSo taking an anti-inflammatory like prednisone tells your immune system to back off. But it is not a targeted message... your *entire* immune system is told to back off. And regardless of what is happening around the nerves in your face, there can be all kinds of other jobs your immune system needs to address at any given time. So prednisone can, in the right combination of conditions, open you up to other problems that would not occur had your immune system been at 100%.  \n\nPrednisone is not a cure for BP, and even if it calms your immune response the already-swollen cells take time to return to normal, on the order of days to a small number of weeks. During which all kinds of other horrible things can happen *because* your immune system is suppressed by the prednisone.  \n\nMy primary care doc put me on 30mg, after looking up potential drug interactions and other contraindications on the computer. I am a big guy, so I asked if this was something that needed to scale up (as various other medications have in the past). He said getting it early is much more important than the specific dose, and that there is no sense in opening the door to other infections.  \n\nIt is not a \"more is better\" situation, you are not on a \"half dose\", and your chances for recovery have not been hurt by not being on more prednisone... that is not how prednisone works, or what it was prescribed for. You note in another comment that you got 20% of sensation back within 48 hours of starting the prednisone, and that is **much** better than the average... for most people, that kind of recovery takes between a few weeks to a few months to *never*.  \n\nPlease just take what your doctor prescribed, they may have chosen the dosage based on factors that they did not spell out for you but are still quite important. I know from experience how easy it is to imagine every possible horrible future, but the process of healing takes time, and, seriously, the progress you have made so far is *waaay* better than most.  \n\nBe grateful for that, take care of yourself, and do everything you can to give your body the reasons and resources it needs to heal: eat right, sleep right, exercise (within reason), take vitamins and electrolytes, massage your face (gently), put heat on it. And try to not worry. Everyone worries, and not one of them got any healthier by worrying... many likely delayed their recovery, because stress and anxiety trigger your 'fight or flight' response, which releases chemicals into your blood that keep the afflicted cells from returning to normal.\n\n(Edit: spleling, spa c ing) This is extremely helpful information that I needed to hear as my GP will not return my calls. However, I actually said the opposite about my paralysis (not that it matters really). After I started taking the Prednisone, I went to full paralysis in 48 hours from about 80%. I could actually speak normally before the medication. Now, at 7 days in, I speak like a drunk. Regardless, thank you for the comment and I actually feel a little bit better about the medication now. Cheers! it is also very normal to get worse before you get better, especially in the first few days. Can you blink at all? Today is my 8th day and all of a sudden, I can only blink like 80% so one eye is bigger than the other. Plus it dries out so I have to use the gel. This is terrible. I am on day 13. Completely no facial movement starting day 10/11. For some reason tho my eye blinking has gotten a tiny bit better. I can get it to about 50% closed on a normal blink and 100% if I try hard but it takes about 10 seconds. \n\nBeen on that eye gel game for a while. It is a life saver tbh. Bro this is the best response I have seen. I have had bp twice in the last four months so I am on here often. Might have to save this to share with other people I have to say that this guy\u2019s post was more informative and made me feel better than anything else I have heard from own doctors! Really good stuff here. How are you doing??\n\nI have gotten no changes :( except for the occasional twitching. I am on Day 13 and have not seen any change at all. My upper lip is drooping now which has upset me. It is harder to drink and eat than before. Still having pain behind the ear. It gets pretty intense but the Gabapentin relieves it. Then I fall asleep. \nI am also experiencing very slight eye twitching in the affected eye. It is been on and off all day. Did you have this happen to you the last time? Is twitching a good sign from what you know? Day 19 and I finally and feeling movement coming back! It is very very mild but it feels different and I can feel the muscles trying to engage. It is not much but it is really encouraging. \n\nAs far as twitching, my face had been twitching like crazy the last 5 days or so. Eye lid and upper and lower lips. I think it is a good sign. I see it as your nerves starting to regenerate and reconnect. The one thing I did read is that they can also twitch from exhaustion if you are spending a lot of time trying to move your face that can happen too. If you do it too much it can cause synkenisis. So I stopped trying to force it. How are you feeling? I have been experiencing a lot of pain behind my ear and in my jaw area. It is really intense. Painkillers only help minimally. The twitching was only mild and sporadic. Nothing today though. It is been difficult to focus on anything because of the pain. Oh yea I remember it was really intense for a couple days. It should stop soon. I think it lasted like 5 days of pain for me. The first time I took a week of to deal with the pain. And this time around the pain woke me up quite a bit. I am getting frustrated with the eye dryness/blurred and constant pain. Did you recover 100% from your first episode? Yea the dryness is the worst. I just tape it shut. It is not great but better than my eye drying out. And yes I recovered 100% from my first episode.\n\nGenteal lubricating eye gel saved me tje first time. This time I prefer to just tape it shut and using eye drops. How are you doing? Last I heard, you were encouraged by some movement on Day 19. Any more progress? Lots of progress every day. On day 25 and up to about 80% I would say. \n\nHow are you doing? Any progress? Not much at all for me on Day 22. Glad you are doing well! Do you do any facial exercises or acupuncture? My cheek muscles have been sore the last couple days but I still cannot move my lips. I can work my eye a bit better but that is about it. Dam sorry to hear you have not had any progress. I did not do acupuncture. I actually was in the process of looking it up was when I started to feel some changes. I decided to ride out the process naturally but if it did not get better I would consider it again. \n\nHonestly I was pretty minimal with actively trying to get better. I took all my meds, got some b12 vitamins that I took sporadically, did not drink, and made sure mt eyes did not dry out. Other than that l lived my life normally. \n\nAlthough as I mentioned before. I had it twice. Once on each side in the last three months so now I am convinced I have lyme. Going To go get tested this week. I cannot imagine having this twice in 4 months. I would die. The pain around my ear is really bad and my eye has given me so many problems, constantly gelling it and I had to get glasses because I cannot wear my contacts. My nose runs almost constantly and I speak like I have marbles in my mouth. \nI did not do anything at all for the 1st 2 weeks but drink. Then I quit drinking and started taking the B-12, doing light facial massages and that is about it. I feel like I am straining now though to move muscles and have to stop or I may do damage. I am at Day 22 so I am not that terribly worried yet. Is it a very slow recovery, like one tiny movement at a time for you? Or is it quick, like you wake up and can move your eyebrow? I do not know what to expect. Yea the pain bordered on annoying on good days and really bad on some days. I felt like a Whoopi cushion with not being able to properly say my s, p, and f. \n\nI saw a video once that you should go pretty easy on the exercises because your muscles can become fatigued and result in synkenisis. \n\nThe recovery started with me both times with being slightly able to move my lip. Like mostly unnoticeable to most but I knew it was different. Then day by day it felt like my face was improving. Like 10% everyday. Hi. I hope you are back as good as new! I have a question:  I had 2 days in a row where I woke up with some slight movement. Not much but a little here and a little there. Then it just stopped for a few days. Is that something typical from what you have seen on here? Stopping and starting to get movement? I am afraid that it started and that is all I am going to get is like 30% or so back. Hey! Sorry I was camping. Not back as new quite yet. I am back at around 85% and I am worried that is where I am going to get stuck. Thinking about going to get acupuncture to see if that helps. \n\nHow are you coming along? What you explained did not really happen to me. It was more of a slow improvement not a starting and stopping. I hope you have felt more movmwnt I am stuck. I only had slight improvements for 2 straight days then it stopped for 5 days. I am only at about 30% or so. I also have been thinking about acupuncture but I am seeing a neurologist first. I do not even know if acupuncture will do anything. Some say yes but it could be coincidental. I do not know if I want needles in my face for $300 a pop. Foreals. I am leaving my job at the end of the year so need to take advantage of my insurance. Let us keep in touch! I want to hear how you progress. I am feeling like I am going to stay where I am at for a while :/ I definitely want to keep in touch. I think logically that if you came back 100 the first time, why would this be any different? I think we both are stalled. I do not know if that is normal. For 2 days I thought I was going to be fully recovered by week\u2019s end. But I stalled out with no additional progress for a week now. My eye is getting worse. It dries out no matter what I do. I use the ointment and tape it shut and it still dries out. Then the tape is irritating my skin and I am bleeding and sore. My eye hurts all the time. I can only close it 80% and fully if I focus. It is terrible. I cannot do this forever.", "Dedicated to every time I was written up or chastised for not smiling bc it was excruciatingly painful. \ud83d\ude3c I only smile now when I am happy.

Everyone I run into gets dry eyes only, and uses the gel, or tapes it closed to keep it moist. My eye ran regularly for about three months- it was exhausting and embarrassing sometimes. It\u2018s likely that the nerve branches that affect your lacrimal gland have been affected- so you actually produce less tears but because your eye is droopy the tears just fall right out. Dry eye can also cause extra watering so if your blink is not quite back that could be an issue too. Keep using eye drops and eye ointment even though it may seem counterintuitive. \n\nI used a lot of eyepatches for the first six months to keep the moisture in my eye and it was a huge relief. The patches also helped catch  some stray tears too!  I taped my eye for the most part (still do) but sometimes the amount of watering I had was too much and would cause discomfort- so I would use a patch. I used both the nexcare 3m patches and nexcare sensitive eye tape.\n\nMasks and air conditioning can both cause dry eye so you may be feeling it even more severely right now. I hope this helps and that you find yourself on the road to recovery soon :) I make my own custom patches with a wide band so they are comfortable. I also use silicone ear plugs and flatten them out to make waterproof soft pads for the inside of my eye patch. \n\nAnd it produces an over ubundance of tears my eye has a constant \"lake of tears\" as the doc put it. He actually had me try a medicine that would reduce the amount of tearing, but then I had to use eye drops anyway so it was counter productive.

My eye is forever sensitive to light. I just got diagnosed a few days ago, but it is been a non stop waterfall from my eye. Still trying to figure out a comfortable solution I have got some silk eye patches on order. \n\nI hope it gets better for both of us but you are making me love the eye patch look!", "Scared that i will never recover i have had bell\u2019s palsy for exactly 5 weeks. it was a quick onset, similar to others stories on here- half of my tongue lost taste and felt sort of numb when i woke up one day, by the end of that day my face had started to droop, and woke up the next morning with that whole side gone. it is been 5 weeks now, i have already gone through two rounds of steroids and the antibiotics but i have 0 movement at all still. at this point i am starting to get really scared. i am only 20 years old, and everyone kept telling me it was going to heal rlly fast, but it is already been 2 weeks past when the doctor said it probably would start recovering, and i just feel lost. I got Bells in May 2019 when I was pregnant. I did not begin to recover at all (I am talking zero recovery, nothing) until August 2019. Things have gone very slowly since then but I would say I am about 85% recovered. My forehead is totally dead but I had some corrective surgery (check my post history) that really helped. My smile is not perfect but I look totally \u201cnormal\u201d to people who did not know me before. \n\nGood luck, I will be rooting for you. Happy to chat more if you would like. I was diagnosed on Wednesday, 4 days ago. Same onset symptoms. Out of nowhere. \n\nJust out of curiosity, have you recently received your vaccine? I read where it happened to some people in the clinical trial for Pfizer but they could not say definitively that it was that because it was the same number of people that it would have happened to anyway. \n\nBut someone else online that I spoke to said they got BP 20 days after their 2nd dose. Mine was one month to the day. It is probably just a coincidence, I was just wondering if it happened to anyone else. \n\nMy doctor said if it does not get any better in 3 to 4 months I should come back to consult with a neurologist. I have heard of people recovering in a few weeks, but it sounds pretty rare. I am already over it. I do not want to live the rest of my life like this. I am 21 and I can totally relate. I am close to 8 months out and I am like 80-90% recovered. Same story with me, everybody told me it will get better after a few days or a couple weeks but it took a lot longer. Trust me, stay patient because it will get better, I was in a panic for weeks to months because everybody\u2019s story was different and I thought it would never get better. It will, just stay positive and I promise it will get better eventually. I have accepted the possibility of me never getting to 100% and it sucks, but most people who meet me now would never know I ever had it and are surprised when I tell them. Good luck!!!!! We probably all felt that way at some point. It is scary but keep in mind that the odds are with you. You will heal completely. \n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Bell's palsy (\n\nMaybe prepare yourself and your close ones for the worst case, a few months. In some rare cases like me it took a year or so, but it is statistically very unusual. I would love to hear more about your surgery, how did you find a surgeon that dealt with BP? Did they raise both sides and then your BP side higher? I have been having Botox, but am still droopy and a permanent solution would be great. Thanks! I did not see a specialist in BP, I just saw a regular plastic surgeon. I actually went in for a Botox consult and he recommended a brow lift instead. My surgery was completely one sided; they did a brow lift on my bad side. I had BP 20 years ago in 2000 was a sophomore in high school. \u2639\ufe0f\n\nDid not take my steroids as prescribed and did not do my facial Exercises. I only recovered about 85-90%. Yes I got made fun of sometimes but I also still slept with hot chicks and had a normal life. It is what it is Have you been doing any face exercises? I really felt that it helped me recover.  \n\n\nOther people also suggest acupuncture. I personally have not tried that, but it is worth looking into.  \n\n\nIf you need any tips regarding face exercises, I can share my training brochure. It is in Danish, but there are tons of pictures, and you should be able to easily translate the text. Positive attitude and rest. It may take time, but you will see improvement. i know this girl on tiktok where it took her 2 months to see the initial movements and 5 months to fully recover. i guess you are a bit like her! dont lose hope please, you will see normal again xxx I am on this board because I have bell's palsy again. \n\nMy first time was a decade ago and it took a very long time to get even minuscule movement, like 4-6 weeks, maybe longer. \n\nI know how hard it is, but hang in there! I received the vaccine last week (Pfizer) and I got BP two days ago. I see a doctor today but I feel strongly that it is a reaction to the vaccine. (I had BP 10 years ago, so I think it triggered something) Oh that is interesting! I know they say they cannot conclusively tell us that it is vaccine related, but I am a little suspicious. I reported it to Pfizer through their adverse event reporting system. It is important for them to have this info: (\n\nThere is debate pre-covid about whether or not vaccination causes Bell's Palsy. Seems that palsy is a rare side effect of other vaccines like influenza. I will report it too, thanks for the link! I got BP almost exactly a month after my second dose of pfizer. I was diagnosed at the start of December 2020, and I went through hell in the four weeks after onset - it came with ear pain, partial hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo so bad I could not eat or drink without throwing up for 10 days. I was at a grade VI paralysis on the House-Brackmann scale, the most severe.\n\nI honestly wondered if I was going to ever improve, just as I am sure you are now. I would read recovery was supposed to start within three weeks, but I had not changed at all. Was I going to be forever taping my eye shut at night, dribbling my morning coffee onto my shirt, permanently dIzzy, unable to properly smile, unable to enjoy music again because every note in my left ear sounded a semitone higher? It was bleak, but I had to hold on to the assurance that most people of my age (42) in otherwise good health make some degree of recovery. I had to, because what was the alternative? Sink into despair, wondering if I would ever want to show my face in public again?\n\nBut once the worst of the symptoms and side-effects were over, and I was able to take it easy, I began to see some improvements. It was not until well into January, probably six weeks after onset, that I could really say I was seeing a noticeable recovery. It was very gradual at first, just being able to detect my cheek muscles tensing even though they were not producing any visible movement. Then my eyelid started to come back, and my eyebrow. The vertigo spells started to become shorter and less frequent, the tinnitus less noticeable. Each day was just a little better than the last, but only very little. \n\nNow here I am, six months later. I had my last consultation with the ENT doctor a couple of weeks ago, and he put me at a grade II on the House-Brackmann scale, almost normal again. I am about 85-90% recovered, I would say, and even my family barely notice I have had anything wrong now. My hearing is mostly back, my tinnitus gone, my vertigo limited to one or two episodes a day of just a few seconds. My lips are still a bit janky but only when pouting, and my eyelid droops when I am eating sometimes, but it is a hundred times better than it was in December. \n\nI cannot predict how and when you will recover, nobody can, but I can say be patient - do not read the advice, then assume the lowest figure or best case is going apply to you just because you are otherwise fit and young. I am hoping I continue to improve, and the ENT doctor said he was surprised at the progress I would made in 6 months given I was at a grade VI when I presented, and that I could continue to see improvements for another 12 months or more.\n\nHave patience, that is all I can suggest to you. Patience and optimism.", "Anyone have experience with Lyme facial palsy and prednisone? I recently developed facial paralysis. I was given prednisone and anti-virals for seven days. Ten days after onset, my blood tests came back positive for Lyme. Since then, I have been on doxycycline.\n\nThere is a lot of scary stuff online about prednisone making Lyme facial palsy worse. Has anyone gotten through Lyme facial palsy successfully, despite taking prednisone? I was diagnosed about 2 years ago and recovered maybe 80%. They gave me Prednisone and doxy. I did alot of facial exercises and massageing, although proably not as much as I should have. I tried accupucture as well which seemed to help the most. Hey, MasonicGnat420, just a quick heads-up:  \n**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. I just gone done my 7 day regimne of prednisone.. My palsy has switched sides of my face.. Originally it was my left now just yesterday it is on my right. I still have 6 days of doxy 2x a day left. Got To call the doctor Monday and see what they reccomend to do. Obviously it is not getting better..which is concerning. I got bit by a tick they think about a month or 2 ago. Thankfully my doctor was proactive in finding out if the bells was due to lyme. I did not turn out positive for the Lyme itself..it was the ANTIBODIES that came out positive a day later. \nHonestly the antiviral meds wont help with the Lyme as Lyme is a bacterial infection not a viral infection. Do not know why your on those..mayb you ment to say antibiotics instead? The antibiotics doxy is what I am on as well. It happens a lot. You treat Bells empirically with steroids (+/- antivirals) unless you have a clear treatable etiology (like a know tick exposure in Lyme endemic areas, known sarcoidosis, recent ENT surgery around the facial nerve, etc).  Lyme titers take a while to come back so without having the clear history of tick exposure, you get the steroids and then find out later you did not need them. You will be okay. Might have mildly decreased your chances of 100% recovery, but do not dwell on it. I had a very similar experience with it switching the sides of my face, during or after taking the Prednisone. Very strange. Wow... I am not the only one?! Absolutely not. My doctor seemed shocked but quickly brushed it off. It was an extremely painful process to changes side. Wow..I am still in shock .. Lol.. So sorry it was painful.. I only have pain in the back of my jaw/ear area.. Its not too bad..just got to take Tylenol. No biggie. I went to UC today and they gave me more prednisone and doxy. Another 10 days of prednisone.. Hoping this time it goes away and stays there. Did ur doctor tell you to go to Neuro for the change of palsy to the other side? I went to urgent care yesterday and they wanted me to follow up with them.on top of seeing my pcp. I had so much trouble with Drs once I got the doxy I stopped going. I had to see 3 different ones before I got a lyme test, when that is what I walked in the door asking for. Wow.. How long did it take for you to see signs of recovery? I have had paralysis for almost four weeks and nothing has changed. It slowly got better after being on the doxy. took about 3 to 6 months Wow! Were you on the doxy the whole time? My prescription is only for 21 days. I took two rounds of doxy in that time frame. It was not easy to get but it was the only thing that helped the Lyme symptoms. Each was 21 days as well I believe The exact same thing happened to me on July 5th. I am now on doxycycline after a positive Lyme disease test. My facial paralysis has not improved at all. I think about those studies as well even though my doctor warned me not to look into those reports too much.

I was born with it, and it is been a lifetime of suffering, misery, and deep loneliness. \nI am half blind in my good eye, and the one that doesnt fully blink is constantly red, it is hurting from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. Everyone does not know how much it hurts physically and mentally, when they say \u201cyou look high on weed\u201d when I have always been against drugs. I have been laughed at my entire life for the way I look, the bullying in school was torment. I did not learn anything after graduating because I was so concerned with my appearance. I was afraid to be laughed at again. I remember growing up, at school everyone excluded me, I was told I looked like I got hit by a truck, that I was ugly. I am completely obsessed with my appearance now, everything around me has to be perfect, everything has to be symmetrical, its come to a point where if the wrinkles in my clothes are not symmetrical to the rest, I feel like breaking down. I cannot even take a picture without many layers or makeup and filters. I buy so many lashes, wigs, nails, anything to improve my appearance because I feel like I need to make up for the one thing I dont have, my smile. \nI have had both surgeries and a third upcoming one, but the unrelenting bullying and judgement i have faced throughout my life is just too much to handle. \nI genuinely cannot see myself in a future where I still worry about my appearance, where I still feel so much pain, where I am aftaid to enjoy life and laugh because half my face doesnt work, I am sick of the suffering. I spend my days alone in my room with my pets, with almost no human interaction unless its over the internet. I just feel so lonely, so worthless. \nI just wish this could all end, but I will try hold on for the miracle that could be my third surgery. Dr Avakian, Whitestone, NY used fillers and Botox and made my face symmetrical over the course of years of treatment. No ins tho... I am really sorry to hear that you have struggled all your life with this and that it is been so devastating. I do not have anything helpful to say, but want to send hugs and love. This is my second time with it and it is pretty awful to deal with both physically and emotionally. I can only imagine how it is been for you. That just sucks. \n\nI hope others have ideas and that your third surgery goes well. I am sorry. :( Please find a therapist who you can talk to about this. Sometimes, self-deprecating humor helps to disarm people. I grew up feeling like no one could like my appearance and got teased a lot at school but used humor to deflect. You will find friends and people who will appreciate you for you. Trite but true. \n\nAnd as someone mentioned in the thread, maybe fillers can help lift up some of your cheek to give you a more balanced smile? Im sorry ive alrlways struggled with my self acceptance and appearance this is my 2nd bells flare up and my smile still isnt right tho most of my face has healed luckly. Point is is even if uts just iver reddit messanger im here for you your not alone and lifes to precious to give up over looks please feel free to message me anytime again you have a friend in me It is just the physical appearance. Your soul is beautiful. Do not give up. Seek therapy if you can. Please do not give up!  Beauty comes from within yourself.  Try to find a Therapist that you feel comfortable with.  Talking about your feelings is a great way to heal and get inner peace!  Prayers and hugs for your third surgery.   I heard there is a great Dr. In the Boston Area.

I am on vacation so we are taking selfie\u2019s daily and that is the only way I noticed my lip drooping today. I think it would have taken much more time if I was at home. It is very mild right now and only noticeable to me and family. Is there a certain time period  where it normally worsens? I am starting steroids tomorrow. Anything else I should do? Does anyone have a favorite website where I can find more information? I help deal with anxiety by fully understanding the situation. Is it known what causes this? Could it really be from a Pfizer Covid shot 2.5 weeks ago? Can you start the steroid now? Can you get acyclovir right now? The sooner the better when starting the meds, because you need to relieve pressure from the nerve. Do not wait. I did start the steroids today. The dr I saw today did not prescribe anything else, but I will see my own doctor when I get back home tomorrow. The steroid is most important I think so that is good. The acyclovir helps get rid of whatever virus has caused the inflammation. I hope it is a short term thing for you.\n\nFrom the data I have seen and infectious disease researchers I follow, there is no higher rate of Bell's palsy in vaccinated people than the normal rate in the population. It could just be coincidental that you got it now; it is just that so many people are getting vaccinated at once that it is been confused as causal. So first take a deep breath and remind yourself that the vast majority of people like 85% heal in 3 weeks.  Another big percentage get better a little slower but most people get better. It is easy to go down the rabbit hole of your in that small percentage but that thinking is only going to make things worse. \n\nExpect it to worsen for the first 10-14 days. Even if you got the steroids right away it is still going to get worse. \n\nTry and enjoy the rest of your vacation and maybe take some sick time after you get back. There are plenty of suggestions out there for what to take to help and it is debatable. What is certain is steroids are a must. Other things include taking b12 vitamin supplements and acupuncture. \n\nThere is a lot of good info out there but I found some of the uk websites to be most helpful like this one \n\nGet yourself some tape, an eye patch, and good eye drops or gel. It is very important to keep your eye from drying out. Even if you can close your eye lid now it will likely get to the point where you cannot close it and it is better to be prepared. \n\nI have had it twice and currently recovering from the second time. The first time was a month before the vaccine. I do not think it is helpful to blame the vaccine and beat yourself up for taking it. What is done is done. The important part is to take care of yourself. \n\nGood luck! It is truly sucks and is scary but you will get through this. Thanks so much. Luckily I am a school teacher so I have another 5 weeks off for the summer. I have read several places to get rest. Is that an important part of recovery? Are their certain activities or strenuous exercises I should avoid? My girlfriend is a teacher too! What a crappy way to finish the school year but I hope you get better before next year. \n\nI would take it easy the first two weeks. In my experience they are the hardest. I found that the days I was on the steroids I felt somewhat normal but as soon as I finished I felt like crap. \n\nThe first time I took two whole weeks off not doing anything but bed rest. I got better in 3 weeks. This time I took 1 week and kept going as normal it is looking like it is going to be a 4 week process this time around. Idk if that means anything but I would not do anything more strenuous than what you did pre-BP. Like if the gym is part of your normal workout routine, keep doing it but do not decide now is the time to start a new workout regimen. At least that is the way my doctor put it to me. Also Do not force your face to move. It can cause something called sinkenysis. Which is when your nerves rewire incorrectly. For example you will blink when you smile or have uncontrolled twitching. As of today I only notice the drooping lip when I smile and slight difference to my eye. Am I correct in assuming those will normally get worse before they get better? Yea. It differs for people but could get progressively worse for the next 8-10 days. If you are already on steroids you are in good shape. But yea it will get worse It could very well be from the vaccine. You arent the first person after being vaccinated to bring this up Hello there, was diagnosed with BP on Monday, which was 2 1/2 weeks after the Pfizer vaccine. Was told it is likely what caused it. :( I caught it very early and still had movement in my left cheek and could slightly close my left eye at the time, but now left side of the face is fully paralyzed. \nI was terrified when it started to get worse so I saw another doctor who told me it is expected to get worse before it gets better. \nHope you make a speedy recovery. The best thing you can do is take the meds and try to relax and cut out as much stress as possible.", "Blurry vision I was diagnosed with Bells on August 18th of 2018. Thought most of it went away(I had a sever case) I obviously still have some residual effects of the disorder. One thing that seems to be a chronic issue is my vision has been getting blurry from time to time. Mainly the peripheral vision. Has anyone else had issues with vision after the bells \u201csubsided\u201d?", "3 months in and giving up I was diagnosed almost 3 months ago, I got the flu and it felt different, went to 2 doctors in 4 days, got extreme ear pain and started to notice some changes later in the night, could not move my lips as much, the day after I went to my dentist thinking I was just unlucky and getting my wisdom teeth at the same time as I had the flu. \nLong story short my dentist sent me to the ER where I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy. \nI was rated a 6 on the house-brackmann scale so pretty much fully paralysed. Recently went to the doctor again for a check up and got pretty bad news, according to him the Palsy is clearing up way too slow and I was rated at 4 after 2,5 months. I thought it was going pretty well so this was a big shock. \nI just have a couple of questions I was hoping someone could answer for me\n1. Do/did you still have pain at this point? The left part of my face is very sore to the touch, kind of like I have a bruise where the Palsy is, my doctors are honestly completely clueless, were insistent that Bell\u2019s palsy was a completely painless disease and at the same time ignoring the pain like I was imagining it \n2. I just got an mri of my brain and neck to check that the Palsy is not because of something else, do any of you know what they might be checking for? I hate not knowing and my doctors are not really answering any of my questions \n3. Any tips for asking people not to take pictures of you or to delete the ones they have taken? My family is insisting on ignoring this and trying to act like everything is normal and do not respect my wishes that I do not like having pictures taken and this is honestly messing with my mental health a lot\n4. How do you deal with the questions and \u201csympathy from strangers or people that you do not know well such as fellow students or coworkers? Do you lie or do you just tell people the truth \n5. When I get tired or stressed or just do not take that good care of myself I kind of relapse temporarily, loose control of my lower lip again and things like that, it is usually better again after I sleep, does this happen to you?\n\nLastly, I feel horrible and vain for how much this is affecting me, I have cried almost every day since it happened, I just feel so ugly and honestly hate seeing my face and have taken down or draped over almost all of my mirrors, could really use some support that I do not suck for feeling so bad about this \n\nP.s. my doctors are pretty sure that I will never get fully well and that since my recovery has stopped for a couple of weeks that this is very likely the best I am ever going to get Hey, I feel you. This sucks. I was you literally a week and a half ago. Over 3 mo in and zero improvement. I went back in and my docs were pretty much same as yours. I just got my mri results back saying it was as expected and was Bell\u2019s palsy. They said it ruled out a stroke or some other unknown. \n\nWhat is crazy is I had just come to accept it and roll with it after feeling defeated for so long. I was starting to like people treating me differently (kinder), and just made the most of it. While in between my doc appointment and waiting for my mri, I suddenly noticed a change. No one could tell at first, but within a few days it was very noticeable. First sign of hope I had in 3 months! It is been slowly getting better. \n\nI had lost hope- but it is getting better! It is so cliche and annoying to hear \u201cjust be patient\u201d but it is all we can do. \n\nAs far as dealing with others- be honest. You do not need to provide a long ass explanation for why you do not want to be in pics or have them posted. Just say, \u201cI would rather not- and you need to respect that\u201d. \n\nPeople want to pretend everything is all normal and you are still beautiful just the way you are and all that.... but come on- this shit sucks! It is ok to know it sucks and to be annoyed. It is what it is and though we will come out better from it- it is hard as hell to go through. \n\nI do not have any tips or anything- one thing that is probably unrelated is I started a gluten free diet two weeks before the sudden improvement. While it very well may be unrelated- you bet your ass I am sticking with it until I am healed (or forever, it is helping a lot of things). If you get hopeless, give it a try. There is nothing to lose (except bread- god I miss good bread!). My face never felt sore, I had pain behind my ear and bad headache. The MRI could be to see if there is a tumor, MS, stroke, or brain bleed. Try not to smile in pics just be straight faced ..... when I told people what happened to me people just felt bad and were like \u201cwow I never knew that could happen\u201d no one ever made me feel bad or anything like that..... \nStress makes it worse. Mine only got better when I accepted that this was my new face and eliminated all stresses. I was eating healthier than I ever have in my life and I was going for massages regularly. And then it started to get better! If you keep crying you are never going to get better sorry to say. Just relax. It gets better for SO many people. They just do not stick around in groups like this because they do not need to. I am just trying to help others :) Thanks for answering! It really did make me feel a little better, this shit really does suck, I keep trying to be hopeful because that is what is expected of me but honestly just allowing myself to be negative and try to accept that I may never get better seems to be helping more than my forced positivity Thank you for answering, it is the straight face in pictures that I hate, have always been a smiling person and I am a girl so being straight faced just makes me look angry in photos \nI have tried to eliminate stress as much as I can, dropped a class to make final exams easier etc\nI know most people get better but my doctors constantly telling me I probably will not is not really helping me believe I will Try to be POSITIVE and accept that it will never get better. And then it just might! Haha I am also a girl and I have resting bish face lmao so I totally understand. I wore sunglasses so prevent people from seeing one eye blinking and I just tried not to smile or speak much in public I live in Northern Europe so it is basically dark 24/7, I did use sunglasses at first but now I just would not be able to see anything. \nThe doctors gave me this weight that I am supposed to stick on my eyelid to help me close my eye but people just stare so fucking much and it really messes with my head so I just use a lot of eye drops \nIt is not really being in public that bothers me anymore now that my face is fairly symmetrical again, there are just so many social engagements going on now that it is so close to Christmas and my family insists on constantly taking pictures, my friends totally understand me not wanting photos it is just my family My face did feel sore. My cheek, and brow were very sore in the beginning and if I am very stressed or cry they will hurt. Doctors do not know very much about BP so do not get discouraged if they tell you that you should be healing faster or that you should be feeling no pain. Try asking for prednisone for inflammation. That is a pretty typical medication to take for BP and should help with the pain. Healing time just varies by individual. I am also about 3 months in and have only gained back a little bit of lip control and my brow droop is not as bad as it was. I still have no movement control on that side. My mouth still droops. Do not get too discouraged. Rest as much as you can, buy a facial massage roller and give yourself light massages and if you can try acupuncture. That is one of the best things you can try. Do not overdo any manipulations to your face or you could end up with synkinesis. There is a wonderful group on fb for Bell\u2019s palsy if you need some support. I was an 7/10 and am now almost 3 years later 1/10. I had full paralysis including no blink response or mouth moment for about 3 months. I have some synkinesis but it is only noticeable with certain movements. My bells side eye does droop when I get tired or am sick. \nNerve wise, my face would randomly twitch and still does. \nUnfortunately, pain wise, my case turned into trigeminal neuralgia. I would trade my lopsided looks to get rid of the pain in a heartbeat. \nAs far as pics, my daughter would do Snapchat and I would tilt my face so it looked more like a smirk. \nPeople can be insensitive and it sucks. Thank you for your answer, yes it really does feel like doctors have no clue about BP\nI was on prednisolon for a week when I first got it but not anymore, did not help any with the pain but it is less now than at the beginning\nI am so sorry that your progress is moving slow and I hope you get better soon! I have been told you can ask for more prednisone. I was like you where I only took it for a week and that was it. Did not seem to do much for pain but the pain is supposed to be from inflammation which is what the prednisone is for. There are quite a few people who take it for a few months if their pain persists. I still have some left and will be taking it again over christmas after speaking with my doctor but mostly since it relieved knee pain I have that is unrelated so I will be able to skii, will be taking notice if this lessens the pain in my face as well, thank you for your advice I am in the same boat! 3 months in and very little (I do not see it but some people say it looks a little better) improvement. Still cannot close my eye or move that side of my face at all. \n\nAs for photos, I have my husband still take photos of me and the kids and whatever we normally would... I just save them for me. I do not share on Facebook or anything like that but I do not want months or years of no photos of me with my family just because of how my face looked. Right now, they are for my eyes only but one day I hope I will be better and can look back and see how far I have come (or if not, hopefully by then I will not care anymore lol). In other situations, I will just offer to take the photo so I will not be in it. That is worked well for me as a non awkward way to not be in a photo that I do not want to be in. \n\nI have recently started having some twitches and soreness on my BP side of the face. I am hoping it is a sign that something is going on in there and I may be improving soon. I have had Bells Palsy since June 1, 2019.  First, your doctors are assholes to say you will never get fully well.  \n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1- I cannot remember if I still had pain in my face at 3 months but I do remember having it.  Felt like I got kicked in the face by a horse.\n\n2- they are checking for something beyond BP, like a brain bleed, stroke, etc.  This is a non-asshole thing for your DR's to do.\n\n3- tell your family they are assholes.  They need to respect your wishes.  Remove yourself from the situation if it bothers you so much.\n\n4- Why lie?  Tell them you have Bells Palsy.\n\n5- Yes, that happens to me.  You need to take care of yourself.\n\nI also just read some of your replies below.  I am not quite clear on if you did not take all your steroids as prescribed or if you were prescribed more for your knee.  Hopefully its the latter.  But if you were prescribed them, you should take them. 9 years since diagnosed.  Yes, my face was very sore and sensitive.  It still is a bit.\n\nGabapentin is wonderful for this type of pain.\nNerve pain. Its the only thing that stopped the sharp pains behind my ear.", "Sleep tips? Hello!  I was diagnosed just yesterday, but symptoms set in the day before.  Now I am extremely neurotic about keeping healthy sleeping habits, so after 2 nights of poor sleep I am already at the end of my rope.  Tonight I am trying the tape on my eyelid tonight, but does anyone have any tips for getting quality rest? I _HATED_ the taping my eyelid shut.  What worked better for me was a sleeping mask, preferably a gel one.\n\nThat said, the best remedy for me was sleeping on my side, and putting that side of my face on the pillow and using it to keep it shut... it felt the least intrusive. Eye patch or face mask. I have sleep apnea as well. I was basically a pirate darth Vader. Keep that eye closed as much as possible. Get rest. The symptoms will probably get worse before it gets better.  I vote sleeping mask as well. The tape was very annoying and made it difficult to sleep. Also, my doctor prescribed amitriptyline which helps with some of the pain but also has the added benefit of having anti-anxiety properties and causing drowsiness. I had a hard time sleeping because I was so stressed out, so that saved me.  The Sleep Doctor, Michael J Breus, is one of the best.  Here is his recent interview with Frank Buckley KTLA. (  I tried taping but it felt awful, so I used an eyepatch. I also felt most comfortable sleeping on the affected side. Just make sure if you do use an eyepatch that it is a comfortable fit before settling down. I had a few nights where the strap was just a fraction too tight which was not nice coupled with the nerve pain.  I have successfully managed to RIP out half my eye lashes by taping. It is so painful but it is worse to have it open. I can barely see and it is my good vision eye that is affected. I have a lazy eye in my other so it is a struggle. My skin was literally turning purple and on fire around my eye. My husband brought me one of those frozen gel eye masks. What a lifesaver. I wear it over the one eye when I am doing things and take it off every hour for drops and to make sure I try using it. I cant drive literally everything is blurry and all lights are bothersome. Similar to my auras I get with migraines. I hope the pain subsides soon between that and the eye sleep is ridiculous and I am frustrated and taking it out on everything. Doing exactly the same! I use a Bluetooth headband from Amazon. Listen to calming music or calming Bible readings to help me relax when trying to sleep.\nOnly downside is that the headband stained my pillowcase.\nBut this is a strategy that I have been using since February (for stress, prior to BP)", "Just being diagnosed with BP for the fifth time in 8 years. Just one more and I will have three on each side, so I guess that is a good conversation starter.", "On this day 2 years ago I woke up unable to move half my face and was later diagnosed with Bells Palsy.

I have never fully recovered. It is been 9 yrs.  My speech is a bit better but I still cannot smile and my eye feels like there are shards of glass in it.  I have to wear an eye patch most days.  Kind of depressing but it could be worse but thanks for asking I got BP the 1st time when I was 17 and recovered quickly. Two days ago I woke up with BP again. I am on day 3. 25 years later", "Month 2 (32 yo F) Month 2 and my progress is very slow. I am about 20% back to normal if that. I get so depressed every time I see people recovering within weeks because this might not go away as I imagined. I started acupuncture a couple days ago and one pin point is causing me a lot of weird pain so I am also afraid they messed up in some way. BP just makes your anxiety skyrocket about everything. My birthday is tomorrow and I feel like just sleeping all day. I am so sorry you are struggling. And I totally agree with the skyrocketing of anxiety. I started seeing major improvements when I started taking 1000 mcg of b12. Have you tried that? Thanks for your comment! When I was diagnosed I was getting B12 shots daily for about 10 days. I since stopped because I was getting weird lumps at the injection site. I ordered some b12 drinkable vials that should get here tomorrow. I hope it helps. I am really sorry to hear this. When I was first diagnosed the doctor dodged the question of a time frame for recovery so I presumed it would take about the same time as my prescription of steroids lasted. 10 days later it is fair to say I was rather disappointed with now being more paralysed then I was when I started them.  \nI viewed anything short of a full recovery within a couple of months as my life over. I am now 3 months on and still not fully recovered but I have started to see recovery as \u2018who cares if my eyebrow moves anyway\u2019 and \u2018at least I can drink without a straw now\u2019. As annoying as I found it when people said the same to me, you have to try to focus on the positives. \nMost people\u2019s recoveries take 3-6 months so you are still on the early side of things. You are young which gives you a good chance of a full recovery. Those with quick recoveries are the anomalies that we are all jealous of.\nIf you are struggling with your mental health, do try to get support, whether that is talking to family/friends or a professional or taking medication. I really do not think your progress is \"slow\". 2 months in and 20% recovered is a good sign of recovery. \n\nIt can sometimes take up to 9 months to fully resolve. Trust me, you will get better. And this time next year, you will look back and be SO grateful you went through this because you will come out stronger &amp; back to your normal self trust me ! \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\n\nI would recommend massaging BOTH sides of your face to get your blood pumping to quicken the recovery process. I know that helped me. Please do not lose hope. You can DM me at anytime! Stay strong x You will almost definitely make a full recovery. I have had it now 4 times, and every time within 9 months, it is been at or near 100%. The recovery happens fast, and mostly in the 6-9 month range. Yes this! I did not see any movement at all until 3 months. So the fact that OP has already had that much improvement in two months is a good sign that they will recover well. Give those little nerves time to grow! They only grow like 1cm a day so the fact that you have had improvement already is a great sign. If you do not want to be out in public, take this time to work on your mental health so you can come back stronger than ever when you are ready. I did not think I would recover quickly and ended up being ok within a month. \n\nTo get better I did a few things:\n\nI took vitamin b12 and a multivitamin whenever I remembered \n\nI bought one of those jade rollers and massaged my face a few times every day\n\nTowards the end I started doing some bells palsy exercises that I found on YouTube and I saw a huge improvement right after\n\nI tried to do a light exercise a few times a week, and I juiced every day\n\n I did try accupuncture but I did not do it for long because I was paying out of pocket and it is expensive. I did get a weird feel in my face after accupuncture also but that eventually went away. \n\nHonestly I think the combination of everything I did is what help me get better so quickly. Hopefully my text was able to help you. You will get through this. Help your body help itself by doing everything you can do to get better. Goodluck! Hello! I am in the same situation as you - 2 months and still 15 %. My mouth is not moving at all, only my eye have a little improvement. Do not lose hope, stay positive and do not think only for the bell's palsy. I told myself these things and I try to stay positive. I read a lot of comments and cases and there are so many people who have improvements after 3 or more months. Yes, there are many people who are getting better and have recover in 1 month, but we must be okay soon too! Good luck and best wishes from me! Do not lose hope, I was about the same, very very slow recovery and it killed me seeing so many other recover quickly. I am at 6 months and I would say I am like 80-90% back to normal. Nobody can notice it anymore, but I obviously can because of the little things. But, I did not see any big progress until about 3-4 months, that is when it just started healing very rapidly and was so encouraging to see. Do not give up, I know it is scary but I am confident you will be back before you know it :) also, I credit a lot of my recovery to acupuncture, I did 6 sessions after about 2 month, then stopped for a month, then went back and that is when it suddenly jump started my recovery and has been getting so much better since. Good luck my friend! Well done! :) You give me hope too, thank you so much!\n6 sessions - you mean 6 times you go to acupuncture or ..? Thank you again! Of course, glad to hear! Yes, though, I went twice a week for 3 weeks, then took a break, then did the same 6 sessions about a month later. I was pretty pessimistic the first couple months until I started seeing real improvement with my smile then it started getting a ton better. Best of luck to you, stay hopeful :) Thank you for the information! :) Wish you all the best! :)", "Bell\u2019s Palsy and abnormal MRI? I am really at a loss here and I do not know if I am overreacting. \nI was diagnosed with BP on Feb 12 in the ER. \nI had dizziness and my hearing felt off about a week leading up to that. \nThe dizziness/vertigo seemed to get worse right after diagnosis and a new symptom emerged. I started waking up with double vision, but it goes away about 30 minutes later once I am up and have time to get oriented. \n\nMy doctor ordered an MRI which I had done this week and it showed \u201cT2 bilateral signal abnormality.\u201d \nMy doctor has now referred me to a neurologist, but the soonest they can get me in is May 4. \nI tried calling other locations and the appointments were even later than that. \n\nIn the meantime I have not actually talked to a doctor about the scan. Just a nurse who at first said they are referring me because the abnormality is \u201cextensive\u201d and then that I am being referred because the report was \u201cso vague.\u201d\nMy dizziness is maybe starting to feel a little better but I still woke up with double vision today and now I am a nervous wreck wondering if I could have multiple sclerosis (the report mentions possible demyeliniating disease). \n\nI just cannot believe this is acceptable. Like I have not driven myself anywhere or even been walking/exercising for more than two weeks.\nI am afraid my work will tell me to go on disability. \nI guess I am very slowly, minimally starting to feel better, but like this is it? Just wait a couple months and hope it is not something worse like MS? i have nothing in the way of medical advice to offer you - but egads, May 4? Of course you want to know earlier than that! So sorry you are going through this. I would just keep bugging them for an earlier appointment, but this system is broken. I am so sorry to hear about your suffering. My husband was also diagnosed with Bell's Palsy at the ER on February 12. He was able to see a very rude and unempathetic neurologist on February 22, who did not give him any definitive answers, but has ordered an MRI, which he will not be able to get until March 5. He was only able to get a neurology appointment 10 days after his ER diagnosis because he called literally every neurology practice in our tri-state area, and luckily got taken off the waitlist when somebody with an appointment at one of the practices canceled at the last minute and my husband was offered that patient's spot. Meanwhile, he is experiencing terrible, lingering side-effects from the very high doses of Prednisone and Valacyclovir that he was on for the first 10 days after his diagnosis. Even though he is off the meds now, he still has severe insomnia, heart palpitations, elevated heart rate, and extreme anxiety. Facial and ear pain from his muscles stiffening on the paralyzed side. Painful sores in his mouth. He is absolutely miserable and I cannot bear to see him suffer so much. \n\nIn our desperation to find him a neurologist and MRI appointment, we learned of something called \"concierge medicine.\" If you pay a retainer fee (\\~$2000 upfront for one year per patient) to a hospital network, then you can get a same day appointment with a primary care doctor who will coordinate your care with all the specialists and imaging centers, and help you get earlier appointments everywhere. We are contemplating using our stimulus check money to pay the retainer fee because we are afraid and desperate for good/prompt healthcare. As morally repugnant as I find the whole concept of a two-tiered healthcare system, if you can afford the retainer fee (maybe it will be lesser in your area) that might be one way to see a neurologist sooner. You should ask a lot of questions before you sign up for anything. Buyer beware.\n\nBest of luck to you! I hope you make a full recovery. And fuck the U.S. healthcare system. Rotten, broken, and predatory to its core. One more thing: We have Aetna health insurance. As part of our insurance plan, we can schedule free telemedicine appointments with primary care doctors as well as specialists. My husband was able to get a telemedicine appointment with a dermatologist through the insurance portal last year during the lockdown because his regular dermatologist refused to see him in-person until the lockdown had ended and only if he had a negative Covid-19 test result. In the end, the regular dermatologist confirmed the diagnosis that was made by the telemedicine dermatologist that my husband had talked with through the insurance portal. So, my husband ended up starting his treatment one month sooner than if he had waited to see his regular dermatologist in person. It saved my husband time, and he was almost fully healed by the time his (asshole) regular dermatologist saw him in-person.\n\nYou should call your insurance provider and see if you can get a free telemedicine appointment with a neurologist right away. You can get your MRI scan forwarded to him if such a service is available. If not, then look up all of the neurologists who are in your network in your state and neighboring states (this information is available through your insurance's patient portal) and start calling all of them to see if anybody has an opening/last minute cancelation. Best of luck with everything! Thanks for all your advice. This is so overwhelming. I keep thinking that things are suddenly going to get worse like I will not be able to breathe or something. My anxiety is through the roof. \nI see the neurologist they scheduled me with specializes in MS so they must think that is what it is. \nI plan to call today and get on the cancelation list and I should probably check with my insurance like you suggested. I am so overwhelmed. Maybe it might be worth it to see your primary care doctor as soon as you can and have him/her look at your MRI scan while you wait on your neurologist. That way your primary care doctor might be able to rule out the worst case scenarios and at least offer you some reassurance if it is not MS. Even if he/she cannot treat you like a neurologist, you might be able to get some answers/reassurance and peace of mind while you wait.\n\nHang in there! I hope you feel better and make a full recovery soon. Please reach out to loved ones for help and support. It is just as important to take care of your mental health as your physical health. Best of luck with everything!", "Confused as to what I have For years I have had a droopy eye and uncentered lips and I did not know what the cause of it was. I just found out about Bell\u2019s palsy and my face looks similar to it, but it is obvious this is not supposed to be a long term thing. I do not know if this is a result of leaving it untreated. One side of my face looks completely different from the other. I have some definite facial weakness on the \u201cweird side\u201d as it is a bit harder to move my lips or try to wink. It does not look as extreme as some of the stuff I have seen but it is noticeable. \n\nIf anyone\u2019s willing to help or give advice, let me know if I can DM you to talk or send pictures of my face please Actually it can be a long term thing. Generally you are supposed make a full or almost full recovery, but that is hardly ever the case. A lot of people have it for years and never get better. In my case, I regained full movement but my face will always be crooked. Some people have had it multiple times and a lot of the time if you get it once, at some point you will most likely get it again. Sometimes it can be a few weeks after you recover, a months, or even a few years. Then again, it may never happen again. \n\nThat is the conundrum with Bells. Lots of people have BP \"permanently.\" I have had it for over a year and I am pretty that I am all done healing at this point.  I can blink again, and speak and eat normally again, but the palsy has definitely permanently changed how my face operates. I have also found out I had Bell\u2019s palsy . I was scared I just woke up with my face numb..could not move my left side blink or even smile. I feel so down with all of this. I am still doing research to see what caused it", "Good options for eye protection? Hey guys.\n\nGoing into my second week of the affliction now, and I am looking for some suggestions for eye protection. I did a look through the BellsPalsy website and it gave me a lot suggestions for drops and gels, but I am curious if there are some better options than the \u201cpirate patch\u201d.\n\nI use it in conjunction with tape and gel/drops, plus some padding underneath. But my eye is still suffering from irritation and only getting worse as the days go by. \n\nI have booked to see my eye doctor on top of my physician, so they can let me know whatever is going on, but would love to know what worked for each of you.\n\nThanks :) I went without entirely.  I am lucky enough to work indoors.  I just loaded up with eye drops and tried to \"blink\" with my hand as often as I could.\n\nTaped it shut at night.\n\nI got some tinted 3M safety glasses that have a foam seal around the rim to wear outdoors.\n\nChin up, you will improve! Go Broncos! I used some gauze/padding eye patches but then wrapped one of those elastic bandages (like you would wrap a foot/ankle or wrist)  around my head. I found it super comfortable although it looked a little extreme, like I had a giant head wound. So I mostly wore it if I was at home and while I was sleeping. I found since I could control the pressure where I needed it, without the harshness of tape adhesive. That is smart. I definitely need something with some pressure because my eye keeps fighting the tape and is probably making it worse in the long run. Thanks for the insight! I wore my prescription sun glasses in the house for the first week and a half since my eye was really bad and I was really light sensitive.  I was wadding up gauze or tissue behind the sunglasses lens on the bad side to hold my eye closed.  It was OK, but not great.  \n\nThe gels that are recommended are actually pretty good at keeping things moist and less irritated, but they cloud up your vision something fierce.  With my light sensitivity this worked ok in conjunction with my sunglasses.  \n\nI ended up buying a crap load of eye patches but they all did not fit under my glasses, or they were concave and did not hold my eye shut.  I found this:  \nIt is just a soft silk pad that was gentle enough to hold my eye closed and not put pressure on my eyeball and it would fit under my glasses.  Also the silk is soft and did not irritate my eye. Thanks so much for the reply! Really appreciate it :) There are clear patches you can stick over your eye aswell, look like pods, I personally did not use them, I just used eye gel, and at night I used a thicker gel, almost like Vaseline thick and held my eye closed with a soft  sleep mask.", "Antiviral Med Taken 3 Weeks After Onset I was diagnosed with BP approx. 6 weeks ago. For reasons unknown to me (my doc will not speak to me), I was prescribed a low dose of Prednisone and NO antiviral medication. All research and anecdotal evidence suggests that taking an antiviral along with 60mg of steroids has a positive affect on chances and timing of recovery. So, I was quite upset that my doc ignored that (I have no other health problems that would justify such a decision). I was 100% paralyzed on my left side for 20 days. No movement at all. I decided on my own to take an antiviral and got a new doc. Why not, even though everything and everyone says it will not do anything?\nWell, within about 30 hours of taking the antiviral, I had my first movements; eyebrow 25%, cheek 50%, blink 50%. The next day, more movement; ear 25%, nose flare 50%, lower lip 50%. Then, very small improvements over the last 3 weeks. \nThe point is that you never know with treatment of BP. The studies only show correlation. Nothing is definite and each person\u2019s recovery is different. So, I took things into my own hands and have made significant progress by taking an antiviral 3 weeks after onset when told it would do nothing. Now I continue to progress very, very slowly but just started acupuncture and after 1 session, feel slight improvement in lips and eye. Try everything as long as it cannot harm you. I am still not close to full recovery (maybe I am at 60% or more but I am a harsh critic) but I am way better than before I took matters into my own hands. \nDo not give up the fight, everyone!\n\nP.S. I believe, without direct evidence, that my BP was vaccine induced (3 weeks after second shot) and the theory after talking to experts is that my immune system was not stimulated by the vaccine or that the vaccine was not eliminated from my system. I am super curious about what your P.S. said - do you think either the vaccine did not work for you (so no protection) OR your system did not clear it? Glad you are doing better! Thank you! I feel that the acupuncture is working already after only 2 sessions because I am twitching all around my mouth. As for the vaccine, my acupuncturist, who practiced in China and has extensive experience with Bell\u2019s Palsy, said that she believes the vaccine did not boost my immune system, which is its ultimate intent, and that my body did not eliminate the vaccine entirely from my system. It only makes sense because an antiviral worked for me 3 weeks after onset of BP which apparently is unheard of. Eventually, it will be eliminated but it has been messing up my system and making me sick. It is just theoretical at this point but I trust the opinions of my ENT and acupuncturist, logic, and deductive reasoning that the vaccine very likely caused my BP.  I hope that makes sense. Yes, makes sense! I wish you continued luck on your healing. My husband, who is currently afflicted with BP, also had a low dose of prednisone but did receive the antiviral quickly. It is been two weeks but not too much improvement so we will soon start looking into alternative therapies. Thank you for your insights! ANY improvement at all in the first 2 weeks is huge! He is already ahead of the game if there is even been small movements in his face because the research suggests that it takes at least 2 weeks for the viral infection and inflammation of the 7th nerve to resolve and regeneration to begin. Typically, any slight recovery within 2 weeks would indicate a much better chance for a quick and full recovery!  As I stated in my post, I did not see any movement at all until around day 21. Sounds like good news for the hubs.", "How soon to go back to work? When did you people feel ready to go back to work? Does it even matter for the recovery? I went back after about three days, no issues with coworkers which some may have questions. Other than just dealing with the recovery it was as normal as it could be.", "Prepping for a job interview and considering how to answer the inevitable \"What is your greatest weakness?\" I am leaning towards saying: \n\n\"Ordinarily I would say that my spelling or inability to remember names as my greatest weaknesses. *But in the past 18 months, I have realized that it is now the left side of my face.*\"\n\nThen they cannot discriminate my answer because of a disability. ;) ", "/r/bellspalsy hit 1k subscribers yesterday  \"members have had mixed reactions judging by their facial expressions\"", "one month    One month after diagnosis and visibly there are no signs of the Bells.

Just waiting.", "It gets better, do not worry and do what the doctor and physiotherapist says Brief description of my personal experience:\n\n1. My first realization was when I woke up one morning and started feeling numb and weird sensation in the right side of the face. By evening, I realized I could not close/blink my right eyelid.\n\n2. Immediately went to the doctor (Neurologist) and was diagnosed with 'right lmn (lower motor neurone) facial palsy'. \n\n3. The doctor put me on corticosteroids (prednisolone), anti viral tablets and vitamin b1, b6, b12; and physiotherapy. Physiotherapy sessions consisted of the physiotherapist giving minor electrical impulses on my face to stimulate the nerves and let the muscles work. And then keeping my face under an infrared lamp for 15 mins.\n\n4. At home, I did exercises shown in this video (\nJust be consistent and you will see results eventually.\n\n5. It is normal to freak out and worry about it. Fret not! Just keep going and it will go eventually.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\n1. Rest and sleep well. In fact rest a lot! I personally slept quite well during my recovery days and after every good sleep, I noticed visible improvements.\n\n2. Be consistent with the exercises, but do not over work. You need to give your muscles some rest too.\n\n3. Take the meds on time and as prescribed by the doctor.\n\n4. Meditate. Clear out your mind. And try to focus on your facial muscles. Imagine them moving.\n\n5. Get someone to massage your face gently with olive oil. It helps.\n\nThat said, do not lose hope. I recovered fully in about 3 weeks. Just stay positive.", "Question About Medication (Day 5) I got diagnosed with Bell's Palsy on Tuesday night at urgent care before it got super severe (I could, and still can, move my face and feel it) and was put on medication (Prednisone) to keep the inflammation from getting worse. Tonight is my last dose, and I am still getting pins and needles on the affected side of my face, as well as some pain up towards the top of my head when I laugh too hard or get worked up, and also for a few minutes every now and then throughout the day. Should I worry about the inflammation getting worse again after I run out of medication, or is this normal? I have already had an appointment with my usual doctor, who did not think it was necessary to prescribe me anything more. \n\nI just posted this on a different subreddit, then found this one, so please forgive the crosspost. \ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I had the same thing happen to me a few weeks into my experience. It started as pins and needles and devolved into full-on severe facial pain. I am not saying this is what will happen to you because everyone is different, but if it keeps getting worse I would maybe try speaking to your doctor again. My doctor prescribed me Gabapentin for the nerve pain and it was a gift from the gods because it was the only thing that helped.\n\nI hope you get better! Same, except I did not get anything, and wish I did. Go to your doctor, nothing else will help pain, especially if it evolves into real, debilitating pain. \nSome doctors will give an anti-viral, but some also will not. They really do not have any idea if it helps or not. Prednisone is something that is not controversial, and almost probably helps. (They do not seem to do much research on Bell\u2019s palsy). Noted! May I ask how long recovery took/has taken for you?\n\nAnd thank you! I am trying to rest as much as possible and stay positive. \ud83d\ude05 Gotcha! Thank you!\n\nIt is both fortunate and unfortunate that Bell's Palsy is uncommon - I would not wish it upon anyone, but it is kind of nerve-wracking to not know as much about what is going on and about how to handle it. Hopefully, there will be more research for it in the future. \ud83d\ude14 You are welcome!\n\nMine started last November and it was a couple of months before I really started to feel close to normal. The first few weeks are awful because you just do not feel like yourself, but it gets better. I was diagnosed with BP 6 days ago. Full paralysis on left side. The pain behind my ear was so intense that I could not sleep. My doc gave me Gabapentin, which is for neurological pain, and it took care of the pain immediately. However, it makes you very groggy and sleepy. I will take that any day. I am so sorry you are going through that... \ud83d\ude30 I hope you can get plenty of rest and that your recovery goes well.

Yes, I had the most horrible pain leading up to my diagnosis and during my recovery, same as you described. I used a warm moist towel and hot water bottle along with ibuprofen. Yes, to me this was the worst part of bp. I could barely go to sleep because of the pain. I would highly recommend getting yourself a facial roller or a gua sha to help massage the area daily. That worked for me but unfortunately the pain still lasted about a week. It will pass eventually so do not get discouraged! Good luck with your healing \u2661 Both of my ears have hurt during recovery the pain comes and goes. The not affected side has been worse for some reason. I also got a sharp ear pain and a headache. It got gradually worse during the first 5 days after my paralysis then it was very bad for a week but it got better. It was like a pain during an ear infection I got when I was a child. I think that using a hot compress and a face roller helped. My throat also hurt when I swallowed and when I touched it with my tounge.

I am still very much in panicked owl mode and cannot really believe this is happening to me yet. I do think the right first steps were taken (I am on prednisone now and I followed the advice here of taking some B12 vitamins also). So far it is difficult to notice improvement and it is really worrying me. \n\nSome answers I could use and that might calm me down:\n1) Should I go back to my doctor to ask for anti-viral medication? I do have a history of getting cold sores, though the last outbreak I had was in April of this year. \n2) Could a massage tool have caused this? I started using a jade face roller a week ago and I might have pressed on my face too hard and damaged the nerve. I have completely stopped using it now because I do not trust it. \n3) Should I wear an eye patch all day or just when I go to sleep? I have already stopped wearing my contact lenses. \n4) What else could I do to facilitate recovery? Should I do exercises or massage the area? Or do the opposite and let it rest as much as possible? \n\nStill very scared... In some wicked irony I had just gotten some dental work done and finally felt really great about my smile... Here is hoping I am able to get it back :(\n\nI am grateful this Reddit exists though, I feel for all of you who have gone through this experience as well and wish you all as much recovery as possible x Hi, here are some of my opinions after specialist visits and personal experience. I was diagnosed 2 weeks ago and started my medication of steroids and anti virals at the end of the third day,  in an emergency ward. I know how it feels. Today, I can move features of my face freely, although without much strength. \n\n1. The role of anti-virals in helping Bell\u2019s Palsy is still under debate but as what my doctor said, its better to give it a try since there are little( stomach discomfort) to no side effects. \n\n2. This is another question u should raise to your doctor instead because the causes of 7th cranial nerve\u2019s inflammation is still unconfirmed. Many believes it to be due to viral infection, hence heavy doses anti virals are usually prescribed alongside steroids.\n\nI am not sure how will messaging(helping blood to  circulate) cause an infection but it can be a possibility. Better check with your doctor. \n\n3. The purpose of an eye-patch is to protect your eye from drying out and foreign bodies entering it. Constant eyedrops, even if it does not feel dry, worked for me. It is important to have eye-patch on at night as it as the most dangerous when u are toss and turning in bed. \n\nA substitute for eyepatches, if u feel uncomfortable, would be just using common medical tape and tape it shut gently. From experience, its better to stick the tape onto your hand first and then onto your eye as it can be too sticky. \n\n4. Through painful trial and error in these 2 weeks, it is better to do nothing other than gently pressing warm towels onto the affected side. Initially I was making great progress in the first week- smiling, blinking normally etc, and decided to try acupuncture. Progress was wiped after two sessions and the pain at night was no fun. Maybe it may work differently for you.\n\nGentle(!!!) messages with lotion can be done although the most important thing u can do is just to relax, destress and not let anxiety affect your mood. Basically avoid stimulating the affected side and let your body do the healing. \n\nI wish you all the best and hope you recover well. Thank you so much for your answers :)\nI was still worried this morning since I had lost more function compared to yesterday. So I went back in to see my doctor. He was not too concerned about it getting worse before getting better and gave me a salve for my eye which I have been using. I might also pick up some eye drops since he did not give me those which I could still use with my contacts in. He also did not think antivirals were necessary but if there is no side-effects to those I might try to convince him again tomorrow. Which anti-viral medication did you take/or is standard? I am in Europe so perhaps treatment here differs. \n\nI think I will also ask him about the face roller and a Lyme test tomorrow. I have not been bitten by a tick as far as I know, but I have since heard some second-person accounts of other people with BP and Lyme. \n\nAnd I read your advice for the eye taping a bit too late, haha. I just somewhat painfully removed some medical tape from my eyelid. I found it helps a lot to remove it horizontally as well though (from left to right or vice versa) instead of pulling up or down. It is definitely more comfortable than a huge eyepatch though, so I am glad I figured that out early thanks to you and this subreddit :) \n\nI hope you continue to recover more strength in your muscles and that my recovery is as speedy as yours. I will definitely stay away from acupuncture and other stimulating of the nerve besides gentle massage for now, and simply let it rest. \n\nThanks again for your answer! I appreciate it a lot :) The benefit of use of antivirals is kind of inconclusive in the research I did. My doctor prescribed it because I had active cold sores inside my mouth. But if you do not have an active flare, I have heard they sometimes do not. The prednisone is the most important part. In terms of the jade facial roller, I highly doubt it. The point of inflammation of cranial nerve 7 is usually in the bony knob behind your ear where the nerve passes through a bony canal in the skull. The nerve swells at that point, and is constricted by the canal, which causes the palsy. So I doubt rolling your facial muscles had anything to do with it. Not a doctor though. With my case, I used some facial oil at night and did a light massage. The main thing is rest, rest, rest. Your body is under a lot of stress right now. I took hour long meditation/prayer showers with essential oils, music, etc. to help stay calm. The prednisone made me sleep terribly (it is common), and I was so high strung and anxious. Be kind to yourself now. Take photos of your face doing a few things like raising eye brows, smiling, squeezing eyes, etc. and compare them to see small changes you would not otherwise see. I started really noticing recovery about 6 days post onset. Was pretty much fully recovered within 3 weeks. Hang in there! Hi, the anti viral I took was Acyclovir, 5x 800mg a day for 10 days.\n\nFor eyedrops, make sure u get the most basic ones. Mine is from \u201cRinz\u201d Normal Saline. It was part of the prescription from my doctor. 2 should be enough. \n\nDo not be worried about it getting worse as you are only on your second day. It may get worse throughout this week but rest assured u will recover well if u let your body rest and heal itself. \n\nNo problem and thank you for your well wishes. It does not hurt to be decent in today\u2019s world. \n\nA book you can read is \u201cMan\u2019s Search For Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl. I chanced upon it before getting this illness and it has helped me to stay strong. \n\n\u201cWas Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben\u201d (what you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you)\n\nRest well my friend. Small update: This is the end of day 5 now and I seem to slooowly be getting better. I have some sense of taste back and my face is slightly improving. I also wanted to reply again because that book you mentioned is one of my all-time favorites. Thanks for reminding me of it, I have been rereading quotes :)\n\n\"Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, the freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.\"\n\nTo return the favor: *The Courage to be Disliked* by Fumitake Koga and Ichiro Kishimi on the philosophy of Alfred Adler (another Austrian psychologist) absolutely changed my life. I hope that may bring you some comfort as well. Thank you again for your kindness x Hi much calmer, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 Thank you for your answer! It really did a lot to calm me down when I first read it. I have been able to focus more on resting and relaxing, which I was really struggling with when I posted this. I am also happy I followed your advice and took pictures, because today those helped me notice some small improvements! In retrospect I did probably have a small outbreak of cold sores. I had two painful spots in my mouth on the affected side about 5 days before my BP started. They were gone by then and I originally thought they were canker sores, so I had not considered their role in my situation. I still did not get on antivirals, but since I am improving slightly I think you are right that they are not always necessary. I hope my recovery will be similar to yours. Thank you again :) It is a great book indeed. \n\nThank you for the recommendation and I am glad that you are already getting better. I would advice you to not make it work so hard by trying to smile etc. Give it some time to rest and apply warm compress at least twice a day. \n\nGood luck! \n\nPS. For me I feel heavy lifting has helped in my recovery after I started lifting again on the 15th day(just a faint smile) of onset. After 2 sessions in 4 days, I can smile while showing both sides of my teeth now. If u had a habit of working out before onset, maybe u can resume after the second week and ease back into it. Also, I have replaced all carb intake with millet porridge and stuck to stir fried fresh chicken breast with different vegetables everyday. Maybe you can try it as well. Oh and plenty of Vitamin-B complex tablets( 3x a day)", "There are warning signs. It might not be a sneak up on you type of thing, at least in my case. I was diagnosed in March 2020 and am about 50% recovered (is stress is a factor in recovery, there is been a lot of it since then, if you know what I mean:).  Half my neck muscles also do not work as well.  For the past three years, I have noticed that my half my neck would get cramped while kayaking in winter. I thought it was just because the stiff rubber gasket on the drysuit was causing it.  I noticed my adams apple would slide sideways sometimes and I would have difficulty swallowing. I would simply push it back into place and be allowed to swallow.  Sometimes it would get cramped while trying to roll up after being underneath the water because you sometimes strain your neck when doing. I chalked all that up to just winter kayaking in a tight drysuit on risky rivers.  Ignoring these signs, which I did not know where signs, is probably part of the problem. I am unable to recognize what the stress factors are in my life to reduce the stress on the nerve.  The neck cramping and throat displacement are symptoms.  I need to find out how to destress so I can go kayaking again.  That was supposed to be a stress relief:) Accepting a high stress level in your life as normal might be the problem, but these days, good god man, what is not stressful? The entire world is on fire. I had about 24 hours notice with mine. Half of my face twitched uncontrollably all day. The next morning.. paralysis onset. 4 years later- still no movement. I do not trust a simple \u201ctwitch\u201d anymore. I just had a really painful migraine behind my eye and then I was diagnosed 3 days later and it is been three weeks with no pain and no movement Had you been experiencing migraines in the past year at a greater frequency? I too get migraines about 4 times a year about four days after being extremely tired (staying up all night with drinking, or working too hard outside) and dehydrated on the side of face that now has paralysis. I do not think any of us have any warning signs. I just woke up and it started.  I am saying that looking back over the past two years, my face and neck was already getting limp on the left side before the big shutdown and I did not realize that that was a symptom it was going to occur.  I am wondering if anyone else has gone backwards and looked at their life like that. We all think it happens suddenly like a light switch going on and off, but perhaps is it a long  process leading up to it and also away from it during recovery. I had throbbing pain above my ear 24 hours before I became paralyzed. Then hours before I had weird face pain, as if I had a migraine of my face. No I just got them out of no where and they got worst when I could not complete my exercises and I have been stressed about my life after college and barely sleeping (Sorry this comment is a lot longer than I anticipated) I got diagnosed on a Wednesday in January 2018 the Saturday before I had the stomach flu, and was in hospital Monday for dehydration and nausea medication. Out of work Tuesday Wednesday to recover and let my fever go down. Was back in hospital 1 in the afternoon Wednesday afternoon because I was sending selfies back and forth with my sister who was away at college at the time and one picture I was smiling fully, 5 minutes later the next picture I was not able to lift the corner of my mouth. I caught mine so early that they called a stroke code on me at the ER because I was not showing all symptoms yet, was one of the scariest days of my life. \n\nI had 0 symptoms leading up to in in the early months, I have always had frequent ear infections and respiratory infections so that was all normal for me at the time of year. I had just turned 26 at the time, but I also had chicken pox at age 5, and then stress induced shingles at 24, and they said that this virus is a similar strain as the chicken pox and shingles so I assume for me it was just a matter of time. I had bad ear pain for three days leading up to it. I too had the stroke scare, terrifying to say the least.  I also has a respiratory illness and fever the week prior, plus a lower back ache the week before that, which is also common for BP. Hope you have recovered considerably. What have you done to reduce stress in your life now that you have the diagnoses? For real! 2 cat-scans, so much blood being drawn, clothes getting torn away and replaced, 5 drs and all their students. It was...overwhelming to say the least, and then they kept me in the neurology unit overnight to be monitored and for an MRI the next morning. \n\nI have since been the therapy for a little over a year. I stopped going because it was not super helpful after a while. But I have got GAD, Social Anxiety, Depression, and a form of OCD called Excoriation. So it is kind of hard for me to NOT stress, but I have been handling it a bit better. \n\nMost days I am better, some I am not. I have got like 90% function of my face back thanks to Physical Therapy and Acupuncture, but that even took 8 months to do. And more so on top of that I got married that August so it healed up enough just in time.  \n\nI still get weakness in my face and drool, bite my tongue, or feel have a hard time forming certain words sometimes when I do get stressed, and I have been getting more migraines since then too. But I have just kind of accepted it for what it is. Stress is the silent killer of younger generations.  They do not have it the same as older generations. Wages stagnant, tuition 100% increased since 1995, while median income increased 45% in that time, the world is on fire, and now you have to take care of aging parents who might not have made the best use of their prime earning years to save for retirement. It is maddening and there seems to be no end in sight nor anyone fighting for our rights. Sorry about that, that is not helping either of us. \n\nSame here. I drive myself to urgen care because I did not want to pay for an ambulance and E.R. care.  When I got there, they looked me over, said I might have a stroke, might have BP, but wanted to send me to the ER in an ambulance to make sure. So two F'n bills and a ton of medical interns at the ER poking and prodding me. Then an uber back to get my car to pick up steroids.  \n\nI am glad you recovered close to 90%, I cannot seem to get to 75%.  I will try resting more. thank you. It seriously is, my parents had me fairly young, so they are still only in their 50s dad is a rock. Financially, health wise, emotionally, he has been there for me through everything. My biggest stressor in life (outside of work) is my mother. She is an alcoholic and has been as long as I can remember. Did a lot of digging with that through therapy. \n\nFinancially I am so grateful to be in the situation I am. I teach so while it is stressful I love my job. My kids were SO great when I returned to work too. I would get so busy that they would grab my eye drops from wherever I last left them in the classroom and be like hey Ms (my name) you have not blinked in a while you might want to use these! They were angels, it took them a couple days to get used to my face being like that but ultimately they got used to it and were amazing. \n\nIf you are not seeing much progress I seriously recommend acupuncture. I was a HUGE skeptic about it, but I waited a couple months before I started it and as early as the first appointment I was able to twitch the corner of my mouth. I remember that day where she was like sometimes people get emotional and it is okay, and in my head I was like yeah right okay let us see. She walked out and within 5 minutes I was crying, it was a huge emotional release and I always felt so much better after. I genuinely give a lot of credit to my acupuncturist and physical therapist for making me better", "Posible cure to Bell\u2019s palsy! I want to share with many of you our story! My husband got the West Nile virus, spent a week at the hospital and then while being at home i noticed his eyes were like not synchronized when opening and closing, i did not think of it as a bad thing, 3 days later he panicked when he woke up not feeling his left side on his face! Diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy, he was devastated! But his aunt had just gone through the same just weeks ago, she told us about this vitamin injections they have in mexico and since we live in el Paso TX its easier to get them for us, i gave him 2 shots a week for 3 weeks, after day 4 of using them we noticed a huge change! By week 2 he was back to normal! We also did the massage therapy recommended by his doctor. The Name of those shots is Beyodecta Tri! I suffer from anemia most of the time and after taking this shots once a week i feel so much better and different!! Healthier! Hope this helps all of you who struggle with Bells Palsy Oh I forgot to mention that the first 10 days he was on that medication that i guess most people get when diagnosed with this horrible thing! Along with the shots i gave him. Bells Palsy is caused by inflammation that crushes (or kills) the facial nerve.  \n\nWe take steroids to reduce the inflammation and anti-virals to kill whatever virus caused the inflammation.\n\nEverything else we do is to try to help repair/rebuild the damaged/dead nerve.  B vitamins are commonly thought to help with nerve repair, so I imagine that these Mexican vitamin shots might be able to help. Is there any scientific studies done on this? Interesting... ( Vitamin ( ( and ( I have had bells twice and both cleared up after two weeks with just regular steroids &gt;Everything else we do is to try to help repair/rebuild the damaged/dead nerve.  B vitamins are commonly thought to help with nerve repair, so I imagine that these Mexican vitamin shots might be able to help.\n\nTime to go to Mexico :) I am 3 months in and just started weekly vitamin B injections (also got mine from Mexico). I have seen more improvement in the last 2 weeks than I have in the last 3 months. \n\nI do not know if it is a coincidence or not but I am going to keep giving myself these injections that is for sure!", "More than 2 years, still no recovery. I am in the half of my second year and I am still in nowhere near a perfect smile. My mouth is still far from symmetry, and I still cannot blink properly. I had this since June 2017, I just do not know what to do. I just really want to see my smile back. I had therapy before and I was on prescription with vitamin Bs, it did improved but not my smile. Sometimes, I just avoid smiling, I seldom look in the mirror. If I take pictures, I always make it sure that my face was taken in the unaffected side just to hide this \"facial scar.\" I do not know doing exercises now will help, since I have stopped doing anything for more than a year already. I have stopped hoping for sometime believing that mine is a hopeless case.\n\nI was thinking of having some botox for some \"short relief\" but I think such is expensive. Was yours caused by a virus or from stress? I really do not know. Just woke up one day like that. But I was in law school that time and was aching for a unrequented love. Yeah, sounds cheesy. That was probably stress. I did not took antivirals though. I was not given any of prescription on that. Sounds like stress induced. 2 years? I would try some type of physical therapy or massage therapy ... or changing your diet... We are on the same boat. I got mine June of 2017 as well. I have learned to live with it. People do not notice unless I tell them. I do facial exercises but still have not fully recovered. I have even stopped doing any type of research. About 2 months ago I was tearing from my eye alot. When I eat I tear also. I joined the Reddit Community for some support and or people who have the same issue. I love to hear when epople recover. I hardly hear any cases like our. I too am in that same boat.  First occurrence of BP in 2011, very slow recovery, ~85%.  Second occurrence of BP in 2017, slightly better recovery, ~90%.  I too also produce tears when I eat and my face is very asymmetrical, especially when I smile or laugh.  I also lost the ability to whistle.  I really dislike looking at myself in the mirror. Yeah I cannot wistle nor pucker up for a good kiss, but I cannot agree with you at disliking to see myself in the mirror. Be confident and embrace the face. Idk if you find yourself looking at people's faces but slot of people who do not have BP do not have the perfect smiles and their faces are not asymmetrical as well. I hope u look at yourself in the mirror and admire the beautiful person u are.", "Anyone else ever feel tightness across the nose? Whenever I blink, every now and again I feel this tightness across the side of my nose. I can move this muscle pretty well, weaker than the right but I can twitch it. But all of a sudden it just feels like it does not want to budge when I blink, yet I can still move it independently?\n\nI am on day 9, coming up to day 10, hoped the worst of the paralysis had passed but this has got me worried", "Bells palsy came back just 1 week after recovery! :( Has anybody here had this happen? It happened to me at work tonight. I have just gotten over a case of BP that I had for a couple of weeks. Should I be worried? What medications were you on? A second round of steroids and antivirals might be in order. When I went in the first time they only gave me the steroids. The doctor who took me at the eelr didnt give me anti virals because \"He did not believe in them\" Remember, the guy that graduates last in his class is still called Doctor. Find a better doctor and get on better meds. You are right about that my man. I will get right on it and post how it goes. Mine came back too I just finished a second round of antiviral and steroids.

I take steroids and vitamins and it is more than I can swallow. I cannot clearly remember but I think the doctor said ranitidine is only needed if my stomach aches because of the steroids. Do not take it if the steroids do not bother your stomach Thank you", "Long term Bell's palsy: Has anyone tried botox treatment? So I have had Bell's palsy for almost 10 months now. I am about 70% healed, I cannot smile (about 50% smirk) with minimal  movement in my forehead and have crazy skinesis when I attempt to do either. I  am still healing a little bit every day, but its really minimal, things are sore and i am constantly massaging in an effort to restore muscle movement.\n\nI have tried Acupuncture. It did not really do anything\n\nI am starting physical therapy Tuesday to try  and see what they can do for me.\n\nI have heard that people have used botox to help with the skinesis. Right now mine is so bad my eye completely shuts when I attempt to smile. I just wanted to see how it worked out for anyone that had tried. I posted this about 4 years ago. ( . Subsequently I had sessions with Jackie on and off for about 3 years and had Botox treatment with it.  She now is in private practice and does much of her appointments over Skype. But she works with a local doctor (helpful for me!) who does Botox based on her recommendations (inactivating  certain muscles that are way over active!) :) I found these treatments to be incredibly helpful. I had BP almost 6 years ago. I still have obvious synkinesis despite treatment but compared with how I felt 4.5 years ago, it is much better. She has published an article about Botox. I do not know if you have found it. But I will see if I can find a link to it. Omg this was great I have been debating Botox for years and think now I will really do it. Thanks for the information!! This is some great information I will see if I can work with my GP and see who can help. I have been doing a lot of the retraining exercises and have been taking vitamin b (off and on I need to be more consistent). Thanks for the information OMG- your posts are the first real information that I have read.  Sometimes you can go down the rabbit hole of crazy on Facebook and here with so much misinformation.  I was shocked when I listened to her (Jackie) video when she said 85% heal in 3 months.  \nI am almost 7 months in and I think I have the synkinesis (sp) after I read the information you posted.  \nI have that dimple in my chin now.  \nI am devastated.", "Just got diagnosed. Thought I had a stroke while I was asleep but the doctors said it was Bells. I have almost full paralysis on the right side of my face and I cannot taste anything on the right side of my tongue.  Is there anything I can do to speed up recovery? The doc just gave me some steroid pills and referred me for an MRI but they are so swamped here in El paso I cannot get seen for a month. I am only 29 and been very depressed  today. I was supposed to get married in a few months but I will not even be able to smile properly. Does anything help? sorry that you are part of the club. hope you recover quickly!\n\nmake sure to ask for anti viral pills along with your steroids\n\nif you can make it to acupuncture, it is been a godsend for me. they say to start early as possible.\n\ntry to relax, sleep, and massage your face often. try not to go too crazy with trying to move your face or do exercises early. just chill for a while. Thanks for the acupuncture tip. I have seen that around but never in my life tried it. Should I be playing on my phone, looking at screens or even reading books? Does that cause more eye strain? It is really just you against time, some things that helped were staying true to my daily routines and not thinking about my diagnosis as much. I was about 90 percent healed after a month. Also, B12 vitamins helped me a lot. It is up to you. If it strains your eyes, then maybe not. make sure to use eye drops a lot. \n\nAlso, learn to tape your eye for sleeping and get an eye patch. lots of videos on youtube about massaging, taping, and stretching the face. Go early. I am on my second bout of bell's palsy (first time 10 years ago), and this time I waited 6 weeks before going to acupuncture because I did not want to spend the money and I regret it. In my experience it does encourage healing. I would have acupuncture and then a day later have new movement. Okay thank u I will try that tomorrow. Did u ever get back to 100 percent? Did you taste ever come back. I am no pig but I like good tasting food lol. I had to use a fork to eat a hamburger and push it into the left side of my mouth. Almost started crying in the restaurant when some food went to the right cause  it taste like chewing on a towel. I will try some tape. Already got an eye patch but it gets very uncomfortable when I try sleeping.  Thanks for all the help random internet stranger I appreciate u answering my questions. I had mine at 18. Just like you I woke up and thought I was having a stroke. I took steroids and antivirals the day it started. It was really tough especially since I was so young (30 now) but in about 3 weeks I was back to normal. The most important thing is to take your steroids, protect your eye (SO IMPORTANT) and try to not get too sad about it. Definitely stay away from anything that will make you scared (like stories about people who never get better). These things made me so upset for no reason. For the vast majority of people it is temporary. Good luck!  If you need to talk about it let me know! Thanks so much. I am a welder I work around bright lights all the time. I am not sure how easy it will be to avoid  them but I will try. b vitamins, and get on a course of prednisone ASAP. if y9u do not use prednisone within the first 4 days of diagnosis then you miss their chance to help you have a better chance at full recovery Yeah I have been at 100 for a while now. I was diagnosed in may so you can imagine how difficult my summer was in the beginning. I had a mild case it was not too severe but I did lose my taste. That being said, if you stick to your meds and do slight therapy you you are on track to making a great recovery. Hi there\u2026I am into my fourth week (I am 60) now. That first week is rough! I did get my taste back. My mouth is not 100% but honesty no one would notice but me. Progress is very slow though.  Do not stress, you should be fine for your wedding! And congratulations \u2764\ufe0f Most people start seeing and feeling improvement in a week or so, though I was convinced I would not, (there are scary stories out there)\u2026I was completely paralyzed on one side.  Stress is not your friend right now.  Have faith, take care, relax, take your meds, feel sorry for yourself \u2018cause this really sucks. Then cheer yourself up by making wedding plans! I was diagnosed a week ago today, on my right side too. I am coming to the end of the steroids and antivirals now. Had my first acupuncture session yesterday and they said the sooner you start the better. They seemed pretty confident which was some positivity I needed. \n\nB12 vitamins have also been recommended a lot. \n\nBe patient, get a lot of rest and have a faith that you will make a speedy recovery. Anecdotal but an aggressive amount of B12 helped me - both my doctor and acupuncturist recommended B12. My acupuncturist actually told me to get shots of B12 and take the sublingual B12. \n\nAcupuncture helped a lot for me, in terms of pain relief, bringing down the inflammation and just being forced to take a break for an hour without any distractions. My BP came on after a year of intense stress, and now I feel pain or pressure building behind my ear whenever work gets particularly stressful. \n\nLysine supplements too. I took a lot of anti-inflammatory supplements like curcumin. And an anti-inflammation diet reboot. \n\nA good quality jade roller helped relieve the pain and I put CBD cream/oil on the affected part of my face. Just make sure to use artificial tears and tape the eye. Overnight you can use an ointment to help keep it moist for longer along with the tape Hi there! I got Bell's back in August (I am 20) and was terrified that I was going to look the way I look when I go back to in-person college classes. I am now 2,5 months in and most people do not notice anything at all (I would say around 85-90% recovered) - just me and my physiotherapist notice. The first weeks were really rough. I did not have any improvements for weeks, that can feel very depressing. But it WILL get better, I promise! As other posters have also said, recovery is SLOW - slow, but steady. You should be fine for your wedding though!! Most people recover within 3 months.\n\nThis community helped me a lot. Just get the rest you need right now and make sure to take prednisolone. \n\nI am wishing you a speedy recovery :)", "Twitching Hello Im 5 weeks into recovery and im starting to get slight twitching on my non affected side. It is kind of wierd had this happend to anyone else in recovery. Im starting to think it may be hitting my other side? Any thoughts. I am about 18 months recovered, and I have had that too at varying points in time without any kind recurrence.  I think once you have had BP, you become a lot more aware of your facial muscles and cranial nerves.  The twitches may be normal and you are just noticing them more now than you would have before.  \n\nFYI: This sub is kind of hit or miss for responses - I had better luck with the Facebook group called \n\nBell's Palsy &amp; Facial Paralysis\nSupport (Group Page)\n\nGood luck! Hi, my guess is that the non-affected side is over compensating for the BP side, so it could just be a case of tired facial muscles. \n\nI only had twitching on my BP side, which is when I really started to notice some recovery. Within 2-3 weeks of this my my face was 90% back to normal. When mine started twitching that is when it started getting better. Personal experience tho. Im getting on my side that is not affected .

Had vertigo so bad I fell down a lot but I have Ramsay Hunt syndrome. It is worth checking for I would get this checked. I went to my Family Physician and an eye doctor after my ER visit. They advised me and also ensured that I was getting the correct treatment for my condition. They looked in my ears in the ER on Friday and said everything looks fine. I do not think my eye is dried out. It still closes (though not tightly) and the vision looks ok if I am looking through one eye at a time. It is when I first get up from laying down that this seems to be worse. Definitely get this checked, my doctor at the time advised an MRI if I notice double vision or affected hearing\n\nThis is because these two nerves are located beside the facial nerve, of you have double vision it may be a stroke, not bells palsy My doctor ordered an MRI but the soonest they can get me in is Tuesday. I am trying to stay calm. In the meantime they said because the double vision is only temporary upon waking they do not think it is a stroke and are reassured by my clear CT scan on Friday. \nToday my right ear hurts and the vertigo continues. It is constant and pretty significant dizziness. \nGod, I hope I am ok! Sorry to get you worried just better safe than sorry, it can be multiple things causing the swelling and inflammation around the facial nerve for whatever reason could be affecting the hearing and vision \n\nCauses can be herpes simplex, apparently even if you do not get cold sores bells palsy as a result of inflammation can happen \n\nAlso been more prevalent with covid happening, some people who got the vaccine reported it, as far as I am aware I have never had covid, no symptoms with myself or my family but you never know \n\nIn my case I am 24 and had a wisdom tooth emerge in the upper right side of my mouth and the crowding caused a fair bit of swelling, still never got a confirmation on what it was exactly but prednisolone (steroid) reduced the inflammation and after 3-4 weeks I noticed a sudden quick improvement then by 5 weeks back to normal\n\nIt is most likely something mundane and not serious at all, it is just a symptom that can in rare cases indicate a stroke I would bet you are going to be fine but best of luck regardless :) I am having double vision as well. I am sorry. This symptom has me terrified, though my doctor must not be too concerned since I have to wait a week to get my MRI. They told me since it goes away after I am awake and oriented it is not likely a stroke. It did take me like an hour to come out of it today...\nWhat are you experiencing? No worries. I am scared regardless! I just wish I had some relief. I have been dizzy for more than a week. Maybe it is slightly improved the past two days, but still debilitating enough that I cannot drive or even feel comfortable walking around. My doctor prescribed over the counter motion sickness meds but it just makes me really tired. My doctor was worried so I had to go to the ER for a cat scan, all came back well. But the ER doc was pretty sure my eye has an abrasion, so I am using a couple different eye drops and taping my eye shut when I sleep. Maybe try that? I know you are freaked, I am too. Let us support one another through this, since no one can relate to us.. shot me a PM if you want to chat.", "Cold after taking medicine Has anyone started to get a cold after taking the Antiviral and steroid medication ? Also can I take cold medicine while taking the medication I was prescribed ? Also, I forgot to mention to my doc that I took Aleve the day before my appointment with them They say Aleve will help due to the anti inflammatory factor of the medicine  I have been freezing and unable to get warm since I have had BP.  They said it was the virus acting and to try to stay as warm as possible and bundle up. ", "Excruciating facial/side of head pain?? Hey everyone, hope you are all doing well. I was diagnosed in early September with bells palsy, which started after severe jaw/facial pain, and escalated to complete facial/neck paralysis on the right side. It is now late December and I have regained some movement, but the last few days I have had severe (what I think is) nerve pain in my face and on the side of my head on the affected side. It feels like someone is driving a knife into my face underneath my cheek bone and dragging it across my face and toward my ear. It used to happen maybe once every couple of hours and lasted about 10 seconds. Now it is happening about every 5 minutes and lasting for about 30 seconds. My doctor(s) do not really seem like a helpful option at this point, with their advice being that \"this is a head scratcher, because they do not know what caused it\" and then try to send me on my way with gabapentin and pain pills (I have taken neither this entire time). My question is, is this normal for recovery? This amount of pain?", "My bells palsy progress in 8 days!  When I was diagnosed with bells palsy last Saturday I found a lot of doom and gloom things that really freaked me out, and a helpful redditor pointed out that a lot of the people who recover do not stay to update, so I just wanted to share my progress from last Saturday to now, my sense of taste is not fully back and I feel VERY sick from the medicine but my face is now completely back to normal! Man you are so lucky. It took 9 months before I saw any improvement whatsoever! I am happy for you, it really is a horrible condition.", "20 months update While I am thankful that I have recovered most of it and people do not even notice if when I talk to them. But deep down I know it is not symmetrical. I tend to ignore it but when I look at my photos I can clearly notice the differences. I had most difficulty in my right eyes, it is still not 100 recovered, I can completely close it but when I open It is not same as left eye. In my pictures I see that right eyes are smaller then left one. Any recommendation to make sure both eyes looks similar ? I have been trying eyes exercises but it is not helping much. I think that there are some muscles are behind my eyes which I do not have control to move. No advice to give.  I am in the same boat.  18 months since I lost function.  \\~90-95% recovered.    \nIt is not obvious that there is something not quite right unless you look close.  I can definitely feel the difference though.  My left eye does not open as wide as my right.  My blink is uneven.   My nose only closes on the right side if I sniff really hard.  (would not have thought that was a muscle thing, but...).  My wife says the differences are more obvious when I am tired or have had a few drinks.  My beard hides a lot, but I can definitely feel a lot of difference in my cheeks when I smile.  Same as you, I have been doing cheek exercises but they do not seem to do anything. Maybe accupuncture?  They might be able to stimulate those muscles.  I am about 90-95% recovered also but it is been about 5 years.  I still see little improvements, but it has also left me with tinnitus in my right ear.  \n\nI agree with the tiredness exacerbating the symptoms - If I get stressed I will have twitches under my eye and will feel nerve pain behind my right ear.  All in all, it is a pain in the butt, but I know people who have a lot worse problems so I am grateful for all the good things I do have.", "Should I be worried? All day Friday my youngest felt numb and I could not taste anything. That night when brushing my teeth I was slobbering everywhere and that is when I realized my face was dripping on my right side. I went to the ER and was diagnosed with BP. They gave me a steroid there and sent me home with a prescription for more for 7 days. \n\nI can fully close my eye and have some movement on that side of my face so I guess I am lucky and have a milder case. I can still eat and everything too. I took my first prescribed steroid this morning so I got it treated quickly. \n\nDoes anybody know how long this lasts? Should I be worried about permanent problems? I am a 26 year old guy of that matters. If you can already close your eye, you are probably in for a short bout of BP! That is great!\n\nI am over 5 weeks in and have a little progress in my mouth, but little going on for my eye. I have a fairly severe case, but I am still anticipating that I will recover most of my movement (had it a decade ago on the other side and I seemed to heal a little faster that time, but it was still at least a month until I got any movement back.)\n\nBe patient and rest as much as you can. My husband had a relatively mild case two years ago (I know, what is the probability of both of us getting it?!), and he was mostly recovered in 10 days.\n\nGood luck! Have you regained functionality - \"I can fully close my eye\", etc - or did you not lose it in the first place?\n\nIf you have already regained some functionality, you basically won the BP lottery. If you only got hit with a subset of symptoms, you basically won the BP lottery.\n\n&gt; Should I be worried?\n\nThe answer to this is always \"no\". Stress and anxiety cannot help, and might make things worse... they might have been factors that contributed to the BP event in the first place. Many people get BP during particularly stressful times, and many who remain stressed and anxious do not have good recoveries. It is not a simple causal relationship  - the only thing about BP that we know with total certainty is that we do not know all of the how is and why is. A virus, stress, *something* caused inflammation, and the nerve that controls your face passes through bone so when it became swollen the signals got choked off. That is it. BP is not an affirmative diagnosis, it is an exclusionary diagnosis: they went down the list of other things it might be and found nothing, so they call it BP.\n\nSo, in general, no, and in your particular case, no.\n\n&gt; Does anybody know how long this lasts?\n\nAnywhere from days to the rest of your life. If you are already regaining functionality, it will likely be closer to days than to weeks. For most people it is on the scale of weeks. Most people who have not fully recovered at 6 months do not fully recover, or they continue to slowly regain functionality and then have subsequent events (and it is not clear whether those events were actually 'subsequent'... perhaps the original event had a reduction in symptoms for a while, then returned to full strength, so it was actually just one long ongoing event). You have an approximately 7% chance of having a recurring event sometime in your lifetime... could be 70 years from now, could be tomorrow. But the number of people who continue to have weird sensations without ever having a second BP event is much, much higher: only a fraction of a percent never feel anything weird after their first event.\n\nAs I am typing this, I am having changes in my hearing: BP slackened the muscles that the auditory canal passes through, so there is a different timbre or reverberation (that we do not normally even recognize exists, until something like a BP event changes it). There is a lot of noise reaching my ear from inside me: swallowing, breathing, I can even hear my pulse. This comes and goes, every few months. I consider myself lucky that this is, so far, the only recurring symptom. (And that active noise-cancellation earbuds have one microphone pointing inward, to specifically block these sounds. As a bonus they also block every other damned thing that would keep me awake.)\n\nTake the anti-inflammatories, they address the root problem. Many - most? - doctors also prescribe antivirals, because nerve inflammation can be caused by viruses that like to camp out along nerves (such as herpes, i.e. \"cold sores\").  (If you are willing to share: were you offered antivirals? If you were not, what part of the world are you in? There are regional variations in treatment, it is helpful for the *next* person who comes along to know what to expect from their doctor.) \n\nTake care of yourself - like, *actively* take care of yourself. Reduce stress, eat right, drink electrolytes. Get good sleep. Apply heat to the affected area (heat pad, hot towel, hot bath, whatever resource you have). Massage, *lightly*. (Some parts of the world use electrostimulation, but the WHO has done studies that showed such treatments to have either no effect or a slightly *negative* effect... the nerve is already swollen and out of commission, there is no point in making it pissed off too.) You want that nerve to have every reason to get better and every resource it needs in order to restore functionality. Think of it like a friend who needs your support in these trying times.\n\nIt does not sound like you will need it, but: good luck. ", "5 months in between these photos. Healing... slowly. \ud83e\udd74  You look great! It is frustrating when it takes a while (I am 10 months out and still am not a 100%). You will get there \u2764\ufe0f Can see the progress!

And it was as bad if not worse than your vid. Get your meds and I strongly recommend getting B12 shots. I mean, it affects everyone differently, so I would not say it is not \"serious,\" but I recovered after a few weeks to 99% and after several years, I am 100%.  It is important to monitor your symptoms and progress. Try to protect that side of your ear and face from the cold. Cold can exacerbate it. If you must be out in the cold, try to wear a scarf or something. First time can be rough, mate. Stay positive, take your meds, look up some exercises to help regain. Over a year later from my first attack as an adult (had two attacks in 35 years, with 20+ years separating) and I am at 98% back. \n\nBe well! Serious was probably a wrong choice of words on my behalf but I was comparing to the fact that I went hospital with suspected stroke so not so serious compared to what I thought it was but thanks for all information that I have already and may receive on this vid i do appreciate every comment and hopefully it will all help towards a quick recovery bk to normality Be aware that it might get a bit worse before it gets better. On the day my paralysis started, I had about as much movement as you do in this vid, but the day after I had much less movement.\n\nThat being said, by taking the prescribed adrenal cortex hormone and anti vitals, and doing face exercises, I was back to 99% movement in about a months time.\n\nI wish you a swift recovery, and feel free to ask if you have any questions. In your boat, symptoms started 12/29, diagnosed 12/31, way to end 2020... Bells Palsy is not serious. You will get better in around 2-3 weeks and most probably will see a full recovery within 2 months? Mine was like yours &amp; trust me, you will get better! Feel free to message me anytime if you have any questions! Stay safe x Follow your doctor and make sure to take meds on time.  It will heal in time. I second this! Faster you get to see a doctor for meds and shots the better. Mine lasted 6 weeks and have made I would say 80% recovery so far. Thanks for posting this. Same happened to me, my movement got worse for a couple days after starting meds. A week in now without change and your post gave me some hope. I saw absolutely zero improvement until day 12, were I was suddenly able to move my eyebrow a tiiiny little bit. After that, it got better by the day.\n\nI did face exercises 3 times a day, and some extra exercises whenever I felt like it (like practicing blinking when watching TV).\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions :) This also gives me hope!  Symptoms started on December 24th and I was also able to start prednisone the same day.  Currently day 11 and literally zero improvement.  I am hoping to see something positive in the next week.", "Face Pain? I have read a couple of posts here and they talk about the pain. My face burns when I touch it, like it is one massive deep bruise. Even when something as light as my hair brushes my cheek I have intense pain. \n\nIs this how others have felt/feel? And have you taken Ibuprofen/co-codamols or just plain paracetamol for it? \n\nIt is like toothache, in that it is constant but is the whole left side of my face and neck. \n\nI am on day 21, and have about 50-60% recovered but this pain is something else! I have had a small amount of pain but not that much. Generally a couple of ibuprofen take care of it and it is not constant. \n\nYou may want to bring it up with your doctor just to make sure it is not and indication of something else. Yes, a very intense pain, but it is not everyone. There are working medications, see a doctor about it. Pregabalin worked for me. Thank you, \n\nI take pregabalin for anxiety and migraines but it does nothing for the pain. I plan on seeing my Dr about it tomorrow. I plan on seeing my Dr about it tomorrow. Thank you.\nIt is just reassuring to know it is all part of the \u201cillness\u201d. I hear ya. I have read from a lot of others that there tends to be varying levels of pain associated with BP. I would not let it get me worked up. It is worth asking a pro, but I do not think it is worth letting it cause anxiety. \n\nAt any rate, I hope the doc can help provide some comfort and you get well soon! Good luck, I hope you find the right medication because this pain really is something. I had intense pain after my onset of Bells. I was in and out of the ER. About the third visit they diagnosed me with Trigeminal Neuralgia and I went through two or three (e.g. Gabapentin) anti seizure meads to counteract the pain. Maybe bring it up with your doctor to see what they think? OP, just checking in. I hope the doctor eased your mind and was able to provide some comfort for you. That is sweet of you, thank you! \n\nYes, the Dr told me it was normal and gave me stronger co-codamols for it. She also said to try some ibuprofen cream for my shoulders and neck, which are stiff as a side affect of me being tense all the time because my face hurts.", "Bells palsy hairloos In bells palsy can we have receding hairline problem ?\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 No that is ball\u2019s palsy I have not seen that as a symptom of Bell's Palsy, but if you were prescribed Prednisone (as most are), some experience side effects like ( which can (albeit rare) cause hair loss/recession. Tnx best of luck, hope you get through all of this soon.", "Newest inductee of the famous Bell\u2019s palsy Hey guys, n00bie here! I was diagnosed Tuesday April 27 of this year so I am relatively new. Prior to that date though a few things were off about my taste, I could still taste but not 100% if that makes sense. \n\nRewind to this past Sunday and I noticed I could not blink fully on my left side, I mean I could still blink just not as hard as my right eyelid? If that makes sense, luckily, I have not had to use tape to shut my eye off because I can still close it enough to sleep and get through the day. \n\nFast forward back to Tuesday the 27th, I set up a zoom meeting with my neurologist, she was able to see through the camera that my left side was weak so she diagnosed me with Bell\u2019s palsy. That same day she prescribed me prednisone and valacyclovir (substitute for valtrex) and I have been on both since then. \n\nIm taking prednisone and am tapering off of it day by day. My prescription is 60mg of prednisone the first day and then decrease by 10 mg everyday until I am done with the medication and the valacyclovir will finish the same day (those are 2 per day) \n \nI have severe health anxiety and have spiraled into a rabbit hole before where I have gained weight and lost myself. Not this time though. I have grown mentally stronger. I will beat this and so will all of you. \n\nSome words of encouragement would be nice though, I am wishing all of you guys a speedy recovery and hopefully you will all be back to your own sexy selves in no time. Do not let anxiety or depression knock you down! Mine took 8 months to recover and I am still only like 95% three years later. Each person has their own experience and unfortunately patience is the biggest issue. I share this because was I was in the hospital googling it and everything kept saying give it three weeks. It just was not my story. Do you have corrected vision? I have tips for that. Straws are your friend. It will be okay. I did the same prescriptions and acupuncture from 8 weeks to 5 months in. You would not know now looking at me but I still have residual issues.\n\nEdit: seek a therapist if you need to and talk about all your feelings towards it. I slurred my words and did not recognize myself in the mirror. It was a very tangible identity crisis and talking through these issues helped me a lot I was diagnosed yesterday! I am also on antiviral meds and prednisone. I called out of work for the next few days because I do not want anyone to see me (or hear me) like this, if I am being honest. Reading everyone is stories about how it is taken so much longer to recover than originally thought is kind of disheartening. I am used to wearing contacts and makeup everyday, which is currently not an option. I do not want people to see me eat in the break room like this, so I guess I will eat in my car. I know that sounds ridiculous, but I had never even heard of Bell\u2019s palsy before yesterday and I do not know how to deal with it Mine took 4 months to fully recover, and yours might even take quicker because you started your medication way earlier than I did. You WILL beat this! \u2764\ufe0f That is how I was when I was first diagnosed! I did not even know this was a thing \ud83d\ude02 I think it is important to acknowledge that not everyone \u201cbeats this\u201d. Most do, and I really hope that you do too! Please know that regardless of whether or not you heal, you are beautiful! Fellow health anxiety person here... I am sure you obviously know already that the recovery time and effectiveness for BP is different for everyone. Best advice I can give is come to terms with the reality of the situation and still live your life to the absolute fullest. BP really showed me not to take things for granted. The positive outlook definitely made the recovery process easier, and reduced stress is something that will aid in the effectiveness and speed of your recovery. \n\nOne thing that really helped me... If you have a lot of trouble with your eye not being able to shut, I would look at getting a weighted eye mask for sleeping. It really helped because it kept my eye shut at night so it would not dry out. \n\nHope you have a speedy recovery! I felt exactly the same way. I got it during a big lockdown so I was lucky to just be able to have video off during our meetings, but I knew it was easy to tell my speech was slurred. I felt super self conscious and it hurt my confidence quite a bit.\nEating was super difficult too. That part sucked. Really hurt my self image to not be able to \"eat like an adult\". \nWhat you are feeling is totally normal!    \n\nHaving said that, what really helped me is that people did not let up and forced me to keep working hard. In my first meeting I was super self aware. In the 20th call I had almost forgetten about it and focused on the topic we were discussing. Distraction and necessity are great.\n\nAlso - Bell's takes time to recover from, but it does get better. I am basically fully recovered now, but the first two weeks were really rough because for me there was zero improvement. Thank you! I really appreciate you letting me know I am not alone in how I am feeling!", "My mom (42yo) just got diagnosed and we are both worried that she may not fully recover. Worried because of the pain she has. Also no insurance. B complex? Acupuncture? Any advice and tips would be helpful. We went to the hospital about 12 hours after the symptoms started. The ER doc told her it was BP and prescribed her 60mg prednisone everyday for 7 days and 200mg aciclovir 5 times a day for 10 days. They did not even give her bloodwork at the ER. Since she has no insurance we are debating if we should see a neurologist. I have had this years ago and went to one but the neurologist did not do anything different than what my PCP did. She just ran a mri or ct scan I cannot remember and a seizure test but it seems kind of useless? I could be wrong though. \n\nThe paralysis is on her left side and she has pain behind her ear? But it is closer the the back of the head (CLOSE TO THE BACK OF THE EAR) on her left side. The doc told her that was normal but I am not convinced. She describes the pain as if it is a muscle cramp and she has the same pain close to her cheekbone. Is this kind of pain and area normal? It is been 3 days and her face got more droopy.\n\nThe nurse told her that she should take B complex but we are not sure how much or if it is okay to take it right now with all the meds she is on. \n\nI found her crying today and I am trying to be there for her but I cannot do much. It is a waiting game but I just tell her that she is going to fully recover and that people with more severe BP fully recover but tbh I am not sure. I only tell her this because her eye closes about 90% and her eyebrow VERY SLIGHTLY moves when she raises her eyebrows but other than that her left side is fully paralyzed. Hi.  The left side of my face was fully paralyzed.  It did get worse/more droopy before it got better BUT I did 100% get better.  My doctor said I had a pretty serious case, too.  I was 27F at the time.\n\nI also experienced a lot of pain on my ear and jaw bone.  This was the first thing to get better and how I knew the meds were working.\n\nThey also did not do bloodwork or any sort of scan (MRI/CT) for me... dr said there was no point really.  I took prednisone and antivirals like your mom is and I got better.  \n\nDeep breaths.  Practice self care, too. Let me start by saying that I am sorry that you and your mom are having to deal with this, especially with everything else going on in the world. I know that dealing with BP can be scary for both the person going through it as well as the people around them. I was diagnosed at the end of May and it was a rollercoaster of emotions, but I am probably 95% recovered now, so recovery might seem like an impossibility, but there is always hope.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed, my doctors did not give me a sure diagnosis either - they just ruled everything else out - but the pain that she is describing sounds exactly like what I had experienced. During the worst times, I could not sleep due to the pain (and I tried everything from hot/cold compresses, Advil, and even muscle rub). My doctor told me that it was due to an inflamed nerve, and the one thing that temporarily helped ease the pain was applying pressure to that part of my head (for me it was right behind my ear lobe).\n\nMy situation did get worse before it got better, I did not see any major improvement until about 3 weeks in. For the record, I did take a B-12 methylcobalamin supplement, which I saw recommended on this sub. However, one of the main things to watch out for is dryness of the affected eye. I am sure her doctor already told her, but if she is unable to shut her left eye, she may want to get eye lubricating drops and an eye patch for the time being. I will be praying for you and your mom. I know that BP takes it is toll while you are going through it, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. If there is anything else I can help with, feel free to shoot me a PM. Thanks for your comment. Should she be massaging her face right now or should she wait? Also I have heard that the face can sink in but I am not sure if that is true but any way to prevent it? Thank you for your comment. I am glad you are almost fully recovered from this. She says massaging the areas relieves the pain for a while. The doc actually did not tell her about the eye thing so I am definitely buying her eye drops and an eyepatch tomorrow morning. Is b-12 the same as b complex? What was your dose? And is it okay to massage her face this early into recovery? Also thanks again. I had BP episode with similar symptoms \\, and  pain at the back of my ear. The prescription was very similar to what your mother's: prednisone and aciclovir.  I took extra, over the counter Vit B in the morning.  Day 2,  I began the acupuncture, cupping and herbal treatment therapy for about a month. By the end of month, all symptoms were almost gone. Some may say, acupuncture and such are bullshit, but no harm to try it. Gentle massage now might help alleviate the pain. Just go easy with it. My face looked droopy until I got motion back in it. Now some 15 years later I still get occasional pain but only when I am stressed or sick. I also get occasional twitches on that side of my face, again usually when I am very stressed and/or sick. Gentle massage behind my ear usually makes the pain go away. The severity of pain and time for recovery depend on a lot of things; there is no way of knowing how it will go down until it does. Getting lots of rest is probably the best thing for her to do right now. I will definitely let her know to gently massage the areas. I also had it 3-4 years ago and I 100% recovered but also get pain and twitching when I am super stressed out. It is weird. Yeah you are right there is no harm in trying. What type of vitamin b and what dosage were you taking? Thank you, it is been a journey but having my family around me definitely helped with my recovery so your presence probably helps your mom more than you know.\n\nAs far as I can tell, a B complex contains all of the B vitamin variants so that should be the same, and I just took the recommended dose that it said on the label. As for massaging her face, as long as it does not cause her pain or discomfort it likely is not a problem! I was diagnosed 2 weeks ago and I am about 90% recovered. I did the acupuncture route with electric pulses sent through the needles to stimulate the muscles, after about a week I started to see improvement, after two weeks I am almost normal.  For everyone I have talked to the key to a quick recovery is start acupuncture ASAP, I do 3x a week, it costs me  $60 a session but i think it is worth it. I also do a lot of face excercises and those seem to have helped. Wow 2 weeks? That is very impressive and I am happy you have had a quick recovery. I hope that at we can get an appointment ASAP. It is been a year for me and I am around 95% recovered. I do not think my eye or upper lip will ever fully come back. I did physical therapy for a few weeks which helped. You can find the facial exercises online and save the expense. I believe it takes time and depends on each individual and their bodies ability to recover. Thank you for the information, did you start physical therapy facial exercises right away or did you wait for a period of time? My husband was diagnosed on Wednesday and still has pretty much no movement on the affected side. We did find some exercises online but unsure if we should begin them now. Thank you and happy to hear you are 95% recovered. My fianc\u00e9 has been is horrible pain. Ibuprofen, heat, and B complex. My fianc\u00e9 is taking just an over the counter vitamin complex. If you have a free clinic in your area I would go there. They gave my fianc\u00e9 a high dose of gabapentin and another nerve pain med and that is been helping. Lots of rest! I am so sorry for your mom. BP is tough.\n\nI had BP in 2014 and also had horrible pain. Like curled up in a ball in the dark with my eyes closed all day pain. My face hurt to the touch and I had the headache from hell. I think that pain is pretty common. \n\nThe fact she can raise her eyebrow is good! I had no eyebrow or mouth movement when it first happened. My eyelid still does not close 100% of the way. You learn to deal. I did face exercises given to my by the ER Dr and acupuncture which I feel helped the most. That is when my mom first had symptoms and she started medication on Thursday. I think therapy should be started ASAP. The guy I talked to for an acupuncture appointment told me the sooner you start the better. So immediate medication and some type of therapy improves your chances of fully recovering.\n\nI had it years ago and was only given prednisone and I would gently massage my face. I recovered 100% in a month or two. Thank you for the information! Be careful....I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy by 3 doctors over a period of a year....told by a neurologist I had to learn to just live with it.  No MRI just the easy diagnosis by a neurologist with no hope offered.  I did not want to settle for \u201clearn to live with it\u201d I sought additional medical advise at a state medical university though it was actually difficult to get a referral from my primary doctor.  Turns out I do not have BP but rather a cancerous tumor effecting my facial nerves/muscles.  Will be having surgery in 2 weeks that will hopefully be able to remove all the cancer that has been there for over a year yet undiagnosed in spite of seeing multiple doctors over that year.  Bottom line always get 2nd and 3rd opinions before accepting \u201cjust live with it\u201d.  There is something wrong with our medical system that encourages quick easy diagnoses to move on to the next 5 minute patient $$$. I am so sorry you are going through this. I will be praying for you and hope that everything goes well in surgery. \n\nII did not even know about this until earlier. I was reading that few patients get misdiagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy. Now I am extremely worried that it could be a tumor because my mom had been having dizziness, headaches, extreme exhaustion, and had 2 balance problems that almost caused her to fall for about a month before she got BP. I am taking her to my doctor that I know for a fact will order an MRI &amp; CT scan. I thought these tests were useless but now that I have read up on it I am starting to see that these can be very important. Better safe than sorry. my mom took methyl b12 for nerve regrowth\n\nlots of therapy videos on youtube. Hey can you link me to the one you used and what dosage? Thank you. We have been doing the exercises on YouTube and have an acupuncture appointment today. \n\nwe used the 5mg tablet.  the first week i gave her four per day but after then just one since its high dosage.  If she starts to itch then take a break because b12 has cobalt and it can build up in the body in some people and cause itchiness. it goes a way in a few days if that happens. Always get another diagnoses....had a doctor tell me years ago the medical profession is really just educated guesses and if they guess wrong you could die...good luck to your mom an MRI should be automatic when BP is suspected to simply rule out other possibilities.  Unfortunately that often does not happen.", "My Bell\u2019s palsy is gone!! \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70 After 4 depressing months, I am finally Bell\u2019s palsy free and back to my normal self and I could not be more grateful \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dI am never taking my ability to laugh, smile or any normal facial expressions for granted ever again! \n\nTo anyone who is newly diagnosed: please do not ever lose hope.

As the tingling and twitching progressed so did the recovery. Good luck! I bet it is a good thing. I am on week 3 and do not have either one of those. My effected side was sore, week and lots of nerve pain. Hope that is a good thing. Definitely a good thing. Think it is a sign of the nerves regenerating.

I caught it pretty early (like first 24 hrs) and started steroids and anti virals. I am having excruciating pain all across the paralyzed section of my face though, which does not seem to be a common side effect for others. Thinking I may have had Ramsey Hunt Syndrome instead but without the rash. \n\nI have been taking 500mg of naproxen and the pain has not dissipated. I had pain for about a week before I had the bells.. I thought I slept wrong but no :((( I had lingering pain but when I would try to flex my face it felt as if my neck to my cheek would have a muscle spasm and it hurt. It hurts near the ear because that nerve is probably being pinched Yes. That is perfectly normal. It will last throughout the entirety of the experience at varying levels but eventually calms down. I had bells 3 years ago and to this day my face hurts a tiny bit when I have caffeine. Wow! Thank you for your insights. It is really concerning having this pain so it is good to know others had similar reactions. I have been doing hot compresses and taking 500 mg of naproxen and it does not always help. Did you do/take anything to help manage the pain? Thanks again!!! Yeah I had pain the night before :( That is good to know-thank you! Yeah I think you are right. I definitely have neck pain too. Face massages from the wife. Use lotion, light pressure. Helps tremendously. Also warm showers. pain has been common for me, not sure about excruciating pain though. I would call your doctor. Yes! Thank God I am not alone! I have had BP for 10 days now, already finished anti-virals and steroids, but I have noticed the last couple of days my affected side is really sore. Is it because the muscles have not been able to move, like they are stuck? Yes, we are exactly on the same timeline. I really do not know :(\n\nI thought it might bc the nerve is swollen and maybe the muscles are a bit tight. I did hot compresses when I had the pain and it mostly went away, but it has not been going away. I could not sleep at all last night, even after taking a 500mg naproxen. \n\nI have been get accupuncture as well, so I do not know if maybe I am sore from that too. \n\nI have been reading a lot about vitamin B12 shots and CBD oil helping. Will report back when I see what results. \n\nHang in there !!! Yep I noticed the hot showers definitely help take off the edge. Thank you! Hmm okay good to know. Thank you! My gp explained that the jaw joint becomes enflamed, that hurt like hell for me, my neck too\n\nIt did go away after a week or two though with strong pain killers Thank you! Ohh thank you!!!! That is good to hear. That is precisely where my pain is. I am looking into getting CBD. I was on a combo of naproxen and gabapentin and found that helped with nerve pain. I am happy to report I took a very heavy dose of CBD last night in place of the 500mg of Naproxen and was completely relieved of my pain!!! I slept all night. If you are still struggling with pain I highly recommend you try cbd. Also it will be lighter on your liver seeing as we just got off so many pills. Hope that helps! Omg thank you so much!! I have a dumb question. Where do I get CBD? I know it is pretty popular and there are different forms, but what kind and where did you get yours? Thank you again for the info! Not a dumb question at all! I had to do a bit of research too. When I lived in SF I just walked to the nearest dispensary, but I am in miami rn and things are not as easy. Depending on where you are, you can Google maps cbd dispensary. If you are in a state with legalized med weed you will need a med card. I do not have one so just settled on getting the strongest CBD tincture they had. The person I spoke to was super helpful once I told them what I needed it for. I tried the Green Roads CBD tincture and have had zero pain since I last took some last night. There is various ways you can take CBD but I would opt for the tincture if I were you. Hope that helps! Feel better!! I live in NC and unfortunately they have not legalized it, but I will see what I can find online. Thank you again!! Sure thing! I have heard buying on Amazon is not the best. There should be smoke shops in NC that sell just the CBD. That might be better. I am on day 11 of BP, I have a mild case but in the last 2-3 days I have started to feel pain along the 7th Cranial Nerve. It goes away and comes back, I feel like going to the ER b.c I did not have pain the first week but not sure if maybe it normal as things are healing. I mean listen to your body and if you think you need to see a doctor absolutely do that. I will say, I definitely had a moment of panic a few days ago when I posted this bc I was also experiencing a lot of pain and was not sure it was typical for BP (my mom had BP 12 yrs ago and she never had pain). With that said, you will see from my post that many have mentioned they have had pain. I would highly recommend you try CBD oil...I know exactly the pain you are describing-- I could not sleep for a few days. That is how bad it was. CBD has completely decreased the frequency and gravity of the pain. I hope that gives you some peace of mind. Thanks for the reply, I went today and so far so good, they could not give me the details as the ER had Traumas coming in but nothing abnormal as far as the regular DR could tell (aside from the BP ofc). And thanks I definitely will try the CBD oil. Good luck to you and hope we all recover.

The twitching is now felt everyday and my upper eyelid at times twitch uncontrollably. What should I do ? Any recommendations? Yeah, this happens to me once in a while. I cut down on caffeine, which seemed to help. I notice it more when I am stressed or tired.  I will also get nerve pain that feels like someone is pinching my ear. I have gotten BP twice once when I was 18 and again when I was 28. Eye Twitching and dry eyes are the worst but cut down on the caffeine, stress less and get some good sleep.", "Tongue and mouth soreness Does anyone else get soreness in the unaffected side? I feel like because I now favor the right side when i eat there is maybe muscle soreness? Idk Hi! Sorry for the late reply. I felt that during my first week of BP. probably because the unaffected side was doing all the work. I would feel tired after eating or talking, and my unaffected side would feel sore. But now I do not feel that. I am in week 4. I think after your first week of antivirals and other meds, you should try eating with your affected side as well. But do not strain too much. I favor my unaffected side but still eat on both sides at this point. Like I said not sure what is causing the pain. It almost feels like my tongue and throat swells up but doesnt look it, if that makes sense. Ohh sorry to hear that, but no, I have not felt that. If it does not get better, you should definitely ask your doc in your next appointment about it then, unless it worsens, then definitely go to the ER. When were you diagnosed with BP?

Dr said I might just be still healing. But yes I get the same way and hope it never comes back.\n\nTry to spend some quiet peaceful time, try working out(nothing extreme) something light.\n\nDo things that make you happy, eat food you love. Stay away from things that bother you I am coming up on a year since having it. I recovered 98% in 2 months. At 1.5 months I started weight lifting which I feel greatly helped. That side of my face still gets tight some days and hurts. I am sometimes scared it will happen again but I try not to dwell on it. Just started living a more healthy and balanced life to give my body the best chance of dealing with anything that might happen.", "Well fuck. On Tuesday I woke up with a really weird thing going on with the entire right side of my face - it was completely numb. All of it, even my teeth and tongue on the right side. I already had a Hashimoto's diagnosis and sometimes weird things happen that are related to that (like random parts of my face swelling up for no discernable reason), so I figured it was just another one of those things.\n\nCut to yesterday when I finally mentioned it to my mom, at which point she demanded that I have my husband take me directly to A&E, and you cannot really argue with that so off we went.\n\nGot a CT scan pretty much as soon as I walked in, and was summarily told that I most likely have Bell's Palsy.  I do not have any muscle weakness or drooping - just this awful numbness that comes and goes in varying intensities of 'just got a novacaine shot in the jaw for dental work'.\n\nI was given alyclovir 200mg, 5x a day for a week, as well as a hefty dosage of steroids, and was basically told that it would \"probably\" go away in a few weeks and that if I suddenly lose all movement on that side to not panic.\n\nSo ugh. I guess this is where my life is right now. Having taken the full dosage of antivirals for a full day, I am now weirdly getting occasional shooting pain in some of my teeth, but it is very quick and then is right back to being numb.\n\nHow screwed am I because I let this go for almost a week before seeking treatment? Mine went on for a whole month before seeing a doctor (ughh thanks mom!) \n\nThis was 14 years ago so I would guess treatment is better now.. I have some issues with my eye muscles being fused with my lip muscles but otherwise it is not very noticeable. \n\nDo as many facial exercise as you can but do not force it. Keep the muscle movements separate so that they do not fuse like mine did.\n\nGood luck, I hope it turns out alright! I am not really sure I understand the 'fused muscles' thing.... Like, I mean I have read about how it works, but I thought it was generally only an issue in cases with severe paralysis?\n\nFor now I seem to only have a little droopyness at my lip and definitely have caught myself drooling a tiny bit. I can still move everything around, though a big forced smile yields a weird numb-but-pain sort of feeling like when you run for a while and the muscles in your legs hurt... But in my cheek. I guess that is the muscle weakness setting in. Glurg. Yeah I did not do a good job of explaining myself lol. \nIn severe cases, or if left untreated, the brain may lose control over certain muscles. When you do facial exercises to regain that control your brain will use active connections to attempt to repair the damaged ones. \n\nThis results in things like the corner of the mouth relying on muscles typically used for eye control. \n\nI think this is an extreme, and it does not sound like you need to worry about it, but it is good to know what to look out for! I had an initial dose of steroids and did not set a new appointment for a week or so. I did, and I am glad I did because I was getting a lot of pain behind my ear, headaches, toothaches and of course paralysis. Took like 9 days more of roids and symptons did not clear up. This was in April and I am just now getting kind of back to normal. Mostly my eye waters when I eat but I do not have a slur and can drink and eat normally. \n\nYou are lucky it was not a stroke, that is probably why your mother was so concerned. I know I did not go in right away the same day and my SO was like uhh no you need to go right now. Once I was in, 10 minutes later I was hooked up to all sorts of machines and had 5 doctors doing tests. And they say the US healthcare system sucks, heh. I was in and out 30 minutes with drugs.

I feel like i didnt do my exercises enough and that i could always have done them more so idk what to do with my life so i see no other option than to end it all. Have you tried accupuncture? This really sped up my recovery. Yes ive tried some sessions with accupuncture between 10-15 I would recommend going 3 times a week for a sustained period of time. This really sped up my recovery. About how long ? And wluld it even help after 1 year ? When did you start your accupu cture Bell\u2019s palsy isnt worth just ending it all for. Im almost at the 3 year mark and I still have it. Yeah some days are super shitty but other days arent. You got this. Dont give up on yourself. Maybe you should take a trip out to see the doctor at the Facial Paralysis Institute if you can afford it.  I am not a doctor or a physio so I could not say but it is worth going and seeing if it makes a difference  CBD oil, try it.\n\nAlso: Ending your life is the easy way out for you, and the most painful for everyone else - do not be selfish. I got BP ~14 years ago and my eye still squinches when I smile. It took me well over a year to make considerable recovery. Ill be honest, I thought about ending it more than once. It is hard, people can be shitty. But is that going to be the reason you die? Do you put that much importance in your external appearance and what other people think of you? Is that ideology something you truly believe, or is it the product of cultural brainwashing?\n\nIf I would have ended it 14 years ago, I never would have met my amazing wife, went back to school for my degree, and made some amazing friends who do not give a shit about appearances. You will find happiness again, you will learn to live and love yourself for who you are as a person. I guarantee others will do the same, but only after you truly love yourself for the person you are, paralysis be damned.\n\n It gets a little better. I am still not 100% but better than before.

It does not seem to be progressing but it also does not seem to be getting better. I also have really bad health anxiety so I do not know if it is related to that or maybe allergies. It is definitely possible. No reason it is not possible. I would go to a physician and get their opinion, and some drugs for it if it is bells. My doctor does not have an appointment for 3 weeks out. Should I go to urgent care for this? Yeah. They will be able to diagnose you I am a speech pathologist, and when I hear you say \u201cwhen I swallow, everything go to the left,\u201d I have some follow up questions. Can you explain what you mean? It goes to the left of your mouth, your throat? Are you having trouble with moving your tongue around and manipulating food while chewing and swallowing? Any coughing, choking, gagging, etc? Bell\u2019s should not be impacting these functions necessarily, as it really is isolated to the facial nerve (cranial nerve 7), which is responsible for facial movements (excluding the tongue), some hearing, and front taste buds. Tongue movements and swallowing should be normal. Any impact in the upper portion of your face, like your forehead, eye, or eye brow? If it is Bell\u2019s you should see it in the upper portion of the face as well. Paralysis of the lower portion of the face only is typically more indicative of a stoke or something else going on at the level of the brain (because the upper portion of the face is bilaterally innervated). I would definitely go see your doctor, or even an urgent care or minute clinic if you can! Cannot hurt. Also, I have health anxiety and medical PTSD I am in counseling for, so I completely empathize with you and know how hard this is. If I could get through it, you can get through it!! Mine has been mild like that! Go to the ER. I went to the ER, they gave me a week of steroids (which almost completely healed it) and anti-viral. My follow up app with my doctor was pointless the ER will help u I just got out of urgent care and gave me a prescription to steroids but said not to take it unless I notice significant drooping. She thinks my face looks completely symmetrical right now with some weakness in my right cheek. Wow yours is SO mild you are going to be fine! Hope so! Does it progress from here after 3 days? Hope you are feeling better. Yeah i had mine for like 2 weeks and it went away completely Did you mostly have control over everything? It was very hard for my physician to see the weakness. The only way she could tell is my right cheek would quiver due to being slightly weak when smiling. Honestly for me, it stayed the same for like 3 days, and then started getting a little better every day and now is almost gone I do not have issues swallowing and it is not difficult, perhaps more difficult because I am paying attention to it. No problems eating too, no choking, gagging. I went to urgent care this morning and she did not see any signs of a stroke and actually did not give me a definite diagnosis of Bell's, she did give me steroids though just in case it gets worse. She told me not to take them unless I notice my lip drooping. The only noticeable symptom she saw was that my right cheek shakes due to weakness. She checked my entire face and checked for numbness too. Also my entire right side of my face feels somewhat weak or numb and my right eye is more red than my left but I seem to be blinking just fine.\n\nAnother thing I had her check was my lungs because I have the sensation of feeling like air is only going into the left side as well but she checked and said air is equally getting into both sides. One thing is for sure, my ears feel full and I do have a very mild tension headache.\n\nMy anxiety has peaked in the last month so I have no idea if my nerves are just on overdrive and that is what is causing the sensation of right side paralysis/weakness. The urgent care physician said to wait 2 weeks before getting an MRI if the symptoms do not go away. She did not seem too concerned and said she is experienced a similar sensation too for 2 years and checked out fine. &gt;I am a speech pathologist, and when I hear you say \u201cwhen I swallow, everything go to the left,\u201d I have some follow up questions.

Some even talk about pain. Is this something you have always had? Or did it come on suddenly? Is it getting worse or staying the same? \n\nBell\u2019s palsy is usually sudden onset(within 24-48 hours) of partial to full paralysis of one side of the face. At one point I could not blink or move my eye lid or wrinkle my forehead on one side. For most folks it is a 3-4 week recovery period to be back to normal. Sometimes it can take much longer than that. \n\nYou have got a little bit of droop going on your lip and a bit on your eyebrow but judging from the hair styles, they seem somewhat far apart. \n\nIm not saying it is not Bell\u2019s palsy but as someone who has had Bell\u2019s palsy twice, this looks incredibly mild. If you provide a bit more info on how it progressed for you we might be able to give you more insight. I definetly had pain. Behind the ear is pretty common. I think maybe you are just aware of the usual asymmetry most people have with their face. You look fine to me! BP comes on suddenly, typically less than 24hrs. And you would be numb as well. aaah okay i did not know it was sudden i thought it was a natal condition.so it cannot be BP as it started and is getting worse since i was about 10 (17 now) thank you for the advice tho! aaah okay i understand it just bothers me how asymmetrical it is and w a google search that is the first thing to show but it cannot be as it was not sudden so thank you!!

I had mine two weeks after being diagnosed with shingles on my face; left chin, and in and around the left mouth to be exact. It was not pleasant to say the least. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo weeks later I was diagnosed with BP after my shingles had healed. I woke up one morning and noticed I could not completely blink my left eye. I knew it was a residual effect of the shingles and went to emerge. Luckily it was a mild case of BP. For instance I could close my left eye lid about 80% and I could talk without showing the left-sided droop. People could not tell I had BP. Once I mentioned it to them they could then see the slight drooping. I was lucky in that sense. I was prescribed prednisone, 60mg for the first 6 days, then taper by 5mg each day after. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am on day 22 of my BP and I have just completed my last dose of prednisone a few days ago and I am glad to say that I am about 95% healed of my BP! With the prednisone I also did facial massages and exercises everyday. I also did one session of acupuncture a few days ago which I believe made a positive contribution to the fast healing as well. I have a follow up session in the coming week. Each day I notice more and more muscle movement in the left side of my face. I also felt major discomfort. I felt a kind of tense pressure on my left cheek in the beginning and more recently my chin. I found that CBD oil relieved some of that pressure a bit. Now there is just a lot of twitching, more so on my chin. Whatever odd feeling is happening to my face, it can only be towards recovery so I do not mind them at all!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to say to those who have just been diagnosed, do not worry you will heal in no time! Take it easy, rest, do facial exercises and massages and listen to your doctor. Acupuncture and CBD oil are your choices to do or take of course. For those who are taking longer than usual to heal, do not give up you will get through this! I know it is scary and some days are harder than others, but having a positive outlook on things will definitely help the healing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck and all the best to my fellow BP-ers! We got this \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd", "Bells palsy within &lt;30 minutes of second moderna shot? Hey everyone, before you read my post - full disclosure: yes, I post on r/coronaviruscirclejerk. Yes, I am very much against manditory vaccination. Yes, I only got the shots to keep my job. We probably disagree on lots of stuff.\n\n I figured that if I claimed I got bells palsy from the jab this community might dismiss or ban me, but I can assure you that I am posting in good faith. I just want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience and can reassure me.\n\nSo, Friday at 410 pm I take the shot. I wait the recconended 15 minutes in the waiting chair at the pharmacy, no obvious reaction, so I leave. I go next door and treat myself to a coffee and have a smoke before getting in the car. At this point it is about 430. Coffee felt strange in my mouth like it would have felt if I had been to the dentist earlier that day but I dismissed it.\n\nAs soon as I am pulling out of the parking lot my right side cheek starts twitching involuntarily. I am driving down the street and it continues, and I am becoming aware that it feels more comfortable to tense up my lip.\n\nI pull over and look in the mirror, and sure enough my right side lip is raised, slightly curled. \n\nIt continued throughout the evening, never got worse or better, just very awkward feeling. I could focus my energy on keeping my lip straight but soon enough the twitching would start.\n\nGot a terrible sleep last night, kept waking up with a sore stiff arm which is exactly how my first shot went - sans wierd facial twitching. But I noticed my face and lips fetl normal while at rest, but sure enough when I got up this morning and started moving around, the twitching, crooked smile is back.\n\nDid any of you have a similar experience? Were your symptoms any better when relaxing or in bed?\n\nThanks. Regardless of your stance in vaccination, I have had a similar experience regarding the onset of my BP.\nDistortion of taste and tension in the face.\n\nHowever I got this before getting a shot and I actually postponed my vaccination and waited for a couple of weeks, because I was afraid that it might worsen my BP condition.\n\nThe cause of my BP is still unknown, but it is quite possible and I believe it is, that it is a delayed effect from a previous COVID infection.\n\n\n\nI also believe stress to be a big factor. I caught when enduring an extreme stressful period in my life.\nWere you very anxious to receive the vaccin? Fearing to loose your job and that kind of stuff? yes happened to me. Get to a dcotr asap to get on prednisone. You only have a very limited amount of time to use prednisone to help bells palsy to heal. Shit really? Okay, thanks! I will get to a walk in clinic today. Do symptoms typically get worse over a day or so? I have not got anything going on with my eyes or forehead, it is literally just my lip and cheek at this point. It is quite possible for it to worsen the first 1-5 days, then it should stabilize and then it could be several weeks until you see improvement as the nerve needs to regrow. go to the doctor asap to get it checked out\n\nusually it is not a twitching, but numbness. with Bell's it is like your face is dead on one side and symptoms do not change when lying down.  if it is bell's, make sure you get  prednisone and the the anti-viral because there is some evidence that the vaccine can reactivate a virus (though I think it would not happen immediately after the vaccine). I am obviously not a doctor, but this is what I have heard from some medical professionals.\n\nit could be that you have a different illness or reaction from the vaccine, so get it checked out regardless. any and all reactions should be reported.  Bell\u2019s palsy should not twitch. It is similar to having a stroke. It is dead on one side.\n\nLet me start over. Bell\u2019s palsy is when your nerves get pinched off from inflammation in your facial tissue. This can become permanent if left alone because the nerves get cut off at the end. Google trigeminal nerve. And check out the images. The fingers get cut off by the inflammation. So go to the doctor right away as others are saying. You may need to visit a neurologist if it is not Bell\u2019s and they cannot figure it out at a family clinic or urgent care.\n\nTrigeminal Neuralgia is ANOTHER disease that we do not know the definitive cause of. It could possibly be neuralgia. Twitching is a symptom. This was my post, I have been looking for other adverse reactions similar to my experience. \n\nFirst off, I am not anti vaccine and I am a few months short of graduating Grad school and working in the medical field. My story is NOT a common reaction and probably will not happen to you. I got my first dose of the Moderna Vaccine on 9/02/2021. Had nothing unusual occurred until 2 weeks later when I was meditating and noticed my both of my eyes started contracting shut on their own. I had the ability to stop the contraction if I thought about it, however, if I was resting with my eyes closed they would squeeze shut involuntarily. The contractions started as fluttering or spasticity(similar to REM cycle sleep) but  then progressed to slower, stronger, and rhythmic contractions that lasted anywhere 5-10+ seconds. I had some other weird neurological symptoms that co-occurred during this time such as right scalene and SCM tightness, weird tongue sensations, and tingling sensations around my right buccal region. These symptoms peaked around 1 month after my first dose but slowly started to get a little better day by day. Throughout this time, I had great difficulty sleeping as my eyes would involuntarily contract and had a lot of anxiety as I was 100% healthy before this occurred. I have seen a resident and a PCP twice, a neurologist, and an ophthalmologist. None of them have seen anything like it but 3/4 believe it was likely an adverse reaction. I got a medical exemption and I never got my 2nd dose.\n\nIt is been about 2 months since my symptoms first appeared and I am almost normal but still feel the impulses like my eyes are going to squeeze shut. However, very thankful it is better than it was but still hoping for spontaneous recovery.\n\nMy main reason for posting this is to see if anyone else has experienced anything similar? Did your symptoms resolve? Anything you have done to reduce your symptoms?\n\nThank You Hey!\n\nSymptoms almost gone in less than a week. Day 3 I went to see my doctor - he did not think it was bells, but he thinks I had some \"mild\" facial nerve inflammation and gave me a week's worth of prednisone.\n\nI still have the odd eye twitch... which is normal for some people but not me.", "Ya girls bells palsy freeee After 4 depressing months my bells palsy is gone !!! I am so beyond thrilled and I am never ever ever taking my smile or anything for granted ever again. I just pray it never comes back. EEEK IM SO HAPPY RN - to anyone newly diagnosed you will get through it trust me. If I did, (I am so pessimistic it is unreal lol) you will!!! You got this guys !!! Q", "Almost ten months since onset...and not quite recovered yet. Hi Reddit! Almost ten months ago I got BP, for the second time in my life. The first time was 15 years ago (46 y/o male here) but it was a mild case that resolved in a just a couple weeks. This most recent episode was on the opposite side of my face as the first one, and much more severe. As of now, I feel like I am about 80-85% recovered. My smile is mostly back so my cheek and eye movement are under control (I can wear contacts again) but the left side of my mouth is still noticeably weaker. I can roll my tongue for example, but the strong side pushes it all the way over to the weak side. My eye on the affected side is still a bit weepy, and when I smile big and/or try to move my mouth on the affected side, my eye scrunches shut a little...I think this might be synkinesis?\n\nI am curious who out there is in a similar boat...six to twelve months from onset and not fully recovered yet. I have a dull ache sometimes behind my ear on the affected side, which I recall happening a day or so before onset, so I am worried my nerve is not fully healed. The other day I would squint my eyes shut, and after release a muscle under my eyebrow would stay taut...then let up after a few seconds. So I am never sure if this is me getting better, or a sign that I need to see someone.\n\nMy MD was sympathetic, but her and several other doctors I spoke to (including the ER doc) were very much of the \"suck it up, buttercup\" mentality that it would heal on its own and I just have to accept what I am left with. No one seems to care too much about this condition. Are there any options I am not aware of for treatment this late in the process? I did acupuncture several times a week the first month or so, and I think it helped, but I am not sure what to do now.\n\nAny help or words of advice would be greatly appreciated. :) ", "Bell\u2019s Palsy: Signs, Symptoms and Treatments You Should Know ", "11 weeks in, still do not have any feeling in my nostril, eyelid and lips.... I can raise my eyebrow almost 50% and do smile with my cheek and around lip muscles for about 70% \nDo you guys think I can get back to normal? I am not getting any twitches anymore Hey there!\n\nIt seems everyone is different, the one constant thing seems to be the younger you are the quicker it gets back to normal.\n\nI had no recovery at ALL for the first 3.5 months.  I used to get twitching all the time and then it just stopped out of the blue and I feared the worst.  Eventually, nearly 4 months in now, I started getting some movement back.\n\nJust hang in there, be patient, and keep doing your facial exercises.", "Help! BP and COVID at the same time?? I was diagnosed in an Urgent Care today with Bell\u2019s Palsy. Last Friday I developed a lack of taste at dinner time on the right side of my tongue and a bad headache on the right side of my head. On Monday, I noticed the right side of my face felt funny and I blinked slower on the right side. I am still quite mild, but it takes some effort to close my eye, and I cannot smile very well on the right side. \n\nI was also given a COVID test, because I was in the ER last Tuesday for 6 hours. I will not have my results for a couple days. I am scared I have COVID on top of this! At first when my UC visit was over, I was optimistic I might not have it, but a while after I got home, my chest started feeling heavy and my blood oxygen levels read 96, when normally I am a steady 99. \n\nThey gave me a shot of dexamethasone before I left, could that cause this? Or anxiety? If it was just the chest pressure I would not be as worried, but the readings have me freaking out. If I have early COVID, would not steroids be harmful since they suppress the immune system? I have read many studies that suggest in COVID that early steroid treatment is harmful but once it is late/severe it is helpful. \n\nI am also nervous about taking the valacyclovir. How did it make you feel? I tend to always get bad side effects from medications and it does not even seem like it helps much from my research. Is it worth it? \n\nI am so scared, I have rheumatoid arthritis and already take immune suppressing medication for that, and I have asthma and a BMI over 30. I do not want to die! None of my doctors want to talk to me about any of this since I \u201cmight have COVID\u201d and if I do it is \u201cout of their jurisdiction\u201d and if I want help I need to go to a hospital instead. BP can actually be caused by covid. In the UK the BP diagnoses' doubled during covid time and are still there. There is nothing you can do about it other than some medication. If it is not from covid, covid will not affect the healing. I have had covid two times during my healing and I am still healing... Keep your head up and hope for the best! No that I read it again, I do not know if it will affect healing with your disease. The doctors may know that? BP can cause lack of taste! The facial nerve innervates the taste buds on the front 2/3 of the tongue on the affected side. It freaked me out too with COVID because I could not taste right and everything was bitter. Now if you lose your smell, that is not related to BP as far as I know. Keep in mind that BP is often triggered by a virus, so you could be fighting a virus other than COVID as well. I dealt with a ton of anxiety and weird physical symptoms during my BP last July. Heart palpitations, insomnia, exhaustion, anxiety attacks (I already have an anxiety disorder). It was rough. I got through it though and fully recovered! Was 95% recovered in 3 weeks. I took valacyclovir and did fine with it. No side effects. I also took Prednisone, which in the research I read is even more important than the valacyclovir. The prednisone gave me some weird side effects, but it was only 5 days worth. Sending you hope for healing and encouragement!! I know how hard it is. But most people recover just fine. You are going to get through it. I really needed this! Thank you SO MUCH.\n\nI also really struggle with anxiety, my chest has felt tight since they started me on the steroids and my oxygen is a bit lower as I stated before, so I am starting to wonder if it is due to the steroids or anxiety. I have not gotten my PCR test back yet but I did a rapid today and it was negative for Covid so that was a bit of a relief!\n\nI am wondering how else I would have picked up a virus though as I have only left the house a couple times since COVID started for doctor related stuff or emergencies (like my ER visit last Tuesday) I do have a weak immune system though and I have been SO STRESSED lately so maybe something reactivated? \n\nI have definitely been struggling with the palpitations and the insomnia, the anxiety attacks, all of it! I am so sorry you had to go through it too but I am so glad that I am not alone! It feels like I can finally see a light at the end of this dark tunnel, now. I will start my antiviral today thanks to your advice, I was really scared to try it! Not that I was happy about the steroids either but I knew they were very important.\n\nMy face is definitely worse today, I can hardly move the right side at all. Even though I started the steroids yesterday, does it usually get worse before it gets better?\n\nThank you SO much again you have been such a huge help! I am so sorry you are going through this!! I completely empathize with you. I have anxiety and PTSD related to medical trauma in my childhood, so my BP experience was one of the hardest things mentally I have gone through. I would not be surprised if what you are experiencing is from the steroids. Those are common steroid side effects from what I know. But getting steroids quickly is REALLY important for a good outcome. \n\nUnless you have been exposed to COVID, I bet this is all related to your BP, anxiety, and the steroids. My BP was actually caused by the cold sore virus! I have no idea where I got it, but I think it can just be dormant in your body and pop up. I got a cluster of SUPER painful sores on my tongue that were horrible. Went to the dentist and they gave me some topical gel that did nothing and said it looked like I would bitten myself. They really misdiagnoses me, because after I developed BP and showed the pictures to my MD, she said \u201coh yeah, those are classic cold sores/herpes virus.\u201d I was going through a super stressful life event of becoming a caregiver for a family member with autism under rough circumstances, which I think just came out in my body. \n\nIt definitely got worse before it got better for me. It started on a Saturday with not being able to squeeze my eye and my smile being crooked. By Monday it progressed to not being able to smile at all on that side, and barely being able to close my eye (there was a small slit I could not close). It was about 3 days before I saw any improvement. After that, it was slow improvements over 3 weeks. I found it really helpful to take daily pictures making different facial expressions, squeezing eyes, smiling, raising eye brows, puckering lips, etc. That way I could compare them and see the small progress I had not noticed. It helped me remember I was slowly getting better, even when it did not feel like it. \n\nBe kind to yourself!! Sleep and rest a lot. I took a lot of long showers with music and candles. I am a Christian, so I listened to a lot of worship music and just cried and prayed and let myself feel what I needed to feel. Do things that help you process your emotions and feel good, whatever that is for you. The heating pad felt good on my face, as well as little gentle facial massages I gave myself a few times a day. You are going to be okay, you only have to take it day at a time \u2764\ufe0f This has all been so helpful! I have been taking videos as my symptoms progress, I will definitely keep taking them as I improve! I only slept on and off about 4 hours last night, but hopefully tonight will be better. I suppose now is a time for rest, so I will try to nap while I can.\n\nI used to be non-religious, but ironically as of Good Friday (I did not realize it at the time) I was just so anxious, and really desired peace. I decided to delve back into Christianity. I know I am kind of just ranting my life story now, but as a child I always thought there was something wrong with me or that I was bad, and I felt like God must be disgusted with me, so I developed a phobia of Him. I was agnostic for a very long time as I got older, but that fear of death and the afterlife and me being bad never went away. I am hoping I can start a happier and healthier relationship with religion this time around. \n\nThanks again so much for your help, it truly feels like such a blessing! Yes, do all the napping you can!! Even just dozing with a fun show or movie on in the background is good for your body. I am so happy to help, feel free to ask any questions you might have. You are not alone! \n\nThat is really cool timing, and I am glad you are finding peace by exploring your faith again. My faith is a huge source of peace and comfort for me. I just want you to know that you do not have to do anything or be anything to be desired by God. He ADORES you just the way you are, and is just so excited by being with you and talking to you. I do not know how your relationship is with your parents. But imagine whoever in your life loves you unconditionally, and just multiply that by a million. They do not care what you have done, they will always welcome you with open arms just as you are. You have no power to change how Jesus feels about you. \u201cNeither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d (Romans 8:39). That is what I love about my faith. Jesus frees me from the pursuit of perfection, and turns me to a pursuit of a relationship with Him. I hope this does not feel \u201cpreachy,\u201d and if it does please know that is not my intention. Wherever you are in your faith journey, there is room for you at the table just as you are. You are loved! It is not preachy at all! This is exactly what I needed to hear, I teared up just reading it! I feel like I am starting to understand a lot better, and let myself feel loved. \n\nIf I have any questions I will definitely come to you if that is ok! Please do, happy to answer questions of any kind! You are not alone \u2764\ufe0f &gt; I am wondering how else I would have picked up a virus though as I have only left the house a couple times since COVID started for doctor related stuff or emergencies (like my ER visit last Tuesday) I do have a weak immune system though and I have been SO STRESSED lately so maybe something reactivated? \n\nStress can definitely activate latent viruses in your body. This is why people often break out in cold sores when they are under stress. These viruses can also be responsible for BP. It may be a virus that you were exposed to many years ago, not one you were exposed to recently.\n\nFWIW, I am also very sensitive to side effects from medications, but I did not notice any from the antivirals. I did feel pretty terrible from the steroids, though. Made me feel like jumping out of my skin. But I just pushed through it. \n\nAlso, anxiety can mimic many COVID symptoms! Until you know otherwise, it is best to assume you are going to be fine and let your body and the medicine work its course. Avoiding stress as much as possible is your best medicine, especially with BP. &gt;  I got a cluster of SUPER painful sores on my tongue that were horrible. \n\nThis is exactly what happened to me before I developed BP. Mine got so bad I could not eat or drink, even water through a straw. I had to be rehydrated at the ER. After I recovered from that, I woke up one morning with half my face paralyzed. Thank you so much! I am definitely thinking anxiety (and probably the prednisone worsening it with a rapid heart rate) are causing some of my issues. I am a lot calmer now, just going to try my best to get through it!\n\nI am glad to know it is something that could have already been there that activated, that makes a lot more sense! Yeah, the prednisone can definitely make you feel antsy and get your heart rate up. Glad to hear you are feeling calmer now. Wishing you a speedy recovery! Oh wow!! I had not heard of anyone else having this exact same thing. I am so sorry, I know how painful it is. I lost like 7 lbs in a few days from not eating or drinking much. My tongue swelled up and I was miserable. I thought going to the dentist was wise and they could help me (they manage conditions of the mouth, surely they would know what it was). If they had properly diagnosed me, maybe I could have gotten valacyclovir before the BP set in... but I guess we will never know. Did they properly diagnose yours at the ER? 7 lbs is 3.18 kg Yes, they did. My brother took me to the ER when he came and visited and saw how bad I was. I could not take myself, I was in such bad shape, and the person who was my wife at the time dealt with my illness by ignoring it. So when my brother took me to the ER they put me on IV saline right away and went through 2 bags, put me on heavy pain killers, and sent me home with antivirals. But apparently it had already done too much damage in my nerve because I got BP a few weeks later. Well I am glad at least that they were able to diagnose you and help get you mended up. I really think mine were caused by serious stress. The doctor told me that the herpes simplex virus usually appears inside your mouth first, and then subsequent flares will be outside of your mouth like traditional cold sores you think of. I never knew this. I am sure mine were caused by stress as well, I certainly had plenty of it at the time. And I did not know that, either! I occasionally still get mouth sores every few years when I am stressed or sick, but I get them inside my mouth still. So weird. I have never gotten them as bad as I did that one time, though. I was so sick I just stayed in bed night and day, barely even noticed the passage of time. I did not even get up to use the bathroom, because I was not eating or drinking anything. If my brother had not come by when he did, I probably would have died of dehydration. I am glad I was able to get treatment when I did; it is a shame you could not get the same treatment! Who knows, you might have never developed BP if you would gotten treated right away.", "2 weeks and almost back to normal I am not 100% better yet. I think I am about 80% better but I feel so much better because people can understand me now when I speak. My mouth is only noticeable if I smile big. My eyebrow is noticeable to me but it has movement. The only thing that really bothers me is my left eye refuses to blink still lol. So to the average passerby I am sure it looks like I am winking at everyone. If I strain I can shut my eye about 90% of the way but if I look in the mirror and blink normal my left eye does not budge. I have seen eyes droop with Bell\u2019s palsy but my Eye is not drooping it is forever awake . nobody Can tell until I point it out but i think it looks like a lazy eye, my norm eye looks like a lazy eye, whyyyyyyy lol .

I know everyone is just being supportive but I just needed to talk to someone who agrees this is effed up and I do not have to hear \u201cIt is not noticeable, it is not bad\u201d yes yes it is.

You are doing great!", "Question about jaw pain I was just diagnosed yesterday and started having symptoms Thursday. The left side of my face is affected. Today the jaw pain started. Did anyone else have jaw pain that radiated to the other side? It is mostly been my upper jaw, but now I am feeling some pain on the other side of face. Is that typical? For me at least made my whole left side look like I had a stroke and like I was hit with a bat, immense pain. Hopefully it does not happen to you as it did to me. Do not be scared, you will get thru this I promise it will just take some time getting used to everything. For me, almost two years late and I still have some effects from it, for the most part I can talk normal ish but hopefully it goes away completely eventually. Yes, the pain is normal, but it goes away. Applying heat helped, and I used CBD balm too. Yes! I felt like my right side jaw had the same pain as a crazy clenched jaw, raw ache for a few days on and off. Heating pad and trying not to talk too much (easier said than done) (no pun intended) helped ease it.

I had bell's palsy sometime around the summer of 2017. I never fully recovered and the left side of my face is still noticeably weaker and there are some things I cannot do:  \n\n1) I used to be able to whistle before, but I cannot whistle any longer because of the weak facial/jaw muscles on my right side. \n\n2) If someone takes a photo of me it is almost guaranteed that the first photo will be bad because of my uneven blinking and facial muscles. I need 3-6 pictures for one to turn out good. \n\n3) I am a bicyclist and now if I try to drink water while cycling using a water bottle often water will drool out the weaker right side because the muscles are too weak to get a proper seal on the water bottle. Also it seems like it is harder for me to continue breathing while drinking. So now I just literally stop to a standstill if I want to drink water while cycling. \n\n4) When I eat something like a big veggie burger or try to take a large mouthful of something it is often difficult because of the weaker right side. I also feel like I sometimes drool when I eat, but that it is intermittent sometimes I really notice the jaw strength discrepancy and that is when it happens. \n\nMost people do not know I have any issue though and they do not think I have facial paralysis and would not know. Thankfully my blinking is fairly normal and I can close my eyes at night -- that was the biggest nightmare when I had full bell's palsy. \n\nI am guessing that these lingering symptoms mean I am one of the unlucky 10% that never fully recovered? Or are the issues I am describing years later normal?\n\nDoes anyone else have lingering symptoms? I just tried whistling and I can almost barely whistle. If I try for like 30 seconds, eventually there will short 1 second burst that sounds like a whistle. But it really tires out the weaker right side of my face and jaw muscles. I think if I keep it at every once in a while, I could get better at it.\n\nEdit: I just tried again but my right side is far too fatigued, I have to build up strength maybe. 2016 dx checking in!\n\nI still have: \n-synkinesis, my eye cries whenever I eat. \n\n-trigeminal Neuralgia, facial cramps along a specific nerve line in my face. \n\n- light and sound sensitivity\n\n- no facial muscle ability to whistle let alone play my flute that I spent 10 years learning and training on. This one was a huge blow to my self esteem and self worth. \n\n- smiling. What is that? Pictures? Pass. \n\n-Eating: I bite my lip a lot when I eat. I bite my lip when I sneeze too. \n\n-Brushing my teeth? Man that one is hard without the muscle capacity to be able to move your lips around to get a toothbrush up in there. Wow you seem to be much worse than me. \n\nI forgot to add in that I cannot smile properly either, so I edited it in. It sucks but I just deal. Get pain management and just go about my day. There is nothing that can make all of this stop or even just heal (that I have access to anyway). Just one day at a time. I consider myself \"done\" recovering.  I stalled at about 85%, and that was about 2 years ago. I cannot purse my lips enough to whistle, and my eyebrow on that side does not rise as far. I cannot pull my lips back far on that side, either.  But, on the whole, I am back to normal. I can blink like usual (for the most part) and eat and drink like usual (ditto).\n\nGot synkinesis, though, so that sucks.  Eyelid will move while eating/drinking sometimes, etc.\n\nIt is not great, but I do not mind all that much! really only miss the whistling. What about photos? Do you also almost always need several photos even if the lighting and everything else is right, just for one photo of you to turn out good? I am lucky -- I am a bearded guy.  So long as I smile with just my eyes/lips, it is pretty normal looking.  If I try a toothy smile, that is when things start to look \"unusual.\" I have had BP since sometime end of May 2021 (so just under 3 mos) and I can relate to most of these:\n\n1. Yep, same.\n2. I turn my face towards my normal side for pics. The weak (left) side of my lips I can now move into a slight smile, but the most I can manage without looking weird is a smirk. Laughing still makes me look like an idiot.\n3. Same. If I attempt to drink anything while forgetting about my BP, I almost always dribble it out. What I do is, I force my glass or cup against the left side of my mouth and use my right to seal. Some people said they resort to straws, but I have difficulty sealing over those. Often, half my lips just flap uselessly and make flatulence sounds loudly, which is embarrassing when eating out in public.\n4. Same. Burgers &amp; sandwiches are a nightmare, bcoz I cannot fully lift half my lips and they tend to get in the way. I cannot even recall the number of times I almost bit thru them, it is so frustrating. \n5. Yes, so true.\n\nStill cannot whistle. \n\nMy left eye could always shut, so I am thankful for that coz I never had that issue where I needed to tape it shut at night. However, it does not shut tightly, so the first two weeks of my BP I wore goggles in the shower. Also, my vision there gets blurred at irregular intervals, so driving in particular becomes a challenge.\n\nI have had to tell the upper management at my office about my BP, coz seeing myself in a Zoom meet, I really looked odd, and they would have to look at me on a regular basis, so best if I got that cleared up right away. But for most other people I do not say anything unless they ask; it is just so tiring having to explain it repeatedly.\n\nDespite it all, I am rather optimistic that most of my symptoms will go away in due time. Maybe its bcoz it has only been three months for me, but still. \n\nAnyway, I hope OP and everyone else on this sub continue to see improvements over their BP symptoms. I am 2 years and a few months out and I am only 85% recovered. People who did not know me before cannot tell, but I definitely look different and still have asymmetry in my face. had mine since... i think 2018?\n\ni am able to grin, but i generally avoid a full on smile\n\nuse thinner straws. straws should be used on the strong side. cups on the weak side (with practice, i still spill, but it is more managable this way)\n\nif you eat by yourself, always use your weak side. yeah you will make a mess, but you will gain better control of your muscles overtime. you cant overcome nerves that dont grow back, but you can work on muscle control since a bunch of nerves are crossed to the wrong muscles\n\ni also massage parts that 'feel itchy'. i think it is the nerves growing back but that is probably just me trying to make myself feel better. do you know a good way to manage/fix synkinesis? i still havent found a good way. As far as I am aware, it isnt reversible. I could be wrong though. I got bells palsy back in july of 2020. My left side has improved alot. My left eye can blink on its own now, i can still notice the difference but its not as bad. As it was in the beginning. My vertigo and ringing in the ear never went away. ringing in the ear ive gotten use to. In can go unnoticed until i pay attention to it. And its not like in the beginning were any noice will make it a louder ringing. Left side of my head still fills numb. I have a really hard time controlling my anger. I never had anger issues before. And idk if its because of my BP but i believe so.", "History of neurological problems? I have noticed that I have kind of had a couole neurological problems growing up and that I do not respond to pain as I should (again problem in nerves) and that I also had Bell's Palsy.\nDo you think people with a history of neurological problems are more prone to Bell's Palsy? Well, I do not have any neurological problems, and I had bells Same, no track of neurological problems in the past till I got BP. Thanks but I am curious to know tho if there is a correlation Have you checked for actual studies on that at Research Gate? I have epilepsy and am currently having my second episode of Bell\u2019s Palsy (on day 4). My first BP episode was 10 years ago almost to the month. My seizure disorder started over 20 years ago when I was a teenager. I am 35 now. I have always wondered if they are related but all of my doctors have never been able to confirm. I am having an MRI next week and am getting tested for Lyme disease. Hopefully I will get some answers!", "When did you get your taste back? How many days after diagnosis? I miss ice cream. Everything I put in my mouth tastes like Prednisone :( U sure u just do not have Covid? Yea I was diagnosed with palsy... I thought it was normal for things to taste weird with this condition. Hmm maybe that is why my taste buds arnt great. Had mine for over 10 years still not better. About 80% good. \n\nSorry I am not sure. Hopefully you heal correctly. Mine lasted about 2 or 3 days. About a week That was the first thing that came back. About 3 weeks for me. Never lost it, for all 4 times I had it. I lost it when I had COVID though. I only lost my taste on the side of my face that was affected by the bells, so I never completely lost it. But I guess it took about 6 weeks for me. Two weeks in and still no taste. I miss bacon.", "Severe shoulder/Neck pain on affected side Diagnosed January of 2014, after being outside in very low temperatures. Since then recovery has been about 80%. \n\nNow I am mostly dealing with synkenesis, (which seems to be getting better slowly) and Crocodile tears while eating.\n\nThe most annoying symptom post Bell\u2019s palsy is the extreme pain in my neck and shoulder on the affected side. It is almost as if the muscle is under tense strain all day. If I accidentally sleep on that side at night it is 10x worse. Not sure if anyone has felt this pain after Bell\u2019s palsy and wanted to get some feedback on anyone who may have. I had similar pain after the first week, right after the steroids. I was diagnosed end of January. Are you currently in pain? Yeah it is at least once a week most times more than that. otc pain killers work but I need to figure out the root of the problem. Have you seen a neurologist? No, my plan was to speak to a physical therapist next to understand my issue and to see if it is even related to the synkenesis. I would make an appointment with the neurologist and get an MRI. They are the ones that could possibly tell you what is causing it", "Day 8 I was diagnosed with bells exactly 8 days ago. I was noticing that my eye was not blinking so that day I went in and got it checked out and they told me that I had it. I immediately started taking my meds and tried to get as much rest as I needed. It is only been 8 days, but I seem to look a lot better. In my case, I was lucky to not have serious facial damages, but it was noticeable. I still cannot blink in my left eye and my smile is not totally bad yet, but I would say I am about 80% recovered and hoping to be better in a week or so. The first couple of days were brutal and I hated going out, but I learned to deal with it and that it is life. Stay positive people!!! I had tooth surgery and after a month I waked up feeling like I have anesthesia on the right side. Went to doctor and ER and got diagnosed with it. I am on day 3 no improvement yet, got slightly worse. I still can move the right side of my face but it is so weak, and I cant shut my right eye independently. Seems pretty mild hope it will pass soon.\n\nDo you use eye drops/lotion? Is it necessary? I can shut my eyes when sleeping. I did not start to see improvement until day 5 I think. Yours seems mild so hopefully it should be better in a couple of weeks if you are taking your meds. I use eye drops since I notice my eye gets dry a lot. I tapped my eye shut for the first couple of days but I do not need it as much so I stopped. Stay strong! It is only temporary and will get better with time and rest.", "Recovery with Bell\u2019s palsy Hope everyone is doing well. I am in 6 month in into bells palsey and I have a few questions that if anyone could help, I would be so thankful. I was wondering if:\n\u2022anyone who has a lot of twitching on the affected side when trying to smile means it is a good sign?\n\u2022I got bells palsey from jaw surgery and the swelling caused the facial nerve to be damaged, does this mean I have chances of worse recovery than normal? \n\u2022when does the eye on the affected side go back to normal? My eye is so much larger than the other. \n\u2022any experiences with recovery would be so encouraging and helpful so feel free to comment anything below. \nHave a great rest of your day!", "My eye is driving me nuts. I am 3 months in with Bell's Major Annoyance. \nI use drops regularly to lubricate my eye, although it does not seem dry. In fact, it is constantly dripping and I have to wipe tears every few minutes or they will run down my face.\n\nNonetheless it burns as if it were dry. I do not rub it - I dab the tears carefully with a wadded tissue.\n\nI do not use the cream at night anymore, nor do I wear a patch. Like I said it seems well lubed - constant tears.\n\nDoes anyone experience the same? Am I doing something terribly wrong? Sounds about right, patience is the key. Im a year in and have made good progress. Still not 100% I am sorry. You are saying that this is normal? Have you experienced the same? Are you able to close the eye? If not, I would recommend using SOMETHING at night.\n\nI was able to keep my eye closed once I used my fingers to shut it.  So I just figured I would not need a patch.  My Doctor correctly pointed out that we open our eyes all the time while asleep, and if I was not awake enough to actually close the eye with my fingers, it was likely staying open all night thereafter.  I started taping it shut after that and my eye began to feel much better during the day.\n\nMy point is that, despite how teary it seems, your eye might still be hanging out in the open during the night (unless you are able to close it) even though you do not realize it.  The tape was annoying for a few nights, but eventually I got used to it.  I still tape it ever so often even though I am \"healed,\" on those nights where it seems to be acting up. For me i had a similar period of time and experienced this too. Luckily it has gotten a bit better. It seems to do strange things as the nerves heal Needed to use drops for awile The eye closes quite well. I know because I can wash my hair again without covering the eye with one hand.\n\nI never taped. Instead I use a regular eye patch and took a couple of my wife's makeup remover pads and put them between the patch and the (closed) eyelid. Worked wonderfully, took a couple of seconds to set up and was extremely comfortable.\n\nI might try it for a couple of nights to see if that is any help. I have experienced the same and still do from time to time.  I am 6 months in and about 90% recovered. You could Try using a thicker gel-type lubricant? Or could you be sensitive/allergic to the type of drops you are using? That could be causing you to tear up and feel irritated. The eye is watering and tearing because your nerves cannot control your tear ducts which hold in  and control the tears and move them into valves. Your eye can still be dry even though you are tearing. I recommend using thicker eye lubricant instead of eyedrops and go to an eye doctor to make sure your overall eye health is good. \n\nHad BP June 18 to August 18. Sometimes I still get headaches and twitches but luckily no more facial paralysis &gt; Your eye can still be dry even though you are tearing.\n\nThank you. This is what I suspected. I do have the gel lubricant and it soothes my eye. Obviously it makes vision terribly blurry so I feel I have to use a patch when I use it. I only used the thick eyedrops at night before bed because they made my vision flurry too lol I do not want to scare you but I am 2.5 years into BP and still have to use prescription eye ointment and drops.  My advice is get to an opthamologist asap.  My eye still gets inflamed daily but the medication controls it well.  I had the same crazy tearing alternating with extreme dryness.  If the opthamologist does not get you on the right track you might need to see a neurological opthamologist.  Unfortunately I know way too much about this so feel free to pm me.", "I smoked Cannabis for the first time in months (I usually use CBD). My left side facial paralysis ceased - I felt my cheek, my dimple came back and had a symmetrical smile for the first time in over a year! Now the affects of the weed have ceased, my face has dropped again. (High then not high)  When i use cannabis oil, I feel like I can feel more in the side that is affected. I used to think it was just in my head, but seeing your picture makes me think it actually is working!\n\nGlad to see that you are making progress. Even your paralysis pic looks pretty good to me. I probably would not know if I saw you and met you. Nice! Always nice to hear someone finding relief or happiness, even if it is just for a moment. Sometimes that moment of feeling normal is truly priceless to the person, believe me I know. I had a stroke a few years back. Sometimes my foot drags or my grip goes weak in the hand on the same side. Smoking cannabis makes both issues go away for the first half hour or so. It is nice to be able to walk into a store and get a cup of coffee like a normal person for a change without people thinking I am drunk or something or staring at me when stroke walk kicks in. I have used the cbd oil for a while in conjunction with smoking cbd flower and it has never had this affect. I definitely think it has had some sort of affect on the whole side of my body! \n\nAnd Thankyou so much\u2026. I am struggling a lot with my confidence as I have had left side weakness and drooping since April 2020 and I had no self esteem to start with, and now I barely take selfie\u2019s or look in the mirror as much (I was a model for a while and been a makeup artist for 13 years). It is been a journey. I really hope my neurologist takes note and is able to apply for funding for actual therapeutic cannabis  use for me or something. It is just insane the difference I never thought it could happen! Thankyou so much. I am sorry you go through that. I have left side weakness and drag my left foot too so I empathise completely. I have had 10+ stroke type episodes in the last year (but not actual strokes) I am quite ill but I like to look well presented, wear makeup and I know my limits so I often get treated like a \u201cstupid person\u201d rather than a \u201cdisabled person\u201d which is quite difficult most of the time. I am glad we have found something that helps us! No, thank you! I know what you are going though first hand (I have had 5 smaller episodes too). I damn near teared up reading that comment, I know how that feeling so well and it takes a toll on me sometimes getting treated like that really sucks. Made me feel not so alone in my struggles for a moment reading it, not a feeling I get nowadays. I hope you keep doing well! And enjoy that smile, it is a great one. I am on my second bout of BP, unfortunately, and I felt the same way as you did when I was healing in the long term. My one eye definitely scrunches up when I smile that makes me lopsided. \n\nNow my other side is affected and I have no idea what I am going to look like when it is healed. It is been more than two months and I am just getting movement back, so right now I just want want my damned eyelid to close! I joke about it a lot, but it makes me really self conscious and I worry that my new side will be crooked in different ways and that I will look goofy. sigh. \n\nin any case, I feel your pain, but you are looking great and I hope you can have more positive changes from cannabis. Do not give up girl, this means it is possible to get back that awesome symmetrical face. I am not advocating to take drugs all the time ( I leave it up to you). Keep working on facial exercises and you will get it back. I also had similar experience after taking edibles, I could feel my muscles tension on the face on some muscles (like lips, eyes) and did some exercises while I was high and somehow I knew that these muscles needs to be worked upon and I have been regularly  massaging those areas and it has given me better results in past few months than last year. Glad im not the only one that noticed the effects of cannabis on my BP. even my mom saw the difference she said my eye looked better when i was medicated on cannabis and then the next week when i wasnt medicated she said my eye was noticeable. I wish they would do more studies on cannabis effects on bells palsy. That way people can be prescribed cannabis to help relieve there symptoms Do you smoke purely CBD or does it also have THC? What is the percentage breakdown? That is incredible I have never seen anyone have that result. I would suggest smoking and doing exercises while it is symmetrical to stimulate the nerves in that position.. Heyhey! Unfortunately I am in the UK and when we get WeEd it is just WeEd and you do not get a choice of types or strains or anything as it is illegal here :(. The CBD I get is 8%+ with less than 0.2% thc which is legal, so I guess the thc content of the real weed is much much higher which would be the contributing factor in my getting feeling back in my face. And I agree I was doing facial exercises when I was high to try to get feeling back in my face it felt like a miracle! Best of luck! X", "My steroids are finished after a week. I got diagnosed with BP on Sunday 6 June. Doctor gave me steroids Prednisone and they are finished already. I also got Diclofenac which is also now finished. I am going back to my doctor as l am wondering and l am worried of the next step from here.\n\nHow long have you guys taken your steroids for? One week of steorids &amp; anti-virals, five plus more weeks of waiting and eye drops. Two months later and I forget that I even had it. Good luck! Thank you for confirming this.  So could be on the right direction. I would make sure you are doing are facial exercises as well, I did a ton of those as well as acupuncture I was back to normal in 3 weeks. My aunt is insisting on accupunture l guess l just have to go for it. I just got diagnosed with BP 6 days ago. It got progressively worse over the course of 4 days. Now I am totally paralyzed on my left side. \nI was wondering what amount of Prednisone doctors have been recommending (started meds within 48 hours)??? My doc gave me 30mg/day for 5 days then tapering thereafter. I cannot find any consistency about the amount to take but I am very worried it is not enough.", "Just diagnosed Hey Yall I am a 21 year old male and I was just diagnosed with Bell's Palsy as a symptom of my TMJ.  I have had symptoms for about 3 days and Holy cow I am already over it. I have been reading and it is very impressive how well some of yall cope with this. My doc gave me a bunch of steroids and antivirals. I am a little freaked out because it really seems like the range for this is 2 weeks - a lifetime. I did not think it would be as big a deal as it is. I currently have some function in the right side of my face. It is not too noticeable except when I open tooth smile and blinking is kind of hard. I have also noticed it can be a little difficult to eat and straws suck. Any advice? Anyone else get Bell's because of TMJ? If you have some movement right now, you are probably going to have a pretty quick recovery (fingers crossed).\n\nA doc just told me that if you have zero movement at 4-6 weeks, there will likely be lingering effects like synkinesis or some more permanent paralysis.\n\nAt this point, make sure to rest a lot and do not force your expressions that are hard to make. It will not work and can even make things worse and cause synkinesis.\n\ncheck out some videos on gentle massage and stretching for BP online\n\nhope you heal quickly!!! I am 100% with you! The 2 weeks to a lifetime is scary AF! \nI \nhave been fortunate enough to have had BP (Bell\u2019s Palsy) THREE TIMES in a span of 10+ years. The last time was this April; which \u201cmay\u201d have been triggered by my Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nIn all my years of reading about it, I have not run into information connecting it to TMJ.\n\nGet you an eyepatch and cotton balls. Tuck the cotton balls inside the eye patch and wear it overnight. Helps keep your eye shut. Sometimes, I would even wear it during the day when my eye would get dried out from not being able to close. \n\nBest of luck to you. Be patient. Get creative. I got used to drinking beer with a straw! Thank you! Great advice! Beer with a straw?!?! Sounds like a foreign concept! Might have to tho It sucks, I know. But, got to make lemonade out of lemons! You are welcome. Sending positive vibes! I did shots with a straw a few weeks ago. \ud83d\ude02 Hi! First of all, I am sorry you are going through this - it is tough! I am also 21 and got BP back in August. My first signs of improvement showed up after 3 weeks (I was told i will be healed by then, lol). But now i can say i am healed 90-95%. I am still in treatment but hopeful that my face will be completely healed very soon!\n\n In those three weeks at the beginning, I felt very hopeless, insecure and certain that my face was going to look like that forever. (Spoiler: it most likely will not! even if it seems that way. BP can fuck with your mental health too, so it is very important that you make sure not to let those negative thoughts in) \n\nMy advice is rest, take your steroids and antivirals, do some gentle facial massages/exercices and take pictures/videos of yourself every few days. Believe me, you will see improvements better that way than looking into the mirror! \n\n(I cannot comment on BP due to TMJ unfortunately, since my BP's trigger is unknown)\n\nI wish you all the best and a speedy recovery! Been there! \ud83d\ude02", "Does BP have post effects? hi everyone! my name is Mia, im 20 years old and i had Bells Palsy in 2017 when i was 16. it lasted a few months and nothing ever came of it. just recently i have had eye twitches and the side where i was paralyzed gets tense and stiff sometimes? and just last month i lost my taste (nothing covid related) for a day. maybe im overthinking it but i would love to hear everyone else\u2019s journey/experiences and if they have had similar ones to mine. i just hope its not coming back. also im new to reddit so if im doing this wrong please forgive me. Well my first question is have you had a covid vaccine yet? I have heard people say that they got BP after they received the vaccine. I myself have had the Pfizer vaccine and my second dose was in January and 5 months later I got BP on my left side. It was mild and lasted about 3 weeks. I have not had any symptoms since.\n\nI have heard people that have it reoccur and maybe you are just having a mild case of it. What treatments did you have the first time? They just gave me steroids, but some people have talked about getting antiviral medication for treatment.\n\nIf you have seen your doctor for the first BP, then I would say see them again just to touch base with them and for the record keeping. yes, i got moderna in april &amp; my 2nd dose in may. i just recently seen that someone else was also having the same symptoms i have been having and they havent had bp in years. and for treatments, i dont recall being on anything. my pediatrician (pediatrician at the time since i was underage) didnt really give me good information. just do facial exercises. \n\nI really appreciate your help and education. although it was years ago i am now recently learning about it!!! yes, I am on my second bout of BP, but I have lingering effects from the first round 10 years ago, mainly tension and tightness in the affected side\n\nMy husband had bell's two years ago (lucky us!) and he had a mild case, but still feels weird tension and numbness occasionally. I had BP for a few weeks in July this year. I now have TMJ because of it, that is the only lasting side effect I have had", "Drinking alcohol? So I recently (as in today) got a diagnosis for bells palsy. I have started steroids (although not anti-virol) but I was wondering if it is still okay to drink?\n\nI had asked the doctor who treated me and he said just do not over do it more or less because of the steroids. \n\nI have a friend's birthday coming up and they are going out and I would love to come with and get drunk with them as they are really dear to me and this is a big kind of milestone for them. \n\nHowever I heard from one sufferer on Reddit randomly in the comments (great source I know) who said it would make recovery slower or even possibly stop a full recovery.\n\nAnyone got a clue, obviously I am inclined to listen to my doctor but just because it is such a small thing (comparatively) I would ask here too. \n\nAlso for the record I am not a big drinker, I would only really be drinking on that one day and not really any other time in my recovery. I would avoid anything that depletes or taxes your immune system as a general rule. Probably no definitive evidence one way or the other on alcohol, but keeping your immune system healthy was a priority for me.   I think you should be okay so long as you cut yourself off at one or two drinks. That point at which you get nice and relaxed is good. Getting buzzed? Better stop there. Getting tipsy? You went too far, because now your body is struggling to keep up and you are taxing your system. You want to maximize your chances of a full recovery or you risk permanent nerve damage, paralysis, and pain for the rest of your life. Not even worth it.\n\nOne of the **most important** things for recovery from BP is getting plenty of restorative sleep. If you do go out, try to **get back home early** and get to bed. Seriously. \n\nAlso, avoid spending too much time out in the cold. Cold air on your face is really bad for BP. I am 11 months in with BP and 90% back. I drank. Saw no reason not too.  It will not stop the nerve growing back.  I probably drink 6 or so times a month so not a big drinker but I think it is fine.  One of the things about BP is your mental health as its hard to go through so anything that keeps that we will such as seeing friends is a good thing. \nBut go easy.  Order white color alcohol such as vodka or tequila and mix loads of tonic/soda water. U will still join the festivities and explain to them this is a special time for you. If they see you as a good of a friend as you see them, they will understand ", "This is my story\u2026  Take care and speedy recovery! My primary care doc got blood work done for me after I was diagnosed at the ER. Perhaps ask your doc if they can do anything about the pain and swelling? Lots of water while you are on your meds and of course, rest. I opted for an anti-inflammation diet and took turmeric supplements as well but still swelled up in my 2nd week. You bring up great points. I will have her run bloodwork for sure at my follow up. I got a B12 shot over the weekend and will get one every week for the next couple. I will look in to the supplements - hope the pills are not too big, I have a hard time swallowing Advil. \ud83d\ude48.. I will look into the diet as well\u2026 I do not think I would have considered that so thank you for pointing it out. Where did you get your B12 shot. My docs refused to prescribe the injections and told me to take supplements. There is an urgent care here that has them. I am not good with pills in general so I could not do the supplements. Thanks for the reply. Btw you do not need a prescription so call around different doctor's offices to see if they offer it. Places that offer vitamin drips also do B12 shots and weight loss clinics offer them too. In a pinch, take sublingual B12. Great plan on the B12 shots! My acupuncturist mentioned it helped her other patient a lot. I am lucky I am slightly past week 4 and almost fully recovered. The turmeric supplements are not too big, standard capsule size. The lysine ones were huge along with the anti viral. Also no harm applying CBD topicals on your face. I was planning on doing acupuncture next actually\u2026 my anti-virals are small - yet somehow I still managed to choke on one earlier today \ud83d\ude48.. I have to look at the CBD oil\u2026 \n\nI start weaning off the Prednisone in the next day - looking forward to that. I feel like my body has not responded well to those..I am on two pills a day right now and will be doing just one for 2 days and then 1/2 for 2 days\u2026 \n\nThe anti-virals are 10 days 5 pills a day..\ud83d\ude2c \ud83d\ude06 with all the supplements you may start getting used to the larger pills. FWIW, my doc told me to get more Vitamins B and C and Zinc so I found throw some multi vitamin gummies and \"immunity\" (the ones with a lot of Vit C and Zinc) gummies in my regime just because... Gummies! My anti-virals were 1 large pill a day so they were fun to take with the lysine. \n\nDefinitely try acupuncture. I felt much better after each session. Mine takes pictures of my progress each session and asks where I am hurting each time. She definitely encouraged more massages (pushing towards the ear and down the neck) when I was swollen and in pain. She did gua sha on my head, neck and back when I was most in pain. Helped a lot with the pain and I did not take painkillers the whole time. Well, I generally try not to take painkillers anyway.", "More of us than one would suspect. Hello all. I am in my third day. Thank you for sharing your experiences and encouragement. I have been amazed at how many people I encounter have experienced Bell\u2019s Palsy either first or second-hand. My ER doctor said mine was the third case they had seen this week, and I do not live in a huge city or anything. It is certainly taking some adjusting, and I was devastated to learn that half of my expression had gone - perhaps forever. I resolved immediately that if I only have half a smile, I must smile twice as much! Keep that positivity coming! Good luck and speedy recovery to you all. Great attitude!  I think something like 80% recover in 2-3 weeks.  Not me though.  Good luck! You will get better! Everybody's recovery is different.  Do not lose hope if it seems to be going slowly.  I had zero improvement for 3 months and then I got to about 25% after another month.  \n\nOn the other hand, I know a guy who was completely healed within 3 weeks.\n\nJust stay patient! I am on 2 years and not fully recovered. Everything works great. I cannot pucker and my eye is still a bit slow. Took me about 6-8 weeks, but recovery was basically 100%.  Keep the faith! For me the most shocking to know was how many people get bell palsy, or knew about someone who also get it, and I have never heard about when I was paralyzed. Mine took more like 2-3 months. Do not give up hope! Thank you all for your kind words of affirmation. *hugs* \u263a\ufe0f So sorry that you are going through this. When I was in the ER they told me that I was the third case in that day so despite how rare my Google searches told me Bell's Palsy was, I am finding far more people afflicted by it than I thought. I am grateful for the support here and from everyone else who has gone through this before sharing their concern and tips. I am about a month in and I would say I have gotten about 60-70% of my motion back. I hope you recover as quickly as I am. Prepared for the long haul, but optimistic. No improvements as of yet. I am glad to tell people about it in public, too. Seems like sharing brings out all kinds of stories about family members and successful (mostly) recovery. Happy to hear you are improving!", "Feeling stressed- vent post I am feeling really stressed which I am sure is not helping my Bell\u2019s palsy\u2026 I just feel like I am doing everything around the house\u2026 all the work\u2026 taking care of the kids\u2026 making the food\u2026. And I feel like CRAP\u2026. I am tired\u2026 I am in a lot of pain\u2026. I do not feel like doing anything\u2026 my fianc\u00e9 is just sitting around playing video games, not working because he got hurt at work in November\u2026 but he is honestly perfectly fine. I feel as if he is milking it honestly. He has a mildly herniated disc in his neck and mild bulging in his lower spine\u2026.but so do I! I have problems with my spine and arthritis I have a tumor in my t5 vertebra and now I have Bell\u2019s palsy and possibly Covid. I am so drained and for once I just want to be taken care of. If he cooks he gets frustrated if he takes care of our kids he gets frustrated, if I ask for a massage he says he is in too much pain. I just feel so defeated at this point. I have missed my period and now worry I am pregnant and worried he is not going back to work!The only time he really shows me any kind of affection is when he wants sex. I usually have a very high sex drive but I have been in so much pain and I am so tired I do not feel like it so I have not been denying him but I have just been laying there pretending I like it but really I cannot wait for it to be over so I can sleep and try not to focus on my pain. \n\nIs anyone else in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Dumping him and making him move out is not even an option. Been with him for 11 years, have 3 kids, we own too much together\u2026 it would be way too complicated and stressful for me to even consider right now. My mom and dad are both dead and gone, I have no family\u2026.. it is just not an option. I have tried talking to him but it really does not get anywhere other than he just says \u201cI am sorry but I am in pain too\u201d and that is the end of the conversation\u2026.. \n\nI FEEL SO DEFEATED AND I FEEL LIKE IM DYING IM IN SO MUCH PAIN AND IM SO TIRED!", "Is there still a chance of full recovery? Hello, this is my first post here, I would like to apologize if I have a grammatical error, because English is not my mother tongue. And also, sorry if it is too long, I just want to contextualize the whole situation.\n\nMy girlfriend had facial paralysis six or seven years ago, if I remember correctly, on her left side. At the time, she went to seek treatment, but I do not really know the details of what went wrong because we were not together yet. All I know is that the doctor who saw her did not take the case seriously, dismissing the situation and recommending that she wait for her face to return to normal over the weeks. At the time, her family was also in a very bad financial situation, which ended up preventing her from undergoing physical therapy even without a medical referral.\n\nHer face never returned to normal. Of course, in the beginning it was much more complicated and severe, and nowadays, the only issue that really bothers her is aesthetics. When she has a relaxed face, you do not even notice that she has had any type of facial paralysis in her life, however, when she smiles, the scenario changes. It can be seen that one side is wide open and the other opens very little. In addition to the smile, her left eye is also affected; she can blink and close it well, the only issue is that the eyelid falls a little when she smiles and when she drinks or eats something, it cannot stay supported.\n\nTwo years ago Itook her for some physical therapy sessions, which she maintained a routine for approximately four months of treatment. After that, she needed to go back to the neurologist for a new referral to the sessions, but due to other problems, she ended up not making another appointment. She was always quite skeptical of physical therapy because she thought it would not help any more due the time the incident had happened, that it would not resolve more and her smile would never return to normal ever again. She always considered having surgery to solve it and I always said it might be a possibility for the future, but for now physical therapy was still the best option. Surgery would be the last resort.\n\nThis week I am going to make a new appointment with a neurologist so that she can do the physiotherapy sessions once again. My question is: after all this time since the paralysis, is it possible that it will regress once and for all and that she can smile normally again? That she can keep her left eye wide open when laughing or eating? I really do not know, because everything I read talks about immediate treatment as soon as the episode happens, nothing is said about a longer period of time. I know that therapy is not going to hurt her, but I also want to be realistic, just to not give her false hopes. And as for the surgery, I read somewhere that it is considered risky because it can damage your hearing and something else, that is, it is out of question, even if she thinks it is her only hope.\n\nCould someone clarify that for me, please? And thanks if you read all down here, I appreciate it. Her story sounds similar to mine. I got it at age 12, very young. I am now 40 and never got more than about 30% of my movement back. Tough road, but having supportive significant other makes all the difference! When looking for physical therapist ask if they have a \"pinpoint muscle activator\" it is an electric muscle stimulator that will help get the muscle moving along with facial excercises. \n\nI know it is not for everyone but I also have been doing acupuncture where they hook up electrodes to the needles and send pulses into the muscles and this has seemed to help a lot.", "Mouth symptoms on unaffected side? My right side is affected. Cannot close eye independently of the other. Cannot smile on that side, squeeze eye shut or scrunch you nose.\nBut the unaffected/unparalyzed side feels weird around the mouth. Slightly numb but it moves.\nAnyone else have mouth symptoms on unaffected side? Yes, I had this numbing feeling around my mouth on the unaffected side as well. This went away after a few weeks and I never had any problems or loss of movement on the unaffected side..just felt numb on my chin and lower jaw on unaffected side for a couple of weeks.", "Tips? (CBD?) About a week ago I woke up to the right side of my tongue feeling a little bit numb. Over the course of two days the right side of my face practically stopped working. Uneven smile, my eye will not fully close, sensitive hearing, tight muscles and very slight pain here and there. I still have to make a doctors appointment with my family doctor. Any tips on the eye area? It is seriously so irritating because it feels dry but keeps getting watery and I am barely able to see out that eye. An ice pack on the eye eases the dryness a little bit but I have also been putting a heating pad on the side of my face. Has anyone tried any CBD oil or CBD moisturizer? I am seriously hoping for a very speedy recovery.", "Second Time Around for Bells Hello everyone.  My boyfriend recommended this page to me as I have been having a really rough week after getting what looks like Bells Palsy a second time.  I have always read how it is rare to happen twice, and the first time I got it was horrible as I am sure you all know.  I have never really posted online to a community so I am not sure what to expect but I figure maybe either someone will give me some helpful advice which would be amazing, or someone reading who is going through something similar might feel some connectivity and not feel so alone through this process.  \n\nThe first time I got BP It took about 3 months to recover to about 85% with acupuncture, massage, exercise, the works.  I still had pain in my jaw similar to TMJ and my eye was never quite the same but I was ok with that and had tried to move past the cosmetic aspect that bothered me post-bells.  It is been three years nearly to the day since I first got diagnosed.  Last week I noticed strange twitching in my eye and lip of the opposite Bell\u2019s palsy side.  I started to panic, but kept trying to tell myself that it is rare and cannot happen to me twice.  The next day my tongue was numb and my speech was slurred.  I knew it was most likely bells and tried to stay calm.  I have realized that this is about the worst time to be sick as my doctors office is nearly impossible to reach and I tried to avoid the ER at all costs.  I did a teleconference with my MD who thought it was another bout of BP, did the same drug regiment that I informed him I took 3 years ago, referred me for a brain CT and that was that.  I was able to get the CT that day but it took my MD 4 days to read it and get back to me that it was all WNL.  I was referred to a neurologist whom I have not seen before and due to Covid19 they are extremely limited on appointments so that took another three day\u2019s to arrange a call back to make a consult.  I am growing pretty frustrated with how much my doctors office is lagging but I am trying to keep in mind there are others much worse and I am sure they are dealing with a bunch of shit right now too with this virus.  I just did not have this much trouble getting seen the last time but I have a feeling it probably would not change much.  As I am sure you guys all know, there is not much the drs tell you about BP.  I am just so scared to have it a second time, and I am worried I will not recover as well or at all.  Since it is the opposite side, I wonder if now both sides will be at best 85% better?  I am only 32, my birthday is next week and I am just so upset about this happening and I feel selfish that people are dying and I am dwelling over my drooping face and how ugly I feel.  I am sorry this post started off as positive and shifted to a negative.  I am just lost as to what is going on with me right now... That Is sucks. Hang in there! You have your right to feel that way. Maybe talk to a love one about how u feel. You beaten this once you can do it again! Thank you I appreciate it! Anytime! Stay strong and safe in this hard times! I cannot imagine the feeling of going through this again especially when its so hard to get medical care. You are very justified in your complaints and how you feel. Hang in there.", "Frustrated, possible reoccurance It is been exactly 1 year since my initial bout of Bell\u2019s Palsy with a very mild reoccurrence in December. I have days I can feel weakness or tiredness through my cheek when I am tired.\nThis weekend I had a very stressful day and could feel the spot on my neck start hurting which was my initial symptom the first time. I felt better yesterday, but today I am in pain again. I am nervous this is the start of another round, but I am curious if anyone has any advice to prevent it getting worse. My neurologist frustrates me bc she sent me to the hospital last time for testing with the mild reoccurrence and would like to avoid that. Any suggestions? I do find that when I get tired or stressed my affected side gives me a lot more pain and weakness. I hope it is not a reoccurrence, but if it is, I hope it passes quickly. I also find this happening... I think I am vulnerable now and I get face twitching years on since my last BP bout, but to be honest it does not unnerve me anymore. I suppose this is where we have a weakness so any stress our body is under will show up in symptoms again. That is how I see it - utterly unscientific but my logic!", "I have footage of my Bell's Palsy attack. Should I post it to this SubReddit? On Monday I started complaining of an earache. On Wednesday during a Zoom call I experienced the start of the facial nerve problems. So I have the footage. Is anyone interested? Should I post it here? I would love to see it Absolutely. I would also love to see it.\n\nI was driving to my doctors to be seen for an earache when my last episode triggered. I had never had one come on so fast before. Thank you. I will work on it now. Thank you. Yes. I am working on the video now. I will post it tomorrow. How interesting! I would love to see it. I too started with an ear ache. I woke up to full paralysis on my right side. It would be cool to actually see it happen I just got word that the Reddit Lords are considering me a spammer. I promise to put the footage up on the Johno and Friends YouTube and Facebook. Peace everyone! I hope you all heal quickly. I just passed my two year anniversary of BP (I recovered in 3months) and my Snapchat memories were all horrible pictures and videos of me with half a smile lmaooo Aw I have posted the video to the Bell's Palsy subreddit. Thank you for the support.", "How long does it take for the affected eye to become the same size as the other side my affected side is noticeably much smaller especially when squinting how long did it take for you guys for it to return to its regular size or tips you used to speed the process up  I am not sure if this is what you are experiencing, but if it is smaller due to synkinesis, it is not something that goes away on its own. I have one eye that squints when I smile as a result of Bell's Palsy. The nerve rewires in a slightly wrong way and you end up squinting when you smile and also smiling when you close your eyes. \n\nI have heard biofeedback can be helpful to retrain the nerves, but I have not found anyone to try that with. how long have you had bell\u2019s palsy for? I am on my second bout of BP, but this time on the other side of the face\n\nI had the first one ten years ago and got synkinesis after I was healed. That time was about 6-8 weeks until getting back movement, and I started noticing in photos that one eye was smaller and more squinty. \n\nI am almost six months into recovery this time and I am still missing a lot of facial movement, especially in my eyebrow. I can close my eye most of the time. It is been very frustrating. did you ever use electrical stimulation in any of your recoveries the one from ten years ago or the one now no, only a little electrical stimulation at acupuncture, but not much Was that in the first or second bout of BP? And what type of electrical stim was it with sticky pads? only the first, and no, not sticky pads, just a little thing attached to the acupuncture needle. probably not considered actual electrical stim, though I have heard that can exacerbate it. \n\nI wish there were more answers.", "muscle group activation I have been recovering for half a year now (after the first 3 months without any), and everything is slowly but surely coming back ( with a few small synkinesis). But one specific muscle group is not doing anything. The muscles that make my lips pout and move my upper lip are not doing anything, not even a bit. Is there any treatment or training I could do to try to make them move as well?  I have noticed my lip is the hardest to control as well. Everywhere else got SOME improvement but you are right for some reason that area is stubborn\u2026 let me know if you find anything :/", "Just got it, depressed af I have been doing okay, but as of recently my stress has gone off the roof. \n\u2022 Colleague/ friend resigns without notice, he might have been embezzling\n\u2022 Employer has tasked me with the investigation\n\u2022 Roommate leaves\n\u2022 car breaks down,  $1500 to fix \n\u2022 Do not get paid till Friday\n\u2022 I work 30 miles away,  uber is $36\n\nNow honestly, those things are manageable, and I have the funds to get back on track ... but getting Bell's Palsy was like the straw that broke the camel's back when it came to my mental health. \n\nI found out 4 days ago, I was drinking water and I started dribbling, I took a pic with gf and I notice something off about my smile ... the next day at work people thought I had a stroke.  Go to ER they tell me the news, go to primary physician, he tells me how this may last months, potentially years... the news sinks in, gf does not want to nurse me ... leaves, it was a new relationship,  cannot get mad at her ... I know I do not need a nurse.  Having a hard time eating and drinking. \n\nThe good news I got the medicine prescribed and insurance ... I am just sad Hang in there. It has been a long road for me (6 months now and still not all back yet). I tried about 5 different suggested remedies and the one that I think started movement was getting lymphatic drainage massage. It is a facial massage that focuses on the lymph system to keep stuff flowing. I still do not fully understand it, but after three months of no movement, I went to one massage and it started to move a tiny bit and now my smile is mostly back and people do not notice. That is my recommendation to you but I am sure you had many others. Hope all goes well for you. \n\nPS. Have some fun with it. I was speaking to a group of teens and I opened by explaining my condition. I did say that my costume for Halloween is really easy since half my face is not working, can anyone guess? A kid raised his hand and said \u201cTwo-Face\u201d (as I anticipated). I looked at him and said, \u201cHow cruel of you to make fun of me! I wanted to go as Spider-Man because I am ashamed of my face and you mock me?!?\u201d I let him off the hook, said I was just kidding and we all laughed pretty hard. 9.13.19 was the day i woke up to my Bells palsy.   Trip to ER confirmed.\nI was prescribed prednisone and an antiviral.   I also took b12 and omega 3 vitamins.   Eye drops too!  \n\nAround week 3, I had control over my effected eye blinking.   And around week 4, I had a somewhat normal smile.   And now, I am pretty much fully recovered.  I still get \"zingers\" where it feels like a muscle spasm around my mouth or in the middle of the cheek.   Rest is huge!  I feel like once I was able to get some good sleep,  I turned the corner.  \n\nNot sure where you live, but Glad Press N Seal was a game changer with my eye.  It was so much more gentle than tape to keep my eye closed when I had no control over my blinking.   I would add eye drops to my eye, use a square of Press N Seal and cover my eye.  \n\nOnce i was diagnosed i heard from several people i work with that had experienced Bells palsy too.  So that really helped my outlook. You did not need that girl to be your \u201cnurse\u201d. You do need to relax though and try not to stress. I agree with some type of massage or physical therapy to help you regain strength in your face muscles. I always recovered after a couple months but my first 3 weeks sucked. Stress such a double-edged sword. When I got BP I took it as my body trying to communicate with me that I needed to chill TF out. Because stress can help trigger it, and it can also delay recovery. But when people say, \"You need to avoid stress,\" like, what exactly are you supposed to do with that? It not like I was actively seeking stress in my life beforehand. You cannot just not go to work, not fix your car, not deal with all that crap.\n\nBut there are some things you can do. I suggest looking into doing 10 minutes of meditation a day for starters. Find some relaxing music that you can enjoy. Let go of some of the crap in your life that you might be worrying about but that you cannot really do anything about. Practice deep breathing techniques, and get plenty of sleep. Odds are good that you will recover if not fully then close to it within a month or two. If not, then you will learn to adapt. It really does suck to have this card dealt to you, but your best course of action right now is to try to take it easy and not fight it. I just got diagnosed on 1/30. The day before my fianc\u00e9\u2019s birthday (sorry, party\u2019s cancelled). 3 months before my wedding (can we mix the photographer?). I  guess there is never a good time for it, but it does seem to have super shitty timing. It is so depressing. I cried for the first 3 days. I just had Lasik in August, so my eyes are already pretty dried out and I am petrified to somehow screw up the thing I just saved up and shelled out 4 grand for. Not to mention it has been really nice to see again. \n\nI am right there with ya. But you bet your sweet ass I am trying every snake oil and advice someone offers. I have got the steroids and anti vitals on deck. Got some super goopy jelly eye drops. Took some days off work to pretty much alternate between *Murder, She Wrote* and naps. I just started B12 supplements yesterday. I even hear turmeric is good for inflammation so I have been force feeding myself a delightful concoction of turmeric + pepper paste. And I am trying so hard not to look in the mirror. \n\nThis sucks! But from reading about everyone is experience, I do feel encouraged. Not so lonely. And weirdly enough, the more people I tell about it, the more I find that they knew someone else who had it. For me, that is a little bit of consolation. I think it helps the sadness. One day at a time. \n\nToday\u2019s challenge: go back to work A) forget that girl. B) take time off from work! I woke up on Easter morning of 2019 and thought I would had a stroke. I went to the ER and they told me to resume life as usual, so I worked for the first two weeks I had it because I did not know any better, took the third week off and that is when I started healing. It took about two months for me to be \u201cnormal\u201d again, and I still have a little tightness/pain but you cannot tell I ever had it externally. BP fucks with your mental health in surprising ways so you have to take care of yourself. If you have supportive friends and family hang out with them, do not hide away and let yourself get more saddened by it. Good company is just as important as time off. Join the FB group for it, it is very active so any questions you may have will get answered. It is not fully understood by doctors and some do not seem to fully grasp what sufferers go through with pain and other strange symptoms of BP so it is nice to have a community to talk to.", "Acupuncture questions So I am close to 2 months in, no improvement yet.  I went to an acupuncturist last Saturday.  I messaged before hand and asked if she had experience in Bells Palsy, she said she did, and I saw her, little risk, possible high gain, right?  \n\nI have never done this before and she was really knowledgeable and wanted to focus on more of my immune system.  So I was surprise that most the work (needles) were in my feet and arms, one at my upper lip and one at my chin.  \n\nI guess I was expecting more focus on my face, but I am not sure how it works with all the nerves connecting through the body.\n\nSo my question is, previous acupuncture patients, how did the appointments actually go?   Am I on the right track, or should I check around.  I understand one treatment will not immediately fix this and I am going back tomorrow.  Just wanted some input.\n\nThank you! First week my acupuncturist did not put any needles in my face at all. Second week she started with some needles on my face for the affected side and 2 needles on the other side of my face. This was about thrice a week that I was visiting her before tapering to once a week after month 1. She said in the first week they treat Bell's like your immune is shot to shreds. In my second or third week, she had a student with her and she was walking her through the points, what to do and why so I felt like she is been transparent about it. \n\nTo be the biggest difference is the pain in my head, jaw and behind my ear would go away or be very reduced after each acupuncture session.\n\nGood luck and speedy recovery! Thank you, sounds like I am on the right track, just never knew enough about it.  I can only go once a week, hopefully it will help out I agree with moonpizzapie. I had a similar experience and I was told by my acupuncturist that it was to balance out the Qi or something\u2026cannot remember exactly. I have had bells palsy twice before and I I must admit that when treated with acupuncture I saw better results and faster improvement than the previous times. All the best OP! Thank you!  Hope so I just went to my first acupuncture appointment yesterday. Im 90 days in with BP with zero improvement. He put 3 needles on each foot/ankle, 3 in each arm/hand, and altogether around 15 needles on my ears/face/scalp. I do not know how it all works either. Just hoping it works! I have to go back 2-3x a week for the next few weeks. \n\nGood luck to you! Best of luck to you too! Acupuncturist here. Every Acupuncturist uses slightly different points and protocols. Usually I do not use as many facial points on the first week if the BP has just started because for up to 1-2 weeks it can get worse especially with acupuncture. And if it was just your first visit, she could have used general points to get your body ready for future treatments. I often do that for people who have never had acupuncture before to kind of ease them into acupuncture. Anyway, if in doubt ask the Acupuncturist. There are Acupuncturists who only use hand points or ear points or abdominal points or totally random places that may not seem to be related to your issue at all. I.e. using the elbow points for knee pain or wrist for ankle pain. \n\nMake sure to have all of your doubts and questions addressed by the Acupuncturist you are seeing. Having trust and faith in your Acupuncturist is the first step in getting better! Yeah, once a week is better than nothing. Also make sure to ask for herbal prescription as well.", "Looking for recommendations for Botox in NYC It is been 10+ years since I have had BP, I recovered 95% so only noticeable when i smile big or if you look closely at my eyelids. I am in my 30's now and wanted to get some boxtox for wrinkles but also figured it would be helpful to go to someone that has experience with BP as well. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on how to go about this? or have a good referral? I am in NYC.", "Recovering - new issue popped up. Hi everyone, been dealing with Bell\u2019s palsy since early February of this year. I had complete paralysis on the left side of my face. I have now recovered to the point where looking at me, you would not know anything was wrong. If I try to smile I cannot quite get a full one yet. \n\nDuring recovery, a new issue has popped up and i wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this. So when I move specific parts of my face (mouth, forehead, jaw) other parts I am not trying to move do so anyway. For instance, raising my forehead or yawning will make the muscles around my left eye move and constrict. Immediately afterwards it will sometimes twitch for a few seconds. It is rather uncomfortable and a little annoying. \n\nAnyone else have anything like this? Does it get better / go away? Should I once again see a doctor? Thank you for your time! What you have is synkinesis, involuntary muscle movement. It is common for people who have experienced facial palsy. Unfortunately it will not go away on its own and there is not a tried and true treatment but there are several things you can try that have worked for some - muscle retraining, massage, acupuncture or Botox may all help. Good luck! It is called  **Synkinesis** and its pretty common among BP sufferers (especially those of us with long term symptoms).  Take me, for example: I am about 5 months in and would estimate I am about 65% recovered.  I cannot close my BP eye without the check moving at least a \\*little\\*. Sometimes it moves a lot.\n\nApparently these things can become permanent. I think any sort of physical therapy is good for it. So I got it at the same time and I have the same issue. I can still only muster a half smile. \n\nSo you are experiencing skinysis(sp?). I have it real bad in which my eye shuts when i attempt to smile. I have started to train my face by using my hands to massage it to get it to relax. t seems to be working gradually, but then again i havn't made as much progress as you. :) Yep! We both have had BP for about the same amount of time and I get that too. When I raise my eyebrows the corners of the right side of my mouth will contract and lift. I also have a lot of twitching on the right side of my nose that will sometimes go for days without letting up and it is gets annoyingly frustrating. Went to the doctor to see why more I could do, I also have leaking from my nose and I when I eat, and she basically said massage is what I should do. Feels like a dead end but everything gets worse when I get too stressed out so I just try and keep my mind off it.", "\u2753What Activity brings Joy to Your Day\u2753 How long have you had Bells Palsy?

Getting better everyday how? What have you done to help? Hello, \n\nI am not sure where to start, but here we go. \n\nI was born with BP and have it my entire life (will be 35 on Wednesday, Nov 25). I have not yet met someone who have BP their entire life. \n\nI enjoy hobbies/activities such as reading, writing, puzzles, riding horses, running, and play with my 22 month old son and 5 year old Dalmatian. \n\nI try to do these activists/hobbies daily because tomorrow is not promised and making memories is a top priority with my little family. \n\nI always try to avoid stress, drama, and negativity as much as I can because I do not do so well with them (loss of sleep and overthinking that leads to poor decisions). \n\nThank you for reading! Great activities! Live your life. Thank you for sharing. It is been close to 2 years now, first year were not the best but I have come up my fears and insecurities and focussing for my betterment. Doing right facial exercise is the key, you might have different skin/nerve tightness than me, so find out the best exercise which works best for your affected side. For me it is right below the eyes, so my exercises/massage is around that area. I reached out to another doctor who is expert in BP, so just following new exercise whatever this new doctor told and I am seeing good results. That is wonderful. You are recovering after two years. Thank you for sharing! Thank you for sharing! It is not really a hobby and it is still way too early but right now to cheer myself up I am planning on making a christmas decoration in a glass jar. My bottle forest sadly died (I did not do it right) so I am thinking on turning it into a beautiful christmas terrarium using decorations and little led lights I already have at home. 3 weeks of BP so I am resting a lot and it is not ambitious but I think it is very cute.", "Chiropractor for recovery. Hi there,\n\nI am not the best writer so I will keep this brief. I got the bells, after about 6 months kind of hit a wall. went to chiro for unrelated reason. Found out my c1 was very janky. got it adjusted and i got over the last hump. at least for the most part. still some stuff that only i can notice really. So happy chiro worked for you! I went to the chiro 6 years after my BP for something unrelated too and saw benefits with some remaining BP issues. Since then, I always recommend trying chiro. Thank you! I read someone here saying they went to the chiropractor and it helped a lot. I will give it a try as well!", "I woke up today and my face feels strange - but I am an anxious person so I might be fooling myself Sorry maybe this is inappropriate but I am a bit anxious. The left side of my face is tingling particularly the cheek, it feels puffy. the tongue sometimes as well. My left eye is tearing but the right is fine. The same with my nose. And my ears are ringing but that could be anything. \nI can still smile but one side is much higher than the other and in a neutral position my mouth and eye are significantly lower on the left side.\n I thought at first that this was a grounding moment where I realise that I am not at all beautiful but have tricked myself for years into thinking I was average - but I looked back at photos from yesterday through to 8 years back and even the worst of them this is not visible.  \nLast week I had tonsillitis quite bad, I ignored it for a week because I thought it might just be a cold like my housemate had- I do not know if that makes a difference. \n\n... I guess I can add a photograph if that helps - as I did make a blank account in case that is something you all might want... However they are not very pretty ", "Round 2 - COVID Exposure I had my first round of Bell's Palsy back in June, after my first dose of Pfizer. I never got the second because I found out that for people with similar cases to mine it came back worse, and I cannot afford more extensive treatment.\n\nI went to the ER super early in the morning on Tuesday and got medicated about four hours later. Nothing's too different - my face just reverted to how it was the first time. The day before (as well as two days before and the previous Tuesday), I was exposed to a family member who tested positive for COVID, and I am currently waiting for my own COVID test results. The exposure was two fifteen-ish-minute car rides (with masks and windows open and on different days) as well as staying six feet apart and in separate rooms in the same house. \n\nI was with that family member because they tested negative several times with antigen tests, but they were taken too early. I had an anxiety episode of sorts before work on Monday morning, then, after work, said family member had a positive RNA test. I am not sure how much of the reoccurrence was from stress or how much of it could have been from my exposure to COVID.\n\nJust out of curiosity - has anyone else had a similar experience? This is the second time I know of someone getting BP after Pfizer vaccine. I read that a study in Spain found Pfizer COVID vaccines are causing BP (1 case each 1000 people).\r  \n\n\nI just shared my story in the main forum, I will not detail here. But now that I think about it, I got vaccinated (Sinovac) 2 months before getting BP. And I know for sure I was exposed to COVID about 3 days later from getting vaccinated. I never tested positive, though. Maybe it is too many days apart from my BP, but who knows?\r  \n\n\nI wish you a great recovery", "My Journey with Bell\u2019s Palsy  I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy around New Years Eve. The doctor at the emergency room misdiagnosed me, and I did not get the correct meds. He and I thought it was a toothache and my side of my face was swollen that is why it was not moving. The dentist diagnosed me and sent me again to the emergency room where I was treated with steroids, but not the antivirals because the time frame had lapsed. I suffer the complete paralysis of the left side. I had trouble chewing, talking, and blinking my eye. When I laughed or smiled I looked like a monster. I had a difficult time getting an appointment with a neurologist, almost a month and a half later I saw one. In the meantime,  I started going to acupuncture. I found that acupuncture did not help me at all. In fact, it just aggravated my condition with the needles. To be fair, I am not good with needles anyway. Once I saw the neurologist he sent me to physical therapy and also to see an ENT. PT team was pretty good and started me with massage, since it was the first stage of Bells, and simple exercises guided by my hand to improve tone and flexibility. I also started a regimen of vitamin B 12, zinc, lysine and otter vitamins. I used oil formulated for Bells I found on Etsy (essential oils) and massaged in the morning and evening. For three months I had zero movement. My PT team tried electric stimulation only at my request, because new medical studies say it does not work. I also found great Bells exercises on YouTube. I also prayed and kept the faith. I felt I would have a complete recovery, but my neurologist was not so positive. The worst part of having this affliction was the constant watering of my eye. At night I had to tape it shut and wear a patch designed for Bells. Driving was really difficult because my eye was so uncomfortable. I also found that taping in my face was comfortable, especially around the house to provide it with some structure.\n\nFinally on the third month, my face started to show some movement. The first area was my smile, but my lip still would not lift. My nose would not crinkle and my brow was still frozen in place. Blinking continued to be a problem.\n\nI continued with my regiment, and started to do face yoga. Now that my muscles were starting to move as the nerves were trying to mend and reconnect, I felt it was appropriate to do the yoga. I have learned that in the beginning of Bells, your nerves are still too damaged and you can cause synkinesis. My neurologist and ENT kept warning me about it. What I think helped me the most was exercising my face in front of the mirror, but prior to doing so, I set the intent. I added the emotion that corresponded to each face movement. Instants thinking of something that would surprise me when making a surprise face. Sinking of the emotion as I fired up that nerve really helped me.\n\nThe ENT, who is a specialist on face paralysis told me it would probably take me about a year to fully recover. On the fifth month my face finally unfroze. My brows started to lift as well as my upper lip. I continued with a face yoga with the massage oil and set  the intent. Always being grateful to God for all recovery. My eye started to feel more comfortable and normal. I am at about 95% recovery now, but my face still feels a little tight and uncomfortable when talking fast with emotion. Sadly I did develop a little bit of synkinesis. When I smile broadly my left eyebrow just on the tip moves a little bit. It is totally unnoticeable except to me. I still need to work on the upper lip, although it looks almost perfectly normal, but my whole face does feel a little weak on the left side,  which makes sense since it did not work for six months. I have continued with a vitamin regimen, and was very disappointed that none of my doctors, including my primary care physician would prescribe vitamin B 12 injections. I had read repeatedly that vitamin B 12 is how Bells is treated in other countries and WORKS! My neurologist told me just to continue with the supplements versus the shots.\n\nI understand that my timeline indicates I had a severe case of Bell\u2019s. Neurologist says that most people get better in three months. I am on my sixth month and I look pretty normal, and my eye does not bother me anymore, but I still have work to do. I am very hopeful.\n\nI have read so many different stories of people that have Bells, and decided to just put my faith in God. Was just diagnosed on Friday after a night in the ER to rule out that I was having a stroke or had a tumor. My BP came on slowly, started with my tongue going numb on Wednesday afternoon and by Thursday my eye was not blinking correctly and my smile was a little lopsided, but I still had a lot of movement in my face. I think the remaining movement I had in the left side of my face was why the ER doc did not want to send me home with a clear diagnosis of Bell's. Friday morning it was much more obvious and has gotten a bit worse since then. Here is to hoping I have a quick recovery! I will update when I have more to update. Hi, I am sending you positive thoughts. It took about 48 hours for my face to freeze. Go back to the emergency now if you have not been put on anti-virals. That is followed by steroids. Do not wait.  I was diagnosed incorrectly and missed that window. Perhaps had the doctor figured it out I would have been in better shape. Good luck! Thank you! I got on the steroid/anti virals on Friday thank goodness!", "Need Opinions on Lip Quivering  I have had BP for 87 days now. As you can see, my upper lip has been quivering for a month now. It usually happens when I try to lift my upper lip and shift it over because it is usually flat and off center. Anyone have an opinion as to whether this is a good sign or evidence of damage to the muscle/nerve? What should I do? It could be a variety of things, it might be good to on occasion take some magnesium supplement or switch to a deodorant that uses magnesium because a deficiency can cause/worsen twitching. It is almost been a year since I had bells palsy but I get twitches on that side on occasion still. It definitely gets worse for me if I do not have enough sleep. I find that sleep, plenty of sunshine, and stress management are crucial to keep the symptoms from creeping back (mouth and eye sometimes not fully closing). And hey, a twitching nerve is better than a nerve that cannot move. hang in there! I think it is a sign of recovery - the nerves are reconnecting themselves. However it could also mean a slight chance of synkinesis. \n\nMy first BP was \\~8 years ago and about 5 years after recovery I started noticing similar twitches. I did a bunch of tests (MRI, etc) and everything came back normal. The doctor concluded it is synkinesis - it usually happens when I do not rest well, and it is more noticeable when my right eye looks up. Anyways - it can be annoying at first but it is harmless.\n\nBP can take months to recover, take it slow and get as much rest as you can - chances are you will be fine in a couple of more weeks. Good luck! Thanks for responding. I have not really heard of it taking over a month for the twitching to be helpful. It is probably synkinesis. Only happens when I try to straighten out my upper lip. It does not really bother me but my lip is off center which definitely bothers me. Hopefully it gets better. That is so true! It will get better - but it might take some time. \n\nMy face did not really started looking \"balanced\" until \\~1 year after most of my BP symptoms were gone. Unfortunately BP is still not very well studied - everyone is different. Hope you will feel better soon Speaking from showing my neurologist a video of my cheek quivering like yours when I finally managed a smile, he said when you use a muscle like flexing your bicep muscle, you are likely to see it quiver too, so this is a normal reaction to a muscle being used. I hope it is a sign of recovery and feelings going back into our facial muscles that have not been used for a while.", "Feels like bruising So it has been one week from the day of diagnosis, and this morning I wake up, and it feels like I have had the left side of my head pummeled. Tender to the touch and even had my little girl accidentally bump her head on my cheek and it hurt like have a bruising hit. Is this bruising feeling normal?  I had that as well, it was really painful to the point of tears. Icing it really helped. I would have pain, then twitching, then be able to move a little, so I started associating pain with recovery. Hopefully it is the same for you! Did your pain move? lol at one point it would be around my eye then behind my ear then my cheek. At the worst point it felt like it was all over my left side of my face. My BP started on11/19 and I felt like I got punched in the face (mostly my cheek) a few days ago and it is slowly gotten worse. My doctor thought it might be sinus pressure but it hurts when I stick my tongue in my cheek and stretch the skin out meaning it is not buried in my sinus cavities. I have taken advil and it is helped, slightly, but it just feels like its going to take a while to fully go away....like everything else associated with this.\n\n Normal - I am ~6 months recovered now (cannot even tell that I have it unless I show you what to look for) and the tenderness/pain is the worst part now.  Have your significant other / friend massage your face with lotion.  Do small circles pulling upward on the face... this is the best thing for the pain for me for sure.  My physical therapist was doing it for me and now that i am done with PT my wife does it.", "is there a specific exercise for this synkinesis I have synkinesis and one of the worst is the blink lip pull. I cannot pay for facial retraining is there an exercise anyone knows for this? did you ever do electrical stimulation? I did for 3 weeks but my friend has the same one and did not do electrical stimulation.  I know others too who did not and their synkinesis is more severe My facial physician told me to stretch my face as much as possible, cheek, lip and mouth area. Mainly by putting some fingers in my mouth and stretching/pulling from the inside out.\nThis to relieve the tension and reduce the development of synkinesis.", "So I have not given mine much thought until I realized I have had it permanently for 10 years maybe more now. I never recovered the right side of my neck and facial muscles. Nothing hurts or anything, it just never came back after a botched wisdom tooth extraction with a military dentist. It surprised me to see how quickly some recovered and here I am unable to smile anymore. I would say it is not Bell's palsy then, it is permanent nerve damage. Bell's palsy is idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown, though it is widely thought to be viral. I am so sorry that happened to you. I know it is tough to do within the military, but I do hope you sued the pants off that dental practice. Unfortunately the information was wiped away but yeah nothing more i can do", "How are you all holding up? I got Bell\u2019s palsy in July of 2018. I believe it was Bell\u2019s palsy anyway. I had a bunch of tests run everything was negative. No Viral/fungal infection. Whatever else they did. \n\nI have healed to maybe 70-80% over the course of the first year, and have basically stayed there. \n\nThere is certain things I hate. I hate when someone starts taking pictures or absolutely wants to get a picture. I have not found a good way to not look pissed off, but also not look awkward as hell because half of my face does not work properly. I renewed my drivers license, and the woman working would not take my picture until I \u201cgave her a big smile\u201d as she said. Like I was a 5 year old. oh god I hate some people. I tried explaining that I really cannot and half of my face does not work, and what not. I truly think she was just being a bitch. So, now every time I pull out my id I see my picture of me basically winking and having this dumb half smile. \n\nI often wonder when I meet people and they are obviously like trying to figure out what is wrong with my face. If I should explain to them what is going on or not. \n\nTo be honest it is really wrecked my confidence, and I get that it is not the end of the world so it seems people do not take it seriously, but it is real it much fun. \n\nFor instance I was in that weird \u201ctalking phase\u201d. With this girl when it first happened. And I told her what was going on. And her response was \u201comg lol you have to FaceTime me so I can see this\u201d I read that and was like why would anyone ever say that. I never spoke to her again. \n\nAnyway, over three years later and I think about it everyday. I think back to how I was before, and I miss the confidence I had, I miss my smile, I miss my eye closing the whole way and not watering and constantly having that weird crusty stuff on it all of the time. \n\nI apologize I just wanted to vent a little and I am curious to hear how others feel and have been handling everything", "Bell's Palsy made my face ugly (rant) I got Bell's Palsy when I was 18 months old, about 18 years ago, and it never fully recovered leaving half of my face semi-paralyzed. I did not notice it much when I was a kid, because that was just my face, but as I grew older I realized how much it impacted me. From eating to talking to drinking to just being attractive it is left a stain on me.\n\nAnd do not try to tell me having this left over Bell's Palsy whatever it is does not make me ugly. No one's ever given me compliments aside from friends on my personality, in fact I have been told I am ugly and that it is my smile (my \"smile\") that ruins my whole face. I have been told to smile when I am, I had my school photographer try to tell me my smile was \"crooked\" and to smile better to correct it during middle school picture day and I had to awkwardly tell them it was just my face. If I try to draw my smile accurately in self portraits and show people, most people think I am adding an \"artistic element to show my inner feelings\" when no. That is just my smile. \n\nAnd if you are still going to try and still tell me my smile cannot be that bad (it is literally the .\\~. face), or my face is not ugly; the majority of the pictures on here, with people upset over how their face still looks, have my smile. That is \"my face\" people get worked up about. I may never understand the grief of losing a smile only to get a face like mine, but I do know the pain of being told \"that is such a shame, you could tell you would have had a pretty smile\". I have been to doctors, there is nothing they can do about it now. I am stuck like Two-Face forever. With a face that obviously needs fixing but can never get fixed. A face with a smile that most people would be horrified to have or get. And I hate it and myself. What about direct vitamin b12 injection into the nerve? I have heard that could help. What about also acupuncture to the area. Or heck, what about even a plastic surgery to lift the drooping side. Maybe lifting the affected side could create an illusion that n nothing is wrong by h avibg it more elevated 1.) I would need to ask a doctor about that first one...does not sound safe? They have told me my muscles have basically atrophied on that side since I have never been able to use it due to the affects from Bell's Palsy.\n\n2.) I do not think acupuncture will help here, but I can look for a place and see what they can do/ask about it.\n\n3.) My boyfriend has told me not to get plastic surgery, though I have heavily considered it to fix my face. It may just mean one side of me is always smiling until I actually smile, but maybe that is better than my \"smiling\" face looking...off? I do not know. Realistically I would have to ask a plastic surgeon what they think they can do if I ever get the money. \n\nOver all I think I am just going to have to learn to accept it again. I will consider and ask about your suggestions, and continue to look for more solutions...but accepting that my face is just going to be permanently ugly, deformed, and affected by Bell's Palsy may just have to be the final option. Especially since it affects my eye and eyebrow too. I would also ask if you are doing face exercises. It may take a long time but may help overall to get those muscles stronger so while you may not recover 100%, it can help with being able to smile more evenly with effort. I would also say with acupuncture to also look into massaging your face muscles if you do not already I am really sorry you feel that way.\r  \nI would suggest also electrostimulation to try to wake up your nerves and muscles.\r  \nI have had BP for 2 weeks and it is been difficult, I cannot imagine being in your situation.\r  \nYour frustration is totally understandable. \r  \nBut I have to say the following\u2026\r  \nSadly, we all live in a society that is very focused about physical appearance.\r  \nIf you do not want to, I will not say that you do not look ugly.\r  \nBut in my opinion, if this is indeed already permanent, you cannot live your life focusing about what you do not have. We are all born with physical traits that we do not like. Some are minor, maybe like \u201cI do not like my ears\u201d. Some can be big and unsolvable, like \u201cI am way too short\u201d. But we all have something that we do not like about ourselves, and if we allow it, it can become a big trauma. \r  \nInstead of focusing about what you do not have, why do not you just think that BP is mostly related to aesthetics? In reality, your physical and mental capacities are at its 100%. I guarantee there are many people out there that would kill for being you.\r  \nWhen I was new in high school, there was this dude, older than me, who had albinism but only in his eyebrow and eyelids, on one side of his face. It looked weird. Even without it, he was not good looking or whatever, he was short. The first time I saw him, he was alone, we did not speak. He was just, another person, who looked weird. A few days later, I saw him again but this time he was with his friends. It turns out he was one of the popular guys. He was really good at soccer, he was outgoing and very likeable. Throughout high school, he always had hot girlfriends, he was always positive and a nice person to be around.\r  \nThese days, while having BP, I remembered about him. How could he be so confident about his face? My first days with BP, of course I tried to hide it. The people I know, at work and stuff, of course noticed, and it was annoying. But I noticed I was also hiding it when meeting new people. They did not know I was normal 2 weeks ago. As far as they know, I could have had this since birth. I am usually not super outgoing, but my interactions with these new people were poor because they noticed my lack of confidence. So I did an experiment, I tried being confident, pretending they did not see my face, and it worked.\r  \nMaybe at first they will notice it, but if they see that you have an insecure attitude about it, they will judge you for it. Not because you have an uneven face, but because you make it evident that it affects you. If they see that you do not care, or that you care but you decide to be stronger than this, they will know you are a strong person, and you will be way more likeable for it. Being attractive is not only about your face or your smile.\r  \n\r  \nProbably you have heard about him, but anyways you should investigate about Nick Vujicic.\r  \n\r  \nI hope this helps you. Stay cheerful and have a positive life :) There is a procedure called dao at the facial nerve center in Boston.  Look at the pictures they post for this procedure.  It is also only about 3500 dollars. Granted it is pricey but not like other procedures.  I am sorry your self confidence has gone down with bp it is so hard I can assure you no one wants to be me. I have autism, and medical issues, and mental issues, and every day I learn a new way my childhood was abnormal and pretty messed up. My Bell's Palsy is probably the most \"normal\" \"fine\" thing about me.\n\nThat being said, thank you for your words. This was very kind of you to take the time to write out, and I appreciate it. I do. I have had Bell's Palsy (or the after effects, at least) for 18 years. Not months, not weeks, years. Soon it will be 19. Exercises have not done much for me. Neither has massaging my face muscles. I have been told by several doctors that the recovery I had with it in the first few years I had it was it, and that I am at where I am always going to be with it - though I still will look into your original suggestions. I will ask about it. I do not know if the doctors would even be willing to do it considering I have had Bell's Palsy for so long (again, 18 years not months), but it is worth a shot. They have done procedures on people who had bells palsy long term. It takes 3 months to be able to book a consultation", "Looks like I have a super mild case but I need help. Hi everyone. I have a mild case of bells palsy right now. Had my covid vaccine and then felt left facial pain. Right after that my left lip corner dropped by like a millimeter. However.... it has now been 14 days since the onset. Is it still worth getting on steroids (prednisone) right now? I have also heard of Valtrex. Have I entirely missed my therapeutic window? I would see a doctor immediately I noticed things like that before and did not think it was Bell's palsy I believe if I went to the doctor sooner I would not have full  paralysis so try and get treated before is gets worse headed to the doctor now. Since I am starting treatment late do you think I am screwed? Not at all better late than never how did it go? well did not work", "bell's palsy eye trick: glad press n seal is a game changer! Wanted to share with all of you who might be having trouble taping the eye.\n\nI went to see a neurofacial rehab person at the hospital this week. I have been having a lot of trouble with my eyes. 6 months in and I cannot fully close my eye. Cornea is so dry that I cannot read out of that eye. have had a lot of difficulty taping my eye. Painful and ineffective. Eye really dry overnight.\n\nRehab specialist gave me a trick they learned when they were receiving training from specialists in the US.\n\nCut a piece of Glad Press N Seal into a square, close the eye, and put it on the eyelid. For those who do not know, it is a kind of plastic/paper combo that is not too sticky. To keep it on at night, I put tape on the edges in two places. It is very gentle but keeps things in place.\n\nThis is an absolute revelation for me. It stays on, totally comfortable, keeps the eye moist. Even if your eye is not completely closed (my is not) it will keep the area from drying out. I wake up with a fairly wet eye, which is exactly what I need!\n\nImportant note: Rehab guy told me not to wear it all day (I asked if I should keep it on all day to give it a break) as it is important for your eyes to work together for vision. Just in time! Tried this yesterday / last night and it did the trick! Worked fantastic. Thank You Kindly for the timely tip. Awesome! So glad it worked for you, too! Hi! I also cannot close my eye so I will share my tips. An oculist advised me to use this method at night:\nfirst I use special eye drops. Then I soak a piece of cotton wool in saline water. Tap water is not safe for the eyes. I squeeze it so that It is wet but not dripping. Too much saline water will not hurt but it might be uncomfortable if it is dripping down my face. Then I put it between a folded gauze (so that cotton will not touch or get directly in my eye. Important!). Next I tape it over my eye vertically with 2 or 3 pieces of tape to keep it more or less in place. I think it is better and it keeps my eye better moisturized if this compress is big enough to easily cover my whole eye socket. I prefere it to be bigger than too small. Gauze, cotton wool, saline water and a thin medical tape should be available in any pharmacy and it is inexpensive. Get big packs and the ones that you can cut up in convenient pieces. \n\nI use different types of eye drops at night and during the day. During the day I use eye drops 5 times a day so about every 3 hours. At night I only put them before sleep so those are stronger. I use sunglasses when I am outside to protect my eye from dust and pollen. I cannot blink so my eyelashes do not protect my eye anymore. According to my oculist the eye may be more insensitive now so it is easier to damage it and not even feel it strongly enough. I am thinking about buying fake glasses because people are staring at me because it is mostly cloudy now :D\n\nI have Bell's Palsy since fairly recently so maybe I am overdoing it, but I have enough medical problems and I do not want to damage my eyesight too. More great ideas! Thanks!", "Any change with diet? Hello! I got my dx today. I am reading about anti-inflammatory foods and supplements and I am wondering if anyone made any changes to their diet that have helped with healing. Thanks so much! I started eating anti inflammatory foods &amp; supplements just cause I was desperate &amp; wanted to do anything to help this. Blueberries, salmon, omega fatty foods, lots of veggies, lysine &amp; b12. I am on week 3 of BP &amp; I have noticed a slight change but I do not know if it is cause of natural healing or the combo of foods supplements &amp; face massages. Do what you can, the worst that can happen is that it will not work but who knows! Thanks- I just bought a bunch of anti-inflammatory food. Any supplements? I got some ginkgo, b12 and reishi mushroom. The one I kept seeing the most besides b12 is Lysine. I got mine at whole foods, it helps with healthy tissue production. Did you get your steroids? That helped me with my pain &amp; swelling. Saw that cbd oil might help as well but do not take cbd oil &amp; steroids at the same time. I did get steroids! What happens if you do CBD lol and steroids? Is topical ointment ok? Ointment is okay! I got some &amp; use it when I can but it is made me break out unfortunately. Supposedly cbd oil taken orally &amp; prednisone rely on an enzyme to break down so both of them together could slow the process &amp; potentially make healing worse. Do not know how true it is but I would not risk it so maybe try it after you finish the steroids Inflammation has been a topic of interest to me for some time and what I would say is to keep in mind if you are not already is that when taking on inflammation like this it is a lot more effective to focus on avoiding inflammatory foods and substances than to take anti-inflammatory foods and substances. Of course both are good but I have noticed way more benefit in general with the former than the latter. Best of luck.", "Pregnant and prednisone? I got the diagnosis today after waking up to numb tongue and mouth. I am 36 weeks pregnant so went in right away since I was not sure what was happening. \n\nDr. was the one who noticed my eye was delayed blinking. Now that is all I can think about! I have to keep making sure it is closed so that it does not water. \n\nAnyways, he did not want to prescribe me prednisone because I was pregnant and he felt symptoms were very minor. He said to monitor and see if my face got more droopy and then come back to re-evaluate. \n\nI am frustrated because I have since read that prednisone is safe for pregnancy. I would rather have taken it right away and not have to go back or make another trip. \n\nAnyone else have a similar experience while pregnant? Sorry you are having to deal with this! The prednisone did not help me at all, but it did make me incredibly thirsty all the time. The only thing that actually helped whatsoever was getting extra sleep and reducing stress (I used mediation and the audiobook \"How to stop worrying and start living\" really helped). oh also, things like delayed blinking and other facial issues will be incredibly frustrating and like you say, can be hard to not think about. It is important to accept it and put it out of your mind to heal. You will be okay! :) I was 34 weeks when I got BP. I took prednisone. I felt comfortable doing it and my husband is a doctor and he felt comfortable with me taking it. It is crucial to take it right away. Not sure what type of doctor he was but I saw an emergency doc and a neurologist did a consult in the ER and the neurologist prescribed the prednisone. Go see another doctor if you can. I was 35 weeks pregnant with my daughter when I got Bells. I took an antiviral. My doctor offered me Prednisone but said \u201cI cannot guarantee this will not have some sort if effect on the baby.\u201d That scared the shit out of me. So I refused. That was 11 years ago.\nI never fully healed. I am about 85% back to normal. I have a slight droop to my smile. I had it between pregnancies not during, but I was given prednisone both via IV and oral during pregnancy for hyperemesis when anti-nausea meds stopped working. I took it for over a month during the second trimester, doctors had no issues with me taking it and everything was fine. Was never pregnant, but I took Prednisone and I do not feel like it really helped. It just made me incredibly anxious. I am 5 years post onset and I still have facial paralysis and synkinesis.. If you would really want to take it though, call up your OB and have them call the doctor you saw, or go visit a Neurologist and have them consult your OB if they are hesitant. I got my bell\u2019s when I was 28 weeks pregnant and was prescribed a low dose of prednisone in an ER because the doctor was afraid to give it to me. I called my OB and he apologized and gave me a better prescription, but I wish I had done it earlier. I am almost 2 years out and not fully recovered and sometimes I wonder if an appropriate dose of prednisone would have helped. Call your OB. I was diagnosed at 26 weeks the Wednesday before Thanksgiving last year. I was on prednisone and the anti-viral for 7 days and started taking vitamins B-6 and B-12 three days after BP onset. The ER doctor and my OB/Gyn explained that the prednisone treatment I had is safe after the first trimester. I have had several acupuncture sessions and am doing PT exercises. I am now about 90-95% recovered and almost 33 weeks. My doctor was the worst! Finally got on the meds after the runaround. Argh! Thanks for the encouragement. Ah that explains why I have so much dry mouth!!!! This was helpful. I took that same path and my OB sent in an updated prescription to correct for the standard dosage a non-pregnant person would take. Fingers crossed it helps. My due date is in 4 weeks and I am dreading having to go through labor with this discomfort, but mentally preparing for that! So glad to hear you are almost fully recovered. Crazy that this effects pregnant women. I have now heard so many stories. Thanks for sharing you are story! I am hoping you recover soon!", "Slow onset pregnancy associated bells Just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience... I had ear pain starting about 2 weeks before my facial paralysis - I was 35 weeks pregnant so assumed it was from sleeping on my side all the time. 1 week before the paralysis my hearing sensitivity started, again, I did not think much of it (and actually thought maybe I was experiencing hearing loss on the other side). A few days before paralysis I had pain radiating out from my ear around my head, but it was not crushing pain. Finally the paralysis started and took probably about 5-7 days to plateau. My OB sent me to the ER where they diagnosed me with BP. I got on Prednisone and valtrex within 24 hours of the paralysis starting, but I guess the onset was really 2 weeks prior. I also had gestational hypertension, and was induced at 37 weeks, 3 days after the paralysis started. \n\nI have complete paralysis, there is no movement in my mouth/nostrils/eyebrow. I am 6 weeks out from paralysis start and have seen no signs of recovery. It is hard reading stuff like, \"get lots of sleep and reduce stress!\" when I have brand new baby to take care of. I have started acupuncture (only had 2 sessions so far) and try to massage/stretch my affected side when I think of it. Twice now I have had a spasm on the affected side where the corner of my mouth pulls back. Not sure whether that is a positive or negative sign, I massage my face until it releases.\n\nI guess I am just posting to share my experience. It is definitely a downer to not have seen any changes yet. I am fortunate to have a dedicated facial nerve center nearby, but they will not see me until 3 months have passed. This happened to me when I was pregnant as well. My acupuncturist did some kind of electric stimulation that helped. Can you close your eye? Only partially, I have been taping it shut at night. What was your recovery like?", "I had bells 12 years ago I had bells 12 years ago when I was 19. I received steroids as treatment and was told to massage the affected area.y face never fully recovered. Today I am going back to the doctors to discuss potential options to improve my face in terms of symmetry and/or movement. Has anyone heard of anything that could be worth me discuss and suggesting? Thanks :) My GP referred me to a plastic surgeon to discuss those options, so perhaps yours will do the same? There is surgical options for adjusting your smile, but depending on how asymmetrical your face isBotox may be be recommended instead. Physiotherapy and speech therapy could also be options to discuss with your doctor as well. \n\nGood luck! I found this clinic and the specialize in Bell's Palsy and the after affects. Check them out ( I have done Botox and am looking into facial reanimation surgery.  I am only 7 months in so I was going to wait 1 year to see how I recover before I opt for surgery I have been referred to a neurologist at the hospital so I am waiting to get an appointment and see what they say. Thanks for the replies everyone \ud83d\ude42 Great I will have a look thanks I hope you get to a good level of recovery. Thanks for replying A year or so after I had originally got it I got an appointment with a plastic surgeon but they said they considered me to have good recovery so they would not operate. Hopefully there are more options for me now 13 years down the line. Thanks for replying", "Mother has bells palsy My mom developed bells palsy last year in May. They do not know why. She has been on medication, physical therapy, and has recovered about 70%. Today the other side of her face has developed palsy as well. I noticed that on her \"good side\" the corner of her mouth is twitching in time with her blinks. Has anyone else experienced this? I am worried for her. yep, it is called synkenisis, and it is pretty common for people who take a while to recover. I would suggest she go to a physical therapist sooner rather than later.", "Young diagnosis I was diagnosed BP at 7 yrs, I am now 27.\n\nI am currently undertaking EMDR and exploring the connection between trauma and the body. \n\nI am wondering if anyone else has had BP diagnosis at a young age and how this has affected them growing up? \n\nFor example, my parents prevented me looking at myself in the mirror as I became very upset, I took a significant absence from school, recieved mild bullying for the way I looked. I had BP when I was 4, then again when I was 18. \n\nI found that it did not have much of an affect on me. My mom ran an at-home daycare at the time, so I had lots of kids to play with who did not see me any differently. It went away a couple of weeks before I started kindergarten, so I did not have to deal with bullying and such. I did become a champ at putting in eye drops though, haha.\n\nI found that I am more \"traumatized\" from having BP as an adult, since I could notice when people treated me differently. Working in retail, people treated me like I had a mental disability, and would look at me like I was a child. I was more receptive to the way that people blatantly *stare*. I would hear people whispering at grocery store, \"did you see her face?\", and I would see the way people's faces switched to looks of surprise and concern when I smiled. I felt really small.\n\nBP has permanently changed certain small behaviours of mine though, regardless of the fact that I have nearly fully recovered (about 90%). For example, I now ALWAYS cover my mouth when I chew, laugh, and smile; because it became a reflex when I had BP and I could not close my mouth fully, and my smile looked off. I got into the habit of bringing reusable straws with me everywhere, in case the restaurant/bar did not have any, since I could not drink without one. \n\nThe day before I noticed my BP,  I yawned super big, and my jaw cracked and felt weird, but I brushed it off. When I noticed the beginnings of paralysis the next day, I became quote certain that the crushed nerve was a result of that yawn. Whether or not that is true, I force myself not to yawn very wide anymore.\n\nHaving BP as a child did make it fairly easy to identify what was going on when I got it a second time. I noticed my reflection in a FaceTime call, and saw that my face was only responding on one side, and slowly getting worse. I quickly told my mom, who double checked that it was not a stroke, and took me to the ER. I was able to explain to the doctor on call what was happening, and he confirmed it was BP and gave me a prescription for prednisone. I had BP at 14, the end of 8th grade and facial movement did not start to come back until a few months into 9th grade. I was once very extroverted, but during that time and afterwards I was much more shy and introverted. Adolescence is one of the worst times to have it I think. The teens are already a difficult time with puberty and everything else, and having facial palsy on top of that was terrible. I made a lot of bad decisions trying to find my self esteem again, that I feel I would not have made if I had not had BP. I also was bullied a bit, mostly for my \"lazy\" eye. I would always smile with my tongue pushing the inside of my affected cheek, or just covered my mouth. I am 34 now and got about 75% movement back, fairly significant synkinesis though. It still bothers me... I use an app to alter my pictures to get more symmetry. When I am done having kids I plan to get Botox for symmetry, I have also seen good things about threading.\n\nI am very interested to hear what you learn what you learn through EMDR about it. Thank you for sharing!\nI am sorry to hear you struggle with insecurities from BP. I go for the 'I do not care how I look' but I think I repress my insecurities, if that is a thing?!\nI do not think I am massively traumatised by BP, but I have been dreaming about my face and I think this is because body work is involved a lot with EMDR... I will update if anything comes up! Thank you for sharing, your reply has made me mindful of reoccurrences in adulthood. And I am sorry to hear it was more difficult in adulthood.\nWe are pretty resilient as kids hey, and I do not think I am too affected my BP as a child either but these little things can make a difference. I hope you learn to love all of your face &lt;3 I have had BP since I was 1 years old. I am 19 now. \n\nI have lived with this my whole life I have maybe five pictures of me with a symmetrical smile. \nHonestly I have come to just live with it. I have tried every treatment under the sun and some probably left me with more trauma than I know of because I have blocked it out but today right now I am okay with it. It is all I have ever known and I am thankful that in my case it is not the worst of cases. It does not hinder me in anyway other than not having a symmetrical smile and being able to raise both eyebrows. I got surgery on my eye to protect my cornea while sleeping and Ive consistently been told by AT LEAST fifty doctors lmao that there were two surgeries as my options. I do not want them as of right now. I have become tired of people telling me it is a problem that needs to be fixed asap. Every doctor has told me as gently as possible that \u2018I am too old to be fixed\u2019. I recognize that yes in the long term I will have to look into it but for now I am just living tbh :) i always tell myself \u201cit does not define me, it is a part of me, I am just me.\u201d I had it when I was 9, I am 25 now, have not fully healed, I am maybe at 90%? \n\nCannot smile fully on the side that was affected (I basically have a permanent smirk) there is a slight droop (not noticeable to anyone but me tbh), eye twitching randomly at times, most things are not really noticeable to anyone who has not known me my whole life (though I have gotten the odd comment), for the most part I suppose it always just looks like I am twisting my mouth a little, in rest, if I am not thinking about it my face always slips back to twisting a bit \n\nMy diagnosis was linked to a terrible period of bullying I experienced in my childhood, BP was the grand finale (bed wetting, trouble sleeping, not eating, withdrawal etc) \n\nI am grateful for the recovery that I have accomplished but I do not think I will ever stop noticing or being paranoid about it, completely reformed how I display emotion but hey it is what it is", "Day 2 &amp; I still do not understand what is happening. I just got diagnosed yesterday. I do not know how to approach this condition. I see some say they are a year 2 or 3 years with this and it is making worry a lot. \n\nWill it get worse than what it is like now before getting better or it will get worse a bit more before it starts clearing up if it ever will. How does the graph look like? First of all, this is my personal experience, so please do not sue me. For me, it got worse before it got any better. I could not eat or drink properly. \n\nBest thing you can do is giving yourself time to rest and heal. Take the prescriptions and relax. I went for walks and took my vitamins.\n\nYour body is mending itself but you need to give it time and do not force yourself to blink and all that. You could damage the nerve as it heals. &lt;- not sure about this, that is what I was told.\n\nJust to give you some light at the end of the tunnel, I was about 90% healed after 3 weeks. I could eat and smile again but my blinking is still off. And after about 3 months my blinking is finally in sync again. This. You know you will have this for at least three weeks so it is best to accept that and do everything you can to rest and promote healing.  Most people heal within 3 weeks to 3 months. \n\nThose who do not heal that quickly or fully are still able to live happy lives and even though it is really scary and depressing when you are first diagnosed, I promise, it gets better. Thank you for your kind words of encouragement. This gives me hope &amp; strength to soldier on. Very scary and depressing. I broke down in front of my 2.9 month old son when l could not drink water properly while taking my tablets. +1 to this. Best thing you can do for yourself now is do not pile on any additional stress or worry. REST, especially sleep is vital. Tape your eye when you sleep, use eye drops during the day. \n\nI am slightly past exactly 3 weeks and also 90% healed, I can blink, smile, chew, raise my brows, etc. Whistle is off, and my nostril does not flare as much as the unaffected one. \n\nI did exercises maybe 2-3 days after diagnosis but did not try to force it if I felt pain or could not do it. Listen to your body. \n\nMy doc said most of the patients he is seen recover in the 30 days and the stats I have read say 80% of patients recover in 3 months so while the mind inevitably strays to the outliers, focus on healing first. If you got diagnosed earlier, that helps with recovery too. Also came here to say that I was at about 85-90% at 3 weeks, so I promise it will get better! But just like the others have said, you absolutely have to rest for your body to heal, cut yourself some slack, take your meds they gave you and vitamin B12. I also used a facial roller to help with the soreness but I am not sure if it did anything for the healing process. Just be patient, you will get through this! Hey OP!! Sorry to hear you are going through this. I hope you have family and friends that will support you in this horrifying journey. I went through it and do not wish it on anyone. It mentally broke me and to this day I hate taking pictures now. But you have to be strong and know it is only temporary and it will get better!!! I hope recover fast unlike me, it took me a few months and know ppl that recovered in a couple weeks. But please rest and relax, that is pretty much all you can do. If you need a friend to talk to that is been through it do not be shy to DM me. Thank you very much for your kind words full of hope and love. It is at times really breaking me down.  I will definitely DM for more of these warm words. Thank you for this information particularly the Vitamin B12.\n\nWould you know which side l must sleep on the affected one or the one that is working and also the best pillow to use. I did not change pillows, but I tried not to sleep on the affected side. I used the night time Systane eye treatment (ointment) and I bought an eye patch at the drugstore. Some people tape their eye closed, but that freaked me out so I could not do it. There is an Instagram page called  run by Andrea. She is got a lot of great information and videos on which facial exercises to do that might help. Thank you l will go andfollow that instagram page immediately. Everyone is different!!! For example I recovered after a month since I was diagnosed. But on the other hand- my aunt still has BP, even tho she was diagnosed 27 years ago. You should never give up hope, and take some vitamin B!! It helps A LOT!! Thank you a lot especially about the vitamin b l will try it.", "Almost 6 weeks and no progress AT ALL It has been 6 weeks since this nightmare started in my life and I see no signs it is going away.

Stress is a trigger for mine. Also, being tired. \nEvery person is affected differently. \nI wish you the best. It took me 2 months to see any recovery at all. 2.5 years later and I am 85% recovered; people who did not know me before have no idea. You will get better, it might just take time. Please do not stress out. Recovery is different for everyone. It took me two months to see a small change, something only I could see and not even my mom, which made me rethink whether am imagining it (first sign was a small movement in my cheek when I tried to smile). But no, it certainly was a change. It is now 4 months, I have not fully recovered, but still am slowly progressing. So please do not give up hope. There is not any point stressing over it. Please keep doing massages and facial exercises. Take care :) I know how you feel, I did not see much progress until around the 2 month mark and it was slow but now nearly 4 months later I am mostly healed except for minor things that no one notices and I have been able to work perfectly in customer service for a while. You will get better, there is no guaranteed finish line for this but you just have to soldier through AND KNOW that it will get better. I am running out of my prednisalone. I have my doc calling me later. I can sort of drink properly now, but my voice is still crackly and I cannot smile properly or raise my left eyebrow. It is my first time. I thought it was a stroke at first. Hang in there. It is my first and with the rarest and most unlikely cause, a side effecf from the Covid vaccine. In the morning I had absolutely nothing, I ate and brushed my teeth normally. A few hours after the vaccine and I could no longer move my lips to the left side. I thought it would go away but of course, it only got worse. I am deadly scared of getting my second shot. Tbh the masks are the only reason why I still go out, I hope they do not go away anytime soon. Thanks, I am holding on the 2 months mark for some hope because another person I know started improving around this mark too. I hope I will not get frustrated again. I know it is hard not to consider a time line, because I did the same thing. I was so frustrated at 6 weeks because I thought I should be improving by then. My mom insists my mouth looks better when I am talking but when I do it in front of the mirror, I see no changes at all. Sometimes I feel like my lips are going to the affected side for a few seconds. I do not know how to explain but it happens without my control and at random times. I do not know if that is a sign of improvement. Thanks, I am trying but it is so frustrating to wake up everyday and see no changes at all. It has affected my mental health drastically. It is my first too and I got from the most unlikely and rare cause, from the covid vaccine. I am almost like you, I can drink properly but my eye does not fully close, I cannot raise my eyebrow or move my mouth to the affected side. My ear also has a pressure sensation and my nosetril is paralyzed too. For how long have you been taking it? I only had steroids for 5 days and I assumed that was the reason why I have not improved. I have a friend who experienced a Bells Palsy episode after both shots of the COVID-19 vaccine as well. His Bells Palsy symptoms have gone away. I do not recall how long it took him, but, being his first BP he felt it took forever. \nIf you search COVID-19 Vaccines and Bells Palsy, you will find that it is reported as a known side effect in a small number of people.\nEven knowing this, I will still get a Booster Shot when I become eligible. #MasksAreOurFriend\nWishing you a speedy recovery. Wow. Nostrils did not even cross my mind. Im on 9 days, prednisone and my last dose is tonight. Had, a, call earlier to see how I am doing. If I do not improve, they will put me back on them. Nothing weird with my ear. I had my vaccines about 3 months ago. Astra-Zeneca. My anti-vax mum (I am English) thought it was because of the vaccine, but it can literally happen to anyone. At anytime. Just like a stroke. But because I am British, I have only really complained about my dribbling half my cuppa tea down my top and, needing to change if I have to go out. Face masks help in public, but because I cannot move my left eyebrow, my impression of the Rock's eyebrow has, severely improved. There is a saying jn England. Swings and roundabouts. Like every cloud has a silver lining. But my typing has gone to crap especially using my left eye. Waaay to many grammatical errors. Missing letters etc. I already have trouble with commas, so much so that I had to go back and delete a load. Until someone, hilariously pointed out that Christopher Walken had possessed my phone. That is now my story and I am sticking to it. Good luck in your recovery. Eye drops during day, eyepatch in between eyedrops, couple rum and coke and just be a pirate. Alestorm is pirate metal. Will set the mood. And, just take it easy. Oh, and medical tape on eye under patch at night. An eyepatch with cotton balls helps me keeping my eyelid closed, both during the day amd while sleeping. \nEye drops are always handy when out in public.\nA drinking straw works wonders if you have to drink in public with or without a mask!\nIn my case, any anti inflammatory (such as Advil) help reduce the symptoms a little bit, as well as the pain.\nI would massage my face and neck while taking a hot shower. \n\nBells Palsy is scary AF! \nFirst you think you are having a stroke, then it takes forever to get better.\nLast but never least, the fear of it not going away.\nI may sound like I am okay with it, but, every single time I have had it (3 times in 10 years), I get so scared and stressed, worrying and wondering whether it will not go away. \nStay Strong Everyone! I was completely stone-faced for almost exactly 12 weeks.  Then I progressed rapidly over the course of another 2-4 weeks or so.

Mine was Pfizer. Honestly, I am so scared about my second shot. My BP is not showing any signs of improvement and I fear it will affect the other side too.

Have you done the standard Valtrex and steroids?\n\nAlso, this is just my experience and I have no objective proof, but Lysine (vitamins you can buy for $10) and avoiding the sun (sunscreen &amp; hats) have helped me avoid flare ups.

I am also lucky to have a sympathetic PCP who has me on a low dose of Valtrex continuously.\n\nedit: I have noticed some weird facial twitching/tingling since I got my booster shot.

My right arm was also slightly numb\\\\tingly. I went straight to the Hospital. They quickly ruled out a stroke and diagnosed me with Bells Palsy. I was put on steroids and antiviral medication.\n\nTwo days I started to get a massive pain behind my left ear that went down into my left arm. I saw my doctor and he sent me for tests. Shortly after the left side of my face went completely numb. I immediately went to the Hospital again, saw pretty much every doctor there, and was diagnose with bilateral Bells Palsy. \n\nI was struggling mentally when I had the first diagnosis... feel defeated after the second... but I have family to support me so things will work out. Reading other posts on here helps... thank you. Hey you hit the BP lotto like me. Regular BP - on one side - is already rare enough on its own, but bilateral is like hitting the worst jackpot ever. \n\nIt sucks. it does. no two ways about it... but it WILL get better. I had it a couple years ago and i wish i could say i recovered 100% but i have not. im at maybe 70% and will be going to speech therapy soon, but have made a ton of improvement naturally. the first few weeks and months were rough and they will be for you - especially mentally... but trust that it will be okay.. and look on the bright side, it could be worse. it could have been a stroke. I am grateful it was not, and you should be too. GL I got bilaterally BP and it caused the doctors to check me for Lymes disease and that medicine cleared it all up", "Recovered in two weeks - what I did Hi all,\n\nI was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsey just about 14 days ago. As you know, it is very scary reading about how the recovery can take so long or that you may never fully recover. I wanted to share what I did I hopes that it may help some of you out there.\n\nFirst of all, I was diagnosed and started on steroid and anti-virals within 24 hours of losing muscle control. \n\nAdditionally, I purchased an online course ( from a physical therapist to help with the treatment. I did not do the electronic muscle stimulant so cannot speak as the effectiveness of that but I would do the recommended exercises 2-3 times a day.\n\nI saw a chiropractor who specializes in TMJ and Bell\u2019s Palsey treatment. He did an adjustment on my temporal lobe and I continued seeing him twice a week and am still seeing him. To be honest, it was super painful but I wanted to do everything i possibly could to fix this.\n\nI took B12 daily and would get a B12 shot on the affected side (in the arm) once a week.\n\nI also took supplements that were recommended to me by a nutritionist:\n\nZinc\nVitamin D\nTuna Omega 3\nN Nerve\nGinkgo Forte\nEchinacea\nCod Liver Oil\nParamin\nEndo AC\nCardiotrophin PMG\nNeurotrophin PMG\nThymus PMG\n\nI have about 90% muscle control back and things are looking up! It is hard but try to keep a positive attitude towards it and do stuff to keep your mind off of it as much as possible.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and I will be happy to answer!\n\n*note, I am note a medical professional. I recommend getting your own diagnosis and your own recommendations from a nutritionist. I simply wanted to share what I did in hopes that it can help another with a speedy recovery* What in the world is a temporal lobe adjustment? I am sorry to be rude, but can I ask what level of impairment you had to begin with?  \n\nI was diagnosed in March 2019 and did much of the same treatments as you, save the chiropractor, and a few of those supplements, and never got B injections.\n\nI was completely stone-faced for 3 months and, since then, I have recovered to about 80% or so.  I have not seen improvement in close to a year so I have pretty much decided that this is as good as it is getting.  I am satisfied because I can blink and eat and speak normally, but I am clearly not as I should be. I cannot whistle, for instance, and that actually bugs me a little bit.\n\nSo I am always just curious to see people who manage to recover in a matter of weeks (please do not take this as a criticism; I am super thrilled for you!). Sorry to pry. No worries! I could not move the whole right side of my face. My eye would half close only when closing the left side. Had to tape it down and use eye drops. The only motion I could make was a very slight flare of the right nostril. It was like this for about 10 days and then drastically improved on the 11/12th day. Electric stimulation therapy should have a big BUYER BEWARE notice on it. There is no proof that it helps. A few neurologists told me that it actually irritates the delicate nerves trying to heal. This is why I am stuck in the 5% that will never heal. Not to mention, its painful af. \n\nGlad you are doing well OP. Its great to see that people can recover from this! Haha to be honest I am not sure! All I know was the chiropractor (with gloves on) had to reach inside my mouth and adjust some shit. Sorry, it is a temporal bone adjustment. The technique is referred to as SOT Cranial. I was diagnosed on the 13th of this month and fully recovered by the 24th. I had zero movement on the affected side. I took prednisone and antivirals as prescribed. Massaged and exercised my face 1-2 times a day, every day. But when I did my exercises I held down the opposite side of my face to \"force\" the affected side to move, sounds weird but it worked. Thanks! Ya I had read pros and cons to it so I decided against it. Just thought I would do standard facial muscle exercises. Ya! That is what the physical therapist recommended. Make your affected side do as much work as possible and help it along as needed with your fingers. Can u pucker up and do u have the Muscle confusion? Only halfway, and yes. It made my synkinesis worse TBH I had a very similar experience. 3 months of no movement, then it started to slowly come back. It is been 20 years and it is still about the same. The synkinesis bugs me the most. I practice whistling and finally got it, though it is still a crooked pucker :) Same. So many regrets.", "Vaccination experience Hello, I was searching on this sub as I was thinking about taking the vaccine and I had previously had Bell\u2019s palsy 10 years ago. \n\nA little background on my Bell\u2019s palsy experience. I was 13 when I got Bell\u2019s palsy. I immediately went to the doctor and got put on steroids, I did facial massages everyday, and did acupuncture once a week for about 2 months and made a full recovery in 3 months. Since then, whenever I feel any tingling in my face or pain in my ear I am fearful that I will get Bell\u2019s palsy again. \n\nWhen the Covid vaccine came out, I had no doubts that I would get vaccinated as soon as possible until I heard word that it could possibly cause Bell\u2019s palsy. I tried to do research, but of course there was no definite answer. I tried to search for real like experiences similar to mine, which caused more fear because it seemed like a good amount of people were getting Bell\u2019s palsy. (I also like to mention that I did get Covid back in January 2021 with very mild symptoms) So after thinking it over, I decided to get the moderna Covid vaccine a week ago. After the vaccine I did have a sore arm, but no other symptoms. I am schedule to take my second dose in four weeks, and if anything changes course I will be sure to update on my condition. \n\nI hope this was helpful to some people who might be doing some research like I was :) Being part of the clinical trial before it is approved by the FDA is brave, your experience will make the effects of the vaccine well understood. If you get Bell\u2019s palsy, blood clots, uncontrolled movments, have a stroke or die. Then I will have a better idea as to weather I want to take it or not.  Thank you for going first. I wish you Godspeed I will be sure to let you know if I die I had Bells a few years ago and made a full recovery.  I have been fully vaccinated since April with no side effects.   I hope you have the same result! Thanks for this, I actually have BP now and am in my 3rd week. Also caught Covid about a week ago and am recovering now. I just wonder if after I am clear of the virus, I am eligible for vaccination. I just want to get vaccinated and to hopefully recover from Bell's already. 4000 people have according to vaers/cdc.\nI pray that is not how it goes for you Well Bless your heart too pal. \n\n\nYeah people have died. \nThey have also gotten pregnant and broken legs. \nPeople ARE getting bells palsy after the vaccine, but at no greater a rate than they would if they all had an otter pop instead. I will defer to you. I do not know. I am not a doctor. But I do know that many people got Bell\u2019s palsy after getting the shot. I do think that the statistics should be looked into after the clinical trial is done and before the FDA approves it. Ditto. Had BP in November 2019, fully recovered in a few weeks. Got my second shot about week ago and am fine.  Hi I also had Bell\u2019s palsy when i was younger, around 10 years old. I am 18 now. Very worried of getting it again...\n\nWhat if I get it again? I fear I will not recover  Hi how are you? Hope Bells Palsy is now clearing or has already cleared. My Bells Palsy is almost clear now and I am considering Pfizer vaccination. Have you had any research about vaccination with bells palsy? I have regained function on my paralyzed face and am close to full recovery. I am considering vaccination because I do not think it would affect my BP now. That is amazing news l am happy for the progress with your recovery. I guess l just have to go for the Prizer jab.  Thanks for your feedback.", "BP day 11. Trying to purse my upper lip. At least most of my face is still cooperating \ud83d\udc4c  Congrats on your progress!  Also you made me laugh. I am 1 day behind you, with less recovery, so I needed that.  Thanks Thank you, glad you enjoyed! \ud83d\ude0a The humor has totally been a major part of my recovery, I think. All downhill from here \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c Awesome... You are looking better than your earlier video. I am happy for your recovery.  Have a grand at weekend. Glad you are making progress my dude! I never bothered trying to fix my face and now I am permanently stuck w a crooked smile and my eye does not open properly", "Vertigo coming back two months after diagnosis. Anyone else experience this? In November of 2019, I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy. I got vertigo weeks before the Bell\u2019s Palsy hit and I also had shingles. My recover has been slow as I still cannot shut my eye or move my mouth. Today, I started feeling dizzy again and now I am worried. \n\nHas anyone else experienced vertigo coming back? From what I have read, onset of BP can sometimes have cues. I would say that shingles are a bigger cue than vertigo We are you diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt by any chance? That is what happened to me. I had always had random attacks if whirling vertigo which I was told was \u201c silent migraines\u201d. I developed trigeminal neuralgia on the affected side and after I get attacks, like the tsunami after the earthquake, I get a bout of vertigo Last night I was looking up my symptoms and came upon Ramsay Hunt and wondered if that is what I really have. Well, my last and only \u201cattack\u201d was in November and my face got paralyzed. I got scared because two months in, and little recovery later, I started feeling dizzy again. Wondering if I will ever fully recover. You are still pretty early from your onset. It took me about six months to be able to drink not using a straw. I started at a grade 9 and I am 3 years out at a 1 so keep hope. Thanks!", "I am mostly recovered but when I use a drill or a jackhammer, my nerve hurt for days Do strong vibrations affect you as well? I was diagnosed in 2011 and never fully recovered. A neurologist said it is permanent nerve damage. Anyway, in 2016 I got a tattoo on the top of my arm on the same side I got Bell\u2019s palsy. It took about 3 hours and I was fine but the next morning, it was like the first day in 2011. Completely came back and much worse this time. Not sure if this is the same experience as you but thought I would share. I am sorry to hear that. It seems very coherent to what is happening to me, it starts to hurt the day before, but luckily enough the paralysis did not came back. I am about 95% back after being diagnosed a couple days before Xmas. Wearing a mask pulls my ears in a way that gives me headaches in the back of my head My girlfriend made me masks with shoe-laces that tie at the back of the head, I find it more confortable. Maybe this kind of mask can help you with that?", "Sharing my BL story Hi. I do not know if sharing this can help or cheer you up, but I hope you feel you are not alone on this. :) It is long tho....\n\nSo, let me tell you my background. I was working a new job that I hated, with the most awful and toxic people you have ever met. I quit. It was not my kind of job anyway. I worked there for a month more and, in the middle of the month, I was terribly excited - it was my last week and I was going to travel to a new country some weeks later. \n\nLOL. Monday morning, my last week of work. I woke up with a bloated upper lip, to the point I could not spit water properly. Only to the side. I wondered if a mosquito bit me, but did not mind it. My left eye started to give me some discomfort on the middle of the day but I thought it was my contact lens. I even changed the left side one and the pain got better, so I thought I was right and that it would get better when I got home.\n\nAround 6-7pm, on my way home, I went to the pharmacy to get meds to my lip. And while walking I noticed something : my left eye could not blink. I could not even close it. I assure you, I felt terrified. I went to the pharmacy and she told me the lip was normal, just dehydrated lol She gave it a lipstick. She told me to go to the doctor and see my eyes when I told her so.\n\nI was still convinced that a day of rest would work fine. I did not even know what a Bell's palsy was, to be honest.\n\nBut it was not. I woke up worse. I had to ask my boss if she could let me leave early on that day to go to the urgencies... she looked at me and told me to go immediately. That now that she looked closely, my left eye was totally open, with no signs of blinking, and that it did not look good. As for my lips, I only started to talk funnily around that time, in the hospital, because before that I did not have any signs of it while talking. I went, and you know the rest - I got my diagnosis, my meds and a promise of a long journey ahead of me. The best thing my boss has done to me, tho, was giving me the rest of the week (my month finished on Tuesday tho, I was the one who decided to work till Friday anyway... but it was still nice).\n\nThe doctor in the urgencies prescribed me some meds and told me to go to my family doctor if there were no signs of recovery after 6 days so that my doctor could prescribe me some physiotherapy sessions. Thankfully, I DID NOT LISTEN TO HER. My friend had a friend who had BL and told me, \"BL will not probably be cured with meds. You should urgently get an appointment with your family doctor I do physiotherapy as soon as you can - the sooner you start, the faster will be your recovery. And do exercises at home meanwhile\". I did so. It happened on Monday, had the appointment on Friday, started my physiotherapy on the next Monday.\n\nI can tell you nothing was easy. I hated my face, I would work on it every day with no results. Reading stories of many people who would recover naturally, without doing anything, and stories of those who had long recoveries and were not better yet. I thought it was a viral sickness, that it would pass after some days. But then read so many testimonies and saw it was not, that it depended on the person and there were not meds to cure it. I was shocked, scared.... I was so anxious. I would cry. My friend would tell me it would pass, and that I should be patient, but I hated that because she did not even know how experiencing something like that can hurt and scare us. I felt as if she was treating my pain as whining. \n\nI even participated in my country's election day, I was in the polling stations and had to show my face to many people of my parish, known and unknown. In the end, one of the people who was working with me in the polling station even wished me \"to be in good health\". Not that I wanted, but I could not reject it at that point..... Yeah. Awful. Even had to be careful drinking water.\n\nTwo weeks after I started physiotherapy, I traveled to the UK with that friend. I was so excited to visit it, but after being diagnosed with BL I did not know if I still wanted to go. Having to ask my friend to put me an eye patch on me every night, having a crooked smile in every photo and even having to be careful drinking/eating.... it would ruin my experience by a lot. But I went. And all of that happened, yes. I even met an online friend looking like that, took a photo and put on Instagram because it was a memory. Even with a crooked smile. Ofc, I had to explain everything to her and apologize over the fact I was drinking a bubble tea with a straw in such a \u00abretarded\u00bb way. But I tried not to let it get to me and enjoy my journey.\n\nOn my 3rd day of travel, a Saturday afternoon, three weeks after being diagnosed with BL... I remember going to the toilet and trying to move my eyebrows and lips once, as I had been forgetting to practice during the travel. Look. I moved my eyebrows, I raised them, I blinked, I smiled and even did a duck face. I was so happy. I was happy to the point of crying!\n\nDo you know what I did? I showed my friend everything, told her I could move my face.\n\nShe was like, \"Oh? Good!\"\n\nNowadays I look at it and find that to be such a lame reaction. Really coherent with her previous speech of \"do not get anxious over it, it will pass\" because she did not get through it, and her lack of concern when we got back as she never asked me if I was doing better, or not. But back then, I did not even care about her answer. I recorded myself, sent to my family and some other friends. I was so happy over such a \u00abtrivial matter\u00bb as moving my face. In fact, even though the travel was also being a little stressful and that Saturday especially awful, just that was able to turn my day around.\n\nOfc I was not cured. But at least I could move my face. Could take a normal photo. I was not very strong on my mouth, yet. England's drinking-on-the-go culture? It made me spill my coffee on my clothes and I did not even notice it (my friend told me). Luckily, all my clothes were black and it was quick to clean, no one noticed. I was not very much affected either, I was happy about my advancement already... did not want to ask for more. And I was anxious to show my physiotherapist those results!!\n\nAfter that, I spent months doing physiotherapy. Trying to put everything symmetrical and giving strength to the muscles.\n\nI spent like 3-4 months on physiotherapy, one of them being August (meaning, holidays) so it does not really count. When everything was symmetrical to the point of being unnoticed, I decided to leave, not forgetting to do home exercises. I mean, I was not cured, I noticed my upper lip was a bit crooked on the right side - or, better saying, the left side was a bit higher than the right side - and I could not close my eyes very strongly, but I knew it was not something I needed to treat with physiotherapy. I was unemployed as well, so I decided to save money, try it at home for a month and then go back there if needed.\n\nRecently, I have been feeling stiff and having some muscle pains at times, but I am doing okay. My right side is bloated. No one notices or believes me when I say I have BL, even though they do notice my right bloated side. I accepted myself a lot more, and I wish I could have appreciated myself a lot more before this happened, tbh. I know this did not end yet, I hope I can work on some minor things and get the pain to go away, but at least I can work normally.\n\nThe conclusions I have reached after this:\n\n1. I was shocked when my doctor told me **there were not really many answers to why it happened**, that science had only a few \"theories\" - they could not exactly tell me why I became like this. I think it was the stress in my work environment, and it manifested right when I was going to leave.  But worse than that was when I realized there were not really meds to treat it.\n2. **Do exercises**. A lot of exercises. Not every minute, as you need to rest your muscles too, but try to move your muscles at least twice a day, for a few minutes. Do not exaggerate.\n3. Try to start **physiotherapy** as soon as you can. The sooner you start, the greater will your chances be to recover quickly and completely. Ofc, if you are young you can have better chances to recover 100%, but it will depend on the person.\n4. You should do exercises, yes, but **do not overwork yourself**. Too many exercises can lead to asymmetry, as one side can become more developed than the other, or synkinesis. Try to dialogue with your physiotherapist.\n5. If you cannot close one of your eyes, **get an eye patch** and take care of your eyes. Get eye drops and do not forget to put those. I would put my daily eye drops every three hours (?) and put my night one, followed by my eye patch, right before sleeping. If you notice your eye is getting worse, go to the doctor.\n6. **Do not give up**. This has no guide or order, it is different for everyone. You cannot know when will you show results - I showed results on my third week, but I know a boy younger than me who has been like that for almost a year and only now he is showing results of recovering. **BE POSITIVE**. It is hard. But you have to do it - do not stress yourself more because of it.\n7. If you can, **surround yourself with the people you love**. You may feel lonely and insecure. I did. But **you are strong and will get through it**!!!\n8. **Try to free yourself from stress.** I was lucky because I recovered at home, but I could not really rest - I had some work from my previous office to finish but I could not as my \"boss\" is a disorganized person and would give me things to do right before the deadlines (the things I have been asking for since ages ago lol). I remember I even slept badly many times because of that. \n9. I did not know Bell's Palsy but, after having one, I noticed how most everyone around me knew one or two people who had gotten one. At first, they did not know what it was and looked at me with pity, but then, after being told more about it or chatting with others, they realized they have had a few friends/family members who suffered from it. Some even had it twice. My doctor even told me how recently more and more young people had been diagnosed with BL. I believe it is something that people want to hide too, so it is understandable.\n\nThis is not gold. I do not even know if it can help you out. But my inbox is always open if you want to talk. :)", "PLEASE HELP ME! I woke up yesterday morning and drinking water but it split out off my mouth. It was hard to moving my left side as well. My speed is kind of mess up. I searching on website and it is call Bell\u2019s Palsy. I just have a daughter 7 weeks old. I cry alot when I seeing her and cannot smiling like normal. Please help me. \nQuestions :\n1/ Do I have to go to ER or urgent care to do MRI? How much it is going to cost?\n\n2/ what food do you guy avoid to eat?\n\n3/ what do you guys you to help your eyes closed?\n\n4/ What kind of exercise do you guy do? Or massage? Get to a doctor as soon as possible. Early treatment is critical. The doctor will prescribe an antiviral and a steroid. Avoid alcohol and tobacco until you have healed. You will need eye drops during the day and genteel extreme eye drops (more of a cream) at night. You will need tape to hold your eye shut at night. The doctor will explain this and more. What someone else has said, get to a doctor immediately so you can start steroid treatment, which can help reduce the recovery time and chance of a full recovery.\n\nOnce you have done that come back and do some reading, but that needs to be your first priority. It is my second time having bell's palsy. (Do not worry about that though, it apparently very rarely happen twice)\n\n1. I live in Canada, health care is free so I cannot tell how it will cost you, but as someone said earlier, early treatment is critical.\n2. I  do not avoid any food, although eating a juicy grapefruit could be a challenge. Also, I try to eat slowly so I do not bite the inside of my mouth\n3. Eye patches could be useful sometimes to avoid getting dust in the eye, like when it is windy. Some people wear swimming goggles in the shower\n4. Here are exercises for early stage of bell's palsy: ( You can found many more on Youtube, like this one for massages (\n\nThis website has a lot of information on facial paralysis (\n\nI hope this helps. Best of luck. 1. Go to the ER or just your doctor ASAP if you have not already so you can checked out. If it is BP, you will not need an MRI and you will be sent home with prednison and perhaps antivirals. If you think you have had a cold sore or another herpesvirus recently, please be VERY careful around your child, definitely do not kiss them and ask your doctor for more information about this! \n\n2. There are some studies linking the consumption of animal products to inflammations, so I am avoiding almost all meat and dairy. I would also avoid highly processed and greasy foods. It is easier though to focus on what you should eat. Foods that reduce inflammations and support your liver function, like blue berries, olives (and olive oil), fatty fish, red grapes, ginger, coffee, green tea, black tea. There are many. Google anti-inflammatory foods and pick what you like. I am also eating a LOT of vegetables (carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, lettuce, cucumber, etc.)\n\n3. What eventually made taping my eye shut much easier was also lifting the bottom eye lid with tape. I also do this during the day because my eye looks more normal and does not dry out as fast.\n\n4. No need to do exercises or even massage during this stage if you have BP. Your facial muscles and nerves are fine, the problem is the signal getting blocked at the 7th cranial nerve near your ear due to the inflammation. Just let it rest, cool the area gently to help the swelling go down faster. Exercises seem to be more useful in a later recovery stage. \n\nMy onset was 6 days ago and I am slowly improving now. I know what you are going through and I really feel for you! Hope you get the answers and treatment you need, and that your recovery is speedy. Hi, I did a CT scan only because I hit my head before bell's palsy. Otherwise it is not needed. For the cost I think it varies a lot for different countries, it should be around a normal flu consultation plus additional specialist consultation fee (if you go for one). Try to start your steroids medication within 72hrs of onset. Anti-virals depends on your doctor. \n\nFor food, I avoided spicy and high fat meats (steak, pork, mutton etc) and only ate millet porridge with stir fried chicken breasts and vegetables. The senior specialist I consulted said there are no food restrictions. \n\nTo keep your eyes closed, use medical tape and stick it onto your arm or hand first to make it not so sticky, if not it can be painful when removing it. Be gentle and apply eye drops throughout the day. \n\nFor the first 2 weeks, just stick to warm compresses at least twice a day or when in pain. Your goal in these 2 weeks is to 1. reduce inflammation 2. avoid stimulation and 3. help nerves recover and grow back. Gentle messages with lotion should be avoided until at least a week in. AVOID acupuncture with electric stimulant (specialist kept repeating this) although the normal acupuncture should be fine. Personally it just added more pain and wiped my progress. \n\nTry not to be so expressive with your face in the first week or try to do funny faces like what some websites have suggested. Let the injured nerves rest and your body to do its job. Do not compare your progress with others' as everyone has a different body. \n\nGood luck and I wish you a smooth recovery. Buy Glad Press &amp; Seal for your eye rather than tape. Use eye ointment at night and see your eye doctor right away if you start to have pain. I had worn a hole in my cornea in 2 days because I could not blink. Do you know why it is recommended to avoid acupuncture with electric stimulant? I ask because my husband had it done a week(ish) after onset and made about 80% recovery within a day. However my father was just diagnosed and he had regular acupuncture but has not had the electric stimulant yet. Would not want him to go through it if it can make it worse. The specialist told me that electric acupuncture will over-simulate the already injured nerves. Guess it depends on the person using it. Good luck! I went to urgent care for mine and with my insurance had zero copay. A friend of mine is a nurse and she did a visual assessment on me over FaceTime. My face was clearly struggling on one side and she could not be sure that I was not having a stroke and told me to go to the ER. I hate going to the doctor, hate the hospital even more. I tried to go to urgent care and I did not make it past the check-in window before they told me I would have to go to the ER. \n\nThat is a long way of saying you need to go to the ER so they can give you a CT scan right away and rule out a stroke. With a stroke, time is everything so you will be moved through there quickly. It probably is BP but do not self diagnose through Google. It could be a stroke and you will not know for sure until you get the proper diagnosis from a doctor. \n\nAs far as how much it costs, I have no idea. I have terrible insurance but I have not received my bill yet because this only happened less than 3 weeks ago. Do not fret over the bill though. As long as you are making some sort of effort to send in payments, there is not a whole lot they can do. Most are willing to work with you.", "Today I was diagnosed, missed signs I had a headache at the beginning of lockdown 1 wich lasted 4 5 weeks went to docs had eye test everything fine\n\nA week before second lockdown I had same kind of head ache again lasted weeks visited docs again everything fine back to taking old medication to help my sleep to see if that would ease headaches\n\nThe headache dissapeared I am feeling great about that until 3 days later \nsunday I am in bed and the headache is back only more intense and shooting from brow to behind my ear and Into my jaw line down the back of my head and into the neck, \n\nThe Monday night my eye develops a twitch enough to really bug me its noticeable for 2 days straight hours on end. \n\nWednesday headache still there and eye not as intense now, \n\nThursday I am looking in the mirror just after I get up I think I cannot smile not sure into the night smile feels worse but not allot I go to bed, \n\nFriday I wake up and cannot feel my whole right side from mouth to eyebrow nothing works.

The meds make you very dizzy and weak- they do for me at least. I almost passed out just from vacuuming PART of two rooms. Stay open with your doctor, let them know the nature of your work and let them know how you are feeling about everything. It is important to keep your stress down Thanks for the advice not sure weather I should take 2 weeks as I have 2 weeks of meds If your speech is affected I would make an appointment with a GP to get a second opinion about it possibly being a stroke. I wish you the best of luck. I think there is something about prednisone and operating heavy machinery, so that could be your answer.\n\nI did take two weeks off (10 days of steroids). Tried it on day one, but I felt tired all the time and wanted to sit down for an hour after just making a cup of tea. See how it affects you, and decide what you need based on that. I think speech was dues to how bad my mouth was I was having difficulty saying ords beginning with f, v, p, b mainly but today not so much I think I will take 2 weeks to be sure I have nothing on my mind except these tablets. I cannot miss them and I cannot risk getting hurt at work as I work with low functioning adults with autism and could get hit in the face quite badly I only had one week of meds but I got so dizzy and light headed just from vacuuming. Granted I was very pregnant but definitely would not recommend operating heavy machinery I am onto the 4th day of meds they make me. Feel tired", "Anyone have any experience with/suggestions for lingering pain after recovery? Bell's Palsy struck this past June. I had complete facial paralysis and some drooping, accompanied by pain around my ear, cheekbone and jaw that got worse for the first 5 days or so, then gradually improved. It took about a month to see any real improvement beyond twitches, and four months to make a complete recovery, but by late September, I had complete movement back on the affected side. Which I am very very thankful for.\n\nI have come out relatively unscathed, but I do have lingering tenderness on that side. I do not notice it most of the time, but it is enough to be aware if anything presses on my face under my eye, along the cheekbone, or along my bottom jaw right below that. I have had to switch away from metal glasses with nose-pieces, because the pressure was uncomfortable after a while, and I generally do not to sleep on that side anymore (I tend to smoosh my face into the pillow). It is not a sharp pain, more of the 'poking a partly-healed bruise' sort. \n\nAnyone else have issues with this sort of lingering discomfort? Did it fade eventually? Is there anything you found helped? I was diagnosed with BP at a young age (10 yrs old) and full recovered. I am currently in my mid 20\u2019s and to this day half of my face we will get this tingly pain. It is exactly how you described, and sometimes it even creeps into my hair. Super weird feeling. I have not discovered a fix I came to this sub to see if anyone else was experiencing this. I got BP in March of this year and recovered end of April. \n\nI only feel pain if I apply pressure to my cheekbone. It is an uncomfortable type of pain but only if i press on it. It does not really affect my daily activities but it is still kind of annoying when I lay down on my pillow. \n\nThe ear pain was the worst part of my BP. It went away a few weeks after my diagnosis but I noticed it comes back every once in a while. It is not nearly as intense as the first time but it still worries me.", "3 weeks later It is been 3 weeks and my face has regained 95 percent mobility. I regained my full sense of taste and I can make a full smile. One of my eyebrows still does not move all the way up buts it is barely noticeable.

I am so glad I found this sub reddit, to anyone going through this, just hang in there \ud83d\ude01 I am 2.5 weeks and still no progress. Sigh. I am happy for you though and hope you keep on recovering! I did a lot of facial exercises which I think helped speed up the process a bit. I hope you feel better This is really motivating - thank you so much! You are very welcome Yees that is great! Im 2 weeks in and movement is definitely returning, but I would say im only 35 - 40% recovered Exactly the same timeline here. Diagnosed/paralysis hit on the 15th. I have zero improvement.

I have had it twice now! \n\nI wrote about ( It is in Spanish but it can be translated. I left some tips that might help somebody.\n\nThanks for sharing! I feel you! It took me like 3 months to start seeing improvement. It is very frustrating but do not worry, you will get better!", "Just diagnosed on Wednesday Hi all, I know this sub gets a lot of new posts. It is the 3rd day of my diagnosis and it finally hit me hard yesterday and this morning, so I found the sub and decided to make the post just to share/have a bit of support all around. Vanity aside, what has been most nerve wrecking (pardon the pun here) for me has been the little things I have taken for granted like drinking without spewing half the liquid out, chewing since I enjoy food immensely and probably too much. \n\nAnd speech - my profession involves a lot of talking and more so now with working from home and having to be on video calls. Yesterday I was on back to back calls having to lead the discussion and drive home points for my clients and it was incredibly frustrating to have to spend so much effort to sound somewhat like myself. There were certain words I simply could not vocalize because I cannot control my right side at all. I found myself having to use my fingers to support my mouth to help with speaking. \n\nI had pain at the back of my ear and neck before the right side face paralysis came on. I was fine in the morning when at lunch I felt like I could not chew on the right side and finally took a look at myself in the evening and saw my half my face was droopy. Went to the ER, and was glad it was not a stroke. My work has been stressful and my diet and alcohol consumption leaves much to be desired, so when I heard it was not a stroke, I was relieved. They gave me steroids and antiviral drugs immediately, and likely this was caused by chickenpox or shingles since I had the itchy rashes just days before this. I have got an appointment to see an acupuncturist in a few days' time and have started taking B12. Going to get some lycine and starting on an anti-inflammatory 5-day diet just because I need to reset my eating habits anyway and this is the wake up call. \n\nI find myself swinging from feeling depressed about my condition to feeling relief and gratitude. Healthcare can cost a lot here so I am glad I am in a position to be able to get the treatment I need and have the insurance coverage. Also glad for a supportive partner and that for the last year, a lot of my friends have told me to take a step back and work less, so I guess this was the kick in the butt I needed. \n\nAnyone found any exercises or stress coping mechanisms that were useful? My company actually offers meditation classes for free but I attended one and checked out when the instructor asked us to imagine seeing a lush forest ahead and snowy mountains behind. Tried yoga but I am just not someone who can \"turn off\" or focus on just my breath. \n\nThanks for reading my long ramble there. It is comforting to have this sub and just to read about everyone is experiences. Hey there! Little bit of encouragement. I had bells right after I turned 25. It is been 5 years now and I am mostly back to normal; no one can notice any residual effects aside from me-but I am as close to normal as possible. I highly recommend taking homeopathic remedies, seeing a chiropractor once or twice a week, and doing acupuncture. The steroids do not do diddly and my doctor even admitted that they are not sure it does anything (but I did take my steroid until it was gone anyway). I had no movement for almost a month and it was probably another month or two before I was back to \u201cnormal\u201d. Try not to lose heart. If you can afford to take off of work, do it. Your body needs the rest. My bells was stress induced, this last year has been stressful to say the least. I also recommend not doing any facial exercises until you see movement begin again, when I was researching 5 years ago I saw videos of people on YouTube who did exercises too soon and their central nerve started to come back online, but made the wrong connections (IE opening their mouth and their eye would close). Best of luck! :)\n\nEdit: there has been an uptick in bells infections with those who have gotten the covid vaccine I go on walks now, bc of covid I have been inside a lot so that helps. So does the fresh air and sun. \n\nIf you are sick definitely take two weeks off and file it has health issues so you get paid. The first month is very important so going into work might just cause more stress. Take it easy and focus on your physical emotional and mental health.\nAfter my meds ran out I started CBD oil and between that and acupuncture today I was finally able to close my eye while keeping the other open which I could not do. \nDo things that relax you and do not require much focus. \nBP has re-humbled me and has been forcing me to take better care of my self and sometimes life does that to remind us not to take the little things for granted.\nBest of luck with recovering. Thank you for this! I am going to see if my acupuncturist has a chiropractor he can recommend. I am taking the approach of just throwing everything I can at it to see what sticks. Definitely appreciate the advice on taking it easy with the exercises. I am following a YouTube video where she recommends 5 repetitions and just 2x a day during the early days. \n\nI am actually glad that masks are a common thing now, makes me less self conscious when I have to return to the office. Thanks for the CBD oil suggestion! I have some CBD balm lying around so I will try it too. I live in pollen central so sadly going out for walks means my sinus infection/allergies flare up badly. Probably a sign to move. \ud83d\ude0f \n\nI did notice I could move my upper lip more after my partner massaged my face. He said he could feel tightness and focused on it. \n\nThis is great advice really - focusing on taking better care and not to take the little things for granted. Haha yes, also look into BP exercises to start on, 2x a day is best, do not over force yourself and use your hand as support.\n\nGlad you are seeing some result already that is a good sign, best of luck friend Thanks for reaching out! I am on day 7 today. This time last week I was checked into the ER and slept over the night after a battery of tests. I got my steroids and I do believe they helped. As of right now I have already started recovering; my smile has started to become more symmetrical and I have learned to cope with the annoying drinking problem. Most importantly for me, and to your point, is that my speech has improved, mainly through retraining to talk and working on my diction. I also have a job which requires excellent communication skills and I am feeling positive that I will continue to get it right. \n\nUnlike alot of threads I read here, I immediately started working on massaging my face muscles and doing exercises like blowing up a balloon, trying to focus on closing each eye too. Initially it was pretty disheartening but now I think it is really paid off. I think rest is important but I do not associate a bit of physiotherapy to be counterintuitive. \n\nCould you elaborate on your neck pain specifically please? In my later days my neck started stiffening and cramping right below my centre jaw line, and I wonder if that is what people are referring to or if it is more around the back and sides for others? I am glad you are seeing great improvement just a week from diagnosis! I hope you will continue on the speedy recovery. Like you, I have been doing some exercises - twice a day and no more than 5 reps for each exercise like the video I found. Bit of a longer video but I found it helpful to follow along:  (in case anyone is interested). \n\nMy neck pain is right at the back of my neck, base of my skull. I have had a knot there before BP but it felt more pronounced with the onset of BP. \n\nI was rubbing my face today and noticed my jaw hurting. My cheekbone area (that line where you contour, for makeup enthusiasts) definitely feels stiff and aches. Having it massaged makes my forehead hurt slightly but I found that the pain is worth the reduction in stiffness in my cheek and jaw area. Been noticing tingling around my affected lip. \n\nStarting on an anti-inflammatory diet (  tmr and will report back on any progress. \n\nTake care and speedy recovery to you!", "Trying to puff out my cheeks but my lips will not fully close. Can barely shut my left eye and chewing food is difficult. Acute onset about three hours ago. Currently in physical therapy for unrelated spinal issue. This bells palsy or something else?  If you did not mention the Spinal issues I would have said Bells Palsy, but even then it looks like Bells to me. Very similar to what I have right now. Looks like it. Go to the doctor and get started on some steroids and anti-virals within 48 hours of onset. Supposedly it helps reduce symptoms and increase healing but I did not find that true for me.. just precautionary things. Go to urgent care/ ER for diagnosis. I would suggest calling ahead to find out what their covid protocols are. Sometimes BP can mimic things like a stroke and the internet cannot substitute a proper diagnosis and screening. Best of luck Just finished a round of steroids for my initial complaint. I believe my home exercises may have brought this about. Thank you. Former emt as well. I have been assessing my self over and over. No extremity deficits. Just be easy on neck and shoulder exercises as it can irritate the nerve and prevent healing. PT for me made my BP worse and I never healed. If it is BP is you will want to start antivirals and steroids ASAP to improve chances of recovery. 2 years in with BP. Most symptoms have lessened but no completely, acupuncture seemed to give me some relief. I had mild onset (looked like yours)and started anti-vitals and steroids within about 36 hours. I just did facial exercises with the meds and it was gone in 6 weeks. UPDATE: Sought treatment this morning. Confirmed case of Bell's palsy. All the usual treatments have been started. What exercises did you believe brought this on?", "Charlie horse under my chin Hello everyone, went to the ER 4 days ago and was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy. I caught super early and still had some muscle movement on the left side of my face, but now it is completely gone. \n\nI am starting to have an issue now where when I open my mouth too wide, stick my tongue out or brush my teeth, I get this really awful Charlie horse under my chin and I can feel it back to right below my ear as well. Does anyone know if this is normal and if so, how did you overcome it or help to lessen the pain? I will frequently get cramps underneath my jaw on the BP side.  Usually doing something (or, rather, TRYING to do something) with my lips I guess.  I got it about 2 years ago.  Made a decent recovery, but have lingering issues.  This being one of them.\n\nI just have to stretch it out, that is the only way I can get it to go away. So I have to look up sharply at the ceiling, while twisting my head, etc. Thankfully it does not happen in the middle of conversations usually. I had Bell\u2019s Palsy a few years ago and got 99% muscle movement (still have a very minor weakness in my upper eyebrow area).\nI started getting Charlie horses under my chin on the same side as the Bell\u2019s Palsy, but only when taking a shower.\n\nTook me a while to figure out why only when taking a shower.  Then I realized that when I wash my hair I close my eyes and typically keep them shut with a little bit of pressure.  That is when the Charlie horse would strike.\n\nNow I am mindful when taking a shower to relax my eyes shut and use minimal pressure as they are closed.\n\nI think there is a major nerve that runs from the eye socket area, near the ear and below the chin area.  Since it is all connected and I still have a very minor weakness in my eyebrow area, I attribute it to all being related. Did you get Bell's Palsy within a month of the covid vaccine? Yes. I did sadly. Monday I was diagnosed, which was 2.5 weeks after getting my first Pfizer shot. Thanks for the info! This helps a lot. Thanks for the info and letting me know how you managed to work around it. I am glad that you do not really have to deal with it in conversations, hate that you have to deal with it at all though. This is why I am afraid to get vaccinated. I had Bell's palsy 22 years ago very very bad. I would rather be dead than get it again!!! I understand that feeling. I did not care either way with the vaccine, but my boyfriend lives across the Canadian border and I have to be fully vaccinated in order to keep visiting when they fully open back up, so I had no choice. :( \nI would just say consult your doctor, and then get a second opinion just in case. Do research as well and make the best decision for yourself and your health. This describes my experience as well! I have this too! My neurologist diagnosed me with trigeminal Neuralgia for it and now I take carbamzapine to help keep the nerves quiet and it really has prevented a lot of these muscle spasms for me. I went from multiple in an hour to about like 3 in the last 3 months. That is a huge difference. I may have to look into this. Thanks for the info!", "Anyone tried CACI I have a friend who had Ramsay Hunt and had CACI and said it benefitted her. I have now just found my aunt has bells, I am thinking of getting her this treatment, although the fact it is at beauty clinics and not doctors surgeries is concerning. Has anyone tried this?", "New member here Hello everyone. New member here. I have oral HSV1 and was wondering if everyone here who got BP has HSV1? Wishing everyone good health and recovery. Wishing you a speedy recovery! I did not get BP the same way but sending you well wishes on your journey to getting better. Hi! I also have HSV1 and was diagnosed with BP 3 days ago. Lucky to have antiviral meds on hand for the HSV1 taking them daily now to hopefully help with the BP", "CBD Anyone use CBD for their BP? If so how has it helped you? I did and it might have helped. I have recovered pretty fast (90-95% in 3 weeks) but Im a sample size of 1 and I do not know how fast I would have healed without it. The way I saw it is that it probably will not hurt so worst case scenario it does nothing and I am out $20 and best case scenario it helps me heal faster. There is evidence it helps with inflammation and bells palsy is caused by inflammation of the nerve so that was my thought process. I used a tincture.  No idea if it helped or not. Did not hurt! I bought some but I am not sure if it helped honestly. I was pretty much healed in 4 weeks. I also did a lot of other things. What did you do? I took vitamin b12 every day. I started juicing. I massaged my face multiple times a day sometimes with my hands and sometimes with one of those jade rollers. Towards the end I watched bell's palsy therapy videos on YouTube. I also tried one round of accupuncture. I also made sure to get consistent light exercise I am not sure if it helped but figured it could not be bad. I tried the cbd gummies and that is about it. \n\nI honestly do not know if any of these things helped speed up the process but I was definitely willing to do anything that might help. I am doing b12 and cbd as of today", "Everything Sounds Lower-Pitched I am now off of my steroids and antivirals for my second bout of Bell's Palsy, and I have just noticed that everything sounds slightly lower in pitch. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I had nothing like this during my first bout. I am still in recovery and I experienced this in week 2 right after getting off of steroids. It was really severe and disorienting. Everything sounded lower in pitch and all music sounded out of tune. Hang in there. It has something to do with nerves being enflamed. For me it went away over the course of about 4-5 days. I also totally whacked out hearing for a bit.  It went away after a while. I get massive hearing sensitivity. I cannot stand the sound of machinery, like the vacuum, and Oh My God, lawn mowers and those evil gas leaf blowers. It just kind of comes and goes. Ear plugs!", "Thankyou so much everyone Hello everyone i posted a question yesterday and i got suggestion's to go see a doctor thankyou guys it turned out that i have Facial Nerve Palsy my doctor told me that i only have to take steroids and anti biotics and continue medication at home. So i you think you have the symptoms of bell's palsy go see a doctor immediately as it turns out every day i forgot what is its called but theres something that grows 1mm a day in your brain that will cost long term sickness or it will be forever ", "A number of local restaurants have got rid of straws because of single use plastics. This is a problem. While most of the chains have moved to paper straws, many others no longer have any option. I was a bit pissed off this weekend when I went to the local casino with my wife. They had got rid of straws under the excuse of 'the environment'. All of their utensils are single use plastics as are the drink covers, but straws are canned somehow. I literally cannot drink without a straw without pouring the contents all over my shirt.\n\nSorry, just a rant. FINALLY WE CAN ALL AGREE. Damn. Like I have this struggle too. Huh. I thought this was unique to me. They should keep a few on hand for people with facial and dental abnormalities. It is not that uncommon.\n\nEDIT: I just sent an email to their customer service advising them of the issue. I am pretty sure that this never crossed their minds. I'lll see what happens. \u201cThEn BuY a MeTaL sTrAw aNd BrInG iT wItH yOu\u201d Yeah. If I had known this was going to start being an issue I might have thought of that in advance. I might have to look into something like that. Not too convenient an item for a man to carry around though. It does suck and I also bought a pack of metal straws from the camping aisle. Kept them in my purse and glove compartment. The stated reason is an absolute cop-out. When I was in California recently, I asked a bartender for a water, no straw. And she said, \u201cwe have paper straws in case you should need one.\u201d (It was probably obvious that I was not from LA, not necessarily the Bell\u2019s)\n\nBottom line: restauranteurs can totally accommodate, but they see an opportunity to shift razor-thin margins to their store\u2019s credit. It would be quite a bit easier to digest if they would just say as much. I have been told that if you are running 5% margins in the restaurant business you are killing it, so shavings of a penny add up.\n\nIt would seem that conceal-and-carry or open-carry are the only ways you will be guaranteed to have a straw at all times.\n\nEdit: casinos have nooooo margin issues with which to contend, smh. Lol I feel your pain.  I ended up carrying a metal straw in my purse just in case.  Not exactly a practical solution if you are a dude though. Yeah. Just another thing that my wife will have to carry for me. Half the junk in her purse is mine now. My asthma pump, my keys, my reading glasses, and now a straw. Actually, no where did it state that was the reason. But I naturally assumed that would be the only reason for eliminating straws - which were in wide use previously.\n\nThe cost is so minimal that I think this is just misguided corporate greening.\n\nA far better route would be to use reusable eating utensils, but that would cost more, not less so...... Bless her.  It is a shame it is not as normal for men to carry around a bag like that. You have to regularly wash metal straws tho otherwise they will get nasty \ud83d\ude33", "my Experience so far First time  getting Bells Palsy, never even heard of it 3 weeks ago. I thought I would document my \"journey\" here, as this was scary at first, and hopefully I will have a positive outcome that may help comfort other first timers. \n\n10/18/18, I work 3rd shift. I started getting a slow throbbing pain along my lower left jaw line during work. Came home, and went to bed. When i woke up, Something with the left side of my face was not right. my wife, and I's initial thought was it was swollen, but it did not have that \"tight skin\" feeling you usually feel with an are that is swollen. I quickly discovered how challenging it is to do some things you take for granted, like drink something, or eat cereal without it running back out and the eye irritations. Work that night was especially fun. Got in to see Dr. right away the morning of \n\n10/19/18. Got in to see Dr. right away in the morning and was immediately diagnosed as Bells Palsy, and put on Valtrex and Prednisone. This was the first time I ever heard of Bells Palsy, and talk about a scary discussion, I thought I was going in to get something to reduce the swelling in my face, Not something that could be potentially permanent. I followed the regimen prescribed by Dr. At this point, I cant smile, blink, taste, or wrinkle the left side of my face. I cant properly pronounce words with \"P\" or \"F\". I have a hard time eating, and keeping the food in my mouth, and I have to push food back into the center of mouth that gets stuck between jaw and cheek on the left side with my fingers (from the outside). I cant even close my left eye, without the assistance of my hand. Of course I was advised to tape eye shut at night, which I did. \n\n10/22/18. I am able to close left eye lid if I close both at the same time, but it wont stay shut by itself. Eating and drinking has become just a hair easier. I do not know if this is an improvement, or just my body adjusting to, and compensating for the new limitations.\n\n10/24/18. After discovering This sub reddit, and doing alot of reading, and researching, I decided to add B12 (Methylcobalamin) 5 grams daily, to my regimen. \n\n10/25/18. Starting to feel a little better. Left eye lid will sort of stay closed on its own, although it still has to be manually closed. Drinking from a bottle seems, genuinely a little easier. Speech has improved a little. I dont know if this is because of the B12, or coincidence, but there is a slight, genuine improvement.\n\n10/28/18. Definitely feeling motor control returning. I am guessing I am about 50-60% recovered. I can close my left eye, independently, though it takes a little more effort than the right, I have taste starting to return. I can come a little closer to an actual smile. And speech is about 95% back to normal. I have taken the last of my Valtrex today, and I still have one Prednisone left, which I am pretty sure I should not, so I must have missed a dose somewhere. So I guess it is  going to be on the B12 at this point. I feel I should also point out that I have been taking L-theanine here and there, for Nootropic reasons throughout this ordeal, I do not know if it has any effect on it or not, but in the interest of full disclosure, I do take it in a stack with Caffeine. Are you a vegetarian by any chance? I also developed BP and I am wondering if I did not take enough B12 when I was healthy.  I am not a vegetarian. My understanding is that it isnt caused by a lack of b12, but rather kicking up the b12 helps recover faster. Ah makes sense. Hope you are fully recovered. I am just starting down this path.  Yea, been meaning to do another update, I have been 99.5% recovered for about a week now.", "Diagnosed Monday December 20th for the first time Hello everyone.... I am a 32 year old mom of 3 and I was just diagnosed with bells palsy on December 20th. It was quite horrifying waking up with a paralyzed face... I thought I was having a stroke. I went to the hospital,  they did blood tests, CT scan without contrast, xray of heart etc.... everything checked out so they said so they diagnosed me with bells palsy. I also had broken blood vessels in my neck that resembled a red rash/bruise under skin. \nAt first it was just my upper lip that was numb and then my right side just went paralyzed. I still cannot smile fully. A week prior to this happening I had the most horrible headache behind my right ear and bottom of skull/neck area. The night before this happened I had prosthetics put on my face because I am an actress and we are currently shooting a horror film. We were shooting at an abandoned school that night that in some rooms has black mold and asbestos and the prosthetics the make up artist used I thought were a bit dirty.... honestly it could have been from anything. Like I said I had a head ache a week prior. A month ago I went to Dr thinking I was having a heart attack because my right arm went numb and kept getting shocks up my arm and pins n needles in my hand.  And my right hip area kept going numb and locking up so I would be limping randomly. Nothing was done about it.  \nI just wonder if the hospital I went to missed something?? I really want an MRI with contrast done. I have to see my neurologist for this but this appt is booked a month out. So frustrating!! I was already seeing a neurologist and rheumatologist previously because my primary Dr suspected I had an autoimmune disease based on my positive ANA titer,  it is off the scale high....but they cannot pinpoint what autoimmune disease I have.... I also have a benign tumor inside of my t5 vertebra in my spine called a hemangioma. \n\nI was prescribed steroids and antivirals for this that have been giving me major gas LOL... now that my steroids are out my face feels like it was hit by a truck, so much pain!!!!! So I have been laying my face on a heating pad at night and taking hot baths. My upper back hurts pretty severely too. \n\nI have 3 more scenes left to do for film and everyone is upset with me because I have bells palsy and cannot shoot.... as if I can help getting this. I did not ask for this and I hate looking in the mirror, I feel so disfigured and hate the way I look and feel right now  \n\nI just wish I knew what is causing this!!!! I do not have aids, Lyme, stds, nothing. I have not been sick so do not see how it could be viral unless it was a dormant virus. I was wondering if it could be from the moderna vaccine but I only got one dose and that was back in May of 2021 so idk! I do not have diabetes or high blood pressure. I have been somewhat stressed but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nI am not pregnant, however, I just missed my period so I could be....but I never hear about it in the beginning, I hear about it happening to women in 3rd trimester.... so I am not sure.\n\nAll I know is I want my smile back. I want to feel normal again. And most importantly... I just want a proper diagnosis because clearly something is wrong. \n\nI am here for anyone who wants to talk, this sucks! We can go through this together. 11 days in and it is not getting any better. Would be nice to be able to swish listerine and drink out of a straw again.\n\nDoes anyone have a similar story? Would love to hear \u2661", "Still dealing with Bells for almost 5 months.. It will be 5 months next week since I have been diagnosed with BP.  The left side of my face completely paralyzed.  Cannot blink eye or smile.  However, symptoms have changed recently and was wondering if anyone can relate or have any idea what is happening.  I am afraid it is not healing properly.\n\nAbout a month ago, my left eye stopped drying out.  I still cannot blink but I do not need the drops and/or ointment to moisten.  It looks normal - there is no redness.  However, when I look down or eat, a bubble forms at the bottom of my eye and impairs my vision.  Tears will drop one by one as if Im crying.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I noticed the left side of my mouth was showing some movement.  I can almost smile!   However, I feel more pressure on my left side than previously and it appears my lips, when rested, have reversed.  The left side of my mouth used to droop lower than right side...used to look like /.   Now it appears the left side is higher than the right \\\\\n\nI  started prednisone as prescribed within 24 hours of symptoms appearing as well as anti-virals.  Since I finished medication, I have been taking B12 every morning and CBD oil every night.  Facial exercises from time to time.\n\nAnyone else dealing with this for months see any changes?  I understand it is a gradual recovery...but how gradual is it?  Also, how is anyone taken the Goodbye Palsy Essential Oils? I can relate to that healing timeline. I had no movement at all for 3 months and nothing more than a twitch and small movements until 6 months. I got my blink back within those 6 months but it is not complete so I have a constant dry spot if I do not use drops/eye tape. \n\nI am a few months shy of four years and am around 65-70% healed but I am still having bits and pieces come alive. Do not give up! \n\nAs for the tears\u2026depending on where the nerve was initially damaged, they may be crocodile tears caused by synkinesis. Or it could be that your eye really is dry which causes tearing- without your blink being back, I would suggest it is probably that your eye is still dry. Keep using the ointment and the drops and taping your eye at night. \nI had excessive tearing until I got my blink back and it was quite embarrassing in public but there was not anything I could do. \n\nI have not taken the essential oils but have tried lots of different things. Facial massage, osteopathy, acupuncture (I had good success with all three of these- especially acupuncture- the needles were always placed on the opposite side of my face.) I use an an acupuncture pen (Pointer Plus) nearly daily but did not start this until I was at 6-7 months in and already told that I would likely not recover fully. I do speech therapy (though if I had to choose again I would likely do physio for Bell\u2019s palsy instead). I am in a place where marijuana is legal and use that as well, I find it helps me focus on my facial exercises and stretches better. I also use KT tape to try to strengthen weak muscles. \n\nI hope that list is helpful for possible things to try as you work through your recovery:) I appreciate your response.  You have given me some tips I was not aware of and I have started to do research on.   I thought about doing acupuncture and it feels I should strongly consider it now .  I spent 6 weeks (Apr-May) in NY and tried marijuana a few times.  I am not sure if it really helped but I did notice changes started happening shortly after I started.  It is been almost 4 weeks now since I last used it and there has been no improvement since. In my experience, a lot of my recovery happens when I am really relaxed. I would sometimes fall asleep during acupuncture and wake up snoring. With marijuana, I have noticed different strains have different effects- some I notice a lot of tingling and some movement, others very little. It may be a bit of trial and error to find a few strains that work well for you. But again, it really relaxes me, so that could be a big component.   Ugh formatting.... Disclaimer - I am not a doctor, but my advice to you is to stop any supplements and essential oils, eat a variety of vegetables and get enough protein, and get some sun. With those things over time, even bad sleep should improve, and your healing should be as good as it can get.\n\n# it could be that the speed of your immune system's ability to heal is slow\n\nis something stressing you out on a daily basis? (maybe time to take some sick leave)\n\ndo you get 8 hours of sleep each night?\n\nare you eating enough vegetables and protein? (fiber helps remove toxins from the body, a balanced diet should be all the vitamins you need, and consistent energy from protein will help your immune function)\n\ndo you get any sunlight (10 min a day at bare minimum)? Most people are vitamin D deficient, and vitamin D is involved in almost all immune function  \n\n\ndo you drink enough water?\n\ndo you drink alcohol frequently?\n\nalmost forgot - do you eat sweets? Sugar results in an almost immediate reduction in immune function.\n\n# or it is not slow and you are continuing to be damaged by something:\n\nis there an abnormal amount of mold in the home?\n\nsome sort of toxin you are exposing yourself to? (do you work with chemicals? are you using essential oils regularly? Even if they are pure they may be doing harm)\n\nare you taking any non-prescribed supplements?\n\nsomething you are allergic to in the environment?\n\nonset of another issue/illness that you are body is busy fighting? (do you feel generally lethargic? swollen lymph nodes elsewhere on the body?) Today marks 10 months for me.  I did not start healing until the 5 month mark.  I can blink, but I have to think about it.  The normal reflex blink is not back yet.  Due to that, I still have some dry eye, as I suspect you do.  It does not have to hurt to be dry... This is a load of hogwash. If sugar shut down the immune system, why the hell do hospitals keep giving me jell-o? My mum (42 yrs old) experienced the same thing; it took a month for her to see any progress and a few more months for her to close her left eye fully and smile. Its been two years now and she is about 90% recovered, but it took her a long time to hit those major milestones. It just takes time and every single recovery is different. \n\nFrom her experience her main regrets are that she did not do as many facial exercises, didnt use her face roler/ gua sha often, had to go back to work almost immediately, and was constantly worried and stressed about how long the recovery was taking which didnt help her immune system. These were some thing she wishes she could go back and redo. I hope at some of these can help your recovery. \n\nI really wish you all the best! This happened to me the first time. Your eye just adapts to it eventually, over 5ish months, like you stated. After my first time, I never used any sort of eye drops, because my eye was just used to it. I have had it 3 times, and it is been between 6-9 months to recover each time. they really should not. Not everything hospitals do actually keeps up with medical science, especially in America if that is where you are located.\n\nJust editing to say if you are interested in learning more about sugar - check out Dr. Robert Lustig's talks at various medical conferences, or Dr. Rhonda Patrick (who discusses medical research with other doctors) or Dr. Peter Attia\n\nAlso adding that if it helps give you a jumping off point - the idea is that eating sugar causes your individual cells to have far more receptors available that can be leveraged by viruses, etc. Ah, yes. Guests from the Joe Rogan DMT hour.   \n\n\nI have been abroad. They have jello there, too. Except it is agar-agar. I do not watch the Joe Rogan show so I cannot comment on that, I found them through IHMC talks, conferences and Stem-talk podcast (  \n\n\nif you are interested in learning about it that is great, but it sounds like you have 100% faith in everything hospitals do so it almost seems silly to even be on a forum centered around discussing a medical issue Can i still take steriods even if my bells palsy were about 2 years already?  It is true that the ability and speed to heal varies with each individual. However, supplements do help. Sure if you eat everything you are supposed to eat, but that is difficult for most people. For instance, I take high quality omega-3 fish oil and Coq10 and my heart health is excellent and even w Bells my skin looks great. Anyway, you get my point. \nSleep is great for recovery overall, but a recent study shows that sleep does not play a big role in Bells recovery. Only time does. My neurologist explained that it takes many weeks and months for nerves to heal and reconnect. The massage and exercises are not for nerve recovery per se, but to keep the muscles that are flaccid from losing tone and becoming weak from non-use. Plus, the brain is a miraculous organ. By doing the motions, even with assist sparks a healing connection. You are reteaching your brain to spark-up that muscle. I set an intent before facial exercises and imagine/remember the correct corresponding emotion.\n\nYou are right that you are not medically qualified to give medical advice. Common sense advice like ho out in the sun and get lots of sleep does not apply here. Mind your own bees wax as my grandmother used to say. My doctor says steroids only work at the onset. Plus, steroids have very bad side effects. Go see a good neurologist and see what is available for you. Still dealing with Bells for almost 23 years..", "Interrupted recovery? I was diagnosed four weeks ago, left side completely paralyzed. Luckily I started a treatment with prednisolone right away. In the first week nothing happened, but in weeks two and three I improved rather quickly and I would say I am at 80% now. What worries me, is that now progress seems to have stopped. Especially one of the muscles for my upper lip is missing. Is that common, that some muscles come back much later than others? Diagnosed the day before New Years and I am in the same boat, been doing facial exercises since day 1   And while some of my cheek muscles can manipulate my mouth I would say about 1/4th of my mouth(lips) is unresponsive. Hang in there, if you are really concerned talk to your doctor or maybe a pt", "Curious about features without condition Does anyone know what might cause someone to naturally (from birth) have one side of their face move naturally, whereas the other side does not move naturally but can be moved on purpose ? \n\nFor example, my right eyebrow is always arched (I can flatten it with effort), and when I smile usually only the right side of my mouth curls up, resulting in a crooked smile. However, I can smile on both sides if I am conscious of it.\n\nJust curious- it does not affect me negatively except looking a little asymmetrical, and was wondering if anyone knew what this could be related to.", "Lingering effects I have had the pleasure (displeasure) of getting Bell\u2019s palsy twice...after the second time, about 2 years after the first, I guess I am \u201crecovered\u201d at this point, but there are lingering effects.\n\nHonestly I feel like I have lost my smile, which is one of the things I loved about myself before. But now, one eye does not open all the way and my mouth does not stretch as far on the same side.\n\nThe worst part, is people do not notice it, but I do. I see it in the mirror, in pictures, I feel it now typing this out.\n\nI do not know what to do to fix it, if it even can be. And it really is a kill to my self esteem and happiness. Feel like my smile was taken from me way too young. And I fear everyday that I will get Bells again, and my smile will get worse. 1: how to make sure that you dont get bells palsy again:\n\nKeep you ears WARM and clean at all times. You can put come cotton inside the ear while sleeping or going out.\n\n\nMaintain hygiene.. Use clean sheets and cushions.\n\nIntroduce alot of vegetables in your routine.\n\n2. How to get back your smile:\n\nDo facial exercises regularly, blow whistles, sip water, coffee using straw,blow balloons. \n\nDaily 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes in the evening and 10minutes before going to bed.\n\nAnd be patient.. It is 100 % recoverable. Been there twice myself. Tc Thank you! I can totally relate. I have had it 4 times. And after the 3rd my smile and eye were never the same. It is incredibly frustrating. 4 time is brutal, I cannot imagine. While most things I have read say it usually only happens once and we have had it multiple times.\n\nIf I come across anything that helps I will pass it along. I will try the exercises the person commented before. I have done them in the past but felt they were not helping, maybe need to keep at it.", "DX 11/5/20, still unresolved What is everyone taking for the headaches? \nBackground::\nDX 11/5/2020 I did the whole antivirals and steroids (3 rounds by December/Jan 2021). I am now seeing Neuro regularly and do PT for facial paralysis to see if that helps (doing e-stim machine) . \nI have headaches constantly and they can be regular or beyond migraines, onset is different sometimes out of nowhere sometimes gradually they just get worse or just stay consistent all day. It does not help w the insomnia I have been getting either. They gave me gabapentin 600mg but sometimes that does not even work and i end up crying from the pain (that does not help matters either but y'know it is hard to deal with when your trying to parent too)\nAny advice? Has anyone going this long recovered i need some hope especially after my PT lady casually said i might not regain movement since it is been this long. Gabapentin sucks (imo). Im not a doctor. But Gabapentin is that catch all medication for neuro issues that no one knows what to do with. My neruo told me this right before she kicked me off her service because she didnt know what to do with me. \n\nMy primary care doctor has me on a seizure medication (carbamzapine) which has been working well for me in terms of nerve pain, headaches, and trigeminal neuralgia. Definitely ask for other options I have my next Neuro in August will definitely ask about this! Thanks for the advice and i was also hesitant about gabapentin but when the pain is that bad i had to take something y'know. When I had nerve pain for Bell\u2019s I was on gabapentin and naproxen. I know a few people who have been given naproxen for migraines. So maybe talk to the doctor about that option? Yeah i take it also but also very little relief.

I am mostly recovered now but still have some lingering facial pain and not too noticeable paralysis.\nPrior to onset, I had a pain in my ear for 8 days and now I have had the same pain in my other ear for the last 3 days. I am concerned I may have Bell\u2019s Palsy developing on the other side of my face.\nHas anyone here had experience with reoccurring Bell\u2019s Palsy? Is there anything I can do at this stage to prevent or minimise the reoccurrence? I read that reoccurring Bell\u2019s Palsy usually has gaps in the order of years rather than months but has anyone had short intervals?\nThanks in advance It is possible, but the chances are very, very low. Just one side already is 1 out of 50 000. If it is the case, there is not really much you can do about it, maybe some prednisolone or something, but that is it.. Thanks. I know I am most probably being paranoid but I really do not want to go through it twice. Especially as I still have not fully recovered from the first time. I have had BP twice, the instances were 12 years apart. They were also both on my left side. \nNot to freak you out or anything, but I have also had pain off and on related (I think) to BP for almost twenty years. I say just stay calm and focus on healing! The most recent time I had it, I got it on one side of my face, and then 2 weeks later, the other side of my face got it. It really sucks worse when it is both sides of your face, because you cannot even close your lips. Hope you do not have this, but if you do, Goodluck. It gets better though I got BP 2 years ago and am not fully recovered. I sometimes still get pain and I get worried, but it has not reoccurred. Wow that really sucks. Luckily if I do have a reoccurrence I have lip movement back on the original side so I will not be quite as badly affected. Thank you for sharing your experience No I doubt it is bells palsy. I also got that for around a week - pain behind my ear. I got really paranoid and the pain ended up passing around a week. You are just being paranoid! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e Haha thank you it is reassuring to hear. I imagine I would not have thought too much about it before I had BP but now my brain has made a connection between the two.", "Has anybody experienced twitching on the \"good\" side? I am 3 months in and have very little recovery.  Maybe no recovery; it is hard to tell.\n\nLately, the lower eyelid on my healthy side will twitch after I have tried to make movements on the \"bad\" side.  For example: if I sneeze, my reflexes are to shut my eyes. Obviously, only the healthy side shuts, and the BP side stays open.  Then, for a few seconds after that, the good eyelid will twitch.  Basically, whenever I try to close my BP eye \"quickly,\" now the eyelid on the good eye will twitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am beginning to panic because of this.  I know about synkinesis, but I was under the impression that only happens on the BP side.  You see stories online (here, even) about how many BP survivors end up with it, and will do things like blinking when smiling, smiling when raising an eyebrow, etc. But does that happen all over your face?!  I thought it was just the sick side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also worried because my BP began with twitching eyelids...so of course now I am worried I am getting BP on the good side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnybody else experience twitching on the good side while recovering? \n\n# Mine was most likely muscle fatigue. Your body often compensate for loss of motion and perhaps the muscles on your other side are fatigued from this. Thank you.  That is certainly what I am hoping is the case! Have you gone to a neurologist or tried and physical therapy? A neurologist would be best for calming your mind about the twitching. PT is what ended up helping me the most healing wise. I saw an ENT two weeks ago and was ordered an MRI to double-check for tumors and to start PT.  MRI is Sunday and I hope to schedule the PT sessions tomorrow. Good! What helped me was electrical stimulation. It is a little painful with quick jolts of electricity but it is neat to feel your face move again. I am having the same and my neurologist told me it is because facial muscles are trying to compensate the affected side. Prior to BP I would get twitching when my eyes are tired. Drops would offer relief that I did not know I needed.\n\nWith BP, I noticed my good side gets tired. Good side eye muscles definitely pulling extra work to compensate (as others have said).\n\nImagine the work it takes to wink with either eye... 1 eye shut and other open. Ever seen a young child trying to learn to wink? \n\nFigure as others have said it is probably the compensation.", "7.5 year old diagnosed with BP - anyone with children experienced this with kids? My 7.5 year old daughter was just diagnosed today (13 July) at the ER with BP. \nLast month she had a very bad bug bite on her scalp (no idea what kind of bug. We thought mosquito but now we are wondering if it was a tick bite. Even thought it could have been ringworm given she was around two puppies and it did not look like an ordinary bug bite) that brought us to the doctor on 23 June where she was put on antibiotics for a week to treat the infection. Things cleared up and all was fine for a week or so.  The doctor called to report that they had no conclusive results as to just what the infection was\u2026..\nJust this last weekend (Friday/Saturday, 9-10 July) she said that there was a bump behind her ear on the same side as the bug bite and that it hurt to sleep on. I assumed it was an ear infection or a swollen lymph node left over from the previous infection. Treated with warm compress and some ibuprofen.  I wish I had taken her to the doctor then!  Come Monday night the same side of her face looked very swollen so we knew we were heading to the doctor in the AM. \nThis morning her face was definitely drooping and I was very anxious. \nER confirmed that it was BP. They drew blood and will let us know in a week if she has Lyme Disease or not. They put her on steroids, antivirals, and antibiotics (in case of Lyme) and we follow up with a pediatrician in a week. \n\nI just wanted to hear other peoples\u2019 stories of kids with BP. Are there any facial exercises or massage we should be doing?  We have loads of lubricating  and  rewetting eye drops, an eye patch, and a sleep mask for bedtime. Thinking of upping her B12 supplement as well as zinc and Vit C.  And lots of rest sounds essential. \nShe is taking this like a champ and loves wearing her eye patch. She is referring to herself as The Dread Pirate Roberts and I am hoping she can come out the other side just as strong and happy. Needless to say, as her mama, I am worried and scared, though putting on a brave face for my girl.  I guess I am looking for good news or any advice that could be helpful. TIA!  \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc9c\ud83c\udf08 You can search in YouTube. There are a lot of facial exercises available there that you can follow. I followed it religiously twice a day. ( is a great resource and they also have ( on you tube that are helpful. \n\n It sounds as though you are doing the right things. If your daughter is comfortable with it acupuncture, I found acupuncture to be very helpful (in the unaffected side). It is still early so she may only have this for a short while :) My second cousin had BP as a kid, and her face looks fine now. Idk if every kid is the same, but we are talking 30 years ago when medicine and  doctors were not as advanced as today. I would not have even known she had it if my mom did not tell me. I only know because I had BP back in February. Thank you for this!  Kids are very resilient. I hope you are doing well, as well. I really knew nothing of BP besides what I heard while pregnant. I am learning so much here so thank you! Thank you so much!  I will check out the site for sure. This is such a scary thing out of the blue and this group is such a huge relief and wonderful resource! Wonderful!  Thank you so much! it sounds like you are handling it very well! I may have had mild BP when I was 10, but my family did not notice. I remember another classmate drawing me with the half smiling half frowning face I had at that time (they were not making fun of me, they were just drawing everyone). I can tell you having love and support would probably go a long way versus being a kid trying to make your smile work on your own every day in the mirror. Sounds like you are doing a great job and you have raised a trooper! Thank you so much for your kind words and your support!  I have to say, I think my daughter is handling this much better than I would have at her age.  From what I have read, it seems common enough in kids, especially after tick bites. Again, I never saw a tick bite her on the bug bite that was infected last month but we were in a place in Massachusetts with outrageous tick numbers and in a house with a dog who regularly brought in deer ticks. My daughter had two on her in two days that we caught and removed but maybe there was another?  Waiting for test results and I am very curious to know if it is Lyme. And even if it is not, ticks carry so many other diseases. The not knowing and wondering if there was more I could have done when she had the infection makes me a little crazy!", "Surgery for Bell's Palsy Does anyone have any resources or information regarding facial reanimation? I never fully recovered from my bout of BP and finally decided to look into surgery. Any help would be appreciated. EDIT: I have already done tons of google searches. I did not make it clear what I am looking for. I would like to hear about places where I could possibly talk to people who have had it done, or personal experiences, etc. :) Thank you!  I recommend the this ( I have not been there myself but they do have good reviews online and the doctor has an impressive portfolio of experience. Dr. Babak Azizzadeh in LA, CA specializes in BP surgery I had the procedure in which they implant nerves connected to your functioning side into your palsy side, by Dr. Azizzadeh (mentioned already). It was not successful for me. I would love to talk to other patients of his and hear if they were successful. I did not have facial renanimation but I did have a brow lift to help correct symmetry. Oregon Health and Science University has a Facial Paralysis Dept that does facial surgery for those that have suffered strokes or also BP that has effected facial nerves/muscles.  Dr. Ng has been practicing there for several decades, they also include in their options doctors that do facial reconstruction surgery.  I had facial reconstruction surgery related to a cancerous tumor in my face.  They are miracle workers.  I highly recommend them. I am also interested and following.

Feels so weird. \n\nDo any of you wear glasses? Mine keep slipping down my face and it is giving me headaches I also wear glasses - 5 days in and yes it is much easier when the glasses are off.

I am 18, turning 19 soon, now.\n\nWhen I was 17, the doctor I saw finally said nothing could be done for me. What never recovered, a fair half of my face, would always be at least semi-permanent. While my case is not as extreme as some people, it prevents me from smiling \u201cnormally\u201d, I cannot make normal facial movements, one eye is slightly lower than the other, the eyelid to that eye will not close all the way, I cannot move the eye brow on that side of the face, I have to drink out of a straw, etc., etc.\n\nTo anyone, especially people with spouses or partners, who got Bell\u2019s Palsy - what is kissing like with it?

It was not \"surface level\" like with an ear ache, but felt more like a headache/migraine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Day 1:*\n\nFirst sign that something was wrong was when I went to rinse my mouth out with mouthwash and I spit all over the bathroom counter. Did not know what to think so I brushed it off. Later that day I was having a hard time drinking out of a straw. Finally realized something was wrong when my wife pointed out that my right eye was blinking slower than my left eye. \n\nMy healthcare provider does virtual visits so I started there. They recommended an Urgent Care, then the Urgent Care sent me to the ER out of fear I may have a brain tumor. \n\nER doc was confident that it was Bell's so ended up not doing any head scans (I am 23, healthy no real cause for concern). The only reason there was even any ambiguity in the situation was because of how early it all was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Days 2-3:*\n\nNow the symptoms fully settle in and I have got the full facial paralysis on the right side of my face. I was lucky in that I did not have a \"droop\" but it was very noticeable when I talked, smiled or laughed. These were definitely good days in all because I was on the highest dosage of steroids so I was golfing, exercising and then resting. I took off work these days and overall felt fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Days 4-5:*\n\nReturn to work. Side note: Do not ever be late on your steroids. I was 3-4 hours late and I got a massive migraine and ended up having to tap out early from work. \n\nMy only issue while working was eye-dryness. I could barely stare to look at my computer screen for any considerable amount of time and I could not go outside if there was even the slightest breeze. \n\nSomething I would have done differently is gotten the really thick eye drops, instead of just the basic Refresh eye drops. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Days 6-19:*\n\nThis was a pretty steady time frame. I had re-learned how to blink so eye dryness was no longer an issue. During this time frame I would still have classified myself 0% recovered in terms of my facial control. I started taking B12 vitamins because I heard from this subreddit that it had helped some people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Day 20:*\n\nMy first wrinkle. Super exciting day, this was the first sign of progress. When I did the eyebrow raise in the mirror that morning I noticed a very small wrinkle on the right side. I would still categorize it as 5% recovery.\n\nThat evening I decided to double down... \n\nThere was not a ton of data (as it with most things BP related), but there were a few articles that had speculated that cannabis (specifically CBD) could accelerate the recovery from BP. I decided to take an edible which included THC and CBD just to see if it would work for me. \n\nLater that night as I am high off my ass, I feel like I can almost fully use my face again. I could not tell if that was accurate or if I was just tripping balls and I fell asleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Day 21:*\n\nWow. It actually worked. I would classify myself as \\~90-95% recovered. You can notice a slight difference on my right side when I make the various movements of what I like to call BP Simon Says (eye brow raise, dog smile, hard eye squint, etc.) but unless someone is looking for it, they cannot tell. \n\nObviously, I cannot say for sure that it was the weed that did it. However, considering the change did not come overnight, but actually came in the literal hours while I was high I have a hard time thinking it was a coincidence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*In Conclusion*\n\nI hope this personal testimony gives hope for those that are experiencing BP. I will keep up with the comments on this so feel free to comment of PM me if you have any questions that I did not hit on. Thanks for sharing, hopefully it helps someone.\n\nFor the eye dryness staring at a computer screen I ended up using an eye patch over the bad eye and turned my monitor to warm color.

I work around a lot of loud noises so I am thinking it might just be my ear is struggling to adjust still. What do yall think and is there any thing I could do for it? Maybe continue with the garlic oil but that does not seem to relieve it. Maybe try sound protection when you are near the loud nose at work. Go to a neurologist if you can and ask for a ICA MRI for you ears and explain why and get them checked just in case and the neurologist should be able to guide you better once they have the test results. Hope you feel better soon. My wife is struggling with her diagnosis, and has been absolutely miserable. :(. CBD oil took the ear ache pain away for me completely! Glad you are recovering. That is a great idea, I will try that. This is great news! Definitely ear plugs or some form of protective ear cover if you are working in a place with loud noises. Maybe check with an ENT? I found that prior to BP, I had constant ear blockages because of inflammation from my sinus infection, and my ENT prescribed a nasal spray similar to Flonase that helped a lot with bringing down my ear condition.

Has anyone recovered after this amount of time? Had it a decade ago. I still have some eyelid drooping on the side that was affected then. I also have synkinesis, so when I smile, my affected eye really scrunches up. I, too, have been really bummed about it at different times, especially when I see photos. \n\nI went to a number of different specialists and they said they could not do anything. I do not think I can offer anything in terms of solutions, but I know a little bit of how you feel. I am sorry. It is really hard. \n\nI am on my second round of BP, other side this time, which is why I am on this reddit board. What type of specialist did you go to for the synkinesis?  I am dealing with the same thing with my eye, but I was hoping there was help available out there for it somewhere I went to a doctor called a physiatrist, which I did not know was a thing, and a neurologist, asked my physiotherapist, regular doctors, etc.\n\nthat was a long time ago, and now I am doing more research, and I am thinking it might be worth it to get botox or look for someone who specializes in biofeedback", "Joining the club... Hi all. I am here to join the club. \n\nHere my story so far. \n\nTuesday 3rd November I woke up feeling unwell, just a real heavy head like a flu but without the headache and low level head pain all around. I was also exhausted. \n\nI work from home so went about my morning and I had a video call at 11am. \n\nDuring the call I could see myself constantly moving my mouth around as if to wake it up, it was overly dry and just tired feeling. I has not noticed anything else wrong and my smile was fine (the boss cracked a bad joke once or twice and I noticed my full grin). \n\nThe rest of that day went normal enough but my overall sluggishness just never went away nor did my headache. \n\nI was on leave the next two days to take a trip away with my wife. I woke up on Wednesday morning and my mouth was now numb on the left side, like coming out of the dentist after an op. But I still was not noticing anything else yet. \n\nThat evening I noticed the whole left side was now going numb, pinching both side of face proved something was different. Then I did the full grin test, it was not my grin anymore. That is when my wife got worried. \n\nMy first idea was I have had an allergic reaction or a trapped nerve. I consulted my nurse friend and he immediately said (with the help of a photo) it was Bell\u2019s Palsy. \n\nThe next day it was off to the doctor who was sure it was BP but sent me to A&amp;E to get a head CT to be sure. I honestly have never been seen so quickly in an A&amp;E before. 3 examinations (to test if I had a stroke) as well as the CT all done in 3 hours. It came back clear and a consultant agreed with the (now second) doctor it was BP. I was sent home with 5 days worth of Prednisone and warned taking them it may hit my immune system. \n\nI am now on day 5 and it is the exact same as day one. Compared to others I have seen online it looks mild but still unsettling all the same. I can close my eye (though I have to do it slowly or else it gives up if the right eye completes the blink too quick), I can sleep fine with it and eating is different but not impossible. \n\nI have been doing the exercises I have been seeing on here and across the many online pages I have been reading. \n\nAll I have been told now is to wait for the hospital Out Patients to contact me for a review and see if they want to continue me on steroids. \n\nSeeing the posts on here about recovery and positivity have been great to read. I have been trying to absorb as much info on this as I can and on here as been great for it. Hi! I am in almost the same place as you! Around 10/28 I felt a bit congested and tired. Like a mild cold was coming on. Then, Sunday, 11/1, I woke up and nothing tasted right. Naturally I thought I had COVID so I went to get a rapid test. Negative. Cool. Then Monday, 11/2 I woke up and was brushing my teeth and realized I could not spit. When I looked in the mirror I could tell the left side of my face was not working. Did a quick self assessment for stroke, and decided it was probably BP. Went to urgent care as soon as they opened. Started prednisone that day. It is been 8 days now and no improvement. \n\nI saw a neurologist yesterday and he recommended a few more days of prednisone to taper off of the medication &amp; physical therapy. I read today about B12 injections being helpful. I called and asked about that so I am waiting to hear back from the doctor. In the mean time, I stated taking sublingual B12 that I got at the grocery store. \n\nFingers crossed that we both recover sooner than later! Hi.  I am fully recovered after a diagnosis date of September 15.  It is hard to be patient when you are effected so seriously, but time is the key healer in Bell's.  Lots of rest, keeping the stress down, and pampering yourself is the best advice I can give.\n\nI watched a lot of videos on YouTube, people doing a video diary of their recovery and I think that helped keep me positive. I was first diagnosed September 22nd. I started medication (prednisone and an antiviral) the very next day for 7 days. I saw some improvement that first week. There was very little improvements on weeks 2 and 3. No medications given to me after that.. But I still tried practicing my speech, eating correctly, and facial movements whenever I could. I did use kinesiology tape on my face for support as needed.. Starting around week 3 I read about B12.  I started taking over the counter B12, B6, and a one a day multivitamin. By week 4, I want to say I am about 85%-90% recovered.  I still feel numbness on the left side of my face.  Slight drooping. But a stranger would not know the difference. Whenever I am tired, I feel the bell palsy act up more. I saw a neurologist by week 4 but she said my recovery as been good so far. My follow up is in 2 weeks to decide where to go or what to do from there. There is hope! Everyone is recovery time will be different. Just make sure to rest, less stress. Thanks for your replies to this. Hearing other stories really does help with this. I am now exactly 2 weeks since diagnoses and this morning I could whistle again. I cannot see much change in my smile but there is muscles working again that were not even working yesterday. Update. \n\nIt is now been 20 days since diagnosis and I am so happy to say I am about 90% back.   \nReading stories here I am aware of relapse and recurrence so I am not taking anything for granted but I feel so lucky that I have had such a speedy recovery.", "Update six months in I am on week 28 and have recovered about 30%. I can make a closed-mouth smile, but not an open-mouth smile, and I still cannot move my forehead or blink. I also have some synkinesis: when I close my eye, my cheek pulls up into a small smile. \n\nOn the day of onset, I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy and began a ten-day course of Valtrex and a seven-day course of 60mg/day prednisone. I also started taking large amounts of vitamin B12, general multivitamins, and turmeric. I also rested completely. On the tenth day, doctors did a Lyme test--the screening test was equivocal, the Western blot confirmation was positive. I did three weeks of doxycycline. Also did acupuncture. On week 8, there had been no improvement, so doctors did an MRI, more blood tests, and a spinal tap. The MRI showed that the facial nerve was inflamed, but the blood and spinal tests showed no sign of any infection. Doctors gave me another three weeks of doxycycline, just to be safe.\n\nOn week 11, I started to get very small amounts of movement back, and I have very slowly improved since then. I also started doing physical therapy once every two weeks. I only started work again on week 13.\n\nMy theory is that the prednisone and the 10-day delay in antibiotic treatment made my situation a lot worse. See (\n\ntl;dr diagnosed with bell's palsy; ten days later diagnosed with lyme disease, did prednisone, antiviral, and doxycycline; did acupuncture, rested, took huge amounts of vitamins and turmeric; still saw absolutely no improvement until week 11; now at week 28 and about 30% recovered; think worse outcome was because I was given prednisone for Lyme-associated palsy and not doxycycline until ten days after onset. I got tested for Lyme disease too. Turned out negative, happily, but I think it is worth testing for unless you live in a concrete and glass box.", "I was told you would enjoy this and to post it here too. Since getting Bell\u2019s, this is what my Animoji looks like.  Just got it today, this made one half of my face smile!  I am glad! :) I needed to find joy in it lol It is like a spitting image of me.  Exactly what I look like when I smile! And I cannot stop winking at everyone either! Do not want my co-workers to get the wrong idea!! ;) Haha man this made me laugh! It is about to be a year in for me in may! Still recovering! Hope everyone recovers quicks! I have a question  For op or just in general?  In general, does it hurt because you cannot blink? Some days yes. \n\nFor me, if I am particularly stressed or over tired my eye feels very dry/irritated because I cannot close it well or at all. \n\nI mean I do not know if it is necessarily a PAIN but it is definitely a strain. Like I feel a similar sensation to a strained muscle in my neck. \n\n", "Easy activities to take your mind off things My wife was diagnosed on Tuesday night. While she still has some eyelid function on her affected side, she is finding it easier to simply keep that eye taped closed. But, many of her common hobbies (video games, knitting, movies etc) are very vision focused and uncomfortable. \n\nShe is on a course of Prednisone and Valaiclovir, which have been absolutely brutal -- consistently nauseas while taking them, and having rising anxiety and agitation episodes. Working with the Dr's to figure out a path forward there, but it is been a huge drag on her emotional reserves.\n\nSo... does anyone have suggestions on simply how to pass the time in the first few days after onset, while you are still getting used to things? I think something easy, not too vision focused, and mildly engaging would really help her, but I have been a bit of a disaster myself and have not found anything yet.\n\nBonus Q: any suggestions on gentle eye tape?  The normal medical eye tape is irritating her eyelid. We have ordered some silicon tape but open to other suggestions, especially anything that is monolid-friendly. For the tape- I Use 3M Nexcare Sensitive Skin tape is really gentle- I have used it for almost 4 years now. Eye patches are also nice for when you want to keep the moisture in but are tired of tape. \n\nAs for activities, depending on if your wife has hyperacusis (if she does certain sounds will be pretty excruciating on her palsy side) old radio plays, podcasts, audio books, etc. Listening to comedians helped with feeling low about it. \n\nGetting lots of rest is important so anything that she finds calming is a good idea. \n\nWishing you all the best! Personally, I do not recommend just having the BP eye taped shut all the time. I taped my eye shut during the nights (until the tape irritated my skin too much, which made me switch to a eye patch padded down with some fabric to help keep my eye shut).\n\nWhen outside, I would also wear an eye patch, but for my everyday living inside I would mostly go without, and then practice blinking a whole lot. I would try my hardest to blink with my afflicted eye, and then use my thumb and index finger to shut it.\n\nLike this, I could easily watch movies, as long as I remembered to do my manual blinks often. I was also able to play a bit of video games, but competitive games were not great for me, since I would forget to blink sometimes.\n\nOh, and use eye drops often. Audiobooks, lots of rest in a dark room", "probably 97% physically recovered...now with the pulse in the ear? I am about 28 days in, feeling pretty well recovered on the physical side, but just today, this loud pulse sound started in my affected ear. It sounds a bit like a squeaky gear or wheel...pretty much in time with my heartbeat. The loudness varies on its own from loud to fairly muffled, but also seems to change if I bear down, or bend over. Like other aspects of BP, it is annoying as hell. A quick google search led me to a ( experiencing the same thing, which made me feel better, but man is it hard to get to sleep.\n\nMy DR. said if I was not 100% by Friday (a few days ago), he would like to get me in for an MRI, which is a bit scary, but I guess it is better to know for sure.\n\nAnyway...hope you are all feeling better.\n\nedit: phew... MRI and MRA came back \"great\".", "Two hours in, sitting in the ER. I may have to join this sub... Three hours ago I was enjoying my Saturday evening. Then I noticed that my smile felt funny. First I looked in the mirror, then I looked online, now I am waiting for a bed in the ER.\n\nUnfurrowed brow, loose lips, lackluster smile, and a weepy weird eye. I hope I got here quickly enough; I liked being able to whistle! Best of luck. Did they put you on prednisone?  That knocks it out for me usually within 3 weeks today's is my first week. on prednisone and aciclovir. plus acupuncture. paracetamol for jaw's pain. hope for the best. Yes, they did. Wait... it can recur?!? \ud83d\ude31 It recurs in 4-14% of patients. Take your meds, do face exercises, and do not worry about it recurring. It is unlikely.\n\nDo you have an eyepatch or similar for when you need to sleep? Also, get some eye salve to protect your eye during the nights. And eye drops. You do not want your eye to dry out during the day.\n\nBest wishes during your recovery :) For what it is worth you will find way more information on the Facebook group. \n\nI got this back in December after a nasty ear infection. Symptoms came on slowly, like yours have, and to that end I have found that people whose symptoms come on slowly tend to have a better prognosis. This is as opposed to some who just woke m up one morning and half their face is fully paralyzed. Now, plenty of hose people heal very quickly as well, it just seems like those with slow symptom onset more consistently have quicker recoveries. I healed fully in 30 days but the left side of my face was fully paralyzed from days 3-14, day 0 indicating first symptom onset. Keep that eye hydrated with fake tears and keep it shut with press n seal, I find it works best as it does not irritate the skin. Please feel free to DM with any questions. Best of luck to you  Thanks! This is a wealth of info I did not know I would need.", "When is it safe to do face exercises I started feeling symptoms at the end of last Wednesday and go diagnosed on Saturday and started taking anti virls and steroids, so it been able a full 7 days, when is it safe to start working my face muscles Any time, just be gentle in the beginning and consult a doctor if you experience pain! When I was diagnosed,  I tried to start immediately. \n\n Obviously I was not able to do much and got tired very quickly,  but I tried.  Still working from home so every hour or so, I would try a few left eye winks and eyebrow raises.  \n\nIt helped me a lot and I saw improvement in a few days. I would say after about 2 weeks, when the acute inflammatory phase is over.", "Bell's palsy with relatively normal resting face? I am newly diagnosed with BP (on steroids as of a couple days ago) and I am just wondering if anyone else out there has had a similar experience. The entire diagnosing was just going to the ER, explaining my experience, showing some facial expressions, and a brief nerve test (push this, follow finger, feel that, etc), then saying it is BP and sending me with prednisone. \n\n\nI would say I probably have a mild/moderate case of BP, and if you are looking at me with my resting face, I do not think you would really be able to tell at all that there is anything wrong (even if you know me). However, I have a lot of weakness and inability to move much of the affected (left) side - e.g. Not much smile action, dribbling trying to drink, cannot purse my lips together, eye can mostly close but still slightly cracks usually (much worse if I try to force it closed like a wink), etc. But just resting I do not really have any significant drooping.\n\nDoes this kind of presentation happen often with BP - is it a full spectrum of non function or is it usually more of the typical paralysis/drooping?\n\nTIA The day of my diagnosis and the day after, I did not have any drooping, although I was pretty high on the BP scale. On day 3 though, my mouth was drooping a bit, and continued to do so until I started seeing progress.\n\nBut I guess if your case is not as severe, you might not get any drooping when sporting a resting face.\n\nBtw, regarding medicine, you only mentioned the steroids. Are you not on penicillin? Also, are you doing face exercises?\n\nGood luck on your recovery :) Nope no penicillin. Seems like around here the recommended course of treatment is steroids for all BP cases with an anti viral added for more severe cases (according to the Dr, everyone I know that has had it, and my research online). Actually had not even read about anyone being given penicillin until I read some posts on this sub. Odd. Though the Dr also seemed to think it was possible my BP could be related to preexisting jaw/neck issues I already have that had flared up badly shortly before the BP showed up... Idk about that, but... *shrugs*\n\nAnd yeah I had already been trying to move my face around a lot through the day, and then as I have been reading more have found more specific exercises to use (found a video with 20 or so different recommended movements). Figured I would go ahead and start them - did them today - but have also heard conflicting info about whether to start right away or to give the nerve a resting period first. Thoughts? \nWe will see about the drooping I guess. I have noticed that it seems like when it is late/I am more tired - or at least when my face is more tired after eating, etc - the weakness seems more prominent than it does in the mornings when I am rested. I imagine the longer the weakness persists, the more my face will reflect it. It is a spectrum. I also had very mild BP, gone for about 7 months now. You could not tell I had anything at all with my resting face, but you could notice it when I laughed/smiled and winked with the affected eye. My eye was closing only about 80% and I had to close the other 20% manually when I went to sleep. \n\nI started on prednisone, then started taking Vitamin B as well. Also started the face exercises right away, and after a week my mom began massaging my face with lavender oil for about ten minutes every night, which really did the difference (not sure if the lavender oil plays any part, but the massage definitely did). \n\nI am 100% cured now, it took about two months to go away. Personally I started the face exercises right away, and I am back to like 99% now.\n\n3 times a day I would take like 15 minutes of time to do the exercises while looking into a mirror. I massaged my face before hand, and \"stretched\" it once I was done with everything. For the exercise, I would for example try my hardest to make a big smile, and then I would help my paralyzed side by moving it with a finger or two so that it mirrored my healthy side. I would hold this for 3-4 seconds while trying my hardest, and then rest for 3-4 seconds. I repeated every exercise 3 times like this. I was always exhausted in my face when I was done, but I started seeing my first sign of progress about 9 days in. I think the drooping is more of an optical illusion. If one side is smiling and the other is not, then the paralyzed side looks droopy.\n\nI have permanent partial paralysis (3+ years) and my face looks normal at rest. Nothing droops except my eyebrow and that is pretty subtle.", "Has anyone else had to deal with bad headaches/migraines with your BP? What helps? My mom got BP near the end of august, and it is been really hard to see her go through this on top of the chronic pain she already deals with. She is been having really awful/debilitating headaches, and I was wondering if anyone else has been dealing with that symptom as well? Ibuprofen and pretty much all OTC medication does not seem to help. Sometimes massages, heating pad on her neck, or robax (muscle relaxant), or Voltaren (topical neck pain medicine) can help to relieve the tension in her neck but most of the time it does not completely fix the problem. I am just trying to do some research to see if I can find anything else to help, wether it is a safe medication, or something non-medical. \n\nWhat helps you deal with your headaches? What helps you find any kind of relief? \n\nAlso, my heart goes out to all of you going through this. It is so unfair. Other than my neck wrap (moist heat) I got no relief. My pain has lessened over the weeks\u2026your mom has been dealing with this for a long time now. I have no answers, but sincerely hope it gets better soon. :) I have had headaches since BP started 2 weeks ago. Part of it is because I could not close my eye and it was itchy and uncomfortable. Another part was because my back and top head muscles were very tense, maybe trying to compensate or generate any movement. It took me a few days to realize this. I tried to consciously relax those muscles. Massages help. Also, as another member recommended, CBD oil can help a lot with pain. I hope it helps! Hello, sorry to hear about your mother. I have been around 12 days in and sometimes the pain is unbearable. I am using CBD oil (5%), which helps with the pain, but also lifts me out of a negative headspace, helps me relax, sleep and keep calm. Maybe for her, it would be even better a more concentrated version if you have that available. \n\nAlso, I had a lot of pain on the side of my face, for that what I have been doing: put a little bag of rice in the microwave and made a hot bag to help relieve the pain. Also, my mother did something which took away the pain for 2-3 days, she made white clay with calendula tea, put it between two gauze sheets, and left it on the side of the face for two hours or until it dries. It seems to \"suck out\" that heat over there. \n\nI usually try to do these natural solutions before going to other drugs. Last night I had to take paracetamol, CBD oil and put a warm bag. It worked well.", "Day 1 after diagnosis Hi everyone,\n\nI was diagnosed yesterday with what they said was a mild case of Bells Palsy.\n\nI did not think anything of my symptoms until I was brushing my teeth and well, it did not go well.\nSo I texted my boss on my way to work and she basically said stop. go. to. the. hospital. now. right.  now. \n\nSo after a very scary couple hours, a lot of hysterical calls to my husband and an ambulance ride to the hospital (as of course a stroke was suspected but then ruled out) I got my diagnosis. They were great to me and said I did catch it fairly quickly.\n\nI got my prednisone and my antibiotics on the go, and my eye taped closed and secured with a medical elastic wrap around my head as I find it more comfortable.\n\nI am having some guilt and just some trouble dealing with possibly not being able to work for a while. I am a supervisor/server at a restaurant so obviously speaking and of course being able to see is important on the job.  My speaking is not the worst, but I am a little self conscious about it as well as some slight eye brow drooping.\n\nWould it be unwise to take the eyepatch of for the duration of my 6-7 hour shift so long as I am taped and closed the rest of my time? \n\nAlso it is been both scary and inspiring reading through everyone else\u2019s experiences with BP, so thank you all. How bad is your blinking? I did not have to use an eye patch or anything of the sort, I just kept going on with my business as usual, because I could blink and close them pretty well. If you feel your eyes too dry you should probably not take the eye patch off. If you do take it off, maybe try putting some eye drops on it. \n\nGood luck for the recovery! I am blinking at about half speed,  and I would say it is closing about 90-95% of the way down. I almost feel like my eye is too watery? Like it is maybe producing tears at a weird rate if the tear ducts are out of wack?\n\nThanks for the reply! Honestly, your case seems a bit like mine. I felt my eye very watery as well. I did not do anything to my eye \u2014 not an eye patch, not eye drops, nothing. And I did not have any issue. So I would say you can totally take it off, but pay attention to your own eye's signs. You would probably be fine just wearing the patch while you sleep since it sounds like a more mild case. Mine was pretty mild but did get worse the first few days even though I started my meds within 24 hours of the first symptoms. I just used gel eye drops during the day (doctor recommended but they were over the counter)  hope you have a speedy recovery! I work indoors, speaking face-to-face with people all day.  I did not wear my patch at work.  I just used my fingers to blink when necessary. YMMV. Thanks for the response! I was the same and started meds pretty quickly. I think starting Thursday im going to try for maybe a short period of time, having drops and maybe an extra eyepatch ready if I feel like I need it! (Maybe the eyepatch will bring in some sympathy tips! Jk jk jk) I think I will give it a try starting Thursday! But will keep some drops and maybe an extra patch with me if needed! \nThanks for the response I think I generally have sensitive eyes, so I think I will try some drops for sure and covered when I can!\nThanks again! Lol! I honestly think I was freaking people out when my eye did not blink...but no one noticed really unless I told them. Nothin wrong with sympathy tips!! Systane Balance eye drops (recommended by my ophthalmologist). I have had Bell\u2019s for 22 years and these drops are awesome. I hardly ever tape during the day anymore. I keep drops with me and make sure I use them a few times a day. Wow, that is unbelievable. I cannot imagine. Thank you so much for sharing it means a lot to me. I will absolutely look for those eyedrops. I did not mention but I am in Canada so I am hoping I can find them here.", "Do I explain my face and if so, how do I do it? I got BP last year during lockdown. My story is the same as those of many others. I was told it would resolve within 6-9 months. \n\nI began seeing improvement within the first three weeks. For the first four months I was making steady progress. Then over the following two months I still made progress but at a slower pace. At the six month mark I was dismayed to see it was not fully resolved. Neither did my face go back to normal after 9 months. My face is droopy and I have synkinesis. \n\nA doctor told me chances are slim that any more recovery will take place. More time has passed and I think she is right. This is my face now. \n\nThe pity party is over. I have accepted the way things are. This is my question for anyone out there. When I meet someone for the first time, do I say something about my facial paralysis? \n\nBecause of the pandemic my social circle has stayed the same and when I go out I wear a mask. But eventually this situation will change. I am not going to explain my face to the Starbucks barista, for example. But I feel like I need to say something to people I will be working with. What should I say? How do I own it? \n\nFor anyone out there who did not get their BP fully resolved, do you say anything to people you meet, especially people you will be talking with for a long enough time that it is obvious something is going on with your face and may need an explanation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr  My BP did not resolve completely so part of my face is still droopy and I have synkinesis. Someday when I meet people in person for the first time and we are not wearing masks, should I say something about why I look the way I look? Hey friend. You are just like me! Except.. I have been this way for 5.. almost 6 years now (That does not mean everyone will end up this way...). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI use humor to cope. I used humor the first time I walked out of the ED with the diagnosis. I was a college student at the time and trying to explain why I was wearing the darkest sunglasses possible and ear plugs to class was always a nightmare to both my professors and my classmates. I started with the humor to cope. I made comments like \"Oh, my face is broken.\" or \"My brain decided to kill off my 7th Cranial Nerve or fun.\" People would give me that awkward laugh like \"what the fuck are you talking about?\" and that would end the conversation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf people kept pushing for actual, realistic answers, I would give it to them straight. I was diagnosed with an idiopathic neurologic disorder that is totally unexplainable, and it broke half of my face. The nerve that controls everything in my face from blinking, and facial expressions, is broken and no one knows why. This means that I often times have extreme sensitivity to light and sound, sometimes I am in pain, and sometimes my mental health is absolutely struggling to stay afloat because nothing is easy when you cannot make facial expressions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now, for new people that I meet, I only tell them enough if they ask based on a few factors.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Is this person in my life for a short term, long term, or just passing by?\n\n2) Is this person someone I want to pursue a friendship or relationship with?\n\n3) Can this person (like a professional) help me with my care, my work, my studies, or something else?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom there I make my decisions. People who are only passing by in the wind and short term acquaintances do not need to know anything. Just tell them its a neurologic disorder or a broken nerve and brush them off. People who are going to be around awhile or can help you? Tell them a bit more with details pertaining to the actual issues you experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy DM's are always open if you need someone. It is tough being one of the 5%ers. I had bells about 10 years ago, and stopped recovering about maybe 10 months in. \nI say I am about 75% recovered. \n\nI do not mention it to anyone unless it comes up in conversation. and when I do, of course they say they never noticed!\n\nbut of course we do. \n\nso I would say try to live your normal life and not let it hold you back, do not make it a thing you have to bring up to new people you meet. Unless it comes up in conversation then I would not worry about it. IF they ask tell them so they understand. I am mainly thinking of people who I will be around for months or years such as a co-worker or a co-volunteer. I expect to be in conversations with them, I expect bantering and joking around. And then I cannot smile or laugh without looking awkward. \n\nI think people are polite and will not say anything but just wonder. I want to take that wondering away.\n\nIf I were to go to a high school reunion though, I am sure everybody I am close to or friends with will ask immediately about my face. I guess I will see how much time I will be spending with that person. If it is Day 3 (or something like that) then I will say \"Hey you might have noticed...\" Are people too polite to ask? Ive only had 4 co-workers ask over the past 5 years among 3 different jobs. Many do not care. Some may not ask due to being polite I would say. However, IF someone does not know and it shows some then they may ask out of concern. I mean I was thinking in my head, \"Am I having a stroke?\" and I started to make a fist with my left hand to make sure. So someone could think that possibly you are having a stroke and are not aware. Hi! I am in the same situation as you. Uni and my workplace are now switching back to in-person and noone has seen me pre-BP. Thank you for your post because i thought i was alone with those thoughts. I am only a month into recovery so my BP is still \u201cfresh\u201d. My family tells me they do not notice it as much anymore but i feel like it is still noticeable especially when laughing. I will address it at work i think because just like you \u201ci want them to stop wondering\u201d. \nI am wishing you all the best :) I hope you make a full recovery! Hi! Thank you for your message :) I am now on day 62 and my BP has healed around 80%. Still a long way to go but I am more optimistic now. I wish you all the best!", "Diagnosed yesterday Does anyone have a recommended way to tape their eye shut for the night? I taped it across the length of my eye (along the eyelashes) with some paper tape, but for the duration before I went to bed the eye was still sorta open since I could see the white of the paper tape. Mildly annoying, just wanted to know if anyone had a better taping method. You can get like a pirate eye patch, I have found that it is way more comfortable than tape. Does that help keep it closed? My worry is that the eye will still be open under and dry out. Thanks for the reply I have not really had issues with my eye drying out, as long as my fan was not directly pointed at it. I have had bells 4 times now, and it is gotten to the point that I rarely even use an eye patch. I only use it if my eye actually bugs me. But a eye patch is definitely the way I recommend, I have tried tape, and it kind of just sucks. Ok, I will try that then. Thanks for taking the time to reply My eye will stay mostly closed at night but I found that if I do not tape it all the way closed,\nIt is red and irritated the next day. I have tried multiple ways of taping since I was diagnosed in October. Currently, I use thin paper tape and use three small strips vertically across the lid.  I make sure I pull the lids tight so they are shut completely So far my eyes are not in such a state. It does sound quite uncomfortable to pull it tight like that. Thanks for the advice, I will consider it if necessary. Yeah it is not too fun but I also wear an eye mask which helps keeps everything in place and my eye feels rested when I wake up. I ended up tossing the tape and opting for an eyepatch and some night time eye drops. It is like spreading petroleum jelly in your eyeball, and it always took a few minutes to clear out of my eye in the morning, but I never had any issues. \n\nGood luck They make a wide paper tape, and a narrow paper tape. I use the wide one. Pull off the strip about 2\" long, and then close my eyelid with two fingers, as if making the \"peace\" sign. I use my other hand to place the end of the tape at the very top of my eyelid, almost where it touches the eyebrow, and then draw it all the way down across my cheek. \n\nTook a couple nights to get used to, but ultimately it was the best thing for my eye. Prior to that, I would just close it with my fingers at night and hope for the best. I used GenTeal eye lubricant and then put the band-aid type eye patch over my eye. Walgreens has them. Kept my eye shut and well lubricated all night. at the recommendation of someone else on reddit, i bought silicone tape - totally worth it. much easier on your skin. \n\ni have found the best way to tape your eye is to \n\n1) secure the top half of the tape on your eyelid\n\n2) put your eye ointment in\n\n3) pull your upper cheek up; secure the bottom half of the tape - when your cheek relaxes, the tape will pull tight. for the night you should get a watch glass bandage. it prevents you eye from drying out and dirt comng into you eye. if you just want to tape the eyelid down maybe try a tape used for kinesio taping, its very sticky but also stretchy(?)...couldnt find a word in the dictionary. and use eyedrops during the day, in the night, always... Get well soon. :-) I found 3M Nexcare sensitive skin tape to be really great and have been using it for a few years now- most pharmacies carry it and it is also available on Amazon.", "Has anyone had multiple episodes? I was diagnosed with bp September 2015. I would say I almost completely recovered but my right eyelid droops a little and my right side always feels a little tense. Anyways, since then I get minor episodes where I feel numbness and droopiness on the right side of my mouth, face and eyelid. It usually does not last as long as my first episode did but this has happened at least three times this year and four last year. I had one today and the strangest part is I had a panic attack and my right eye would not open. I plan on seeing my doctor but I was just wondering, has anyone dealt with anything similar? I have had it twice. Once on each side. First time I was 17 or 18 and second time was about 3 years after. Been over a decade without any issues. Both times lasted about two to three weeks and then cleared up without any follow on symptoms", "My Story of Bells palasy 13 years ago I was 13 years old when I got left sided bells palasy.I had no idea about this and neither did my parents. I live in India and it happened during monsoon.I woke up one morning in August month  and was not able to brush my teeth properly and had a hard time spitting out water. \nI did not inform my parents and went on with it in the school. In school I made fun of my face with my friends and they were amazed seeing this .By this point of time I had no idea what has happened.\nWhen I came home from school I told my parents and then they took me to a doctor. \nDoctor checked me and informed that you have to wear some spectacle otherwise something might hit the eye, as my left eye was also not closing properly and was responding very weirdly.At this point I realised something is wrong.\nHe gave me some medicines which were some steroids and suggested to have regular phisiotherepy sessions.\n\nThen my regular session of physiotherapy started. Since I lived in an area where phisiotheripist were not readily available my father did those sessions by himself by learning from the books.\nI went to a big hospital also a week later while my original medicines were in progress just to be sure that what that doctor has said is true and we are on the right track with medicines.\nThere I remember some intern doctors were called by the head  doctor and to study my face which made me realise that it was not so common thing to have . \nThe medicine I took was for some weeks (do not completely remember). And the physiotherapy sessions for 2-3 months ensured around 90-95% recovery.\nI was told that there could be some side effects of the steroids related to weight gain . I was a skinny kid so was happy with that. But since I used to ride a lot of bikes then ,my weight did not increase but my height increased significantly .\nOver all still I have some effects on left face which I could see were not completely recovered like slightly skewed smile  . But only I see them since I know it. To others who do not know anything about it it does not occur.\n\nI just wanted to share my story as I have not told it to anybody ever . Even my closest friends do not know about it. Only my parents and my brother knows.\nTo all who are fighting everything will be fine . This is a great small community which will help you in each and every step. Thank you for sharing your experience with us. It takes a lot of courage to talk about a period in your life that was not easy. My respect. Glad you have healed. Have a wonderful day.", "Exercises I should do for my pucker I am 98% healed, 4 months in my pucker is not coming forward but the overall shape is there What exercises shall I do to help push it forward?? I am doing quite a few already but if u have any more suggestions please leave them down below \nThank you I broke my jaw and needed surgery which effected my smile/nerves and the DR. suggested I practice blowing kisses to myself in the mirror. You might already do this but it helped me get a smile back. Wish I could be of more assistance I already have my smile back thank god, it is just my pucker which is taking soooooo long I will try the kisses I only train one side of my lips u see \ud83d\ude02 thank u for replying xxx try holding a spoon as symmetrically as you can with your lips. Just a few seconds without forcing too much, release and repeat. In the shower I fill my mouth with water and try to swish it around with out it spilling out. This has helped with strengthens this muscles and helping out those nerves My physical therapist has me using coffee stirrers to drink though. Also, blowing balloons.

Been a scary few days as I thought my partner was having a stroke but it is just been diagnosed as Bell\u2019s Palsy.\n\nHe is been given medication by the doctors, had one session of physio and I have given face massages since it happened 3 days ago.\n\nIs there anything I can do to help? Or is there anything you guys think helped your recovery?\n\nThank you I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy a couple months ago. \n\nIf I had a partner to make things easier I would suggestion making smoothies or other liquid based diet for a couple weeks. I would be mindful of the noise level since nose really bothered me (piercing my ears). Encourage resting as much as often. \n\nKnow that it hurts to talk a lot so do not get frustrated if your partner is on the quieter side. \n\nEncourage doing muscle exercises (YouTube has a couple good videos on this) search facial muscle exercises for Bell\u2019s palsy. \n\nI used magnesium lotion and that seemed to help with pain and when I massages my face.\n\nEncourage your partner to express how they feel and maybe start a journal. I know the first couple days it was hard on me and I journaled and documented my journey which helped a lot. \n\nIf their eye is not shutting (encourage them to tap it shut at night and wear an eye patch during the day).\n\nKnow that at night they most likely will not want to cuddle (this was normal for me because half of my face hurt and I just did not want to be touched but it can be different for everyone).\n\nIf your partner had to drive anywhere I would recommend you driving for them for a couple days, their vision may be off. \n\n\nMore importantly just be supportive and stay positive. I took my medication strictly as instructed and it went away within a few weeks.  I think that was the most important factor for my quick recovery.\n\nAs for partner help, my sweet husband was super helpful by helping me with eye drops and eye ointment (my eye would not close all the way or blink) every morning and night.  There was not much else he could do, but he did give me a lot of affirming words because I was worried about how dumb I looked.\n\nMy husband makes me laugh a lot, and the first sign of life came back to my mouth after doing a lot of laughing.  I did not have any pain though, so I am not sure this is the best advice for everyone.\n\nI know it is a helpless feeling to not be able to do much, but being supportive, following doctor\u2019s instructions, and lots of patience will get you all to the finish line. \nHey, thank you for the advice, much appreciated.\n\nI have been doing research into different massage techniques but will look into magnesium lotion as well.\n\nWe have been taping the eye at night and been using drops throughout the day when it feels a bit dry.\n\nI hope you have a speedy recovery! If you have heard of love languages, be as loud and expressive of love in the way that they need it because this is when they need it most. \n\n\n\n\n\nA few other notes\u2014 lots of hugs, positive encouragement and extra patience.", "Can I see a regular Dr for meds? I just got BP 2 days ago. Was looking fir a neurologist as I read a Dr would most likely just refer you to one. All in my area are booked, soonest I could get with a neurologist is June 22.  And I read it is good to get with a Dr within a few days of onset.\n\nI do not have insurance and currently unemployed so I would rather not go to a regular Dr if he is not going to prescribe mens and just refer me to a neuro. \n\nAnything else I should do, or take?  Been taking vit c, zinc, b12 since I hear it could be a viral infection cause. I would go to the emergency and get meds there. You can go to  regular dr. go to the regular doctor to get anitvirals and prednisone. go asap. Go to a doctor ASAP if u r hurting for money go enroll in healthcare.gov it is dirt cheap for unemployed You do not need a neurologist. I got mine from urgent car. As the other person said. Go ASAP. There is better chances of recovery the earlier you get the prednisone Definitely a regular doc. My regular doc renewed my prescription for antiviral. I did not see a neurologist at all and my doc said if I do not improve in 30 days, then he will order an MRI.\n\nSee if the regular doc can prescribe B12 shots for you   since CVS offers B12 shots (via prescription). My acupuncturist recommended that in the first month in addition to the supplements you mentioned. \n\nMassages to the face too. That helps a lot for me. My wife is an ER nurse, I am a BP patient, and we have literally never heard of someone being sent straight to a neurologist in response to a BP event. A neurologist would just send you to a primary care doc, so you might as well start there: with your primary care physician, or whoever fills that role in your situation (emergency/casualty/urgent care/hippie health clinic/student health center). They will do the thing that should happen first: put you on anti-inflammatories and antivirals. (The latter seems to vary by culture, but a large majority of the people who show up here report that they were put on antivirals.) This is one of those deals where the quicker you get treatment the better the outcome, so... get there post-haste. Like: stop reading this, put on your mask, and get out the door.\n\nBP is a diagnosis of exclusion: you are only diagnosed with BP after they have excluded all of the other known possibilities that have similar/identical symptoms but a completely different cause. The number of known possibilities changes with time, so even when you are diagnosed with BP the possible causes are not completely known. What they do know is: something caused inflammation in the facial nerve; nerve conduction was blocked by the swelling; and after taking a look at you they ruled out stroke, tumor, shingles, Lyme disease, and sarcoidosis.\n\nThis is why sooner = better: to make sure you do not have the things that *are not* BP. But it is a good idea to start addressing the symptoms sooner even when it is 'just' BP.

I just discovered this subreddit and was wondering if anyone has gotten BP as a child? I am 19 years old and I got BP when I was around 3, so I have been living with it for about 15 years as it is permanent for me. I got it from an ear infection and the doctors told my parents that I was the youngest they would ever seen someone get PB and that I would probably never recover since I got it at such a young age. I did slightly recover (to maybe ~60%?) in the months after it happened, but then it just never got better than that. Just wondering if there is anyone out there like me!  I was born with it. I am 23, and I do not think I have had any change.  Yup. Got it at 3 from an ear infection too. ", "Bell's Palsy - Long way to go  I have severe Bell's Palsy and it is been 6 months. The little bit of progress I have made has given me hope. And, I do not think about the condition that much anymore. However, I am still dealing with some things.\n\n*Still cannot blink or close my eye without effort  \n*I can smile a tiny bit, but my lower lip still cannot move.    \n*I still cannot drink without dribbling. Cannot drink from bottles at all.  \n*The paralyzed muscles have contracted a bit, adding to asymmetry.\n\nFor me, progress started with my mouth, not my eye. My eyebrow can move the tiniest bit, which is exciting. I can scrunch up my face, which is awesome. Except the wrinkles are back (who cares).\n\nEmotionally, I am much better. I actually have gone on dates and have been sexual again. I realize a minor facial paralysis is not the end of the world. Once I felt confident again, I went for it.\n\nWhat is amazing is a tiny bit of improvement makes a huge difference. My friends have commented on it. But in reality, I am only about 20% better.\n\nI hope this helps others wondering what it is like to have a severe case. It does get better. \n", "Day 7 with Bell\u2019s Palsy  Wow, you have far more control than I did day 7. And I actually made a 99% recovery within a month.\n\nHang in there and keep doing face exercises to regain control :)", "Recently diagnosed. Determine to make this terrible experience the best thing that has ever happened to me. At first I was devastated. To be honest i still have not stopped crying but I feel like this is my rock bottom and from here I can change my life. I have said this before but something about this time feels different.\n\nI know this illness can just be random. A reaction to a virus or stress. But I know in my heart this happened to me because of my body finally quit after 24 years of abuse. \nI have suffered bulimia since I was 12 and extreme exercise addiction for a decade that has gotten out of control this last year.\n\nI have had other warnings. My heart is damaged, I had a TIA stroke, I faint all the time. But despite this  I thought I was special. Above the doctor's cautions and medications and advice.i literally thought I was an evolved human that could withstand what others could not.  Before this happened I was throwing up hours daily and exercising hours in-between that. I had felt weird tinglings in my face and neck and head and just off and completely run down. I had not slept properly for days in the lead up and I thought maybe I was going to have a heart attack. See I  always thought my ED would take me cleanly and I would just drop dead and not have any repressions.\n\nWhen this happened it was different. As vain as it is i could ignore my damaged heart. I could ignore a enlarged pupil and TIA stroke. But I cannot ignore my face. Vanity. But also my identity. How the world reacts to me and interacts with me and I them. I work in a gym also. I deal with people and image all day every day. \n\nMy world ended, but, then I woke up and something had clicked. A weight lifted. I have tried my whole life to be perfect and did not appreciate my body. Now I would give anything to be how I was. Now I look at my old self and do not see the flaws but see someone who was amazing and who I want back.\n I cannot do anything about my face. The ball is not in my court. I do not have to apologize for not living up to what I feel I should look like anymore. \nToday for the first time ever I only exercised very lightly and I made myself an actual dinner. This was a massive thing for me. I have never plated up dinner since I remember. I cried the whole time not because I was afraid (Lol I could not taste it anyway because palsy \ud83e\udd23) but rather  I cried because it was such a big deal for me and not once did the voices from the last two decades tell me to get rid of it. It was like my ED was gone. Silent for the first time in forever. He betrayed me in the worst way I never expected and now I am going to do everything in my power to return to that person I can now see with the  prespective of a frozen face by doing the right things and staying positive.\nSo yes. I am going to make this worst experience the best experience. Something like this had to happen. \nSorry for the bad spelling and grammar. I had a lot of thoughts. Go you! Bell\u2019s palsy it tough but it sounds like you have already been through such a rough time. \nYou can do this! If it ever gets tough, we will all be here for you. You have discovered the thing that many Bell's Palsy patients have not realized.  We are blessed. Stripped of our vanity, we have been given an opportunity for a \" time out\" from this world's standards. This allows us to do introspection, which you have done. It is like when the forest rangers burn part of an area to allow new growth. They get rid of the things already there to allow new plants the opportunity to develop.  Our growth is a mental, spiritual and emotional one. Once your appearance is returned, you will carry your new perspective with you.  Please use your growth through this experience to help others. I felt like self care and pampering help Ned recover the most.  I think you are going to do even better.  You got this. I had it for 4 weeks and spent the entire time laughing about it to the point of the other side cramping up from laughter. I think it made the broken side jealous and want to join the party \ud83e\udd74 Aw thank you guys so much. I have never posted on Reddit before just read it lol but I needed to post about this. Thank you for your support even though I do not know you. It is quite a nice comforting feeling to know you have been there and you understand. Thank you! This is so true. 100%. It is like I have been given the chance to look in on myself and my life from an outside perspective. I have always appreciated others before but I have always been so cruel and demanding of myself. I never expected to find self love looking my worst! Thanks you! Hahaha that is the best. Are not no party like a balls palsy party. I have to admit every time I drink I spend ages laughing at how rediculous it is. \ud83e\udd23 God bless you, love. you realize how much a smile meabs, all other people take it for granted. now that i got back my smile, i call it the 1 million $ smile. it worth that much to me. good luck on your journey to recovery! Thank you! And so much. I cannot wait to smile again. It is such an important part of communication and expression. I will never take for granted smiling with people again. \ud83d\ude0a I am on day 25 and I wish I could get positive about it. I have lost a lot of weight. I think I just need someone to talk to. You can talk to me If you need to. I am only so far on day 4 so I am still navigating all of this in the early days. \nTrying to stay positive though and keep learning from this has kept me afloat. And staying super busy. My house has never been so clean! \nI am still in the optimistic stage thinking it will be two weeks and improve. But I know when I hit that two weeks if I do not improve its going to be deveststing. Yeah that is what happened to me. When I hit say 21 (3 weeks) with zero improvement, it sent me spiraling in worry. I am trying to stay positive but I moved 3000 miles away from anyone I know - so lots of FT. Pronouncing my P\u2019s and B\u2019s is so hard. I also bought a metal straw to bring with me everywhere - since I cannot drink properly. Oh I know. I work in a gym as a coach! I am so excited to say burpees \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I think you need to stay positive still. From all my research a lot of people see improvement about day 30 also. Have you tried acupuncture? Has your taste come back? Again my non medical expert research tells me that if your taste comes back there is a good chance you will recover. Bells Palsy though the hardest thing I have ever been through changed who I am, and how I see things and I am thankful for the experience. i am on day 7 of symptoms onset with no obvious improvement yet  - i actually have Ramsay Hunt, which is apparently a little less optimistic, recovery-wise, but my dad sent me this text, which reminded me of your thoughts as well - reflecting on how a health scare throws off ones sense of self - sometimes - often! - for the better! \n\nhe wrote this: Where something destroys equilibrium in ones own body, especially one\u2019s health, everything else \u2013 psyche, sense of self, faith, hope, sense of purpose and future \u2013 has to reassemble and reintegrate. \n\nlet us reassemble and reintegrate!! That is amazing! Thank you for that. I love it! I am glad you seem to have recovered now! And to have come out even stronger on the other side. This is my goal! This is a colossal load of horseshit.   \n\n\nI cannot eat, and I am dribbling like an elderly bulldog. Omg. Grow up! Stop whining. \u270b I did grow up. That is why I have four hours of Zoom meetings per day, which are as humiliating as they are physically painful.\n\nGet a life and stop commenting on random stranger's reddit posts. Stranger, it is supposed to be a temporary situation. My mother had a severe case of it after my brother died. (You are not supposed to bury your children.) Things will get better. It is a waiting game. Hang in there! And, I apologize if I upset you. \ud83d\ude21", "BP for about 2 years Can I still take steriods if my bp is about 2 years already? Pls advise Thanks because that is an unusual situation I think you may want to ask a doctor - lately a lot of virtual visits with doctors have gotten cheaper/easier for short questions like that Thanks for your advise \ud83d\ude09 I also suggest a doctor, but I do not think steroids will help you now.  The point of the steroid is to stop the inflammation that damages the facial nerve.  2 years later, that nerve is just dead now.  You might speak to your doctor about a medication that might help you re-grow a nerve? It must be taken within 3 days of the onset of your bells palsy to be effective, sorry :(.   I missed out too.", "Looking for advice Two days agos I thought I was having a stroke, was working my shift till it was over had a pain in the back of my neck/head on the left side and my left eye was twitching so after work off the the hospital after CT scan found out I was not dying to be told I have BP. Felt my life come 180, given prednisone and valacyclovir and told to see a neurologist still waiting to make a appointment. I been taking my meds but now have numbness in mouth difficult to eat and nose with collapsed nostrils making hard to breathe. Next day here I am back at work at my job trying to figure how to get back on track as fast as I can since I am the only one to support my family no one else is able to work.\n\nThanks for any advice, I need all I can get. Start taking vitamin b12, get a lot of rest, do not try and strain yourself for movement, Gabapentin helps if you have pain while trying to sleep. It gets better, good luck! Have moist heat heating pad for your face\nTry not to be stressed eat healthy\nDont exercise your face too early to avoid synkinesis\nDo face massages \nSee a physical therapist Thanks will take b12, sucks cannot take time off, I do not get paid medical leave at my job. Thanks, I eat healthy, and do not smoke or drink. I regularly workout, but stress come with being the only person in my family that works. You really cannot rush this. Seems like you got the meds early on, which is good. It is going to get worse before it gets better. So just be ready for that. If you work outside, I recommend getting an eye patch and eye gel. I even used the gel right before sleeping and it helped my eye not dry out. Thanks, I am looking for a good eye patch but ordered a simple one from online will show up in about 3 or 4 days. I work as a engineer for multiple hotel casino resorts, so long weird hours working in hotel rooms, casino floor, convention areas, network servers, automation systems, and programming. Staring at a PC screen seems to be the worst. Just got off work five hours ago and getting ready to go back in since I get a minimum 8 to 10 hours off between shifts.\n( I work on a PC 12 - 16 hours per day and this helped a lot when I had BP. It will keep your eye from drying out and you can see through it. Makes life a lot easier. The downside of taping your eye all the time is eventually the tape begins to tear the thin skin around your eye when you pull it off. This \"moisture chamber\" makes it so you do not have to tape your eye.\n\n(\n\nAlso consider buying a pair of swim goggles for taking a shower. Taking a shower with your eye taped up is a pain in the ass, and after awhile putting on the goggles just became another part of taking a shower.\n\nI only got prescribed the prednisone, and I was back to being able to eat, blink, and close my mouth in about 5 - 6 weeks. My taste buds are still a little messed up, but they are getting better slowly. Good luck!\n\nEdit: Oh, and one more thing. Buy two kinds of eye drops. The regular kind for daytime, and \"gel\" drops for night. The gel drops will make it so you cannot see clearly, so do not use those for working on the PC. I got the Systane \"balance\" drops (bottle with purple label) for during the day, and the systane \"gel\" drops (bottle with green label) for the night time. Go get tested for Lymes Disease just to be safe. It is a common cause of BP and there is a whole separate medication for clearing that up. My BP was the reason I caught my Lymes early and was able to clear it up over a 2 week period Hi - put eye gel in at night and tape your eye closed - white or clear medical tape (over thin tissue or cotton strip so tape only sticks at two ends) works. You need to keep dust out and moisture in.  Scotch tape will work in a pinch. Plan on doing this for the first two weeks or until you can consistently keep your eye closed tight at night. It will prevent the eye from drying out. Any patch will work until you get the one you ordered.  Gently stimulate the muscles in your face and behind your ear with your fingertips - frequently throughout the day. You need to wake up the nerves originating behind your ear that fan out across your face on whatever side has BP (did I read correctly on your left side?). Today, it might hurt to put soft touch behind your ear but as time progresses you will want to daily have someone - a professional or friend or family  - reinvigorate the nerves in your face with touch, massage and acupuncture. Identify the places on your head where nerves exit bone plates and gently tap, with clean fingers, along the route of the nerve.  After a few weeks (Do not do this too early) you will want to have mirror time to watch your face move and imagine it move where it cannot and should. You can get muscle tone back if you are patient and diligent and spend months doing daily mirror facial movements - again wait a few weeks on facial exercise - but do massage now... Thanks, will order those and swim goggles. Thanks, I have been going easy but doing a few face exercises eye brow and smiling. Dr ask if I traveled outside the state recently which was no, no tick bites. Take it you had to do a lumbar puncture to find out. Nope my local doctor saw me after my BP had gone away and then come back and he said I am going to start you on Lyme medicine because there is no downside to taking it and then had me go get a blood test to confirm or deny because I am in NY so ticks are very common. I never found a tick bite either but that is definitely what it was", "Electrical stimulation Hi everyone! I was recently diagnosed last Friday 08/20 with Bell\u2019s palsy after having a virus. I was able to catch it super early as in got the steroids the first day I noticed my mouth unable to pucker and my eye unable to blink. I was even able to see a neurologist within a couple hours of noticing it and now I am off the steroids and antiviral and seeing improvement. My physical therapist is only using a electrical stimulation device on me and facial exercises no massage I am wondering if this could cause me issues later? I highly highly highly encourage you to research electric stimulation before you continue. Like, the biggest BUYER BEWARE notice. I went through Electric Stim and it was an experience that I do not wish on anyone. I was talking to a PT (on a romantic level) and discussing some pasts. He told me that they are taught to never ever ever do electric stimulation on the face and head due to the safety risks it involves with electricity being \\*\\*that close\\*\\* to the brain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease please ask more questions and do more research before you continue. From my experience, It was not worth it and did more harm than good. So all I can really offer you and encourage you to do, is proceed with caution, with second opinions, with all of the information you can get your hands on. I do not want you to end up like me with permanent synkinesis, trigeminal neuralgia, and on seizure medications because electric stimulation sounded like a good idea.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuyer beware. Wow okay thank you so much. I have done three sessions so far with him but I think I will get a second opinion before I return! This means absolutely NOTHING, but I bought my own TENS kit and slapped some electrodes on my face.  I know nothing about TENs.  It hurt, and I could not even get the muscles to move, so it just felt like a painful waste.\n\nMaybe the experience with a professional would have been different. Hi, thanks for saving me the trouble to ask. My neurologist recommended me electric stimulation, but my physio (also a friend of my mom's) said that it was not necessary as my prognosis was pretty good. I wanted to know if anyone has done an electric stimulation and if it helps,  but reading the comments, I think I will listen to the physio P.S. I dunno if this helps, but apart from the face exercises, I have also been doing the exercises to relax ur face from the theatre/drama club, as well as image training (my physio encouraged it too).. Like imagining myself to grin with both sides even though only one side is visible.\n\nI have started noticing a minor twitch in face muscles now. I read thta electric stimulation only be done with a pro because  there is  a decent chance to develop sinekinesis, aka muscle fatigue due to nerves short circuiting. And I definitely developed synkinesis.  Was it from my feeble attempts at e-stim? No idea. I only tried it a handful of times, for no more than a few minutes, but maybe I ruined my face! That is good advice not much of an actor and to be quite honest have a little bit of \u201cresting bitch face\u201d normally but definitely worth a shot! I was in drama club in college, but u can easily find the face exercises  on youtube. I also have a resting bitch face, but I work in customer service so forcing myself to smile on command is literally a part of my job,  lmao. I did massage for awhile(before Covid) and my rmt/acupuncturist suggested using an acupuncture pen called Pointer Plus. I did not start using this until I had already experienced some synkinesis and had was about 8 months into my Bell\u2019s palsy with the first 3 months of no movement, the and next 3 months of minimal movement. \n\nIt helped me so much that I purchased my own. I find it helps with stiffness as it causes the muscles to move. I also found that I get movement back after sessions on occasion. It has both intensity and sensitivity controls so I keep the sensitivity high and the intensity quite low. I have been using it for a little over 3 years now. \n\nI have not had any adverse effects from using it. Only positives to say about it. I cannot speak to anyone else\u2019s experience and it is quite different from the TENS machines from what I have seen. That is great I heard so much positives on acupuncture! Even Angelina Jolie used it! I think mine is more electric current related but I am only 10 days out from original diagnosis and three sessions in on the electric stim and my smile is pretty close to normal and my eye can sometimes blink on its own. so my fear is that I will lose progress if I stop but I am also terrified of synkesis It sounds like you are progressing quite well! Tbh, if you are only ten days out and are already improved this much, you are probably in the 80% that recover fully within three weeks to three months. \n\nIf I were in your shoes I would probably just be focusing on getting lots of rest and eating good food. Maybe acupuncture- but I always have time for acupuncture as it is helped me with a lot of things :) Likely your nerve was only a little damaged and so it is able to recover quickly. \nKeep us posted :) I will thanks so much!!", "Will my eye ever blink normally again? 12 weeks in, everything almost back to normal with the exception of my eye (not back up to speed with the other while blinking). I cannot help but to laugh although, I am getting a little sick of accidentally winking at people in public! \ud83d\ude09 Anyone have any tips to get back to a full blink?  I had BP in 2014 and my eye still does not blink like it did before. \ud83d\ude09 12 weeks is not that long so do not give up! My facial exercises and acupuncture helped me the most. Thank you!!  6 months in and struggling with eye dryness that impacts my work (on pc).  Hang in there.  Thank you! My eye took a while to \u201ccatch up\u201d to the other one but nearly two years later it is totally fine (and has been for a long time!) so do not worry too much \ud83d\ude0a", "Question about recovery and symptoms I was diagnosed about a week ago now and I am almost completely recovered.  I know I am lucky.  But, with that I have been waking up and my eyes are always sore, sensitive to light and because of this I have a constant head ache.  I also get vertigo or a cloudy feeling ... it is weird and hard to describe.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar?", "After 4 month of BP i finally regaining my face back!  I almost surrender and choose to just ignore it. The first few weeks are painful and i had the therapy where my face got small electrocuted. Those therapy seems useless at first but now i see that it had some good effect\n\nI also did some Intermittent Fasting for the past 2 month and did work out in the gym like 5 days a week\n\nKeep optimistic guys, some of your efforts might be not makes any noticable improvement but just keep doing it and over time things will get better You look great Yay!! Happy for you! Thank you for posting! I have been pretty bummed lately and have lost hope at times. Good to see positive things! Thank you. I am going on 10 weeks without a change. That gives me hope. Thank you for sharing! You look great. It took me the same amount of time to see a change. At 6 months out now, I look pretty normal too, if I do a close lipped smile.", "Eye patch to recommend? Diagnosed this week. I have been taping eye at night and using petrolatum &amp; mineral oil ointment prior to tape. Wondering if anyone has found a patch to help. Having difficulty getting eyes taped fully shut", "Girlfriend just diagnosed with bells palsy. Dont know what to do to help? My girlfriend was diagnosed with bells palsy last night i have no idea what to do for her. Ive been googling the disease and the 60mg prednisone she been prescribed but that is just stressing me out more. I hope google is making the side effects sounds worse than they are. Im trying to keep my cool around her and not let her know how worried i am. I think shes pretty scared too but is trying too keep her cool about as well. Any advice or knowledge from first hand experience is greatly appreciated as google makes this sound scary as fuck.(sorry about the language) It is more annoying then scary and usually goes away on its own after a few weeks. Do not stress it will most likely pass Do not treat her differently. Of course be kind and understanding with the fears of doctors, outcomes, etc. but do not treat her differently. Do not stop loving her because of a medical diagnosis. Do not stop holding her hand, it is not contagious. Do not stop making her smile or laugh. Adapt to her new and temporary physical needs while still fulfilling the emotional needs as well.  My bad wasnt worried about the emotional part. Got that covered. More worried about medical needs and treatment maybe various causes I would say just take it as it comes. There is no saying she is going to get all of the symptoms or how much they will affect her so just try to help her keep her stress levels low and that she gets rest. Make sure she has drops/gel for her eye and tape for it at night.  Googling too much ends up being a bad thing. Adding stress on top of everything else is not good for either one of you!\n\nI second the eye drops/gel and a patch. My husband helped out a lot with reminding me of my pills and facial massage. Being supportive is the best thing to do! I get it. I do. I am one of those that will never have function back. They do not know my cause. I have seen 3 neurologists, and an oncologist. Nothing. Nada. My physical needs are not as demanding as my emotional ones at this point. Imagine being 22 (now 23) and being told that I will never regain full function. That Is a bit of a kick to the face (metaphorically).  But anymore it doesnt matter because the person who loves me, loves me for how I look now- crooked smile and all. He gets I will have bad days with pain and whatever but the greatest gift he ever gave me was just treating me as if I am normal but with more understanding that some days are painful.  If it does self heal after three weeks (I have been told 80% do) just settle in that you may be in for 6-12 month journey.  The best thing for me was to get to a physical therapist that did stimulation.  I ended up buying one of these:  \n\nWhether or not it was actually fixing things or the healing occurred naturally no one can know for sure.\n\nI would relax and give it about a month.  The main thing I was told that if one eye will not close completely make sure to use an OTC lubricant (not drops think more like vasoline for the eye) and to tape it shut.\n\nI am not a doctor so take this all for what it is worth - get to a neurologist. I have got Bell's so I will give my view.  First few weeks are hard, she should rest loads. I got angry quote a lot because I struggled to get used to my face and voice. 3 months in and I am less self conscious.  My eye is better than it has been. My face is still wonky but I have no real pain or discomfort.\nThe pain went after about a month. It was horrible but you just have to ride it out.  Get three types of eye drops. First, the thin cheap stuff to wash out the eye. The cruddy stuff that develops overnight will be washed into the eye by the thicker drops you use to add lubrication. Wash it out before you put in something like Systane. Use something like Systane to keep the eye from drying out. The third type is something like GenTeal Tears. I used the Extreme type and had excellent luck. A drop at night before I put on the patch kept my eye happy all night long, and a drop during the day is really soothing. A good pair of wraparound sunglasses are a good idea when you are outside or in the car. They will help keep the dust and crud out of her eye. Eye patches at night are also a must. I put on the patch so that it held my eye closed, and added tape to keep it from coming loose during the night. Getting it right took some practice. Eating is a real trick for the first week or so. The \"Jaw Wired Shut\" cookbook is downloadable and has some good recipes. I was on a basically liquid diet for nearly two weeks. Drinking a hamburger through a straw is quite an experience. I had to thin it with beef broth. She will be very concerned about her looks. Tell her is mind over matter. Those that matter do not mind. As for the Prednisone, 60mg is not that heavy a dose. The neurologist I saw said 100mg is normal. The only side effect I had was a slightly increased appetite, but that could have been a side effect of the liquid diet. The doctor should have prescribed an antiviral. You might want to check on that. All in all, it is aggravating as all get out, but it is workable and survivable. If she lost sensation in that part of her face, tell her to prepare for some pain when the sensation returns. She may also feel twitching, something that resembles a facial cramp, and some tingling. Those are good signs and mean that the nerve is healing. Put tape and bendy straws in your car. It is frustrating to be dieing of thirst and not have a bendy stra on hand.", "Diagnosed today, throat and tongue pain? I had an achey ear for a few days that progressed to muffled hearing, swollen lymph nodes, and a sore throat on one side. I went to an urgent care yesterday and was told I just had fluid behind my eardrum but no infection. This morning woke up unable to fully move half my face. Went straight back to the urgent care and was given prednisone 60mg for 7 days.\n\nWhat is bothering me a lot is pain with swallowing, pain in that ear, and I have developed a bunch of inflamed taste buds and canker sores on my tongue. Is this related? Or just bad luck maybe combined with the stress and weakened immune system? Jeeze. I am sorry. That sounds tough. I had pain in my ear but I had an ear infection. It sounds like you need to just keep in contact with your Dr. Good luck! Wow. Sorry about your experience. Mine was much less painful than that. I just finished day 10 of prednisone. I also was on an antiviral. I hope you have that. \n\nIt will probably get a little worse before it gets better. Just be patient, get rest, cover the eye that is affected and you will start to get better. \n\nRest is important here. Do not work if you do not have to. ", "On day 12 and sooooooo tired Anyone else? Started getting noticeable movement on my cheek on day 10 with slight improvement every day. \n\nBut since I have started to regain movement I have gotten to sleepy and tired. I took a full week off from work last week but back at it this week. I have been spending my lunchtimes taking a nap instead of eating. (Obviously I still eat but just not at lunch when it is ok to be offline) I slept a lot more than usual, but also on purpose.  I was aiming to get the full 8 hours at all costs and naps on top of it.  I feel like all the sleep and self care was a huge help to healing. I have level 5 Bell\u2019s palsy and for the first three months I was exhausted. I was sleeping all night, awake for two hours and then having to sleep for the next two and so on until bedtime. That was how most days went for me, I essentially was off work for those three months. It was not a regular tired either- I call it palsy tired- where either I go to sleep or I pass out- there was no arguing with it and I still get it from time to time. But usually that is  either preceded or followed by some improvement to my face, however small at this point. (3.5 years in) \n\nI hope that yours clears up quickly- it sounds like you are on the right track with movement happening already- get all the rest you can. Take care :) I think being tired is very normal while affected by BP.  I do not sleep alot but when i was having my episode last summer, I slept ALOT.  I was also told it was brought on by stress, so I was trying to sleep to relieve my stress levels.  \n\nI have noticed i have been more tired than I have been in the past since I got affected.  I am trying to not ignore the tiredness and give in to sleep if and when I can more often than I did in the past when I used to fight it.  \n\ngood luck with your continued improvement.  This too shall pass &lt;3", "When did your twitching decrease Hey everyone I am 6 months in I guess I recovered 90 percent I do not see it getting better tbh.

So I was diagnosed with BP the end of May, just these last couple weeks I have finally got some movement back, about 50-60%.  Still not blinking naturally or any movement in my forehead.  \n\nAnyways, I just got a call for my neurologist referral from May (they have been backed up).  Do you think it would still be worth it to have them take a look, run an MRI? I did not see my neurologist until 4 months after my onset. Tbh, it was not all that enlightening but it is good to rule out things like acoustic neuroma  as a possible cause. I am also in a country where that is covered by healthcare so it was an easy choice to go. yes. if they do an MRI they can at least rule out 100% there was not a stroke or there is not any tumor or anything that might be pressing up around the facial nerve That is a good point, thank you I had a CT Scan immediately and then an MRI months later at the recommendation of my newly-appointed neurologist.  I healed slower than they expected, so they wanted to check on things in there again.  No issues, and about 2 weeks later, I started healing on my own. I would just in case", "Doc tell you to tape your eye shut at night? Use BandAids. I had toiled with masking tape and scotch tape. Not the right tool for the job. I tried BandAids hours ago and they are certainly 100 times better. Not sure how they will be coming off... but staying on is working well. Will update this if I lose my eyelashes. ;)\n\n**Update: 6 days in \u2014** indeed the BandAid was ultra sticky and good compared to tape. Though an issue has popped up that might be a concern. There is a small small of residue that is left on the eye lid from the BandAid when removed. I guess I have not take enough care to clean the residue 100% off and therefore as my eye sits open (all day) it gets a little sticky up there. The only way you would know is by pulling your eye lid down, as you cannot close your eye if you tried. Anyways, I have been trying to do a better job cleaning the next day and the top of the eye lid (where the BandAid sticks to) is getting very sensitive. I guess like any extra special attention you are body is not used to, the skin there is quite tender and irritated... because of the super-stickum of the BandAid, and then *pulling* it off after many hours. It is just tender skin there! Might also be because I am using tough-ass \"CLEAR WATER BLOCK PLUS 100% WATERPROOF PROTECTION BandAids. They were just ones we had in the cabinet, that is why.\n\nYou may wish to pick a less super-stickum BandAid if you are trying this. Or give it a go one night and give it a reasonably good clean off (any residue) the next day.\n\nI will add this as its own post too in case people have read this and do not check back for updates.", "Left eye will not blink What can I do for not being able to blink my left eye? It is constantly burning and watering because I am not able to close it. I have to manually use my hand to close it. I tried an eye patch but it just stays open under the patch. Hi! I recommend eye drops/eye gel. I had the same for weeks, my eye would not blink + close. I also used eye patches that had a moisture chamber (not sure what it is properly called, am not a native speaker), but it looked like this: ( My eye still stayed open under the patch, but due to the moisture chamber it stayed moisturised. Get well soon! I had to use medical tape to tape my eye shut and then used the eye patch over it. Artificial tears Clean your forehead and cheek with alcohol. The natural oils will keep tape from sticking for very long. Get some Genteal Severe Gel and put a drop or two in your eye. Next, get some medical tape and put on on your cheek and pull up so that your eye closes. Attach the other end to your forehead. Letting the eye get too dry can cause cornea damage and infection. Do this until you can blink again. This!!!! Especially at night, it is super important to get that lid to completely close and \u201cseal\u201d. I too had to tape it shut. Eventually i was able to switch to the disposable adhesive eye patches, which helped hold it closed better than a pirate type patch. Lubricating eye drops too, use them every couple hours whether you think you need them or not. Even a subtly dry eye can cause scratches and minor abrasions to the cornea. You will not realize you are doing damage until it is too late. Good luck. At the beginning of mine, I used a gel.  I think it was Systane night time gel.\n\nYes, you will be a bit blurry, but it helps to protect the eye.  At night, tape it shut.  I used the sensitive skin 3M tape.  Was easier to remove in the mornings. What everyone said before, + exercises. Once I was able to fully close my eye, I would force myself to close it totally when blinking, even if it was slow. For me the eyedrops where not enough so I had to force myself to close it and naturally lubricate it or it would start burning.", "Hand? I was Dx 6 days ago and my facial symptoms have stopped getting worse now. But tonight I had a really hard time using chopsticks, something that had always been very natural for me.\n\nCan anyone think of an explanation for this? If you have any other Lyme Disease symptoms, I would get tested, since Lyme can cause Bell's Palsy. I was misdiagnosed with BP two weeks ago and just tested positive for Lyme. I have noticed my fingers having some trouble moving like they normally would, too. About a week after a vacation in the mountains/woods and 2 weeks before getting Bell's Palsy, I would have these weird panic attacks where I could not open my hands and my thumbs were basically stuck.\n\nA few days after those panic attacks, I had a high fever and circular rashes.  The Dr gave me doxycycline saying it was Lyme despite the false negative I got in my blood test.  The antibiotics are clearly working because the muscle pain is going away and the rashes and virtually gone.  I agree with the other poster to check for Lyme.", "Facial Temp Regulation? Hello all! I am so glad to see this community exists. \n\nI got diagnosed with BP on the 23rd of Dec (and it was literally no more than an hour from a video appointment with a new doctor with nothing wrong to noticing my face drooping and not working). I think it probably developed from TMD and a bit of the usual health issues (hypertensive, pre-diabetic). \n\nI went through the meds regimen and am done, not noticing a ton of improvement yet, with the exception of my eye moisture doing better. I ended up finding a really good weighted mask that does not touch my eyelids at all while I am sleeping and helps with the headache from dealing with the all day blurry eye/audio sensitivity in that ear (and just general chronic pain I had before this hit). \n\nMy question to folks is... has anyone else dealt with weird temperature regulation in their face since it started? The affected side and my entire nose get SO COLD, and the non-affected side (especially under my ear/jaw feel warmer by comparison. I do not have a fever or any kind of other side effects, It is just really bizarre (and uncomfortable, I am going to have to get a nose sock or something!) I have not heard of this or experienced this as related to Bell's Palsy, but everyone is different.  With that being said, I would google it and ask a doctor.\nIn the meantime, consider applying warm compresses to affected areas to provide warmth, stimulate blood flow and provide comfort. \nHave you considered a consultation with an acupunture specialist? This was the deal changer for me. If you by chance suffer from neuropathy, I do believe it helps with that as well. Thank you! I had not considered acupuncture but I will keep it in mind. Thankfully no neuropathic issues. I am coming up on a month since it started and thankfully have about 95% of my face motion back. Still some quirks with my eye and ear but I am feeling very lucky!

You got this! Thank you everyone! \u2764\ufe0f Good job! It will get better yet. Mines about at the second picture now and that is a month and 2 weeks. How many weeks in do you think that picture was? I took it on May 18th and I got diagnosed around March 13th. So around 8 weeks in. I have noticed it seems like in the beginning my progress was going nowhere and then when I started to see small improvements, the bigger ones started coming quicker. I feel like I am maybe at 85% or 90% right now. Almost back to normal since this was posted! Glad to hear you are almost back to normal! &lt;3\nHope I am fortunate enough to get to at least 80-90% I bet it will happen! My biggest thing was just having patience. I am not usually a very patient person lol. Haha, sameeee! I am the most impatient person I know. I am just glad within in 3 weeks I started gaining some movement back. I know it can plateau tho. Even if that happens, I have to be thankful I have near 50% back at the very least. Ugh the human body is trash lol, I say its time to upgrade to being cyborgs XD Yes!! I saw so many stories that said people started noticing improvement at the end of the first month. And I was so discouraged when I did not. So it is definitely a good sign that you have. Make sure to take progress pics! That helps a lot too. \"feeling hopeful\" - very good!", "Dad developed BellsPalsy.. So my dad got the Pfizer vaccine which was something he was looking forward to since he is older.. he ended up developing BellsPalsy few weeks after his 2nd dose. Half his face he cannot move, could not close his eyes and would have to literally tape it to sleep at night, and face drooping. Has anyone else experienced this post vaccine or know of someone who has? If so, how long did it last? :( I had my first dose of Pfizer on June and was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy 3 weeks after. I am currently pregnant so the Doctors do not know for sure if the BP was due to the vaccine or due to other pregnancy related problem. I am still thinking if I should get the 2nd dose. Tomorrow will be my 14th day since diagnosis and have not seen any improvement yet. I am hoping it will get better soon. Interesting. I also wonder if it is pregnancy or vaccine related. Is this your first experience with bells pallsy? Sorry you are going through this. I am trying to urge my dad to report this as a vaccine side effect since he was unaware prior of the association. It is his first time with this and nobody else in our fam has a history of this either. I got Bell's Palsy about 6 weeks after getting my 2nd dose of Pfizer.  \n\n\nHowever, I think it is probably easy for people to blame the vaccine.  Mainly because lots of people are getting the vaccine nowadays, so if it is \"your time\" to get Bell's Palsy, it may just be a coincidence that people get it after receiving the vaccine.  \n\n\nI am not saying either way, because I have no idea.  It would be interesting to see whether Bell's Palsy numbers have risen or not.\n\nIt seems nowadays that if anything goes wrong - people tend to scapegoat the vaccine vs just realising they are unlucky in the Bell's lottery!  \n\n\n  \nMy Bell's Palsy lasted around 3 weeks.  I started to see a small improvement around day 17, and then it rapidly improved over the next few days.  \n\n\nWishing your Dad all the best for his recovery! I got bell\u2019s while pregnant. It is actually pretty common. Had the vaccine two years later with no recurrence of the bell\u2019s. That is good to hear. I am still in recovery so I am pretty scared getting second dose will slow down the healing or make it worse. So conflicted on what to do right now. Yes this is the first time. I had my shot on my left arm. After about two weeks I started having muscle pain on my left shoulder, then excruciating pain around the 3rd week on the left side of my neck all the way up to the back of my left hear. It was scary I thought I was having stroke as my lip started drooping. I would rather have bell\u2019s than COVID. I am still not fully recovered from bell\u2019s 2 years out. Sorry, but there is no guarantee the bell\u2019s will ever be gone. I would get the vaccine so that you can protect your life and the other lives of the people around you.", "Eye either gets dry or excessively tears I will have to either keep wiping my eye every couple minutes or put eye drops in. Anyone know the best way to deal with this?\n\nI can close my eye as long as I close the other one too, so I cannot wink. I feel like me wiping my eye so much is going to cause more damage, but I could be wrong. I am 5 days in, so far I have been using eye drops quite often. Also, when I am home and have the chance, I got some eye patch shaped bandages from CVS that have a large enough pad to cover my eye and I put one on. I shut my eye with my free hand and apply the bandage I try to do it right after applying drops so my eye is moist when I close it and it seems to help.

I am sorry. Seek help for the depression if you can. I know it is hard but please do try. Some people take a longer time to heal and still manage to make full recoveries. It all depends on the amount of nerve damage.\n\nGo for acupuncture, take B12 shots, work out, so facial massages and reguarlarly see your doctor to get professional advice. \n\nPlease do not lose hope, you WILL get better and make a full recovery - it just takes time! Dont let this bring you down, if you want to talk you can message me at any time! Positivity, optimism and keeping hope are great, but I do not think it is right to say someone will definitely make a full recovery. I have not, and several others do not after even 20years.

I am also at the one year mark and nowhere near back to normal. So many things are out of personal control in life, and it is important we do not blame or berate ourselves for things we did not chose.

It is all about MANIFESSTINGGG ya know? Speaking into existence. Who knows, he or she could make a full recovery?? Just out of interest have you seen any improvement at all? Asking as someone who is starting the battle I did. I was a 6 (the worst) on house brackmann scale. For me it took around 5 (very stressful) months before anything changed, and then my eyelid closing improved. Quite a bit of improvement over 2-3 months - I got some eyebrow and some smile back. Also, my face tightened a little, making speaking and eating a bit easier. I am now at 1 year, about 65% back, and have some pretty severe synkenisis. Been told more improvement may come, but we are talking 1-5%, not likely huge improvements. But when my face is resting you cannot really tell, and I can blink again so thankfully no more eye ointment / taping it at night. \n\nGood luck! Many people have improvement within the first month (best case) and if not, it hopefully begins around 3-6months. Avoid electrical stimulation, trying to move it too much, and perhaps read the new book \u2018Fix my Face\u2019.", "Newly diagnosed Hi,\nI was diagnosed today with BP but I have not had any paralysis or drooping. Two night ago I noticed suddenly the right side of my face felt itchy/ irritated along with my ear and eye. I have had some altered tastes for a couple of weeks and my tongue felt weird but today I woke up and went to the ER because my cheek was numb and when I would drink water I could not really feel it in my mouth on my right side. My eye felt super dry and irritated. My throat even feels a little numb. My teeth hurt and feel numb. Is this normal symptoms of BP? I was shocked of the diagnosis because I do not have any paralysis or drooping. Does that come later?? Or is this hopefully the worst it will be? My cat scan was normal. \n\nI was prescribed prednisone and an antiviral but from what I have read it does not really help. Plus, I have bad anxiety and steroids make it so much worse. What were your experience taking medicine for it? \n\nThanks so much. The tongue and irritated eye is something that is happened to me. Numbness is something that happens too. My whole face went completely immoveable the day after I was diagnosed. I was only given steroids but I do not think they did much to change how my face felt. I can move everything fine. It is just numbness and eye irritation that is bothering me. I wonder if this is just a mild case or I would it gradually gets worse? Idk what is normal and what is not and neither does my doctor apparently no one really knows much about it. Does not sound like it to me.  My eye irritation was due to my inability to fully close my eye.  Do you have full symmetry of your facial muscles? (Smiling, raising eyebrows, blinking, etc) I know everybody is different, but this sounds nothing like my experience with BP. If you do not have asymmetrical muscle weakness in your face, then I would look at getting a second opinion. If this is Bell's Palsy then it is pretty atypical. I did have some pain near my ear, but no numbness of any sort. My first indication was my inability to close one eye, or to drink through a straw without dribbling out of one side of my mouth. Did they do any scans before making a positive diagnosis? It sounds like you might have an abscess or possibly some kind of neuralgia maybe; other possibilities like these should be positively ruled out before making a diagnosis and prescribing medications. I am not a doctor.\n\nEdit: in answer to how the medication affected me, I had the same bad reaction as you. It made me feel like I was going to jump out of my own skin. Could not sleep, could not sit still or focus, felt very uncomfortable. But, hey, my BP has been gone for more than 15 years now, so if it helped me get rid of it then it was worth it.\n\nSecond edit: missed that part about your scan being normal. Like I said, everyone is different. It is still possible to have an abscess that does not show on scans, in which case the prednisone might help you fight it or might do nothing. Either way, trust a doctor more than internet strangers, but if you are worried you might be misdiagnosed you can always get a second opinion from another doctor. This does not sound anything like my experience, at all. I had almost complete paralysis on one side but never had numbness, moreso pain. It did not affect my throat at all. I did have taste change and eye irritation, but my eye was irritated because I could not blink. Yes I can do all of that. \n\nHe said my eye was not fully closing when I blink and it was very mild but I do not see it and neither does my family. I think it is a misdiagnosis. All of my function is there. He said that this stage is loss of sensation which most people do not notice. Then later comes muscle weakness. But everything I have read says otherwise. I do have anxiety so I do notice even the slightest change in my body though. \n\nMy teeth on the upper are killing me so I wonder if it could be from that. I have impacted wisdom teeth and a molar impacted on that side. Idk if that could cause any of these sensations. Hmm, I have had it 7 times (super super rare do not freak out! :) ) and never had any symptoms involving my teeth.  I would suggest making an appointment with a neurologist.  Best of luck! Did you mention the pain in your teeth to the doctor? If I were you I would see a dentist right away. This all sounds rather suspicious to me and I am not at all convinced that you have BP. Update:  not BP....\n\nI have a fucking sinus infection...\n\nGot To love panicky doctors. I am glad you got to the bottom of this. It really did not sound like BP at all to me. Good luck with your sinus infection. Did they put you on antibiotics? Yup antibiotics and a steroid shot.  All of this has given me so much anxiety and now I have broken out in a rash all over. Idk what is going on with my body but I am so over it.", "Bells Palsy Symptoms Coming Back I had Bell's Palsy two years and took steroids for it which made it go away but this year I have had some facial asymmetry and droopiness come back (eyebrows, lips, etc). Is this a lasting effect of my Bells Palsy from before or a new bout of it? Should I try taking corticosteroids again? If you had gotten back to 100% and are now experiencing some symptoms again it might be good to talk to your doctor. Mine tends to kind of show up whenever I am really stressed or particularly cold, but I just consider it extra reason to keep my life as stress free as I can. I just got it again on the opposite side of my face earlier this week and I have not had it in 11 years. All my doctors say stress management and high quality sleep is so crucial!", "How long were you on prednisone? I was prescribed prednisone for 7 days, Valtrex for 10. I finished those, and so I am on day 21 now with very small improvement. \n\nShould I go to the doctor to try and get put back on prednisone or should I wait it out? My PCP said that prednisone is not really proven to do anything besides subside inflammation and that nsaids would work about the same. I have still been taking them just in case but they make me feel like a space cadet. I got 7 days worth after discharge from the hospital. I was on a 7-day tapering dose of prednisone, and 10 days of Valtrex, just like you.\n\nI was totally stone-faced for 3 months, I am sorry to say.\n\nThe drug combo is the only thing scientifically proven to help , but unfortunately it is not a 100% treatment.\n\nYou are going to need time to heal. There are studies a that show the opposite of that. If treatment is started within 72 hours of onset then there are better outcomes. There are also studies that say that the studies are bogus because every case is different, so who really knows? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f 5 days prednisone 60mg OD\n1 day 55mg\n1 day 50mg\n1 day 45mg\n1 day 40mg\n1 day 35mg and so on until completely done pills.\n\n\n5 days of valtrex two pills three times a day.", "Slight relapse Hey guys, I am from Germany, so excuse my bad English.\n\nI have had BP in September for roughly 4 weeks. 2 weeks where I could not move anything on my right side and then it has gotten better over the next 2 weeks. It was nothing viral or bacterial. Up to the point where I did not notice anything about it anymore. I was prescribed cortisone for the first 10 days.\n\n1,5 weeks ago I got a cold and I noticed that my symptoms have returned a little. My eye is twitching after I blink and I am noticing a little numbness in my right cheek. It is not that bad but I am a little worried. I have been taking Vitamin Bs and Magnesium ever since my symptoms started. \n\nI am still hoping that this will be getting better soon. Had anyone of you had the same issues?\n\nCheers and thanks from Germany,\nThomas I had Bell\u2019s palsy about 2 years ago. I made an almost complete recovery in the first 3/4 weeks. Most of the time I forget I ever had it.\n\nI still find I get a very slight numbness on that side when I am poorly or really overtired though. 6 months in, still only half recovered. When I am tired I notice it very fast in my affected side of my face. My facial muscles are tied too. I also notice it now with the cold weather, cramping and stiffness. Thanks for your replies. Is there anything else I can do besides taking vitamins and magnesium when this happens?", "New and Concerned. Hey everyone, 29M and just got diagnosed with this on Sunday and just feeling a little anxious about all of it and was hoping to hear if my story so far is pretty normal.  \n  \n   \nLast Thursday I got a rad earache, just extreme stabbing around the ear and jaw. \nFriday was just more pain now with scalp tenderness, was barely sleeping from the pain and sweating through the night.\nSaturday was more of the same but that evening the back left of my tongue went numb. \nSunday morning I noticed my lips and cheek felt funny, but I could still smile, blink, no real issues. That evening I went ahead down to urgent care and it was just a total show with the whole Covid thing going around. Multiple patients packed into one room, Doc swung through and said it was Bells Palsy and gave me the 2 prescriptions and sent me on my way.\nMonday (yesterday) I woke up and the left side was completely gone, nothing. Cannot blink, wrinkle forehead, drink like a normal person, etc.  \n  \n  And that is pretty much where I am at, but my main concern is the pain that started it all has not gone anywhere. The Dr barely seemed to acknowledge that I was getting stabbed behind mu ear, and the majority of stories I am finding talk about it being totally painless until a couple weeks into it when it starts to grow back. \n  \n  \nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? I am feeling like thanks to the circumstances going on (which I totally understand) the fact that I am in a ton of pain days before and it is continuing was glossed over and should have been talked about with some options for relief. I mean they did not even tell me I should be taping my eye shut (assuming since face was still fully functional when I visited) just ran across that on Google after the full paralysis set in.  \n  \n  \nAnd speaking of the eye, is there a general consensus on the best approach? I have just been putting drops in it and taping it shut all day but it sounds like some people leave it uncovered and only patch it any night?  \n  \n  And that pretty much brings me to now, after a night of trying to sleep with the pain and ear feeling hot and swollen.\nIf anyone has any tips or stories they could share I would be really grateful, thanks!\n\n(On mobile, sorry for any formatting)  Take your medicine as prescribed and do your facial exercises as recommended. Do not cut any corners. You will be all right No exercises recommended (or even mentioned), is there a good resource for this? When should you start? You should start ASAP. \n\n Your eye will get better. It is always the worst at first. Take your steroids.\n\nI never had any pain associated with my BP so I have no advice for you there.\n\nWhat you do now, close to when you first got BP, is going to have the biggest effect on your recovery. Once a nerve dies it does not come back Hey there. Your timeframe and symptoms sounds exactly like when I got BP. Here is some tips, pointers and answers to some of your questions in no particular order:\n\nBummer that you could not get the penicillin. Hope you get that sorted quick. Maybe ask your pharmacy if they can check if any other nearby places has it. However, be thankful that they had the steroids. If steroid treatment is not started within 72 hours of paralysis, they will not help. So it sounds like you have gotten those in time. \n\nPain behind the ear and below the jaw is normal, and it sucks. Get the penicillin treatment started as soon as possible, but know that ibuprofen can help ease the pain. \n\nDo not just tape your eye shut during the day. Wear an eye patch when going out, or when doing things were stuff could easily irritate your eye (cooking for example). Otherwise just use plenty of eye drops, and close your eye manually by using your hand, but try your hardest to actually blink while doing this! Act as if you are trying to close your paralyzed eye as tight as possible, while closing it with your fingers. Just remember to do this, especially while watching TV or playing video games, since it is easy to forget that while doing such things. \n\nI did not see you talking about doing face exercises. Get on that right away! If your doctor did not give you any directions, you can find some good videos on YouTube, or I can send you my training regiment if you want.\n\nRegarding sleep, I recommend getting an eye salve and using that at night together with an eye patch. Maybe stuff something like a folded up napkin  or a cotton swab, that can help putting a bit more pressure on your eye to keep it closed. If the eye patch bugs you, you can tape your eye shut with some skin friendly tape. But know that the steroids can give you sensitive skin, and peeling it off in the morning can be uncomfortable if that side effect hits you hard. \n\nI hope some of this was helpful. Feel free to ask if you have any questions. And get on those face exercises! :) Mine was caused by a super nasty ear infection, both middle and outer. That part still hurt, though everything controlled by the nearby facial nerve was dulled, including some taste buds.\n\nThey prescribed me antibiotic ear drops with a steroid, oral antibiotics, and I took ibuprofen and naproxen long after my other meds were gone.\n\nCouple months later I do still get some pain around the very edges of what used to be paralyzed, and little movement/strength details are still coming in, but other than that I had two functional sides of my face again after 4 weeks. What I read is that exercises are best to start after a period of rest to let the nerve get started healing, though I did do a lot of facial massage type stuff from the start that seemed to help. Right, I feel like they are quick for treating the palsy but some kind of check for at the very least an ear infection considering the pain &amp; swelling around the ear and behind the jaw. This just is not a good time right now to be having any kind of health issues. What my doctor said was to start face exercises immediately, but also to get plenty of rest and avoid stress.\n\nWorked for me though. I was 99% recovered after a month. Of course, luck, age and general health also plays a big part. But personally, I believe that starting the face exercises early helped me a lot during my recovery. That is really good to know, thank you! I am prone to swimmer's ear because I have teeeeeny tiny lil ear holes, and it was like. visibly messed up. It ended up swelling and eventually getting sores on the outer ear while it healed. I still get twinges in my ear. It sucked way worse than slobbering my beverages all over myself. How long did it take for your eye to get better? That is the worst part of all this for me. Well I never took my meds as prescribed and I did zero facial exercises so my eye only came back to 85%. It is one of my biggest regrets in life Just got diagnosed as well and, like you, it started with killer pain behind one ear and down my neck (for about three days). Woke up yesterday morning with half my face not working. \n\nGoing to the hospital during covid sure was something. Luckily, my pharmacy did have the antiviral and steroids available so I was able to start right away. \n\nWorst part for me is my eye. Oh and not being to eat or drink properly. I tried having salad for dinner last night to hilarious results. I think I will stick to liquids for the time being. \n\nAnybody have any tips about eye care? I tried to patch it to sleep but my lower eyelid drops so it did not work well Yeah smoothies have definitely been my meal of choice.\n\nHopefully you figured out your eye. They should have prescribed you drops for during the day and some special lube to put in it at night and then to tape it shut (youtube helped me figure out how to properly do it). Really important to keep it safe at night so it does not get scratched.\n\nHope you start to feel better soon!   Funny you mention smoothies, that is all I have been having all day! Might try to make soup tomorrow. Not sure how it will turn out but I will give it a shot. \n\nI do have drops and gel for nighttime. Having trouble patching / taping my eye for sleep. My lower eyelid and inner upper eyelid just will not cooperate. Cannot wait for that to get better. \n\nHow are you holding up?", "Good help for eye I was just disgnosed with Bells Palsy yesterday, and I bought a weighted eye mask from CVS. This thing is super helpful when sleeping because when I tape my eye up at night it really helps hold everything down. You can also wear it during the day and have it rest right on your brow and weigh down your left eye lid so it shuts. \n\nSuper helpful", "Throat tightness Hello there!\n\nI have been diagnosed with Bell's for around 6 days and things have been going well with the prednisone but I am not sure what to do. \n\nThese past couple of days, my throat keeps tighting making it sometimes harder to breathe and swallow and I am not sure if it is because I am anxious and my chest starts hurting and everything just starts getting tight.\n\nIts mostly the side of my face that is affected, im not sure what to do, does anyone else experience this? Not sure of this personally. It could certainly be the anxiety. I would post this in the Bell\u2019s palsy Facebook group there is like 6k some people in there you will get an answer in minutes. Best of luck to you and try to stay stress free and as calm as possible. As hard as that is it can be a key factor to healing. Just binge a favorite tv show or something to get your mind off it Up voted so hopefully others see.\nGoogling \"bell's palsy neck pain\" gave this 1st link: \n\n(\n\nI do not remember any neck pain, but everyone is different.\nIt is been a few days for you. Know that the feelings change. I noticed that my good side would often be sore and in pain.... I think I was trying to compensate and overwork the good side since the bad side did not work. You might be doing something similar with your neck?\n\nI found some good videos on YouTube with exercises. Wish I had been more faithful in doing them. Also, had some good videos that helped me to understand. Unfortunately I did not bookmark them. Could this be an allergic reaction to the prednisone? Otherwise I would say it is anxiety which is going to make your BP worse. Try to stay as relaxed as possible, that is really the only way the nerve will be able to heal itself Sounds a lot like anxiety to me. I have an anxiety disorder and panic attacks, and the Bell\u2019s palsy made it worse. Prednisone also has a host of side effects, including anxiety, insomnia, and agitation. I would see if your doctor has a nurse\u2019s line you can call, or maybe you can email them through an online portal! Not because something is seriously wrong with you, but because it is helpful to know that you asked the question, and are fine. When I am having anxiety attacks, I get short of breath, chest pains, and my throat feels tight. It is very common. But still, have it checked out to be sure. Also, yes, neck pain can be a symptom of Bell\u2019s palsy like others have said. Sorry I did not see this sooner... I would have said it is definitely anxiety.  I had similar sensations around the same time.  It takes time to see your progress, and we do not want to think that this could be our new normal.  It will come back.  Take time to relax and do not worry about it.  You have friends here! I definitely had neck pain/strain on the affected (my right) side.  And around day 10 the affected side of my face also ached (possibly from excessive/desperate \"massage\" ). That has subsided now, and I am beginning to look and feel more normal.  My kids say for the most part they would not really have noticed anything if I had not mentioned it, but I shielded them from the worst of it by eating alone, covering my big laughs, yawns, etc.", "My smile is back! After 2 depressing months, my smile is FINALLY fully back to normal and I could not be happier. I am 96% healed, the only thing I am waiting for now is my pucker. \n\nTo anyone who is newly diagnosed: please do not ever lose hope, I thought my smile would not be the same again and look at me now!! \n\nI literally sat in the mirror crying out of joy \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d !! I am never taking it for granted ever again That is awesome!!!!\n\nI know I felt like I would never smile again.  \n\nNow I do not smile because I do not want to :) \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a Spent my whole life not smiling, then a month trying to. Once it came back, no more smiling. \ud83d\ude06 I have been blessed with permanent bitch face.  The Bells Palsy might have been an improvement.  (Jokes of course. It really sucked). This gives me hope!!! Stay strong, things WILL get better trust me beautiful \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e you can message me any time if you have any questions xxxx wonderful news!! happy for you! That is awesome! Well done! :) When did you see your first recovery movements? I started seeing improvements around 3 weeks in \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e", "What vitamins should I take? I am taking B12, zinc, and a general multivitamin daily. Are there any other vitamins I should consider? Lysine. I took one that is an anti-inflammatory (curcumin/turmeric), also an immunity blend supplement so tonnes of vitamin c in it. A B-12 injection/shot with sublingual B12 is good. Make sure you have enough vitamin D too. B", "It started with loss of taste Hi guys,\n\nI was just wondering if anyone else's started with a complete loss of taste? How long was it before you could taste again?\n\nIt happened last Wednesday (so I am now day 5 if I count from losing taste) and I got tested for covid, it came back negative that night and when I woke up on Thursday morning I had a wonkey smile and could not pout. A trip to A&amp;E and I was diagnosed with BP.\n\nMy mouth is not noticeable unless I smile, and I struggle to put some foods in my mouth, and I do dribble when drinking. My eye has really started to hurt the past day. I have been using the eyedrops but it is still uncomfortable. I cannot wink or flare my nostril. Reading some stories I think I got of lightly but it has still really impacted my day to day, I am very self conscious talking to people.\n\nWhen does BP stop progressing? Does B12 help with recovery? BP only stops healing if the nerve damage is severe. If you start healing in a matter of 3 weeks (according to doctors) you will make a full recovery.\n\nHowever, if it takes you months to see the first initial movements, you might have an incomplete recovery. But, there is still always a chance of a full recovery. Everyone is different. \n\nB12 helps, for sure. Steroids helped me alot and I started healing pretty quickly. Take your steroids and your B12 and you will be back to your normal self in no time. I hope you recover quickly! Sending love \u2764 Thank you for the encouraging reply \ud83d\ude0a. I will give the B12 a go also. It is such an odd thing to happen out of nowhere!\n\nMy dad actually had it at the exact same age I am now but the doc said its not hereditary or anything, it is just a really odd coincidence. He healed in a week (apparently, he likes to exaggerate) but I think he was just lucky, I know it will take longer and I have accepted it. Taste back this time within 4 days, paralysis will be longer. Do not remember taste loss first time though", "Bell's Palsy Diagnosis FML Last Thursday, I was on my way to a job interview and I noticed that my face was droopy, my eye would not shut and I could not crack a smile if my life depended on it.  Freaking out, I drove to the nearest hospital (what good is the job if I have a stroke during the interview).  If you ever want to get seen by a Dr right away at the ER, tell the front desk you think you are having a stroke...i am telling you, works like a charm.\n\nAfter the CT came back normal, I was told I had Bell's Palsy.  Until that day, I had never even heard of it.  The Dr. told me they do not know what causes it and the duration can vary from person to person.  It could end in a couple weeks or it could take months.  Hearing that, I wished it would have been a stroke...a fatal one at that.\n\nThe symptoms of Bell's seriously suck, which is ironic cuz sucking is extremely hard to do for someone with Bell's!  Small things like closing my eye, blinking, smiling, brushing my teeth and eating/drinking are things I wish I could still do.  \n\nThere is however one thing that i am really struggling with, and that is the impact that this condition has had on my speech.  I am in my early 30's and usually a very well spoken individual.  I have had a very successful career thus far and I have so much more I want to do.  Not being able to properly convey my thoughts is the hardest thing I have to deal with.  I feel like I need to preface every conversation with \"I swear to you, I know how to speak.\"  It is to the point that i am so self-conscious about actually speaking, that my brain hyper-focuses on that fact and i am at a loss of what to even say.  I just want to sound intelligent again, is that so much to ask?\n\nIt is only been six days and already i have had to deal with bullies.  I heard rumors that someone I used to work with found out about my condition and started cracking jokes around the office about it.  The crazy part about this...we worked together in Human Resources...WTF...you would think he would know better...guess not.  Today, I saw that individual at an HR seminar.  I knew he was attending and wanted to skip it, but I went with my head held high.  Showing weakness in front of him, not an option.  \n\nI have got the biggest job interview of my life next week and I have to give a huge presentation during the interview.  The thought of doing this with Bell's is terrifying.  I have got to figure out a way to get through...I doubt i am going to wake up the day before and magically be cured.  With the luck I have, mine will last a year.  \n\nFML. I am so sorry. Bell's sucks. (At least it is not winter time? When mine came on it was December and the coldest winter in ages. Not being able to produce tears was the worst! I could not go outside and could hardly take care of my newborn baby.) For 85% of people, they recover completly. I was told that I would recover everything within 3 mo then 6 mo... then a year. It is been 3.5 years and I do not have my same face back. Not to scare you, but to share the reality. But I did re-gain movement starting at 3mo, re-learned to speak (out of the corner of my mouth), used a straw for drinking, etc. I have what is called synkinesis. It occurs in 15% of those with BP. It is rough. But treatable. I am sorry the onset came right before a big interview. I became very upfront about my condition with people when I felt that they were looking at me oddly. It is not like you could help it! Just do not overthink it and speak slowly and deliberately. Be kind to yourself. It is healing. I hope that you are one of the 85% and your recover is rapid and leaves you a stronger person. Thank you.  One of the hardest parts is not  being able to do anything to fix the problem.  All I can do is wait for it to go away.  I am a problem solver by nature and the wait and see approach is rarely something I am comfortable with.  I feel for anyone who was to go through this... Look into acupuncture. The prednisone did very little for me. After 6 weeks of acupuncture twice a week, my face is almost back to normal Does acupuncture hurt? I have a wee bit of needle phobia... I am not a fan of needles either. The needles that are used for acupuncture are significantly smaller then hypodermic needles that are used in the medical world. Each needle hurts a little but goes away rather quickly. I found the experience to be very relaxing after the initial anxiety of needles being in my face. The results are worth the temporary discomfort in my opinion. I have had bells twice and I wish I did acupuncture the first time. The right side of my face happened 20 years ago and it took 10 years to get as good as my left after 6 weeks of acupuncture. The doctors told me I had a fairly severe case, not so droopy but definitely paralyzed. I work in enterprise sales and talk to some very important people with million dollar deals on the table. Usually I just say I just had some dental work and I have a little difficult speaking loud (for some reason trying to enunciate and talk loud/clear really brings it out). Often people tell me they did not notice it in the first place. I am very self conscious about it but with time I have gotten used to it. I am about 2 months in. \n\nThe other day I could whistle for the first time since I was diagnosed. How about that!\n\nI had to get some serious eye drops, the regular stuff would not work and I could not tape my eye shut - it would just open under the tape. I had some relief with a paper towel folded up under an eye patch. I got Refresh Celluvisc Lubricant Eye Gel. It makes your vision blurry for a few minutes and it is like adding sex lube to your eye ball and after a month of discomfort I had immediate relief. I also got this gel bead eye mask that helped with sleeping and was weighted to help keep my eyes shut. My SO actually still uses it sometimes because it feels so good. \n\nAnother tip is eating small bites slowly and use a fork, even for hand foods. I bit the inside of my lip easily over 100 times trying to chew normal bites. Then it gets swollen and easier to bite on accident again. Downward spiral there. Also, straws are your friend. \n\nThe thing that really irked me was the hardest word to say was the F word and I really was saying that a lot for the first few weeks. Fwubck just does not have the same satisfaction. \n\nGood luck with your recovery. I usually heal up quickly from broken bones or other physical injuries but I have a feeling this is going to stick around for a while too.  Do not worry at all. I know it seems important to you know. It affects  something like 1 in 6 people at some point... so most everyone will have heard of it, in case you have to put the job interview off.\n\nYou will likely be close to normal in 3-4 weeks, and then almost 100% in 6-8 weeks. It seems shitty of course... but when it struck me, and like you I have never of it... some weeks later I was thinking that if I was to get any \"palsy\" this was by far the best. Consider yourself severly lucky. Many many people have much worse problems to deal with.\n\nIt does take some time, but hopefully like me, you will look back on this like an interesting blip in your life. Yes it takes time to get back to normal. :) Knowing something is out of your control is one thing, accepting it is another. My Bells Palsy onset was when I was very young (under 5) and it was not until I had symptoms of another occurrence (while pursuing my Bachelor's Degree) and consulted a neurologist that I was introduced to the term and diagnosis. My parents never shared the details (they still refuse to share this) or diagnosis until the neurologist requested details as it pertains to my diagnosis in order to form a complete assessment. I recall going through electro shock therapy, ice and physio therapy when I was younger but I never understood why. I was made fun of during childhood, high school and by certain family members but never fully knew how to defend or explain my being different- involuntary muscle movement, asymmetrical facial features, involuntarily shedding tears and other symptoms. \n\nAll this to say, we do not always control what happens to us but we can use the knowledge that we have to overcome and combat the challenges that come. This person's actions are a reflection of who this person is and your energy is better spent getting yourself into a mentally and physically good space in light of what life has thrown your way. I know this does not change how you feel, but I hope that one day you can focus on what is important and that is your wellbeing. Hope this helps...... Hey /u/scastle84! How are you holding up? Just checking in. Thank you for the message! The BP actually went away after about 3 weeks. I got extremely lucky  I did not get the job I interviewed for, and none of the jobs I interviewed for during that time, but right after it went away I interviewed for a couple and go offers at both. I should probably post an update for everyone to see and let people know what I did during those three weeks. ", "26 months in and a reset ", "Medications Does anyone know if it is ok to suddenly stop the use of steroids and anti virals when the course finishes? I spoke to my doctor and he said it was fine but I am still not sure that is safe just checking what u guys think Your steroids should have a taper off - dosage is less each day, so you do not feel so off after the course ends. I was on anti viral for 30 days. It is still anecdotal on how effective the anti viral is for 30-day period but my primary care doc had good results with the long course so prescribed that for me. Felt fine afterwards. As previous poster said, the dosage for steroids should be less each day. As for antivirals, I had 5 days of antiviral infusions (but i was diagnosed with bell's palsy - in case of Ramsey Hunt  Syndrome or other viral infections you probably take it for a longer period of time). But yes, it should be fine! :) Hm ok do u know when u start to taper off? Is it wen u start getting better or when the course runs out How long did u take urs for Hi! I received steroid infusions at hospital for 10 days and after that got steroid tablets for another 7 days (e.g. on the first day of taking tablets i had to take 3x5mg, on the last day only 1/2 tablet (2.5mg) - but that probably varies by individual (how much mg of steroids you need based on age, weight etc) by country/region, hospital etc.. Oh ok I have only been on the tablets so I guess not that serious in my case den?  Oh, i did not think of that - that could be the case. Nonetheless, i wish you a speedy recovery! I cannot remember my dosing now but the tapering happens DURING the course itself. \n\nSo your RX should be something like 40mg per day for 5 days then 30mg for next 2 days, then 20mg for next 2 days, etc. The gradual drop in dosage is the taper.", "Is this Bell\u2019s palsy? This is how my face has looked in a resting position for years  no, not likely.  Bells palsy is unmistakable. You would know it if it was", "When should I start doing exercises? My doctor has not told me to do any and I saw people say not to start too early\n\nAny exercises or massage techniques are a plus I started doing my face exercises the day I got diagnosed and have made a 99% recovery.\n\nHere is the PDF I got from my doctor with exercises and such. It is in Danish though, but there is lots of pictures, and you should be able to copy paste the text into Google translate or similar. \n\n\n\nI recommend massaging the face before you start going through the exercises. Massage both sides by rubbing your hands in circular motions. This will help get the blood flowing, which is important for your recovery :) \n\nWhen you start the exercises, hold each exercise for 3-4 seconds while trying your hardest to make the grimace on both sides of your facw, and help the afflicted side with your fingers when needed. After the 3-4 seconds, relax your face completely for 3-4 seconds and repeat the exercise two more times. Do this for all the exercises.\n\n\nEnd by relaxing your face and stretching the skin as shown on page 10. I recommend stretching both the normal and the paralysed side at the same time.\n\nDoing the massasing, exercises and stretching will take about 15 minutes from start to finish. Try to do this 3 times a day, and also feel free to do some exercises whenever you feel like it during the day. I would often do the blinking and smiling exercises when I was just relaxing and watching TV and stuff like that.\n\nI hope these exercises and tips will help your recovery :) I did not do exercises until I started to see noticeable signs of recovery. The problem is a swelling/inflammation near the 7th cranial nerve, which blocks the signals from the brain to the face. There is nothing wrong with your facial muscles or the brain signals, so there is no point in doing exercises. \n\nIn fact, it could actually be dangerous if you constantly force your face into expressions now, as you could retrain the brain to send incorrect or unnecessarily powerful signals, causing synkenesis. (Look that up for more info).\n\nJust rest. Gently massage your face once a day (check the YouTube videos of Queen Victoria's Hospital) and occasionally cool the area behind your ear to help the swelling go down faster. Hope you feel better soon! I started to see significant progress after 10 days or so. I did not do any facial exercises at all and recovered 100%. That is my story. Steroids and the passing of time are the only scientifically proven things to help That is good to know!!! Thank you!!!", "Doctor prescribing 3 WEEKS of prednisone? ER doc prescribed prednisone 60mg a day for 7 days.\n\nPCP prescribed prednisone 60mg a day for another 7days\n\nPCP just prescribed prednisone *80mg* a day now for another 7 days. \n\n3 weeks of corticosteroids seems like a lot. Not sure if mom should take the 80mg a day of prednisone for another week??? Anybody ever been prescribed 3 weeks of prednisone for Bell\u2019s palsy? Seems like a lot. I only had a 7 day course of prednisone when I got it and it seems like that is what most people get. I am confused? I had a total of 8 days. 4 from ER and 4 from PCP. 3 weeks seems way out there 2 weeks was whatever but 3 and now 80mg? Idk that is a lot at this point. I got 7 days worth from the ER doc (do not remember the dosage), then my PCP gave me another 7 days of the same dosage. Hindsight... I am not sure it was necessary, and was one of the things that led me to the conclusion that my PCP does not know shit about drugs. I have since switched docs for that reason. At the end of that 2 weeks I felt absolutely awful for days. You are supposed to taper off of prednisone, not stop it abruptly, and yes even if it is just for a week or two. I have had to take it again since my BP episode, and that doc (orthopedist) prescribed a pack that is a week long tapering dose that had self explanatory packaging, and man do I wish I would known I would needed that the first time! Did you take the anti-viral as well? I would get a second opinion and/or ask about a tapering pack. Hope you heal quickly, BP sucks. Fun afterthought. 2 months after BP I got a weird skin condition (pityriasis rosea) that lasted for about 4 months. I have always thought (just a hunch, I could be wrong) that it was because the longer than necessary steroid course fucked with my immune system. I dunno. But maybe not the best idea to take immune suppressing drugs for longer than absolutely necessary during a pandemic... If it is like that most docs do not know shit about drugs. Cus they have never tapered me down from prednisone and I usually get bronchitis every winter. None of my docs ever taper lol. But ya 80mg for another week seems unnecessary so I told my mom not to take it especially since the dosage is higher this time. They did give her 2 weeks of antiviral medication and 2 of prednisone. She is not doing too bad. 19 days in and she has a lot more movement on the effected side. But her headaches, dizziness and nerve pain have not got better so he scheduled an MRI. Hope everything goes well. EXACTLY Sounds right to me (so long as it is a tapered does?? Maybe call for clarification?) In the ER I was prescribed 7 days, after seeing the neurologist he prescribed it longer so I would wean off slower (apparently less painful/shocking to body). I believe I took I did 60-70mg for 5 days-7days and then dropped by 10mg &amp; a day until I was at 10 mg for 1 day. I finish my 3rd week tomorrow. Started out a week of 60mg per day for a week, then 40mg a day for a week, and this past week has been 20mg a day for a week. \n\nPrednisone is one of those meds that you have to taper off of over time so it seems a little strange that her dosage has gone up instead of down. Are the doctors all aware of what the other has prescribed?\n\nMy advice would be to follow whatever the doctors say instead of advice from reddit, of course, but it would be something that I would question to them directly. Cases differ in severity so that much prednisone may not be outside of the norm for her. Definitely ask about what the plan is for her stepping down gradually too. I think she may need to get a second opinion just to be safe Wow... Reading all comments I notice how proceedings change from country to country, doctor to doctor. I just got around 3 or 5 days? And was told to go to my family doctor afterwards and it did not improve... So that she could prescript me to do physiotherapy.\n\nA friend of mine told me that meds would not do sh*t so I should just schedule an appointment with the doctor asap, even before the 5 days. I went there 3 days later, on Friday, and started physiotherapy the next Monday.\n\nMeds did not work but doing physiotherapy helped me  improving in three weeks. Not a total recovery yet, but at least no one could notice I had Bells Palsy anymore.", "I do not know what to think :((( I took steroids for 10 days ( 4 of which were slowly tapering off the drug )2 days later I wake up shivering and with a fever\ud83d\ude1eis this normal ? Is this steroid withdrawal symptoms ? Since all I have is fever and elevated blood pressure \ud83e\udd7ashould I go check it out ? Thank you for all of you!  This place has been such a great support system \ud83d\ude1e Not a doctor but you should def get it checked out. I did not have a taper and did not have those withdrawal symptoms. Hope you feel better. You can feel some residual effects days after coming off the steroids, that is been my experience anyway. Probably best to contact your doctor\u2019s office with what you mentioned. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb I will I think my dose was too high I weigh 40 kg and they gave me 60 mg :/ Hi Katmau, Glad you are going to a clinician. Your symptoms do not sound like what i experienced with steroids.", "how do I visit the dentist if I cannot open my mouth? I need to visit the dentist today and I cant open the right side of my mouth due to bell's palsy.. I am afraid he does not have dental mouth openers because what am i supposed to do then? open my mouth with my fingers? how is he going to work Trust me, a dentist has seen this before and can work with it. He probably has openers, or will hold your lip to the side with his fingers. Remember your jaw works fine, just the lip muscles do not cooperate. You will be fine ;) Dentists are trained to deal with this I went last week for a cleaning and it went fine enough. I think it depends on what you go for. I did not have any cavities and the dentist said she was glad because she did not want to use local anisthetic because I was still ok the steroids. Give them a call!", "How is everyone recovering? I am on day 5 and I feel like I have made some slight progress in recovery (either that or I am getting better at smiling with half my mouth).\n\nI know this condition is not super common but I love this sub and I would love to hear how everyone is doing along their journey so do not be afraid to comment! \ud83e\udd74", "Just a quick chime Hi all!\n\nI just wanted to jump back in and say thanks to all of you in that have posted in this sub. \n\nI was diagnosed with bells a month ago now. My doctor suggested it may have resulted from stress ( one of my favorite pastimes ). \n\nI recently moved into a new field of work in a new city and ended a 5 year relationship with my boyfriend; admittedly, things were a little rough. Bell's really put the icing on the cake.\n\nThis sub helped me feel like I was not alone even when I HAVE felt so alone lately. Another reason I love Reddit communities.\n\nAs of four weeks I want to say I have 90 - 95% recovered! I am ecstatic! I can whistle again, and really, only notice a slight notch on the left side of my lips when I whistle. Other than that, I personally do not recognize any other difference!\n\nDo not feel bad if you have just been diagnosed, and if you have not already, see your doctor! I think, even if I cannot prove the antivirals and steroids really contributed, it relaxed me a little just knowing I was doing what I could! \n\nI even took it as a sign (more like a motive) to start being a little healthier, I joined a gym and have lost weight, I have more energy, and now, my face is back and I feel more confident than I did before the Bell's!\n\nI ran into a friend I saw three weeks ago and he said, \"I see you are back to your full big beautiful smile!\" \n\nAnyway, do not give up. I kept thinking to myself, \"man, I need to get back to the sub and let them know I am seeing big improvement after three weeks.\" Well, since I assume a lot of those who recover quickly may not come back and post, I wanted to offer these words of encouragement.\n\nThanks again All. When did you start noticing signs of recovery? I am 2 weeks out today and aside from greatly reduced pain I have not had any changes. I was put on steroids and antivirals within 3 hours of onset, so I am really hoping to start seeing improvement soon! I had no sign of improvement the first two weeks. \n\nIt was not until the end of the second, going in to the third week that the improvement was like.. exponential? \n\nI cannot say I felt any pain, but plenty of twitching, tingling, and numbness along the way. I got my meds about three days after onset. I am a guy, so, naturally, at first I was like, \"Nope. Not seeing a doctor\". But after all the googling and landing here I went to urgent care and started on the meds.\n\nOther than the meds ( when people were not looking, lol ), I was just practicing making faces. Not in front of a mirror or anything, so Lord knows what I actually looked like haha, but I was just trying to smile, smirk, or  pulling left on my lips... you know, like you are trying to show your back teeth like you might do when trying to floss back there? \n\nI did this as often as I could remember to do it. And then just massaging the left side of my face in circular motions with my hand \n\nAgain, cannot say it helped, but I was trying to do what I could. \n\nI had to tape my left eye shut for the first two and a half weeks, but like I said, the recovery started and I was pretty happy with the tiny increments of improvement everyday from there. Thank you! It sounds like I am doing all these things as well. I am so happy for you that you had such a fast recovery, I am hoping I will be able to say the same. I have heard that often you do not see anything at all for the first two weeks so I am hoping that means I am normal! Thank you for coming back to see you have improved. I am waiting on MRI results to see if my BP like symptoms are a tumor(s) on parodied gland or just BP. I am into my third week since occurrence. I have been doing some facial exercises, but I have actually gotten worse (lack of movement, tingling has subsided to just numbness now). I did not get steroids until 2 weeks after occurrence. Dr told me they will do little to nothing at this point because the window for them to work is 72 hours of occurrence. Although my situation is different, it is nice to hear an inspiring post. Thank you. Congratulations! At least you are letting us know that there is hope \u263a\ufe0f", "Dry eye question Hey everyone, I had Bell\u2019s palsy in November. The facial paralysis lasted about 3 weeks and then cleared up. However, my eye on the effected side is still pretty dry and irritated. I was very careful in November to keep it shut as to not damage it. \n\nIs it normal to have residual dry eye and irritation after paralysis symptoms are gone and if so how long can I expect it to last?  Thanks so much.", "Ear infection? Nope, Bell\u2019s palsy. Bit of backstory: \nOn February 18th I started getting a sharp pinging pain in my right ear. I suspected it was just an ear infection and scheduled an appointment with my GP. Was prescribed amoxicillin and was directed not to take it unless symptoms worsened. Flash forward to a week later and I started to notice that I had lost my sense of taste, the next day I could not blink and my cheek felt heavier. The usual. I would never heard of Bell\u2019s palsy before, I had just assumed these symptoms were related to my ear infection and that I should get that amox prescription filled. In defence of my ignorance I was running on almost no sleep because of this persistent ear pain, but luckily, later that afternoon my mother was able to convince me to go back to the doctor where I would get diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy. I still had a fair amount of control/elasticity by that point, people would not have noticed unless i told them. \n\nMarch 7th: Went to the doctor to follow up (currently 30mg prednisone) and he determined again that I did not have an ear infection and that we did what the literature said to do. I guess I expected to be much better by this point, but it seems that the symptoms were just deferred. \n\nAnyways I am down to 20mg of prednisone today and I feel my ear pain coming back. It feels like pressure in my inner ear. The same pain that I had for an entire week before my diagnosis. Couple the fear of those symptoms coming back and weening myself off prednisone It is hard to stay positive. \n Your experience is very different than mine but I can tell you it will get better with time.\n\nI felt hopeless and embarrassed that half of my face did not work.  It took months to get better and now I get the occasional tic (not sure if it is connected or just a new feature).\n\nIt is really hard for people to understand the emotion behind it all.  Do you have someone to talk to?  In my case, I had an ear infection 3-4 weeks after my initial BP diagnosis. Most of my BP symptoms were starting to fade, but I had an intense pulse/heartbeat sound in my ear. This ramped up to a full blown, and painful ear infection which we treated with amox. The antibiotics nipped it in the bud, but I am still left with the pulse/plugged feeling in my ear, almost 3 years later. I have just gotten used to it at this point.\n\nIt is probably still worth checking with your GP to see if they can detect an ear infection. You do not want that to go untreated. Good luck and I hope you start feeling better.\n", "Any one have any experiences with CBD oil or Weed and how it affects Bell\u2019s Palsy? Seen some articles online saying it may help Daily user of both CBD and THC.  Did not seem to affect the condition for me, to be very blunt.  I suppose there is always the possibility that mine would have been much worse without it, and I will just never know. One time I vaped medical grade about 3 weeks into my BP.  I had not smoked within that same time frame so when I did it again, it hit hard.  I was talking to my friend and felt a massive twitch on my face; I could ever-so slightly move the side of my mouth after.\n\nMaybe it just so happened to affect my nerves or possibly coincidence because I could tell my face was slowly returning to normal before that happened.  That is my experience though. My wife tried CBD edibles and every time she uses it before sleeping, she wakes up with her face more relaxed. In her case, the difference is very noticeable. It is makes my right eye (affected side) more squinty. Besides that weed did not help or hurt it. This has been my experience after smoking a bowl before going to bed.  Early days though - only 5 days since diagnosis. Ill keep smoking and see what happends I do not use CBD or recreational weed because I personally just do not want to. However, when I was about 3 weeks in, I did have an edible and the pain was almost instantly gone lol. I am currently about four months, still having residual pain, and severe pain to touch, however I am on different nerve/chronic pain medications for problems with my back, and I feel they do help a lot with my face as well. Seems that all CBD does is help ! Noice I am using Organic CBD Oil Daily and I am fine with it. I am using it in my ( and it is really good for me. I am using this oil for six months and I do not feel any side-effects on my body. \n\nThank you.", "Scared to get bells again! I am pretty young, only 16F and  I fully recovered in 4 months. I am so scared then I will get it again in the future. I am so grateful that i experienced a full recovery but this is always in the back of my mind. I have really bad anxiety which just makes things 10x worse. Ugh. We need to relax, I feel the same sometimes. Stress inflames the body. Do some mindfulness, have a bath and do not dwell on something that may not even happen and which you cannot control \u2764\ufe0f Thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2d I fear that too. I am currently on Day 17 of having it the first time and while I do see some improvements and a light at the end of this miserable tunnel, my fear is that if I beat it this time will it come back? I was able to hide behind my glasses and the face mask mandate, but they have just lifted it in my area (NC, United States). And I am terrified of it comes back I will not be able to use that as a security blanket. I have heard of people having it more than once, so I know it is a possibility. But I know I cannot stress about the unknown, because that is a never-ending rabbit hole to go down! Yeah but normally people who get it again are people with a family history of it so hopefully that excludes us both \u2764\ufe0f Oh that is good to know! I had never even heard of BP before I got it, so no one on my family ever had it I am on day 16 of BP and 90% recovered. I thought abt the same thing today but the best thing we can do is change some habits. I am a smoker and bc of this I will do my best to not smoke, I am sure I will at some point but I will try to make it a pack a year or something healthy-ish. I also need to exercise more as it helps the body a lot. You are a minor so I am not sure if you can use CBD oil but maybe try having you parent get it for you. It helps with Bell\u2019s palsy and anxiety. Do not over do it, maybe once a week. Or only when you really need it, worse if you become codependent with meds and other things. I also am on B12 and recommend it. B12 might be the only thing I perma add to my daily life. Thank u I will ask my dad to buy me some cbd oil \u2764\ufe0f Do not forget to let your DR know and start off with small amount. \nWish you a fast recovery \u2764\ufe0f As somebody who has had it twice, you have nothing to worry about, your still young and do not need to concern yourself with this kind of stuff, bells was hard, just like it is for everybody, and due to the fact that statistics are pretty slim on the problem as a whole, the second time I got it and knew what it was, the process of getting with my doctor and getting it fixed was much easier, you will probably never see this issue again in all honesty, but I know that with anxiety, it is easier to know that if you do get it again there is nothing to worry about I am on day 1334 and am about 85% (I have started varying that number based on how I feel that day) recovered. Stress is definitely an enemy. Do not obsess over it, that will make it worse. You are young enough to heal quickly and well. Even if you have a second attack, it too should pass quickly. Relax and managing with stress it seems like. My friend who is a general practitioner/primary care doc reached out and mentioned keeping a check on stress levels, when feeling run down/exhausted and blood sugar. It is scary for sure and my only advice is that you take the time to reset mentally from the experience and go live life like any of your peers. To be 16 again - lots of things to see and do!", "I came across this study posted by the Facial Paralysis and Bell's Palsy Foundation on Facebook. Bell's Palsy qualifies as one of the rare disorders! ", "How to help My fianc\u00e9 got a diagnosis 10 days ago. It was pretty scary. Since then he is been pretty down and not feeling like there is been any improvement. He is in a lot of nerve pain. They gave him gabapentin Friday and since then he is been really tired and feeling off and still in pain. He is also a little down and embarrassed to be around people which I totally get. I have been doing my best to help and be here. Any advice on how to support him and maybe any advice on how to manage pain? I did not have much pain, so I cannot provide much advice there. But my husband helped me by reminding me of a few things:\n1. He was super chill about the fact that my face was paralyzed. He never seemed fazed by it (even if he was internally). I said I was worried my face would look like that forever (it did not, I am fully recovered), and he said \u201cthat is okay, I will not feel any different about you, and we will laugh about it and life will go on.\u201d It seems cliche, but it helped. \n2. He reminded me that no feeling lasts forever. The pain, the sadness, none of it would last forever. I only needed to get through the season that it would. \n3. Encouraging rest and self care was really important. Finding things that encouraged me. For example, our faith is important to us, so when I would get upset, he would pray together with me and just provide comfort. Watching happy movies or tv shows. Having a meal I love. Positive things to take my mind off of it. \n4. I took pictures every day making a variety of facial expressions so I could track the micro progressions. Sometimes it was hard to see it, but when I looked at the pictures, I noticed I actually was getting better. This encouraged me a lot. Thank you! Did they find out or test him for what illness gave him bells? My bf was really sick a week before getting Bell\u2019s palsy so they thought he had an infection, but it turns out he actually got bit by a tick and got lymes disease. This made him have serious exhaustion, body aches, muscles pain, joints hurting, headaches, etc. We had no idea he even got bit by a tick! But it explained all of the symptoms! It may sound cheesy, but I tried to remind myself that because I only had half my smile, I needed to use it twice as often - a difficult proposition at first. I also used the opportunity to talk about Bell\u2019s with others, as it is much more prevalent than I knew beforehand. Something else to think about is that this is a sudden and potentially permanent change. It caused me to really examine my life in a way that focused on mortality, and I did not like everything I saw. If you are just starting your life together, it might be a great opportunity to examine what is most important to you both individually and collectively. Losing your face in an hour or so really drives home the fact that everything can change in an instant. Lastly, I will share that I did not fully recover, despite extensive work and physical therapy. If you prepare for the possibility that nerve damage may be permanent and irreversible, every bit of progress is a huge win worthy of celebration. Being able to drink from a glass again was a big one for me. Good luck to you both, and speedy recovery. For me, nothing helped the pain while it was happening other than to sleep. I had really horrible pain all in my ear and down my neck on the affected side. It lasted a couple of weeks unfortunately. \n\nFor me it was necessary to rest and sleep as much as possible! I did not want to see people most days either which was hard as a teacher! I ended up missing 13 days of work across 3 school weeks until the pain subsided. \n\nAs for not wanting to see people I loved that my husband was home with me, lots of movie watching! I was diagnosed right before my husbands work schedule so my dad made me go back to his apartment to stay for 4 days so I was not alone while my husband was working. The rest of the time he was home when he could be and was just overall great. Maybe try planning some indoor low key activities, order some food in - line up some great movies, and just let them experience what they are feeling, I HATED having to wear a brave face for everyone else I was bummed and sad and I was able to feel that at home it was a safe place! Almost a year since I got Bell\u2019s palsy, the thing I wish my SO had done more of was to continue to compliment me the same way he did before I was paralysed. He was absolutely wonderful and super supportive but the way he changed his compliments really sat in my throat. \nIt is also very good that when your fianc\u00e9 has to go somewhere in public and he is nervous that he may be asked about the paralysis that you go with him and give people who are staring the stink eye. My sister did this for me and it helped so much. \nI also recommend going to therapy, it really is quite a shock, for me personally it would have been easier to have half my body paralysed than my face since so much of your persona is tied to your face. \n\nI also recommend taking photos every day trying to move his face, smiling, opening wide, lifting eyebrows etc. it is so easy to not notice the day to day changes. \n\nI also covered the huge mirrors that are all over my apartment since I got kind of a shock every time I saw myself and started crying, it is really hard to try to act normal when it is literally staring you in the face all the time. \n\nRegarding the pain using moist heat helped me a lot, I recommend wetting a washcloth in warm water and placing it on the face with a heating pad on top to keep it warm longer. No. He just started Wellbutrin and we thought that might be it. My mom said her friend would get it when something major in his life happened that was very stressful and he is been dealing with anxiety and it was a rough week before he got it. So I am thinking they might be it Thank you! Yeah that is exactly how he is been. He said nothing but the sleep helps and being really really high \ud83d\ude02 we are both not working right now so I have been here helping him when needed and lots of tv watching. He is been liking the mask thing now since he can hide most of his face!!! But I do give people the stink eye a lot Ohh girl I do not blame him one little bit! It really helps just to have a person around who is patient and understanding with it! My poor husband had to deal with me crying a lot over it all when I could not keep the brave face on anymore, but I appreciate him so much for it. I sincerely hope his pain does not last long! Sending you all good vibes! Thank you! I hope so too! I had intense pain! I felt like I got beat with a baseball bat. My doctor said \u201cyou should not have any pain\u201d and accused me of just wanting opioids... I had a 12 level spinal fusion a year earlier and that pain was nothing compared to my face pain. \n\nMy partner was supportive, it is been over 2 years and I still have about 15% paralysis. It is permanent now. I would say just be there for him and tell him it is not a big deal and that most of his movement will probably come back. How severe was his paralysis? I had nearly 100% paralysis in my left side.", "Anyone experience facial pain Hi.\n\nI was diagnosed with BP 8 days ago and within 24 hours I was on Prednisone and Valacyclovir.  During my first 7 days all I did was rest by laying on my couch watching TV and read.  Since I finished the prednisone, Ive experienced sharp facial pains around the ear and down the jawline of the affected side.  Anyone else experiencing pain at all within the first couple of weeks? Still dealing with BP 2 months after diagnosis but thankfully no pain at all.  The pain lasted only 1 week.  Unfortunately, there has been hardly any improvement with recovering from BP.", "Are facial spasms normal on the affected side? I just got diagnosed today and  was wondering if that is normal. I was having some really intense twitching/pulsing on my eye/eyebrow all day before noticing something was up, now having that same thing again. Worried that that might mean it is getting worse. Hey, I had that same experience. \n\n( two months ago when I was in my first week of Bell's. /u/BennyPendentes commented ( about how the twitches were nerve endings returning to normal, although stating that it would get worse before it got better which was totally accurate in my case. About a month after that I had recovered completely. So I take the spasms as a good sign!\n\nI hope your recovery is swift! Stay positive. When my affected side started spasming, that side started to get better.  So this might be a mark of improvement for you!\n\nI do want to warn you, however, that I also started getting a nasty pain on that side while the nerve started to work again.  While not excruciating, at times I was a zombie due to the amount of pain I experienced and its location (right below the ear).  This also could be a good sign, but I would recommend calling your doctor to verify that things are going well. Thanks! I will do my best  Thank you! I had the spasms and the pain behind the ear before I started showing", "Hope! My 3 week road-to-recovery from Bells Palsy. Hi all,\n\nI was diagnosed with Bells on December 2nd, 2016. As of December 25th, I was almost 100% back to my good-old self. \n\nI would like to share my experience because I relied on the wonderful people/insights of Reddit when times got tough. Bells is not easy; I felt embarrassed, ashamed, and depressed throughout the process. But there is hope. Hopefully this will help someone, somewhere. \n\nNovember 30th- I had a normal Wednesday. Celebrated a friend's promotion in the evening, drank a bit too much. \n\nDecember 1st- Tough morning. Went in to work, also had dental work done in the afternoon. Nothing out of the norm, routine cleaning. **starting to feel aggressive twitching in my upper lip, and lower lip (between chin and mouth) on the right side of my face. Thought nothing of it\n\nDecember 2nd- Woke up with a partially paralyzed face. I was not able to hold water in my mouth. Luckily, my wife recognized that things were not normal, and we rushed to the ER\n\nDiagnosed with Bells Palsy. No family history of the condition, nor no prior recollection of cases with friends. \n\nMy diagnosed was \"minor\" according to the ER doctor. He prescribed me 5 days of prednisone, and 10 days of acyclovir. 30 minutes later, I was on my way. \n\nDecember 3rd- things got much worse. I could not close my right eye, mouth would not move AT ALL on the right side! This was when I got very nervous. \n\nAs most of us do, I immediately went to a second \"doctor,\" the internet. Lesson learned, stay away from obsessing about different stories. Chances are you will recover. Do not stress yourself out. \n\nDecember 4th through 11th, things for much, much worse. I lost all movement on my right side. From my forehead, to my nose, to my chin, I had what felt to be severe BP. So much for \"mild\" right? During this period, I tried massaging my face, breathing exercises, eating cloves of garlic (seriously) and consuming copious amount of olive oil. Nothing was working. In fact, I felt like things were getting worse each and every day. \n\nIn my mind, I was running out of options. Cue deep depression. I felt hideous. My wife said that was the darkest she had ever seen me. I did not want to leave home, I did not want to speak (especially F's, P's and B's!) and all I wanted to do was sleep. In my mind, recovery was hopeless. \n\nOn the morning of 12/12, I decided that I had enough. I had to keep trying and keep fighting. I am the sole provider between me and my wife, so I could not let her down. \n\nI decided to call an acupuncturist. Now, my family is full of doctors, so I grew up in a household where acupuncture was \"not real\" and only offered patients the \"placebo effect.\" But, desperate times call for desperate measures. I booked an appointment that day. \n\nMy acu practices ancient Asian acupuncture techniques. He believes blood \"to a minor extent\" is good, and minor pain/discomfort is necessary. Further, he also believes heavily in STIM, or tiny electric pulses in affected area. \n\nMy first consultation with the acu lasted about 1 hour. He encouraged me to meditate during the process. Once completed, I got on with my day, with no immediate results. \n\nFast forward to that same night, that I started to feel micro-movements in my cheek. \n\nThe next day, I set up three more appointments spanning until December 20th. \n\nAs of today, and as early as even 12/25, I can say that I am now &gt;95% recovered. \n\nA few things that I observed to be helpful:\n1. Speed at which BP was identified and diagnosed\n2. Relaxation during the first few days. While I did have episodes of great panic, the \"mild\" diagnosed made me feel more at ease. \n3. I work a high-stress job. I was not able to take time-off. This was certainly detrimental. But I had a wonderful support system in my wife. \n4. Acupuncture and STIM. I decided to try acupuncture since it was in NIH's write up of BP. If NIH trusts that acupuncture COULD help with BP, why not give it a try. I am now a real believer. Most insurance companies will cover part or most of the treatment as well...\n\nAgain, I truly hope this helps. There is hope; please do not lose sight of beating this terrible condition.  Also, just to note, I did not feel any improvements until I started with the acupuncture. I have had it twice. First time I was freaked out, went to ER, docs, etc.  Went away after about 2-3 weeks.  Few years later I got the lip twitch and weird tongue feelings again, crap. This time I just rode it out, no doctors, no medicine. Cleared up in 2-3 weeks. Been over a decade so fingers crossed anytime my face twitches! Yeah I am currently in the early stages of BP. Reading this helped a lot with how I have been feeling.\n\nLost taste on the right side of my tongue first on the 11/1 and thought it was down to a rather severe ulcer in the same area. Woke up two days later and found I could not blink my right eye properly and over that day that side of my face deteriorated. \n\nLuckily managed to get a doctors appointment the same day and the BP diagnosis was given and the standard medication (from reading this sub) was prescribed: Prednisolone and Acyclovir.\n\nThe following few days (early this week) has been difficult. I am in my early 20's and live alone so I have had a lot of time to torture myself inside my head. Family/friends/colleagues have been nothing but supportive and I am thinking now that it looks worse than it actually does. Eating in public is probably the most embarrassing thing for me.\n\nI am hopeful for a decent recovery, I have been having faint tingles in the eyelid/mouth over yesterday and today. At least I am thinking they are good signs. I only worry about how the opposite sex will view it as I am not the most confident person at the best of times.  \n\nAlthough I will add that me and my, now ex-girlfriend, breaking up last week also contributed to rather dark and depressing feelings over the last few days. \n\nAnyway I have rambled enough now, it is good to hear that swift improvements are possible and I am just hoping I do not have a severe case. I can shut my eye with effort so sleeping is not too bad. I just have no movement whatsoever of my lips on that side. I am not planning on having any extra appointments at this point.  How is your recovery coming along? Very well thanks actually.\n\nToday is day 27 since diagnosis and I would say that I have roughly 80% of functionality recovered. Still the odd little bit of pain, lack of movement and trouble with retaining fluid in my mouth. But overall if it was to stay like this I would probably take it considering where I was.\n\nI am now assuming my case was not too bad, I was just given no indication at diagnosis how severe it was. Reading some other comments on this sub has made me realise further that I have been lucky. The only issue left is that I am still not sleeping brilliantly (4-6hrs a night) but I do not know if that is related.\n\nI am in a much better place mentally now with awful January out of the way and February is looking better!\n\nI hope your recovery is going well and continues that way.", "HSV and Bells I got bells about 3 months ago and found out I had HSV2 antibodies (bells is normally caused by HSV 1 but also, who really knows anything about bells lol). Has anyone who has HSV-2 (or 1)  gotten Bells more than once? Do you get it every time its re activated??\n\nAlso, bells was super traumatic. Does anyone else have extreme anxiety about it coming back?? I have lasting symptoms (tinitus, eye issues, bone pain around my eyes/cheeks) so hopefully that is not a sign I am more prone to another episode. I wish everyone the best of luck with recovery, this is such an unfortunate medical issue and it sucks there is no concrete answers to anything.", "Mouth sores before BP? Anyone else have crazy painful sores in their mouth before getting BP? On 7/13 I got a cluster of really painful blisters on my tongue that were so painful I cried and could hardly eat. Dentist told me it was probably from an burn and gave me some expensive antioxidant/essential oil gel that did nothing. Fast forward to 7/18, sores are healing but still painful. Suddenly the right side of my face stops working right. I am terrified. Today I got diagnosed with BP, and based on the pictures, the MD said the sores on my tongue were cold sores/herpes simplex virus that triggered the BP. Really pissed my dentist did not catch this, because maybe we could have treated them with antivirals and skipped the BP. But I have antivirals and steroids now, and am hopeful for a full recovery. Sigh. So 2020. So sorry to hear, this was not my experience at all :/ Yes! I had the first cold sore I have ever had in my life that week.  Pain behind my ear on the side of my head, Dr. thought it was a migraine.  Within a few days of the cold sore is when it hit. Mine was in my ear. It started out with what I thought was an ear infection on a Friday, waited out the weekend and saw doctor. Doctor said my eardrum looked fine, sent me home with allergy meds. It got worse as the week progressed and called a teledoc because I thought I had a sinus infection and my office was closed in observance of Independence Day. Doctor prescribed antibiotics on Friday based on symptoms. I got worse, started puking my guts out and losing strength on the side of my face, my ear is excruciating at this point (I have a crazy high pain tolerance, so this is saying a lot), and go to the ER Sunday morning (9 days after first onset of ear pain) and diagnosed with shingles in my ear and BP. ER doc said they would have missed it without the blisters, so there was nothing they could have done to prevent the BP. Started antivirals and prednisone about 48(ish) hours after first onset of symptoms (my lip looked a little weird after I first started antibiotics for suspected sinus infection, but I thought that was just swelling from being so damn sick. The full effects of BP started the morning I had my husband take me to the ER) and am currently 15 days post diagnosis. I have some movement on my affected side, but not a lot. I cannot taste at all, and can only hear about 10% of anything on my affected side, and am popping ibuprofen like candy still. Vertigo\u2019s really bad if I leave my house so I cannot drive yet, and I get really tired doing small tasks, so I am pretty dependent on other people to do things for me, which is still pretty rough. There is really nothing the doctors could have done to stop it, unfortunately It did not happen to me, but I would not surprise me at all that they are related. I think the common understanding is that the herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, can actually cause Bell's Palsy Yep, sores on the side of my tongue. Exactly what happened to me! Weird. Had you had a cold sore before? My doctor said that the first time a person gets a cold sore, it is usually a cluster inside the mouth, rather than on the lip like they happen subsequently. Did not know that. Seems like BP experiences are very variable! Very very similar to my experience! How was/is your recovery? I am so sorry to hear about your awful experience! My heart empathizes with you! I have not had nearly as intense of other symptoms. But I also cannot taste well either. Everything is slightly bitter. The facial nerve is responsible for the front 2/3 of taste buds though, so it makes sense. I am a speech pathologist and learned all this in school, but never thought I would experience it so personally. Sending prayers and wishes for healing. I am right there with you!! Yes, that is what my research has said too! I had no idea. I have been under more stress than ever in the last 3 weeks, so I think that triggered the cold sores and then the BP. Stress comes out in the body, man. The body keeps the score \ud83d\ude23 I am so sorry.  Mine came on really without much warning. I had a nagging headache below my ear for about a day, and my family had been sick a week before with the sniffles. Good luck on your healing! Odds are you will be back to normal before you know it. Thank you! Prayers for you as well!! If I had a worst enemy, I would not even wish this on them. I am feeling a little better every day, but this is TOUGH! It is SO tough!!! It takes a huge toll mentally and emotionally in a way no other health issue I have faced has. This is only day 4 for me, but I am worn out. Glad I am teleworking right now and have some flexibility in my schedule, because it is embarrassing and emotionally exhausting. I keep waking up multiple times in the night panicking that I cannot move or feel my face. It really does!! If you can, vegging out on the couch and falling asleep while watching movies has been a huge help for me. Rest is supposed to be the way to heal from it, and I find the more I rest, the better I start to feel. I am on day 17 and am starting to feel a little more energy come back every day Nope. Never ever before.\n\nMy Bells hit about 10 months ago and it is about 85% recovered. And my tongue is all cleared up, of course, but it is now on one side slightly more sensitive than the other. That is good to hear! How quickly did you start seeing recovery? How severe were your symptoms to begin with? It is so hard waiting to see improvement, but I know it can be a long road. It was a few weeks before I saw improvement.\n\n(\n\nGet plenty of rest. Have a heat pack on your face often. Do the face exercises. And consider acupuncture - it is been great for me. Hello,\n\nI Am a nursing student just providing some insight/information upon bells palsy. Please consult your doctor prior to taking any action and for more information. Yes, the cold sores are a reactivation of herpes vesicles which also proceed to facial paralysis in and around the ear. The characteristics for bells palsy include not being able to wrinkle your forehead, eyeball rolls up, eyelid does not close, flat nasolabial fold, and paralysis of the lower face. Also, it would be best to chew on the unaffected side and make sure to use eye-protection such as dark glasses and artificial tears. \n\nHolman, H. C., Williams, D., Sommer, S., Johnson, J., Ball, B.

So the last few weeks the left side of my face has felt kind of funny. I cannot still smile and my eyes blink and I can do everything normally, but it just feels off. Both of my ears ache but nothing awful and I do not have an infection or anything. I get headaches every now and then but again it is nothing. I also have very dry eyes and my left eye feels a bit weak. I keep moving the left side of my mouth to make sure it works and have been doing it about 100 times everyday for the last week just to make sure I am still \u201cnormal\u201d lol. Does this sound like I am getting Bell\u2019s palsy or am I just an anxious wreck. I have been to the doctors but she says it is unlikely  Sounds nothing like when I got BP.   Are you concerned because you have had BP before? It does not sound anything like my onset. I do not think onset typically lasts as long as a few weeks. Personally, I had some twitching the day before that I thought nothing of, but losing feeling on one side and then looking in the mirror to see stroke-face is pretty much how it goes. So yeah, you are over reacting. If you feel off talk to your Dr. Sounds like you may have some serious anxiety. I have never had it before. Idk I do have pain in my left ear that is worse the more I think about it. It is been almost a month so idk what to do haha", "Question about Menstruation &amp; BP Hello! i know this is an odd question, but does anyone with a active menstrual cycle experience symptoms of bells palsy whenever on their period after recovery?\n\nI had BP back in may and it took awhile to get my face back, but every month during my cycle, my ear pain starts up again, only on the BP side, along with eye issues (eyelid struggling to close &amp; stay closed at night) , and my partner just pointed out that i always complain about the taste of food during it too, and i did not notice that)\n\nBut my BP, started with severe ear pain and my food tasted weird.  So now every month i get the same stuff.\n\nI have tried to find any correlation to this on google, but since the general \"research\" is usually in people over 50, finding this statistic/ study is hard.  I just wanted to see if this is just something that is specific to me, or if anyone else experiences this. I was told stress triggers those things, and periods and pms def can be stress triggers. I had my bells palsy two years ago this upcoming January and I still get bad ear pain and facial muscle twinges when my anxiety acts up. \n\nDoctors unfortunately do not seem to have much answers for this condition. Thank you! if stress is a trigger then i am kind of screwed then. Because that is what set it off in the first place.\n\nThank you so much for this answer, because i was starting to worry that it is something else. Happy to be of help.\n\nMine started from a tooth infection... But ugh, do I feel your pain. Most days my anxiety runs my life and now this is just another \"thing\" to complicate it all.\n\nWishing you the best, *snuggles* I even went to my doc for another round of steroids and antibiotics about 7 months after healing bc I was scared it was returning. Baaaaaad idea, the steroids shot my already flaring up anxiety thru the roof to the point I was dizzy with such high bp and got no relief from the pain or twitching. \n\nSo yeah, def do not do that :P i wish you the best as well!!!!! thank you for this! \n\nAnxiety is such a monster. i did not get the steroids in the first place because it took so long to get an appointment and i was terrified of trying them!\n\nI am so sorry you went through that twice!!!!! steroids are bad enough once, but twice?! and while worried that it was BP coming back... no no no no nooooope! Hey, I just came to this sub for the first time with a similar question!! I get pain on the bells side of my face every month or so and could not work out what could be causing it. I had bells about 4 years ago and made a full recovery after about 6 months. \n\nThis post made me realise that, at least this time around, my pain has started a few days after my period ended! I wonder if they are related, I would never considered it before. It is so bizarre is not it?! i wish there was more research into this!!!!!!\n\nThat is just, i wish we knew what was going on with the cycle and flare up, but now that i know there is someone else out there, well a few someones it is like... maybe this is a thing I am definitely going to monitor it to find out if they are related! I may pop back and comment in a few months time with my findings lol\n\nTbh medical research into anything to do with menstruation is pretty woeful so I would not be surprised if this sort of thing slipped under the radar So true!!!!! i hope there is an answer to this, but like clockwork, every month when my period begins it is like \"hello ear pain and ringing randomly\" and that eye issue! i am thankful i still have eyedrops and patches for nighttime for that exact reason still!!!! i think keeping track is the only way, and atleast now there is one post on here about this, so hopefully others can contribute.", "I can now whistle! Diagnosed 6 June, today 26 June l can now whistle. I am happy and l hope this means l am getting closer to complete recovery? Awesome news! \u2764\ud83e\udde1 Oh nice! My lips and tongue are the least recovered of the left side of my face. Still cannot whistle after being diagnosed 4 wks ago. But I can now move the area around my left eye, so I am glad for that.\n\nHopefully, we are just improving at different rates and in different areas, but still improving just the same.  Wishing you a speedy and complete recovery. Being able to move the area around your left eye is some positive news, a good sign of recovery in motion. Stay strong and remember to do your facial exercises or massages. Whistling in reverse is the only way I can whistle. Blowing out my cheek makes raspberry noises, but if I breath in harder and purse my lips I will whistle went a long time not being able to call my dogs till I figured that trick out.\n\nImprovise, adapt, overcome.", "Had Bells Palsy since 2 days ago. How long does it take meds to take effect? I was prescribed antiviral and steroids. How long should I have to wait until the meds take effect? Also, i was only prescribed about 10 days worth of these meds and i was told to make sure to finish them. I heard some people took couple months to fully cure. Then what do i do after 10 days when i do not have meds left? Do i have to go see the doctor again and get more meds? Or is 10 days worth meds enough? So what if its not cured or fully cured by then? Just resting will do it?\n\nI am so sorry about my newbie questions. \n\nThanks. ", "Had nerve damage during zygomatic arch surgery, after 11 months of slow progress affected side still not recovered. Is there hope for improvement after so long? (Assymetrical muscle contraction)  I do not think you are going to get much response here.  Nerve damage from surgery might not have the same recovery as Bell's Palsy.\n\nThere might be another sub you could try?\n\nThat being said, I can barely tell a difference in your photo.  Most people with BP recover fully or awfully close, and that photo is definitely in the \"awfully close\" category, IMO. I would be thrilled if my eyebrow/forehead would move as much as yours does.", "Just diagnosed on Sunday. Prednisone advice please. I just got diagnosed with BP on Sunday. I know that Prednisone is supposed to help but I am terrified to take it!\nI need honest feedback about what to expect from the side effects. Can anyone chime in please? I would never taken a steroid before, so I do not have an experience to compare it with (meaning, a lot of these feelings I am going to describe could be from other factors: stress, the antiviral, etc), but it just kind of made me feel...amped up? Almost like having too much caffeine, but without the jitters. I felt like my heart was beating really hard, although not any faster.    \n\n\nOtherwise not many side effects. Take it in the mornings with food. It made me lose so much sleep the week I had to take it, so you may lose some sleep too. I was anxious a lot of the time while on it. Honestly I did not like it, but it will help. I finished my dose, and I did have some cold turkey side effects (nausea, diarrhea) for like 3-5 days. I gained control of my weak side\u2019s eyebrow and whole bottom lip when I finished my prescription.\n\nWishing you a speedy recovery. I am on week 3 now. Things will look up in the future.\ud83c\udf37\n\nEdit: spelling Thank you. I already suffer from anxiety and panic attacks so adding the steroid makes me imagine I will be in a rolling panic attack the entire time. I appreciate the feedback. Zero side effects for me. In fact, I did not think that side effects were a thing to worry about. You are welcome! I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks too. It was not fun, but try your best to use that peppy energy watching funny movies or something enjoyable while you rest on the couch as much as you can. \n\nI forgot to add, Idk if you have kids (and if u do not, just ignore this part) but if you do, try to have your partner/family/friends watch them if you can while you are on prednisone. That at least helped me be a little less anxious Took 7 days of prednisone all in the morning before 9am per the instructions I got and never got any side effects. Once you start taking the prednisone you can see the inflammation go down pretty quickly(like a few days in I could already feel my lymph nodes swelling go down). Honestly stuck with the prescription and I should be fine. Wishing u a speedy recovery :) Take it as instructed by your doctor. This greatly improves your chance of a full recovery, so do not mess around. It is only really effective if taken in the first 72 hours from onset of symptoms, so do not mess around!\n\nFor what it is worth, it made me a little jittery and my sleep was not the best, but many people do not have any side effects at all. You want the prednisone. I promise you. I have major anxiety about medications, and I understand. But what terrified me a bit more was the paralysis being permanent. Tell yourself you are going to be okay (statistics say you will), throw \u2018them back, and watch yourself get better. Take photos everyday so you can see the little changes! I had minor side effects, mostly just insomnia. But the BP symptoms were way worse. It is going to work out, be kind to yourself right now \u2764\ufe0f", "Bells Palsy and Pregnancy Has anyone else been diagnosed with BP while pregnant? Apparently it is 2-3x more common when pregnant but of course, I still worry. I was officially diagnosed today and they offered me the steroid but there are risks to the baby of course. So I took the prescription and will be getting a second opinion before deciding what to do.\n\nHas anyone else been in this situation? What did you do? I got bells when i was 34 weeks pregnant with my 3rd baby. I got the steroid shot right away (I am married to a doctor). My bells ended up permanent (only have 25% of my nerve back) which is pretty rare to happen. Baby is 3 years old now and perfect. If you have any questions let me know! Yup. I was diagnosed with BP at 39&amp;1 with a planned cesarean happening only two days later. I had a cold already and with pregnancy lowering my immune system, it was like why not add this too? Hehe. Do not worry about it too much. Sucked not being able to smile in her newborn photos but oh well. Been about a year now and am like 95% recovered. I am not so much worried about myself. It is taking the steroid and the risk to the baby. I am only 9 weeks so baby is still developing you know what I mean. If I was 39 weeks, the baby is fully developed already right?  The risk is chance of low birth weight or cleft lip. And now I am reading that if I do not take the steroid there is a chance I could have permanent paralysis. This is so hard \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14 I am not pregnant, but I just got diagnosed today and I empathize with you! This is one of the hardest things I have been through with my health \ud83d\ude23Sending prayers and wishes for healing, and protection for your baby \u2764\ufe0f I am 38+4 weeks pregnant and was just diagnosed. I am calling my doctor in the morning before taking the steroid.\n\nHow did your case turn out? Did you take the medicine? How was the baby? Did your bp clear up? I never ended up taking any medication. I spoke with my gynecologist and he said if I could hold off on it then to wait until my BP worsened - when I spoke with him, I was not at my worst yet. Again, I was 9 weeks pregnant at the time and he said that I am at risk of baby developing a cleft lip or low birth weight since baby was still a fetus and had yet to fully develop as opposed to someone (like yourself) who is just about at full term and baby is fully developed. I told myself I was not going to even risk taking the medication if that is the risk to the baby. I would rather take years for myself to recover - if that was the case - rather than have my child have a lifetime resentment towards me. BUT again, I never took the steroid and I fully recovered within 6 weeks. The recovery process for me STARTED at 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. \nMy GP recommended acupuncture and physio. I was unable to connect with my physio due to Covid so I went on with Acupuncture. Whether acupuncture helped or not, I definitely do not regret going. Hi. I was diagnosed with BP when I was 37 weeks pregnant. I am 12 weeks in and still got no movement. I am doing acupuncture and a few sessions of cold laser therapy. Can I ask when did you had your first \u201cmovement\u201d?", "First week of BP! Hey \ud83d\udc4b first post in relation to BP. I was diagnosed on Monday night after my symptoms started Saturday night. First of all it was the right side of my mouth, then my right eye started twitching annoyingly lol. Then by Monday I could not close my eye and I noticed a slight drop in the right side. I have been given a strong dose of steroids for a 10 day course. They think it is been brought on after receiving dental treatment on my nerve on the Friday it can be a rare complication. \nSince then no Dr I have spoken to seem to tell me anything other than it is temporary and not to worry. No one seems to tell me what it actually is, any tips etc how long it will last is it right it is been getting worse - blurry eye, double vision etc.  I have been taken x2 drops a few times a day and one at night. \nI am just abit lost with it at the minuet. I am also off work because of it as my job is physical and required to drive but I cannot drive with my eyesight! \n\nAny tips/stories/ advice would be appreciated! And if you were off work how long until you were back? Has anyone had the same eye symptoms ?\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude0a Hey there. Welcome to the club.\n\nFirst of all, BP is not necessarily temporary. The large majority of people who get it regain 90+% face control, which is counted as a full recovery as far as I gather. Some people do not recover as much though.\n\nBut again, statistics are on your side. You will most probably recover pretty well in time :)\n\nAs for how long it takes, that is very different for people. Personally I recovered 99% in 30 days. I saw absolutely no improvement until day 15 or so where I could suddenly move my eyebrow a millimeter up, and from then I saw steady improvements every day.\n\nOnce you feel ready for it, I strongly advise you start doing face exercises. Personally I started right away, but I know that other people here recommend waiting a bit. Maybe once you feel the worst swelling in your facial nerve is over? Up to you when you start, but I highly recommend doing it :)\n\nWear an eye patch when outside or doing activities that might put your eye at risk. Making food and stuff like that.\n\nAt night I recommend taping your eye shut with medical tape. But if that irritates your skin too much, use an eyepatch padded down with some fabric on similar to keep your eye closed.\n\nI think that is all for my rambling wall of text with tips and advice. Let me know if you have any questions :)  Get some B12 tablets, massage your face daily &amp; lots of rest! It took me 4 months to fully recover and most people (85%) fully recover whether it be in a month or 9 months. Hope u see normal again soon xxx", "Worried I might have Bell's palsy  \n\n\u00a0I have been living with reoccurring chronic shingles for close to twenty years now. I originally got it when I was in college.\u00a0 I have always feared getting Bell's palsy.\u00a0 I figured I am more susceptible because I already have nerve damage.\u00a0 My shingles are on my butt and the back of my knees. I have always been grateful that at least they are not on my face but now I am feeling nerve pain\u00a0 in my upper left cheek when I try to smile or make any kind of facial expression.\u00a0 My left ear also feels a little bit clogged. And lately I have had a very dry throat and raspy voice.\n\n\u00a0I am in the USA with no health insurance but I could go to Urgent Care. Should I ask for steroids? What do I need to do to prevent it from getting worse?\n\n\u00a0When I was a little kid I remember my dad had Bell's Palsy. He was in bed for months crying saying he wanted to die. So I really want to prevent this from getting any worse if possible.\u00a0 And I think chronic butt shingles is enough torture for one lifetime. My bells palsy showed up on a Saturday and the right side of my fave was completely paralyzed by the Sunday.  My brother had bells palsy years ago so I knew what was happening.  I went to the ER where they gave me medication.  They said it was good that I came in right away. \n\nMy face was paralyzed for months.  It did not hurt.  I had to tape my eye shut and drooled more than would have liked.  I was mostly afraid of how I looked.  It did not affect my ears or my throat.\n\nI have no idea if this is what is happening to you but I suggest going to a doctor. What kind of medication did they give you? If I take steroids will there be side effects? It is Prednisolone, it is about 3.5 and half every day for 11 days, then 3 at day 6, 2.5 at day 7.. like degressive, that was for somebody that weights 70kg. When it comes to side effects of prednisolone, it can change your mood and make you irritable, that is from what I know I was put on 40 mg of prednisone a day for five days and Valtrex, an antiviral med, for 7 days. It is my understanding combining steroids and anti-virals may boost recovery but the meds should be started within 3 days of noticing symptoms. \nIt is been about three weeks since I went to the ER and my face looks almost 100 percent normal. I think I am the only one who still notices. When I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy, they checked the ear on the affected side. Apparently when Bell\u2019s Palsy is caused by the shingles virus, you can often see a rash in the ear canal. If you see that, go to urgent care. You will likely be prescribed steroids and antivirals.\nRegardless, if you start to see paralysis in your face also go to urgent care. You must start steroids within 72h of onset of paralysis to maximise your chance of full recovery. The quicker you get treatment the better. Never taken Prednisolone but they gave me Valtrex for shingles and it did not help. Maybe because they could not figure out what it was till 2 weeks too late.\nIf I do not feel better tomorrow I will go to urgent care and ask for Prednisolone.  thanks Is that what happened to you- you had shingles first and then it went to your ear?\n\nIs Prednisolone a steroid or will they give  Prednisolone  and a steroid and probably prescribe Valtrex too?\n\nI hope you are better now. I try not to be a hypochondriac but I worry about shingles spreading to my ear or eyes and I go deaf or blind. Mine was not caused by the shingles virus. It is a bit of a mystery of what caused it as I have had none of the viruses that are most likely to cause it. Just know the ear thing as the doctor explained what she was doing.\nI was prescribed Prednisolone (yep it is a steroid) 60mg a day (maximum legal dose in the UK) for 5 days then 10mg less per day for the next 5 days. They initially were just going to have me come back in after 5 days to review how I was coping with such a large dose before prescribing any more but I was travelling back to my parents for Christmas so they compromised with that.\nI was not prescribed antivirals as they could not identify the virus that caused it so I cannot advise which medication you would expect. I am aware that antivirals are prescribed as standard in the UK if Bell\u2019s Palsy is caused by the shingles virus.\nMay I suggest googling Facial Palsy UK. They are a charity that provides great information about Bell\u2019s Palsy like what to expect and how to manage it.\nHope this is just a false alarm and if not you have a speedy recovery!", "2nd bout of BP this year So back in March I got my first ever BP diagnosis, it came off the back of developing double vision and so it was believed to be a stroke, but two MRIs later and I was told it was Bell\u2019s palsy. I immediately did acupuncture / short course of steroids, and regained basically 100% mobility within a month. Felt very lucky. However on Saturday I noticed eating felt a little strange, and on Sunday had begun to droop on the other side of the face. Spoke to my GP and I am back on steroids, it seems to be much milder this time, and at least I did not think I was having a stroke so the whole situation is much less stressful, but i was wondering if anyone had been so similar? Two bouts so close together, only been about 3.5 months since recovery. My Physical Therapist said I wear my stress on my face. I am to focus on just \u201c being.\u201d I am learning mediation. I did not have mine that close together but I had two bouts in 2 years \nHeat packs were my best friend under the ear of the paralysed side\nAnd I did my own muscle therapy with YouTube videos\nThe videos really helped me out I feel it moved progress along a bit quicker I just searched \u201cBell\u2019s palsy facial exercises\u201d\n\nWhen I am stressed I feel the nerves get tight on my previously affected side, normally I just give myself a \u201ctime out\u201d and sit in the quiet and breathe \n\n\n\nI hope you recover quickly", "Does anyone think that it takes longer to heal after the vaccine? Hi guys! I got my second round of bells palsy 2 months after the vaccine after not having it for 11 years. Currently, I am going to acupuncture and taking supplements. Already finished my prednisone and alyclovir. Has anyone noticed that bells palsy takes longer to cure after the vaccine?\n\nI am not sure if it is related to it, but I find it very random that it came 11 years later. Today marks week 4 of bells palsy and I have not had much movement, but my face is less stiff and i can blink and taste better Nope. I got my bells in May 2019 and was at about 80% recovered when I got my shots in December 2020/January 2021. Now I am about 85% recovered. Sometimes it just takes a long time to heal, or never does. I am 10 years later too. Had the vaccine in May, got BP, and I am healing much slower this go around. It is been almost three months. Ugh!\n\nI have had more movement after pursuing acupuncture, but it is still a slow process. My dad happened to get Bell\u2019s palsy after the vaccine as well..never had it prior. I asked him to report it as an adverse effect since he was not aware there was an association between the two. I am sorry you are going through this again and hope for a speedy recovery. Not in my case, I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy about 1.5 months after my 2nd dose of the vaccine and recovered 100% by the 8th week (first signs of movement by the 14th day). The healing process is such a different experience for everyone, it is difficult to say what will affect one person versus another. Always a good reminder that everyone heals differently. Thanks! Nice you are getting some movement! And sorry you have to deal with it too :( I do not have much movement yet (have been doing acupuncture since the day I got it) I think I was stressing myself out tho :( trying to be better at it. Good luck to you!! Thank you!! I hope your dad heals well too &lt;3 You are def right about that and I always need to remind myself everyone heals differently. Thanks!", "Can you have permanent \u201esoft\u201c BP? I thought I was crazy. For years i have always seen me on pictures and only saw the asymmetry, esp in my smile.. The corners of my mouth on the right side were just.. Idk hoe to describe it, they did not lift like they were (are still) supposed to. But nobody has brought it up directly. I would say it is rather subtle, but I definitely see it. The whole asymmetrical thing ruined my perception of my face in my teenage years. Specifically my nose, it has no defined tip and a bit crooked from the front (probably a severely deviated septum). But that I made peace with. I\u2018m now almost 20, I\u2018d say I have observed the imbalance in muscle control since I was maybe around 15-16..\n\nI brought this up to a doctor the last time i went and he immediately said, after looking at bothes halves for a bit, that yes, the right side looks more stiff. I can smile and stuff, but It really just looks forced and not at all attractive like on my left side. Less eyebrow control also on the right side. It can feel a bit rustrating at times even, it feels like i cant reach the spot i want to raise. I alr got an anger fold between the eyebrows, but only on the left side, not the right one. I wanted to ascribe this to normal facial asymmetry every body has, but it is just really weird how i have so little muscle control on this side compared to the left side of my face. \n\nCheeks more stiff and looks thicker, eyebrow droopy on the eye, generally looks more compressed. My jaw also is more defined on the left side- probably not that significant to the issue though. Maybe it is bc i have slept on it? Idk. He said would recommend me to a neurologist, because apparently, It could be cured and not at all sth i should just be putting up with.\n\nHas anybody got some advice? It is indeed possible that you got soft BP and never recovered from it. Not really much to do about it. Idk if it is the case, but it is possible... Does this also explain my head tilt to the right side?  I got Bell's palsy when I was a baby and although I \"recovered\" I have never been able to fully smile or raise my eyebrow on my right side due to muscle weakness... so yes, it can have permanent effects. It may improve over time, try doing facial motions to exercise and strengthen the muscles. I had really visible differences as a child that slowly got better, most people do not notice it now.\n\nHead tilt is probably a subconscious response of you \"hiding\" your right side. I do it too. Dayum \ud83d\ude2d well.... crap something else to ask my doctor the next time i see them. i will let you know if i can still find this post! Yeah I think this is also me. I had BP quite severely when I was 7, it took over a year to recover. I have been doing more research in my adult life about BP (now 27) and I never knew anything about recovery rates or medication. I think I have recovered maybe 60-70%\n\nI feel the symptoms of BP pretty much all the time - constant weakness on my affected side, slurring, tears/dryness in eyes, struggling to keep my affected eye open. I also have a compromised immune system (only 30% of the antibodies I should have) and I catch viral infections regularly. Sigh.\n\nThanks for sharing, it is good to know and build awareness.", "Round 2 Recently got diagnosed with bell\u2019s palsy for the second time. first got it at 14, now back at it at 23. finished a weeks worth of medicine, and am now just doing facial exercises to help with recovery. a little ear pain every now and again but mostly happy i found this page. hoping everyone recovering is doing well in these very strange times! Thanks I hope you do too!\n\nI had that too the first time when I was nearly the same age as when you first got it. After 20 years, it just happened again. Started 2 weeks ago but I am able to move a bit on the affected side.\n\nI am just curious I noticed that they both happened when my environmental conditions were cold like 8 degrees celsius. Was it the same for you? I have noticed my BP pain acts up around those temps! however each time i have had a full new case of BP it is been both in warmer climate and cold! I am happy to hear you have some movement! I am currently in the phase after medication where i have some slight pain. Though i am hoping some time and warm compresses help!", "Worried that I have BP (right side) Hello friends! I recently went on a me dial check up + chest x-ray on the 2/7(tues) and I was fine. \n\n3/7 (wed) When I woke up, my half my tongue was numb/loss of taste on the right side. At this point, I am a bit worried cause I thought I was having a minor stroke of some kind but I did not lose any muscle ability in my limbs.\n\n4/7 (thurs) Same symptoms as yesterday\n\n5/7 (fri) I noticed that I am unable to squeeze my  right eye shut (I am still able to close it but not squire it shut). Nor can I furrow my right brow and I still cannot taste with the right side of my tongue. \n\nI am a nervous wreck right now as I am starting school in 1.5 months!! I plan to see a GP tomorrow! \n\nWhat are you guys\u2019 thoughts? Any advice? Sounds exactly like BP, but of course only a doctor can tell you that.\n\nAssuming you have it: some people recovery very quickly (within a few weeks), some people take longer (I \\*just\\* started recovering after having 100% loss of control for over 3 months).  But almost everybody makes a full recovery, or nearly-full, eventually.\n\nRest as much as you can, listen to your doctor, and do not let it control your life. thanks for the reply! Are you able to close your eyes at all? I have seen that some people might have to wear an eye patch Go to ER or urgent care. Double check that it is BP and not something more severe.\nGet on meds ASAP. You need to get the swelling down. Based on my readings, there appears to be a correlation between early medications and quicker healing. I have been using my fingertips to close my right eye for almost 4 months now. :-(\n\nI wear sunglasses  outdoors that seal off the eye pretty well to keep dust and stuff out of it.  Indoors I just \"blink\" with my fingers when I remember.  I \\*did\\* wear an eyepatch outdoors for a while, but the glasses work better.  \n\nI have been taping my eye shut at night with the advice of my doctor. I went 2 months without doing that because my eye will stay closed once I shut it with my fingers, so I figured I could just sleep without issue; however, my doctor convinced me to tape it shut anyway. I noticed my eye before tongue...otherwise Dane symptoms. Mine progressed rapidly in the first 24 hours. Definitely see your GP. Probably BP. Get yourself to urgent care right now to start treatment. DO NOT try to force your muscles to move. Let your facial nerves rest for a few weeks. I wish someone had told me that when I got mine.", "Day 12 - Bell\u2019s Palsy Today marks 12 days since I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy, still no improvement and I have started acupuncture sessions.\n\nHaving a really hard time with vertigo and dizziness issues which are being caused by an inner ear problem, most likely Labyrinthitis. Waiting to see an ENT specialist to determine if there is an underlying issue causing so many different symptoms. But no idea of when that could be.\n\nIt is really got me down the past couple weeks and it is hard to see any way out of it right now, especially with this news from the doctor saying it could be something more than just BP/Vertigo. It was 6 months before I saw any improvement.  Hang in there! how much have you recovered now % wise? I would say that now, at 14 months, I am about 60% what is movements are still recovering? I cannot raise my eye brow, and have trouble moving my cheek when smiling.  I still drink out of a straw, and still occasionally tape my eye shut when sleeping. What recovery methods have you tried so far? example electrical stimulation, acupuncture or physiotherapy Just stim, and facial exercises.  There is no acupuncture places near me, and to be honest I am not buying into the who acu thing... How long after the onset happened did you start stim? Two weeks how many sessions have you done so far and long do they last? I was going about 2x a week, each session was like 30 minutes.  Think I went for 6 or 7 weeks. And you did not see any improvement in those 6-7 weeks? Nope, none. did you use a tens unit with sticky pads? I am so sorry you are going through this. I did not see improvement at 12 days. I am almost 6 months now  Do you have synkinesis? How is your recovery? My husband is going through this Thank you for asking. It is been very emotional. I get lots of twitching have synkinesis.  Today is officially 6 months. It is the worst emotional roller coaster filled with tons of anxiety", "My Bell's Palsy Experience (So Far) Thanks to everyone who has shared their experiences.  I thought I would add my data point to those who may be seeking hope, since I believe my recovery was unusually fast.\n\nAs background, I am in my mid-30s, in relatively good health--no serious health issues prior to getting BP.\n\nTwo weeks ago today, I woke up and could not move the right side of my face.  The day prior, I had some pain behind my ear when blowing my nose in the morning (just morning allergies, I thought), but did not think much of it.  I called my mom (a nurse practitioner) almost immediately upon realizing my face was frozen.  She asked me a series of questions to rule out a stroke before telling me to go to the doctor ASAP to get a prescription for steroids.  I was able to get a last-minute appointment about two hours later--went to the doc, got diagnosed, then headed straight over to the pharmacy to fill my prescription for prednisone (10 days at 40mgs).  The time between realizing that I had a problem and taking the first dose of prednisone was about four hours, which I think was **critical** to my relatively quick recovery.  I was also prescribed acyclovir for 10 days.  I have read that acyclovir is not as important for treatment as prednisone (although I am not a doctor--**this is not medical advice**).  Aside from the pain behind my ear and a runny nose, I noticed no other symptoms of viral infection prior to or during my BP.\n\nThe next few days sucked.  I had to tape my eye shut at night to sleep--I used bandaids.  I could not spit (without making a mess), smile, or eat food without it falling out of my mouth.  I had to use eye drops every hour or so.  I focused on getting plenty of rest and eating extremely healthy during the entire two weeks that I have had this.  I also picked up my exercise routine and generally tried to lower my stress level.  I am not sure how much any of this contributed, but it at least gave me peace of mind that I was doing everything I could.\n\nBy the fourth day, I noticed that my eye was no longer burning quite as terribly in the shower when I washed my face (for some reason I kept forgetting not to do this!).  I was also able to cut down my eye drops from every hour to about every two hours.  After a week, I felt confident enough to try to sleep with an arm over my eye instead of using bandaids--it worked reasonably well, but my eye was still a bit dry in the morning.  Around this time, I had a follow-up visit with my doc.  He gave me a second course of prednisone (7 days at 20mgs) to start after my first course was complete.\n\nOver the second week, I noticed my facial paralysis gradually improve.  At the beginning of the week, I could not wink my right eye.  Today, I have almost complete symmetry between my right and left eyes in terms of winking, raising eyebrows, etc.  The most noticeable lingering effect is that I cannot smile the right side of my face as well as the left, but even this has greatly improved over just the last few days.  Overall, I would say I am about 80-85% improved from where I started, and I am optimistic that I will continue to improve.  I would guess that most people would not even notice anything wrong with me at this point unless (1) they knew me before I had this and (2) focused very intently on changes in my smile.\n\nAnyway, I hope you all can improve as much as possible as quickly as possible.  I feel extremely lucky.", "At the ER now. This might be my second time getting Bell\u2019s Palsy. Still in the early stages if this is indeed Bell\u2019s Palsy. Knowing how socially difficult it was the first time (second semester in college) I am on the verge of crying this time around. I do not want months where I cannot smile properly. Would Short time leave of absence from work be over-reacting? I also had it twice, once in college and once 10 years later. It went away the second time just like the first although maybe it took a couple weeks longer. I do not think a leave of absence from work would be over-reacting at all! I do not think it would overreacting at all! BP is hard and resting is the best thing you can do. I am so sorry that you are going through this a second time. \ud83d\ude15 Thanks for the support. I am being told that I caught it early and with anti-virals and steroids it hopefully will not be as bad as it was the first time.  Thanks. Still mild symptoms as of now, hopefully the meds will keep it that way. If it starts to affect my speech I will likely take some time off of work.  The second time I got BP I was eating a grape and I noticed it tastes different. I could not taste the sweetness. I told my co-worker did my face look droopy and it did not at the time. The next day it did and I went to hospital and I knew I was getting BP for a second time. Lucky I caught it on time and got my steroids and and anti-viral and in less than 3 months I was back to normal.  \n\n\nI took a few days off to rest and work understood what was happening. I did let them know there maybe times where I have to go to a doctor at a moments notice if I do not feel well. My job was very supportive, my co-workers not so much since we like to bust each others balls. I wish the best though and a speedy recovery.  Thanks. Did you eventually get the full droop or did you stave it off with the steroids? I did the full droop but it lasted maybe a few weeks before it started getting better Word.  Hopefully I caught it early enough an it will stop where it is. Otherwise I think I will need some time off work as well. I can still talk fine which is important for my job so I gtg right now.  I took leave from school when I had BP. They were very understanding and accommodating, moved deadlines for me etc. Speak to your dean/tutor. ", "Facial nerve twitching Hello, I was first diagnosed on October 23, 2019 with Bell\u2019s palsy. It affected the right side of my face. I have recovered about 95% since then but I have noticed I still cannot properly pucker my lips, I still get the weird headache sometimes, still have some facial tenderness, and now I have noticed there is a nerve on my face that keeps making the area by my nose twitch. \n\nIs this normal for anyone else? It is really weird and I just noticed it is been happening a lot more frequently these passed few days.. first once a day and now it is sometimes multiple times an hour. It is kind of freaking me out but I do not know if there is anything I can do or if it will go away on it is own? Thank you. It happens to me sometimes when I am stressed or if I need sleep. It still scares the hell out of me because I do not want to go through the whole thing again. That is why it worries me! I have heard that some people can get it multiple times in their lifetime and I am also afraid it will happen again. :( It is terrible. I have the twitch sometimes. I think it is nothing to be too worried about. Had Bells Palsy in summer 2015 and was left with some remnants like the the left corner of my mouth going up when I close my eyes and a nerve under (?) my jaw gets stuck somewhere frequently. It could be worse I guess. I do think almost daily about what happened and am often scared that it could come back, but on the other hand there are worse diseases to get so I try to stay as positive as I can :) Btw, the nerves in your face could twitch more if you are tired or very stressed, that happens to me often Although it is been a few weeks since I last had one, I commonly will get twitches all over the affected area. I do not know if it can help with BP, but I know that regular eye twitching can be caused by needing magnesium, so maybe eat a banana or other magnesium rich foods and see if it helps.", "Can I take tooth filling if I have bell's palsy history? Hi guys, I have got bell's palsy last year and luckily it has been almost recovered after one year. However, my tooth has trouble rencetly and may need a filling treatment. I am a little afraid of the risk of  anaesthetization. Is there any suggestion for my issue? Thanks in advance I have had fillings and even a wisdom tooth pulled after my BP.  I suppose there might be a concern, but likely not.  Make sure you speak to the dentist about it, and perhaps your MD also", "My girlfriend had Bells palsy in August 3rd 2017, the Doctors said when her face was repaired that is their job is done. She still gets attacks, if she needs to lay down it has to be immediately Does anyone else get this? She stutters a lot and if she wakes up with her lip paralyzed that is a day on the couch! She thought she was losing her mind (Doctors were no help) I found a chat room and we got more information off that then anything else! All you get on sites is it is rare and the people that are prone to it Try reaching out to a specialized clinic. They are starting to pop up everywhere. I know of one in California, Ohio, Maryland, and Pennsylvania for starters. There is probably more just got to research and look. I live in Guernsey Channel Islands and there is nothing here! One specialist on Bell\u2019s palsy but they are useless! A paralyzed face is what they say and as soon as they have fixed that as much as possible they say, that is it your on your own now The clinics in the US offer Skype Sessions with a specialist.", "Diagnosed on Sunday. Lots of questions. I think I caught it early. I have been having some tongue and cheek numbness for about a week, I thought it was related to my Orthodontics. Saturday, I thought I had pink eye because my eye kept watering (probably because it was not closing all the way) Sunday evening I noticed my left eye was not blinking and went to the hospital. They gave me prednazone and anti virals in the hospital, and scripts for the next day. Along with anti biotic ointment for the effected eye. \n\nI feel like I caught it pretty early. My eye does not blink still, but I can at least close it if I think about it. I have my first neurology appt tomorrow.\n\nMy question is about acupuncture. My sister is a bit of a hippy, and recommended it. I am not much of a holistic person, but willing to try it, as long as it does not make things worse.\n\nAnother question is related to the prednazone. I only got a 4 day supply, which does not seem like much. Should I be on it longer?\n\nShould I be seeing an eye Dr about my bad eye? \n\nMy last question is about social activity. Going back to work tomorrow, and wondering if I should wear an eye patch to cover the lazy eye. Prednazone they do not like to give for long as it has some pretty nasty side effects and studies have shown it is most effective when administered in the first few days following onset of symptoms with diminishing returns thereafter.\n\nAccupuncture I found to be useless. Others may disagree. Your milage may vary.\n\nAn eye patch will make you more comfortable, as will some simple eye drops applied regularly to keep your eye moist. Patch is actually super useful at night - it can stop you from damaging your open eye in your sleep.  I got extreme bells palsy when I was pregnant. Acupuncture really helped me. I did it 3 times a week for a month. I did not take meds because I was pregnant. My eye would not close at all the first couple weeks. I used ointment multiple times a day to prevent any damage from dryness.  You dont seem to upset which is great, I hope you caught it early! I really struggled with this &amp; even after having my son a year ago, still have some weird stuff go on with my eye when I get stressed. Good luck! Thanks for the good wishes. What should I expect from acupuncture. I have never been, so I have no baseline. Is it painful, pleasurable? Since BP may have a viral component I would not advise acupuncture. It could open your nerve up to further viral infection. If you really want to try that route, I would suggest acupressure instead. But then I will admit that I have a bias against acupuncture in any case, due to lack of verifiable evidence of true efficacy.\n\nI do recommend an eye patch to protect your eye from dust, dryness, and foreign objects, unless your job absolutely requires good depth perception, in which case goggles may be a better option.", "Dad has bells, i have questions hello. My dad was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy roughly a year ago. Half of his face drooped and his mouth did not work correctly. But after a short amount of time it went away. Now he is complaining about it again. He is refusing to see me most likely because he is embarrassed about what he looks like. he is a man who prides himself on his attraction. I am sure he is very insecure. He told me his Bell\u2019s palsy is acting up. I am not sure what that means exactly. Hopefully some of you can help me figure that out. what could the possibilities be? could his mouth be droopy. Or his eye. Both? Could his face be twitching or something? I am sure these questions sound dumb. I have researched but I still do not seem to understand it fully. He claims to be in a lot of pain. I saw him today while he was at work but he kept his mask on. He kept putting his hands on his cheeks and groaning. He has been saying stuff like \u201cI love you more then you will ever know\u201d and just being extra affectionate. he is also told me he does not want to tell me the extent of what is wrong. do you have any ideas? Are there any long-term problems that I could not know about? i have heard of going blind in an eye or strokes being more likely. I guess I am just looking for somebody that knows more about this than I do. Just somebody to reassure me or make me aware of the possible problems. Again I am sure I sound very uneducated and stupid but I am just an 18-year-old girl worried about my father. Any advice helps! Oh my gosh im so sorry :(\nI myself is a 15 year old girl who had suffer so I cannot really tell what he might be going through since there is a wide gap age but yeah, bell's does take a turn in your mental health. I myself was bullied myself out of meds because I looked like a fool. Basically, you look like an idiot. You can not shut one eye so you have one eye constantly open and side of your face will not move what so ever. Twitching does occur but when you smile, no one will look at you. It hurts. About the pain, there is intense pain such as headaches, ear pain, and overall all over. There is also side effects from the prednisone. Since your face is paralyzed, eating becomes a struggle. You can not drink nor pronounce simple words. Drinking water is an automatic drooling. If he is a man that prides himself with lots of attraction then bell's will take a huge toll on that. All I can say is recommend to confront him as much as you can. Make him laugh, whatever you got to do to help him forget he has that condition. You love, everything. You are so sweet to ask strangers online :) Hi love. Since it sounds like the pain is persisting, suggest a visit to an Urgent care center, ER or doctor.  The sooner he starts treating the situation, the better. He will most likely get an antiviral med and steroids.  \nRegarding his appearance, yes it can be shocking but it is a result of damage to the 7th cranial nerve. This nerve affects a load of things. ( You can google for exact info.)\nWhat he can do now--Warm compresses to the affected areas--improves circulation which helps foster healing and eases pain. Preservative-free eye drop and ointment at night for the affected eye. Cover eye at night. \nWill be praying \ud83d\ude4f thank you so much!! helps a ton thank you love! My doctor emphasized...B-complex and a good multivitamin to build my immunity system. You can dm if you want more info or to talk.", "Covid vaccine induced bp Did anyone on here get bells paulsy from the moderna or Pfizer ? If so after the first or second dose? I am having tenseness in my face after my first dose and am wondering if I should get my second. Please help and let me know what your experience is. Additionally I heard herpes (maybe oral herpes? Or any kind?) has a link to it\u2014did any of you have that before you got it or does it have no association I got bell's post the vaccine, first dose\n\nI talked to a doctor and they said it was highly unlikely I would get it again, but he did recommend I fully heal before getting the second.\n\nhe thinks the risk of getting covid is worse than the risk of getting bell's again Thanks for responding and I am sorry to hear that. How long was it after uour first dose? Was it moderna? What were your first symptoms because my face has been tense on one side. That is why I am wondering if I will get it. Did you have a previous history with bp? And you are getting your second dose? I was diagnosed with BP exactly a month after my second dose of Pfizer. I have never even had a cold sore, much less the other kind of herpes, so I do not think mine is linked to that. Did you have tenseness in your face? I am having that so I am worried I will get it. And you have not had a history? (A history of BP) I had bell's before, 10 years ago\n\nI will get the second dose, but I am scheduled for that later in the summer. In Canada, we are delayed on getting the second dose due to supply issues.\n\nIt was about a week after the first dose of Pfizer.\n\nFirst symptoms were numbness in half of my tongue, day later it was mouth and then full sagging of face. If you do end up having it, go to the doctor to get diagnosed to make sure it is not something else and to get some prednisone.\n\nGood luck! I hope it does not develop into full BP I got it years ago. I did have very bad mouth sores several months prior. I did not notice any tension in my face beforehand; I just woke up and found that I could not move half my face one day. Correlation is not necessarily causation - there are quite a few factors that could cause Bell\u2019s Palsy. A large amount of misinformation regarding Bell\u2019s Palsy being linked to COVID vaccinations has been circulating, and it is worth noting that a study by the University of Chicago\u2019s School of Medicine has determined that the rate of causation of Bell\u2019s Palsy in vaccine recipients is \u201cless than or equal\u201d to that of the general population. The study is ongoing with a larger sample size to ensure further accuracy.\n\nIn my case, it was cold sores (HSV1) lying dormant in my system that caused Bell\u2019s Palsy.\n\nMost all cases of BP are caused by herpes viruses, shingles, chickenpox, or Lyme\u2019s Disease. Your body\u2019s reaction to a virus creates inflammation, and if that inflammation happens to be too close to your cranial nerve, Bell\u2019s Palsy is the result.\n\nKeep a close eye on your facial movement and call a doc if you start losing mobility. Best of luck!\n\nTL;DR: Get your second dose! Your generalization of what most causes of BP are is grossly inaccurate considering there are so many causes that have nothing to do with anything you mentioned. Horrible. Is it better now? I am sorry to hear you got it again \ud83d\ude14do you think I will get it based on the stiffness/tension on one side of my face? I got mine about a week ago and I am very worried. \n\nSource study demonstrates 11 in 14 (78.57% of) BP cases are attributed to Herpes viruses, hence my phrasing \u201cmost all.\u201d There are many other less common causes, including cytomegalovirus infections, respiratory illnesses, measles, mumps, influenza, stress, and potentially unknown factors.\n\nI would not characterize this as \u201cgrossly inaccurate,\u201d and if you have sources or further information to provide us with rather than unproductive sourceless feedback, feel free to post them below Received my first dose of Pfizer on Mar 16.  Developed Bell's the next day (17th).  Pretty severe case of Bell's, not much has changed since.  Both my main GP and my immunologist have advised me to wait till I heal before going for my second dose. What were your first symptoms? I am having tenseness and stiffness in my face First symptoms was headache near/behind left ear.  Left side of mouth/lips did not move correctly.  Tightness of face and forehead muscles. My face has movement. Mine is on my right side\u2014did you get the jab on the right or left Bell's on my left side, injection sight was in my left arm (done through a drive though vaccine site). I had mine on the left side but my stiffness is on the right side. I am really worried it is going to turn into full on bp. It has been a week since my initial injection. I am stressed and I do not know what to do I am very scared and upset Yes. I got 95% of my facial movement back in a few months, and over time I gradually got pretty much all of it back. I do still get occasional pain in the area behind my ear, especially when I am sick and/or stressed. First thing is to take some deep breaths and mentally calm yourself.  If you are upright and breathing there is more right with you than wrong with you.  \n\nI know it can be stressing and scary but letting those feelings run the show in your mind will only make the healing take longer (I know, easier said than done).  \n\nIn the long run there is nothing you can do but let your body do what it does best, heal itself, and also follow your doctors instruction (most likely a steroid and anti-viral meds).  Meditation, acupuncture,  herbs, and other alternate practices could also possibly help. no idea, sorry! it is a pretty mysterious illness Good point about the standing upright thing. It is so horrible I just do not know whether to get the second shot. Die from Covid or be paralyzed? Glad to hear it is better. Did you ever have a history or did your family before you got it? I am not a doctor, nor am I trained in any medial sciences, but...\n\nWhen I saw my immunologist I asked the question, \"Should I take the second dose?  If yes, when?\"  His reply was that current evidence shows that the first dose gives you ~80%-85% protection, which is the lion's share of protection.  Delaying the second shot will not change that 80-85 percent coverage.  These words were directly from his lips.  \n\nAlso, unless you are someone with multiple comorbidities and in your 70s you are not likely to die from covid.  Especially if you have had your first dose. &gt; In my case, it was cold sores (HSV1) lying dormant in my system that caused Bell\u2019s Palsy.\n\nhow did you or your doctor determine this? Kind Of curious. Bloodwork was done to rule out Lyme\u2019s, positive HSV1 antibodies I got my Pfizer end of jan, Bell\u2019s palsy end of March. I was told it is not connected but for the 2 months I suffered dull headaches on and off, fatigue.. I was not myself. I am almost fully back to myself normal self form BP but still odd twitching which is annoying Nope, I would never even heard about it before I got it. At first I thought I would had a stroke!\n\nI was a little worried I would have a relapse with the vaccine but no, nothing of the sort. Also, while it is possible the vaccine may cause BP, it is almost certainly less likely to do so than getting the actual virus itself. If the vaccine causes it, then that individual was probably predisposed to begin with and a viral infection of the nature of COVID19 almost certainly would have caused it as well. I have tenseness now but I do not remember having it before the onset. I had never even heard of Bell\u2019s palsy so I had no history or no knowledge of it before this. I have had it for 15 days now. Did yours resolve or you still have it and just residual tenseness I got bells before the vaccine. My bels cleared up and I got my vaccine and nothing. I still have it a little bit, but it is not nearly as bad as it was \u201cLinked with\u201d does not = majority of cases caused by But how long does it last? That is my question because I have heard immunity does not last long with just one dose. Where were your headaches located and did you have tenseness in your face? That is insane that you went three months with no symptoms and suddenly got it Not taking the vaccine ever... BP &gt; Covid \n\n\nI had both. That doc is an idiot Found the Kool-Aid drinker no one has died of bell's palsy. he is not an idiot, he is literally a specialist in stroke and bell's palsy.\n\nsome of the long term impacts of covid, like lung damage, are pretty significant. I am so scared I will get it again after my vaccine. So I am longing it out. Please lmk what happens! I pray to god that neither of us experience it again \u2764\ufe0f The vaccines are mostly safe, and people should get them. However, there are some rare side effects that happen for a few unlucky folks. This is not misinformation or fear mongering. It is just the way drugs work -- most people are totally fine and have minor side effects, while a few people have more considerable side effects.\n\nFrom the small sample size during clinical trials, it did seem that there is no causal link. However, as more people have gotten the vaccine, they are reassessing this link. A number of researchers are following these developments.\n\nThe reason that people believe there is a plausible correlation between the vaccine and BP is because several other vaccines can cause BP. Yes, the main causes of BP are what you list, but the immune response that vaccines trigger can also lead to BP. This is something that the medical world is very interested in right now, so there have been a few cases studies published in the past year.\n\nThe only statistical significance the current number of post-vaccine BP events has is that it is a little *low*: every year there are ~1-4 cases of BP in every population of 10,000 people (and that includes recurrent cases, which affect one out every ~150,000 people), but in the first ~45,000 people who got vaccinated - the volunteers who tested the vaccine - there were only 7 who had BP events. Since the widespread release, the numbers have remained close to the average, which is interesting because the numbers have been reduced by people who might have been heading toward a BP event but died from COVID or COVID-related factors before it happened, and increased by the prevalence of factors that *do* contribute to BP events (stress, poor nutrition, lack of sleep), and those have roughly cancelled each other out.\n\nHigh on the list of factors that contribute to BP events is, and always has been, stress. Herpes - 'cold sores' - is a possible contributor (more info below), but herpes outbreaks are *also* affected by stress. Your doctor told you to wait (a) so you will be as healthy as possible before getting the second shot - always a good idea - and (b) because stressing out over a possible link between the vaccine and BP may lead to a full BP event that does not need to happen, not because they thought the vaccine might cause BP (in which case they would have told you to NOT get the vaccine at all, rather than just to wait a while).\n\nMy wife is a nurse, all of our friends are doctors and nurses, and they talk about this stuff *all the time*. Every new study that is published, every new number that gets reported, becomes that day's sole topic of conversation. Nobody can say definitively that there will never be evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and BP, but - so far - there has not been any. Worrying about shit like that cannot help, and might contribute to a BP event that could have been avoided.\n\nI have had some BP precursor signs over the past year, including one a week after my second vaccination shot. I am having one right now, which is why I am back here reading about everybody else's experiences. The only factor that all of my precursor events have had in common is that they have all happened after particularly stressful times. I treat them as early-warning indicators (for which I am most grateful,,, that first 'woke up and could not feel my face' event was miserable) and start doing all of the things you are told to do *after* a BP event. There is no way to know whether an event was held off by these things or maybe it was never going to be a full event anyway, but eating right, sleeping right, and de-stressing are *always* a good/healthy idea.\n\nTake care. Not like \"ta ta!\", I mean literally take care of yourself. It is a stressful time, the vaccinations are stressful, the possibility of BP is stressful, but stress is a primary contributor to BP events so remove as much of it as possible from your life. Do not feed the beast.\n\n&gt; I heard herpes (maybe oral herpes? Or any kind?) has a link to it\n\nBP is a diagnosis of exclusion - you are only diagnosed with BP after they have excluded all of the other known possibilities, and at any given time in the past that list of known possibilities was smaller than it is now - so even when you are diagnosed with BP, the possible causes are not completely known. Something caused inflammation in the facial nerve; the swelling compressed the nerve, blocking conduction along the nerve; and they ruled out stroke, tumor, shingles, Lyme disease, and sarcoidosis. Must be BP.\n\nInflammation of that nerve can be caused by viruses that camp out alongside it, like herpes. This is why most doctors prescribe an antiviral.\n\nInflammation *in general*, caused by your body sending a bunch of resources to repair damage in the affected area, can also be caused by stress. Your body releases cortisol, the 'fight-or-flight' hormone, because in such situations you need the extra energy. But it is rare that we are in actual fight-or-flight situations, and this causes problems: releasing all of that energy but not using it is like dry-firing a bow or stepping on the gas when the car is in neutral... that energy has to go *somewhere*, and if it is not to help you deal with problems on the outside it tends to *cause* problems on the inside. This is why most doctors prescribe anti-inflammatories. I would have Covid five more times over Bell\u2019s palsy It first started will a dull ache behind my eyes, they I just felt foggy headed most days. I went a week without any headaches and then BOOM BP haha How long did you have the headaches Also how bad was your BP like how severe and how long did it take you to get better and did you use steroids to treat it and how does your face look exactly how it looked before Also was it both eyes also did the headaches start after dose 1 or 2 Wow thank you for this detailed answer! I am worried because on one side I am having headaches in the back of my head and eye, and occasional sharp ear pain. The side of my face is very tense as well as neck. I still have mobility in that side of my face though. It is been a week since I got my shot and I am v concerned. What do you think? My doctors do not know. Obviously you are not a doctor and I cannot take your opinion word for word but based on your experiences what are your thoughts? I know! Thank you for praying~ The sad truth is that the things you are describing are just part of life after BP for a lot of people. If you are lucky they come and go and do not return for some time; in my case it is every couple of months, but others here have reported everything from a few weeks to a few years to (so far) never.\n\nRight now I am having sensations that pop up every few months: I feel like my eye and cheek have been sandpapered, and parts of the skin on my face feel like they are not a part of me. (It is a weird sensation.) The extra work I have to put into driving my face is tightening up the muscles of my scalp and neck. I feel like I have a headache that goes straight through my eye, all the way through the back of my head. So I am taking vitamins and electrolytes, putting a heating pad on my face and neck, staying hydrated, and hoping that these incipient symptoms will go away like they have so far always done.\n\nYou have an approximately 7% chance of having a recurring event sometime *in your lifetime*... could be 70 years from now, could be tomorrow. But the number of people who continue to have weird sensations without ever having a second BP event is much, much higher: only a fraction of a percent never feel anything weird after their first event. So the fact that you are having these sensations tells us... nothing. Only that you are not one of that tiny lottery-winning percentage who never feel anything weird again over their entire lifetime. All of the other possibilities are still open for you.\n\nBut yeah, I already knew those things and when I felt the symptoms return the first time I was terrified. And... I do not know. Offended? This shit *again*?\n\nAll you can do is take care of yourself. It plays out however it plays out. But one thing I have seen reading the posts here in the years since my BP event is that for all but a tiny few it is never as bad as we think it is going to be.\n\nBest wishes. Both eyes, I have only had 1 dose and not having other. Bell\u2019s palsy was mild, took about 4 weeks to get my blink back I really do not know if I should get dose 2. I am worried it will throw me into full bp if I am already having sensations on the side of my face like this I am not a BP expert but I think you would have got it by now. What are the symptoms you are having now I am having tenseness on one side and headaches/migraines on the affected side Have you been to the doctor? X Yes and they told me they do not know what is going on but to see how I feel I am a week and get the second dose I would forget about the vaccine for now and focus on how you feel in a week and then go back. If you do end up with full blown BP, it is reassuring from the comments that people do start feeling better after medication. I am sorry I know it is stressful but do some calming stuff , things to make yourself less stressed. The more you worry the more inflamed your body gets from stress\u2764\ufe0f If you are young and healthy you will not die from covid either. And as for long term impacts, I along with many people I know got covid months ago and we recovered 100% in less than 5 days. No issues whatsoever. Same dude Is it just me...? Or has this subreddit been taken over by antivaxers?\n\no_O This comment comes off as extremely insensitive to anyone who has lost somebody to Covid...  js. \"I believe in anecdotes when talking about a subject. I and people I know who have caught covid survived and thrived! so covid is not a big deal\"\n\nHow insane, and absolutely dismissive of a virus that has killed so many hundreds of thousands of people. Nevermind the thousands who have already come forward with long-term implications form the virus itself.\n\nBell's palsy is awful, and nobody is dismissing the severity of it. But this comment is straight up stupid. Report the antivax comments pls The flu has killed millions worldwide over the last few years. So anytime you have said \"oh do not worry, it is just the flu\", you are being dismissive of a virus that has killed millions. Nothing Kool-Aid about it. That study does not mean a whole lot considering \u201cmost\u201d cases of BP is nothing more than a trip to the ER, a prescription of anti virals and steroids, the recommendation to rest up \u201cit should heal eventually\u201d and being sent home. Maybe 11 in 14 of that study, but certainly not 11 in 14 cases. Mute me all you want, I did not say anything incorrect. How are you doing now? Did you get the Moderna? Still having the same symptoms. Got dose 1 already and decided not to get dose two  I am not anti vaccine. I got my first dose Sorry, can you clarify please if you got the Moderna or Pfizer? I was going to schedule an appt but not getting apprehensive  Diagnosed 3 days ago. Had the Pfizer vaccine on March 17 and April 7. Never had BP nor any of the viral illnesses associated. No family history of BP. I am not going to blame the vaccine. Just too many unknowns. It makes me wonder though. How is the BP? Did it resolve yet? I would say I am about 90% better, and it is only been 4 weeks. Just in time for the mask mandate to be lifted in my area lol \u2014 I feel more confident than I did even a couple weeks ago. I think anyone who did not already know I have it, would not know I have it. I am trying to keep my stress level down so it does not come back. My fear is if it comes back I will not have a mask to hide behind then. Yay! I am so glad you are better~ what did you do that helped you heal so fast I started taking the anti-virals and steroids on day one, added Vitamin B12 and a Fish Oil supplement the next day (because I read somewhere that they helped), and got as much rest as I could over the last few weeks, but especially in the beginning. I used the eye drops and wore the stupid eye patch when I slept, even though I hated it. I never taped my eye shut because that freaked me out. I also chewed gum when possible; I think the muscle memory for blowing bubbles helped. I was planning on doing some facial exercises, and I might still try them, but so far I have not. I had the Pfizer today and within 2 hours my mouth was dropping down at one side. My eye will not close now and the crazy pins and needles on that side of my face are wild. \n\nGoing to the doctor tomorrow \ud83d\ude1e Hey I was just wondering what you ended up doing.

I was being treated for migraines at a neurology clinic for over a year with no improvement until they referred me to a neurologist who said this is not a migraine and injected the right temple with Botox. He saved me when no other doctors could figure it out. Did you go on an elimination diet to rule out foods that could cause the headache?

It is certainly alarming to discover that half of your face has lost its motor control, so I wanted to share my experience for those who are curious and/or worried about the recovery process of this bizarre phenomenon. Each week, I will be posting a photo of my best smile attempt until I see full resolution.\n\nHere is my Bell\u2019s Palsy background:\n\nSaturday evening, I noticed a bit of a crooked smile in my zoom call with a few friends. I thought nothing of it, brushed my teeth, and went to bed. Upon waking the following morning, it had progressed to a level that made speaking and eating quite difficult. I am young and otherwise healthy, so I was quick to rule out the possibility of stroke and skipped the ER visit. I saw a doctor as soon as I could, which was the following day, and was prescribed the typical combination of a steroid (in tapering doses) and an antiviral treatment.\n\nToday is my 4th day on the medication, and I am noticing that I have lost the ability to taste on the left side anterior 2/3rds of my tongue. I am hoping that this is not an indicator of worsening symptoms, but time will tell! I am yet to see improvement and look forward to checking back in with you all.\n\nUntil then, wishing you all good health and a speedy recovery Hang in there man. Try and eat healthy if you can, and extra B12 does not cant hurt either. It took me  a week or so after the Prednisone to start improving.  I am not on FB, but when I was there were some great BP groups on there too. \ud83d\udc4a", "I got ya homie! ", "How do you cope with this? I have been feeling depressed. I do not want to do anything or hang out with anyone. I force myself to go to work but ever since I got BP, I have just been hiding in my room.  It sucks but most likely temporary.

You will start feeling better. Hang in there! Part of it could be whatever virus you got in the first place dragging you down.  I know I slept a ton the first three months of my recovery When my boyfriend got BP it depressed him as well for a while. Even though he has not fully recovered he knows that BP is not what defines him. He is still handsome and amazing and he knows it. Be confident! You are still you! It might sound trivial, but I made a soundtrack of all songs that made me feel upbeat and happy and that is what I would play. I also did journaling to help work through my emotions surrounding feeling like I lost half my face and wondering how long I would be on medical leave.  Was it paid medical leave ? I am trying to get the same thing but they deny it since they say it does not affect actually doing my job.

Keep a look out for good/bad changes hello! It is has only been a few days for me and I am writing my posts in hopes that everyone who reads them will be encouraged :) It is hard/inconvenient having BP and I realised that not a lot of people posts update/positive stuff so I kind of want to be that for myself and everyone!  \n\nEveryone recovers in their own pace so do not be too stressed out \u2728I realised that when i am stressed my face hurts a lot more You are correct. I have been staying off of Reddit from fear of running into negative posts. It is funny that I am an educator because those are some of the most encouraging ppl (but my short journey has been hard thus far ) and I never thought of myself as a vain person but I hate looking in the mirror or taking pictures, or snapping (things I used to enjoy). I have realized how many other things I am grateful for and this is getting me through... it is becoming easier to face ppl and my family has been so supportive. I remember where I was emotionally at day 5 so your post was impressive because I was a wreck lol. Hey OP. Just chiming in as I am one of the rare few that is had this twice, about four or five years apart (I honestly forget the timeline.)\n\nFirst time, I made a full recovery in like two weeks.\n\nSecond time, I took about six weeks. I would say I am what some refer to as \"100% resting recovered\" but there is still a slight tweek in my smile. But so slight, that no one has pointed it out to me. \n\nThe second time was much worse for me as I had trouble eating, like my jaw would lock. \n\nIt is wild how you feel yourself recovering over time, because it really makes you take being fully functional for granted. \n\nAll in all, it was a good learning experience. Especially about the American medical system, though I am not going to get into that! Hello! I hope all is well! When will you do another update?

Lol yeah, I took those within the 72 hours period.  I do not have it either. They did not draw my blood though... just asked me a few questions, looked at me and said, \u201cYes you have Bells palsy\u201d. When I went for my follow up, I ended up explaining to my doctor that so much was going on at that time, I could have had it much longer and did not notice... it is been about a month and two weeks for me and resting I would say I am at 100%, but my smile is still wonky and my eye was not that bad to begin with although I can tell a difference in improvement. I can eat everything now but I have become less worried about facial exercises from fear of making things worse... I am no PT \ud83d\ude44 Yeah I was afraid I was having a stroke, but I knew as soon as I got to the hospital I had BP. Of course I paid $1500 for steroids and valtrex.\n\nMake sure you do not stress yourself out over anything, that may be a catalyst for triggering BP and it does not help with recovery. Did you do PT, acupuncture, or anything? naw meds and chill. i would try and make my mouth move often, but i got my steroids literally within hours of the full onset. (i was eating, noticed something was wrong, looked in the mirror went to hospital) Wow! That was a blessing. I woke up noticed something was wrong, but from fear of not having insurance (lost my job) waited two days. I am getting along fine but I REALLY miss my smile and regret not going sooner... oh hello! sorry i have been busy the past few days! I will do one in a couple hours :) I learnt to cope with it!

And I was not in panic or anything the only things that popped to mind were \"well this is not going to make me seem like less of a robot to my class mates\" and \"it is going to pass eventually, probably not serious\" and I am someone who really hates going to the doctor. So I was obviously wanting to avoid it. But after tons and tons of people  said I really should see a doctor I figured I would go and see a doctor. So the next morning I woke up and went to the hospital. I prepared an awful joke to open up with, so I went to my doctor and I said \"HEY my face is broken  and I still got it under warranty can you fix it?\" The doctor laughed and told me to sit down and she was surprised of how good of a mood I was in and how casually I was handling the situation,    so she said that if need to go see more doctors and I will probably have to spend a few nights in a hospital, so I got my girlfriend to drive me to the emergency room and just did a few tests and other than being a bit overweight, asthma and my face I was in perfect health, I started taking some pills and therapy. They are quite sure it bells palsy but tomorrow I am going to go take a brain scan so they can make sure I do not have a brain tumor but they highly doubt it given my mood and just lack of pain.\n\nCurrently got one eye covered up cause I cannot close it, English is my 3rd language and I am 19 so I apologize in advance for the few typos. I will keep you guys updated ;) When I got BP, the people here were very helpful... mainly in letting me know that I probably was not totally screwed.\n\nYou probably are not totally screwed.\n\nThe brain scan thing: I realize it is best to make sure, but the whole time I was thinking it was like going to the ER with a severed finger and hearing that they want to make sure high blood pressure is not the cause of the bleeding... half my face was disconnected, I could feel exactly where the sensation and control stopped and it was right where the BP wiki page said the nerve is, it was a textbook case. But they do their tests, and even though only some fraction of one percent of the time is it something in the brain, if you are that fraction of one percent it is better to know as soon as possible.\n\nDo the tests, but do not worry about them.\n\nYou mention classmates, so you probably do not have 100% control of how you spend your day, but do the therapy. Eat healthy, take vitamins, get adequate sleep... you want to give that nerve everything it could possibly need to get better. Unfortunately one thing it usually needs is time, so... take it one day at time. But if you can find time to rest, place a warm wet cloth over your face, relax, do so. It helps. The facial nerve is \"swollen, inflamed, or compressed\", so do anything that will make those symptoms go away. They probably gave you some kind of steroid anti-inflammatory/anti-swelling medicine, this seems to help. They might have given you an antiviral as well, which can help too. In some countries they suggest electric stimulation therapy; if you are in one of those countries, do the research... most of the world thinks electric stimulation for BP is a bad idea, or actually makes it worse because zapping something that is swollen, inflamed, or compressed rarely makes those symptoms go away.\n\nIf you first noticed it Tuesday morning, it likely got worse over the next 1-2 days. This is normal, it often takes 48-72 hours for all of the symptoms to present. This is not BP getting worse; by the time you notice that you have BP it is already however bad it is going to be, it just takes time for the symptoms to develop fully.\n\nGet an eye patch. You will never have a better excuse to look like a pirate.\n\n(You might also want to tape your eye shut when you sleep, so you *can* sleep and so your eye does not dry out.)\n\nMost people notice improvement by the second week, many after one week. Some take months, but they are out toward the edges of the bell curve. Assume you will recover fully, and soon... even if it turns out to take longer, your life will be better than it would be if you were miserable the whole time.\n\nBest of luck.", "Is a lazy eye linked to bells palsy?  bell's palsy can create changes to how your eyelids move. many of us have experienced issues with getting the eyes to look normal and be back to their usual strength as part of bell's palsy recovery.\n\na lazy eye itself is not a sign that you have bell's palsy though. bell's palsy is considerable paralysis of half the face. i still have lazy eye when i smile and people notice it and my bell's palsy did not recover 100% what to do then any suggestions? I have the same. There are different things that can be done depending on how the muscles around your eye function. I would discuss with a plastic surgeon. For example botox is a possible solution, either to calm down overactive muscles on the affected side, or to make the unaffected side more symmetrical. Yeah however the smile is also not fully recovered too lol this is crazy what if i take any drug for bells palsy after long period of time it will helps or not? That is how BP started for me. But it advanced to my lower face very quickly, within the same day. I got Bell's palsy almost 22 years ago and still deal with synkinesis (when my mouth moves, my eye moves too). It is the same suggestion, a plastic surgeon can use well placed Botox on your unaffected side to make it look more symmetrical. Sometimes the unaffected side can try to \"make up\" for the loss of movement on the affected side, so the Botox calms it down.\n\nThere are no specific meds to take to heal further, after you have done your course of steroids and antibiotics during the initial onset.\n\nI did visit a doctor in the Netherlands who specializes in helping BP patients gain more symmetry but the therapy they do cannot grow nerves back to where they originally were unfortunately. Im exactly like you when i close my right eye my mouth move also and when i smile my right eye become smaller than the other im really sick of that\n\nDo you think that facial exercises or any type of oil may help for massaging or electric stimulation of the nerve may help i want to try anything that improve a little my bad situation I did the electrical stimulation early on, and have since learned that might make the synkinesis worse. I would stick with gentle massage. You can find some exercises on YouTube, also stretches you can do. To be honest, I did them for a while but you really have to do it every day to get it going. Now I am just like, eh I am fine with my face how it is for now. I plan to try Botox soon and see how it goes. If it does not work, that is okay.", "2 weeks since diagnosis. Entire side of face in pain, and zero mobility. So, basically the title. I was diagnosed nearly two weeks ago, and promptly did a course of steroids and antivirals. The paralysis got worse over the following 48 hours to where I have absolutely zero ability to move any part of the right side of my face. I have regained none of the motion as of yet. At first it was just a headache with some soreness behind the ear and a headache, but now I have a near constant pain behind my ear, that radiates through my ear into my jaw and face. Im in significant paint every day. The entire effected side is sore, and tender to even the most gentle touch. It goes behind my ear to the back of my head and under my jaw to my neck. The pain is worse at night and in the morning. I also have headaches through most of the day. My hearing is very sensitive on that side, and certain times throughout the day i have a vibration/ringing response to any sound, and I am  especially sensitive loud noises at any time. I cant see a neurologist until the second week of august, and\ni have an mri scheduled for this Friday, but I wont get the results read until my following appointment. I am exhausted. I guess I am just looking to hear if anyone else has had this type of \u201crecovery\u201d. It is seeming pretty grim right now, considering the pain and discomfort I am in basically constantly. Plus the lack of any progress yet is frustrating. TIA Yes! My face hurt like a bitch. I asked for a second course of steroids for pain relief. After a few weeks the pain improved, but unfortunately I had zero recovery in my face for 3 months. After 3 months, it slowly started to improve. I am about 85% now a little over 2 years out. Oof. I am sorry that you had such a slow recovery. Sounds like I may be on a similar path. Honestly 85% would be brilliant. Here is to hoping. It will take time but I expect you will have some recovery I had such bad pain I was completely unable to sleep- it was like being hit in the face with a shovel every minute or so- it was nerve pain and my doctor put me on naproxen and gabapentin which was near immediate relief! \n\nI also had hyperacussis (sensitivity to loud sounds/certain frequencies) and it took about 6 months before it was not a bother anymore. \n\nI am almost 4 years in and about 70% recovered. Do not give up! I still have little wins even this far in. Thank you for sharing. It helps to know that I am not the only one dealing with this.", "I (25F) just want to talk and vent with people who are going through the same thing Hi everyone, I was just diagnosed two days ago. First I lost feeling and taste on the left side of my tongue, but wrote it off thinking maybe I just burned it on hot coffee. Then I could not close my left eye and the next thing I knew I was in the ER - it all happened so fast, and it was really scary.\n\nI am still adjusting and struggling with taping my eye shut at night and drinking through straws and learning how to spit my toothpaste so it does not get all over my face. I am still getting used to seeing my new smile in the mirror and overcompensating with humor (lots of popeye jokes over here). \n\nMy friends and family have been amazingly supportive, but I still feel lonely - I do not know anyone else that is gone through this before, and I wish I had someone to empathize with. \n\nIf anyone wants to talk about any of it, from the dumb little frustrations to the \u201coh god what it it is like this forever\u201d thoughts - I am here to offer my support and company in exchange for yours :) I am a lot older and probably more decrepit than you but made full recovery.  Hope you do as well. Hi, I\u00a0was diagnosed\u00a0with BP 4 years ago, one afternoon I was feeling a little pain behind my ear and next day I started feeling strange things with my face that get worst\u00a0through\u00a0the day.\n\nIIRC it\u00a0took\u00a0me like 3 weeks to recover and after that I needed to gain the muscle strength that I lost during that time.\n\nI know it\u00a0can be\u00a0hard, because it gives you some\u00a0depression\u00a0and your are not in the mood to\u00a0socialize. But\u00a0apart\u00a0from eating, you can still have a normal life without restrictions and many would not even notice.\n\nAt first, I was very afraid, but then I discovered that is very common and many told me that they have it or some relative\u00a0was diagnosed\n\nTry\u00a0to be\u00a0positive and\u00a0be patient, if you need some support or question you can answer me here (or dm me) Haha hey thank you! Hearing about recovery really helps, thanks for sharing your story! Any tips for taping your eye shut comfortably? I completely understand what you are going through. It was a dark time for me. I was 28(F) when mine happened in fall 2019, so I definitely get some of the things you must be feeling. If you want to send me a message and chat I am here! \n\nPs. I have said this here a few times. It either worked or it was a placebo but a jade roller on my cheek when I was just lounging on the couch felt so good, and I feel like it helped my face muscles! Either way it felt amazing once my cheek muscles kind of started to wake up. I never bothered with taping my eye shut. I just pushed my face into a pillow and never had an issue. Recovered in 3 weeks. Most people do from what I gather.\n\nI know it sucks but humour will get you through it. I though the whole experience, while a little unpleasant, was fcking fascinating. To see your face, or atleast half of it, without any wrinkles. Super weird. Also, it is a good time to think about any health changes you have been putting off. I quit smoking myself. Hang in there. I am a lot older and while it is nice my partner is here, I have mostly just taken care of myself. Bought a jade roller for face massages I can do on myself and 2+ weeks in, my skin is better than ever. I figured just because I have half a goofier than usual face does not mean I cannot use this as an opportunity to self care. I found some self warming eye masks (lavender scent so bonus!!) and use those at night as an additional layer when I think I have not taped my eye shut tight. Those under eye gel patches are nice and soothing when my eye area hurts (and it did a week into BP). \n\nMy acupuncturist who does cosmetic/facial acupuncture and mentioned a few tips: get Vitamin B12 shots in addition to sublingual B12 supplements, first 30 days are crucial and when massaging, push towards the ear and downwards (basically a lymphatic massage), gargle with alcohol but do not drink it then massage your mouth from the inside to help blood circulation, pat some alcohol on the affected side too before moisturizer, scalp massages relieve the pain in the face and behind the ear, mouth exercises like vocalizing all the vowels help. \n\nDo you know what caused your BP? For me, it gave me a chance to reassess my habits and lifestyle so I am kind of glad to have had this wake up call. (  This one is the one I followed, with great success. Lots of videos on there on people's journey with bells palsy.  Gave me hope. Hi, i was diagnosed last year and made full recovery. I never taped my eyes shut but i did use eye mask to sleep and a ton of eye drops. 43/M, diagnosed just 3 days ago. I first developed tiny but annoyingly painful sores on my tongue the week before. Then soon, I noticed a dull pain beneath the left side of my jaw. The next morning, the roof of my mouth now had a large sore. That evening, as I was gargling to treat the sores, I noticed that I could not keep the liquid in my mouth. And as I looked at the mirror, I saw that the left side of my face was not moving with my right.\n\nSoon I had a slight fever, a slight headache, left side of my face became even more unresponsive, some pain behind my left ear, and I could not use earphones in that ear anymore bcoz the sound suddenly became painful.\n\nDid a quick google search of my symptoms, saw Bell's Palsy. The next morning, went on a sudden, desperate search for an available neuro with whom to consult ASAP for meds, since all the BP sites I saw recommended getting treatment in the first 72 hrs. Eventually found one, and yesterday was able to get the meds I need.\n\nEating is now a tremendous chore. I can only chew properly on my right side; I keep biting into my cheek on the left. Speaking is even worse: I cannot pronounce my P's anymore, which completely suxx coz I work for the *purchasing &amp; procurement* dept of my company. When I am in Zoom or Gmeets for work, and I can turn the cam &amp; mic off for awhile, I often cry in frustration (I just did so about half an hour ago).\n\nI know that this is most likely a temporary setback, and I have roughly an 80% chance of a full recovery after 3 months, but right now it is just the most infuriating, embarrassing thing to be going through. My spouse has been incredibly supportive, but whenever I do anything routine or even rather mundane, yet half my face is not cooperating, it can be quite upsetting.\n\nKind Of makes me a little glad that face masks are a thing nowadays; bcoz if they were not, then I would rather not interact with anyone outside my home for the time being.\n\nI just hope that we all make it through this condition successfully, and that we all regain the full use of our faces eventually, preferably sooner rather than later.\n\n\\*Edits for spelling I have had it 3 times, and still do not know anyone in real life that has had it. It is lonely, and it sucks, but it gets better. \n\nIt really sucks, but you will get through it.\n\nAlso, a quick note. I never taped my eye shut, I used like a pirate eye patch, which was much easier, though on the second and third time I just did not care (this was for months at a time each), and my eye was fine. My other eye actually got worse, because I had contacts the second time, and could not put them in the eye that I could not close because they would just dry out, so I wore 1 contact in one eye for like 7 months, and my eyesight in that eye got worse. Hi! Also 25f, got diagnosed a few weeks ago. I also found doing things like drinking, brushing my teeth and simple things really challenging at first too. But you will find out really quickly what works for you! Its totally okay to feel frustrated and upset, I sure did. \n\nAs for the eye taping/sleeping, I just prefer to use an sleeping mask. I found one that I can heat up and it feels like heaven on my affected side (right side). Hey there, 33F, 2 weeks since I was diagnosed. I think I see minor changes but not sure because I had observed the big changes like not able to whistle, blink my right eye, raise my right eyebrow. So am unsure whether am improving or maybe I had not noticed whether am able to do some little movement (I think I am able to chew a bit on my paralyzed side) when I got bell's palsy. I feel really low sometimes. I do my physiotherapy exercises and sometimes it is exhausting. Even eating or talking becomes exhausting. My bell's palsy was caused due to a dormant chickenpox virus (I had chickenpox when I was around maybe 2 years old) and because of that, now my baby (1.5F) has chickenpox. It is even more exhausting since we are in a pandemic (am from India and situation is really bad here) and have to really think before we can even step out. I do hope I become better and at least be able to smile at my baby properly :'(\n\nAnd yes, this requires patience. I have read others' posts and know some may take 3 weeks and others may take 3 months to see improvements. We do not just snap back to normal. Plus, we need to stay positive. So sending you guys positive vibes! And thanks for sharing your experiences :) What I used was an eye patch, one of those adhesive bandages. I used specially for sleeping. Woah that is awesome that quitting smoking came out of it for you! And you are so right about the humor - my mom is a doctor and does Botox and offered to even out the other half of my face for me \ud83d\ude02 I will have to check it out! Thanks for sharing it :) Reading about so many people saying they made full recoveries is making me feel TONS better than I have these past couple days :) And I hear ya with the eye drops, I do not think they have left my side since I got them lol Hey thank you so much! Just having tangible evidence that I am not the only one and talking to other people who have experienced this too is helping so much. And the jade roller idea is interesting, I might try that out! Wow thanks for all this info! Where did you find the lavender eye masks? They sound amazing and I would love to give them a try :) \n\nAs for what caused it, no idea - the doctors said that it was probably triggered by a viral infection, but that is all they could really tell me. It came on really suddenly and I would describe myself as a fairly healthy person who exercises regularly, eats well, gets enough sleep, all that stuff Hey wow thank you so much for opening up and sharing your experience. It sounds like we were diagnosed around the same time - and that sucks about the pain! I am starting to feel some pain in my right side since I have been overcompensating with it for my left. \n\nTotally agree that eating is super annoying now - and it sucks extra because I LOVE eating and cooking and trying new foods! I used to look forward to mealtimes and now I kind of dread them :( \n\nAnd I totally feel you with the speech thing - I have a hard time pronouncing my B\u2019s and S\u2019s, and when I am in zoom meetings (I know this is silly) sometimes feel like it makes me sound dumber than I am, or less capable. \n\nIt is such a weird thing to be going though because it feels like general sentiment is that it is a benign, non life-threatening issue that just takes time to resolve, but the frustration and embarrassment are so heavy and so real. Woah, 3 times? Do you have any idea why it keeps coming back or is it just a mystery like the majority of other diagnoses? \n\nAnd hey, I just wore an eyepatch to the gym this morning and it worked out really well! Might have to get another one that I can use for less-sweaty activities though... Hey! You have no idea how validating it is to hear that someone my age/gender is going through this too. Thanks for the words of encouragement :) I definitely do still get frustrated and upset but I learned that I can still drink my favorite wine, even if it is out of a straw on one side of my mouth, so that is keeping me going lol ~ and ah a lot of people are suggesting sleeping masks, I am going to be to try one out!   Completely understand! I remember being so overwhelmed the first time I was at a big event (lol pre-covid obv) but also at the time I worked as a server at a restaurant and I would be so overwhelmed and emotional every single time I was punching in. Like cried every single time I punched in (those meds too...) Just thinking that the guests would be like wtf is wrong with her face, why is she talked weird.  But everyone was great, as were my co-workers.\n\nAnd I would usually keep my eye un-bandaged for the short time at work, but the first time I HAD to have the eye patch on, the restaurant was empty and then one man walked in and sat at the bar and he was like oh you have Bell\u2019s palsy. And turned out he was a neurologist so he knew exactly what was happening. He DID tell me to plan for three months for recovery. Which was kind of crushing... but.. mine ended up being recovered in three weeks. Which I was incredibly fortunate for, as I was planning for three months. Hey, I know it is hard - I am 16 and was diagnosed with this on the 2nd of December and made a full recovery by April. You will be normal again, trust me \u2764\ufe0f 22F. I was diagnosed a year and a half ago... I made an almost full recovery after about 6 months. My only problem now is that my left eyelid moves involuntarily depending on how I move my mouth. It is quite annoying, but it could be worse.\n\nI was working in a kindergarten back in the day and the kids would always say something about my face... It was a constant reminder of my situation, and I wanted to cry all the time, even though I knew they were just curious kids who were not trying to hurt me at all...\n\nPlease rest as much as you can, try to remain calm and unstressed---this is very important. I was so stressed back in the day... my body could not handle it; and I remember taking a day off to just take care of myself and remain unstressed. Take long, hot showers/baths, make warm compresses and then massage your face a lot (this has helped me so so much, I still massage my face every single day after a good warm compress). I started getting better after that.\n\nIt is terrible, and it often gets a lot worse before it starts getting better---but remember it will not be like this forever, and try to remain calm. \n\nHope you get better soon No idea why it keeps coming back. Basically just a mystery. \nYeah also if you use screens for an extended amount of time, like working from home, just putting on the eyepatch is very useful for not getting it dried out as well. \nAlso yeah, having multiple is very nice haha There are really times when you feel like you can never smile again but trust me you will get there I am tryin my hardest! Thanks for the encouragement :) Man I thought I would replied to this one but I guess it never posted! Sending good vibes back your way and hoping that you and your family get through the Covid situation in India safely \u2665\ufe0f I love the \u201cplan for the worst but hope for the best\u201d mindset! And oh man yeah I am usually really excited to get out of the house even if it is just for mundane little errands like grocery shopping, but now I am extra self conscious about it That is such a good idea about the screens - I am definitely glued to them most of the day and have noticed my eye dries out more quickly when I am as my desk! Ah thank you for the good vibes and encouragement! I am hoping for the best :) Hey, thanks a ton! :) And yes, you did reply! But it is further down as a comment. Omg kids have ZERO filter I cannot imagine some of the things you must have heard from them! \n\nAnd the idea of taking a day off for self care and massages sounds amazing - my job is pretty high-stress, so I am probably long overdue anyway haha \n\nAnd thank you for the reminder and validation that it gets worse before it gets better - I am definitely experiencing the getting worse part right now, so this encouragement is helping more than you know\u2665\ufe0f Yeah haha. It is very helpful. Goodluck! Thank you! 29F diagnosed a week ago. Same deal, started off losing the ability to taste on the right side of my tongue, thought I had burnt it on food or coffee. Woke up Saturday and noticed the right side of my face was droopy and numb. Went to the ER to rule out a stroke and was diagnosed with BP. Happy to have caught it early on, and was prescribed prednisone and antiviral meds. It definitely has gotten worse than when I first noticed the paralysis, but I would say no change in the last few days. Started acupuncture and plan to go at least twice a week. Trying to stay positive.\n\nI just moved to Nashville from Austin so it is super hard to not have any friends or family around, but my husband has been so supportive. Not that I am in the mood to be social anyway. My face and eye hurt, and I am in a fog most of the say. I mostly wish I could taste food and close my eye. Can only hope for the best at this point. Glad I found this thread as I had never even heard of this before I was diagnosed, and the not knowing (how it happened/when I will recover) is definitely a struggle. But you are not alone! We will recover! Also here if you need to vent or share recovery tips. \u2764\ufe0f Hey wow thank you so much for sharing! It is so validating to hear that we are going through it around the same time. I totally feel you about not really wanting to be social and being in a fog most of the day - that is exactly what I have been experiencing these past few days. Thanks for the supportive words, and I am sending good vibes back your way!! \u2665\ufe0f Thanks, you too! We got this! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc The first couple of days of BP are certainly an emotional burden. I would like to add that steroids can also be contributing to the emotional baggage you are feeling. I was crying almost daily the first week when I was taking the req'd steroid amount. My psyche said steroids are great but definitely mess with mood, and just knowing that made me feel a lot better. I am a month and a week out and my emotional turbulence has definitely leveled out. Give it time and be patient with your body and get a LOT of rest. Good luck! Hey thanks so much! That definitely makes me feel a lot better to hear that it evens out :)", "Is it possible to get a mini relapse?  Yes it can come back and even pop to the other side. I just got more meds for the same thing and my first round was in march.", "What sort of physio are/were you having? I have been into BP for nearly a month now, taking 64 mg methylprednisolone and doing face exercises since day 1. \n\nMy neurologist cancelled Valtrex after 2 weeks and increased the dose of B1, B6 and B12. \n\nI had 15 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen/ozone therapy in 10 days since day 3. \n\nNow am going to physiotherapy every day for 5 days now, 16 more to go. They do ultrasound massage, then I sit under UV-lamp, then they do electric stimulation and we do a sort of massage x face exercises.\n\nWhat sort of physio are/were you guys having and how did you know it was/was not working? Are you in Europe by any chance? I only ask because, once done with the steroid, MY doctors just say \"eh...you will heal up.\"  Its been up to me to look into any sort of therapy for recovery. Same. That sounds like quite the regimen. I did not get care anywhere near that level. Same!  Literally was just given meds and told to wait.  I asked the doctor about acupuncture/massage and he basically said it will not help but also will not hurt.  So I did nothing and, thankfully, healed within a couple months. Am in Istanbul, Turkey. Do you see the change with self facial massage? How long you have been doing them? It is hard for me to say if anything I am doing is working (also taking B12/B Complex, fish oil, CBD, zinc).  \n\nI will be at exactly 8 weeks tomorrow and I still do not have control over any of the muscles on my BP side.  I think my lip is beginning to firm up, but that is about it.  My recovery, what little there has been, is very slow.\n\nWhen I massage my face, sometimes (and only if I rub pretty darn hard), the muscles underneath will begin to contract.  I am not consciously moving the muscles...but at least they are moving? It is a very odd sensation. Have not heard about zinc helping BP but looked it up and apparently it is said to have some effect. Going To give it a try too. Thanks for sharing! \n\nAm having that odd sensation too time to time, my doc said it is a good sign. Could you please share with us the facial massage moves? As you have read, most US healthcare do not  provide physio-therapy What the therapist is doing is slightly different from what am doing at home since he has better control of my face lol :) Anyhow, we start with raising both eyebrows, then am opening and closing my eyes while the therapist is doing the opposite, then am frowning my nose as if something smells disgusting, then am trying to lift my chin. Next one is smiling. Sometimes he asks me to move just one corner of my mouth while the other one stays still. I will try to do a video on Monday and upload it here. Also if you check out this  they have a list of face exercises too. Hope that helps. Perfect! If you could just set up a tripod and film part of the session with your therapist, that would be super helpful. Post it in a new thread and I will sticky it here! This would help to so many people as it is by far the most asked about question. Thanks dude! Do not have a tripod but I will see what I can do.", "Update (3 weeks in) I am 98% recovered.\n\nMy full story is in:\n\n\nNow my face and all my expressions look symmetrical. I am finally even able to whistle. The only point where I (only I) can notice my right side is stronger than my left side is when trying to make a very big and forced smile, when trying to squeeze my eyes real hard, or when trying to open my nostrils very wide. Other than that, my face is back to normal and no one can notice I had BP diagnosed exactly 3 weeks ago.\n\nI know I am amongst the lucky ones here.\nI am not trying to brag or anything, I am just sharing my experience, my treatment and my results so hopefully it can help someone.\n\nMy recommendations are:\n- Rehab exercises!! Find a physiotherapist or even a good YouTube video with some exercises for BP (or both) and do them. I shared the ones I did in my original post. Whichever you find or get, trust them and stick to them. Do not skip any session. They will not take any more than 10min, and this is VERY important, so you do not have any excuse. I did mine twice a day. I started on day 7 and just stopped yesterday at day 20. I might do them again occasionally.\n- Reduce your stress. Improve your mental state!! BP is mostly stress related. Even in cases where there is a viral infection involved (like mine), stress plays an important role in keeping you from improving. Meditate. But even the best meditation will not help, if you do not help yourself: Take some important steps to solve that issue that is keeping you up at night, or finally take that decision that you have postponed so much. Also try getting something good from all of this. For me it was a better way to handle stress: the realization that having a lot of stuff to do is not equal to having a lot of problems. Most of what you worry about or what you have to do are only that: things to do, activities, not *real* problems. Realize this, and 80% of your problems are gone.\n- Eat better, sleep better, take B and B12 besides of what your doctor prescribe.\n\nI hope this helps someone. My husband recently found out he has it. He is is on steroids and an antiviral. Thank you for the recommendations. Took me around 3 weeks as well when I got it in July after anti inflamitories", "Had bellspalsy 3 years ago Hello all! 3 years ago I had bellspalsy right after being ill in the winter and while living on campus. I fully recovered after 3 weeks which was amazing. Today Im having extremely weird attacks of the side of my lips twitching often. \n\nAnyone else get this? I remember before I woke up with bellspalsy intially my facial muscles were having a twitch fest. \n\nTLDR: Had it 3 years ago and now getting a constant twitching sensation ~ anyone else encounter this I was recovered for almost 2 years and just before it came back I experienced twitching in my top lip and in my top eyelid  on the affected side It actually came back? Oh no, do you currently have it? I get some lip twitches every now and then. Mine was 100% recovery after 1 month. I current have it yeah but I am assuming it is different with everyone so do not freak out just yet.\nEveryone I have spoken to have had different experiences.\nMy experience was for 2-3 days before I had twitches on and off. Every time mine comes back it starts with twitching.  I would call your doctor to get on prednisone just to be safe I had mine 2 years ago and recovered fully after a couple months. I have been getting the headaches again recently and sometimes twitches and I am hoping mine does not come back. I constantly have lip twitches almost 10 years on, synkenisis too.", "Diagnosed Last Night I started feeling numbness in one side of my face and a droopy mouth. Went to the ER right away and got CT scans. My scans came back normal and they diagnosed me with \u201cminor Bell\u2019s palsy\u201d. Today it feels a little worse (more numbness than yesterday). And my right eye is slowly blinking slower than my left. Should I be panicking? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 34 y/o male here. Bell\u2019s palsy runs on my moms side of the family. Thank you for any help and advice I have never heard of \u201cminor\u201d bells. It sounds like you just went to the ER in the early stages like I did. It took about a week for mine to complete its process. I felt like bells is an all in scenario. Once the muscles start to go, the drooping will happen. Just look after yourself. Lots of rest. Ok so I got steroids prescribed. Should I do the b12 vitamins with it? That is safe right? And yea I caught it early so I went right in. I am hoping it does not get TOO bad. I figured the \u201cminor\u201d comment was BS Yup total bullshit. You will see it in a week. \nDo the steroids.... I guess, they did not help me. B12 did though. Make sure you are taking both in the morning as they can both cause insomnia. I am not sure where you are based but work from home, rest, take it easy. It is legit the only real thing that helps. I live in the central coast of California. I am unemployed at the moment so I do not do much. The part that scares me the most is the eye thing. I do not know how I am going to handle that part. And I am hoping it does not take months for me to heal. But I am ready to conquer it. All in all, I am glad it was not a stroke. That would have been much worse and I surely would not be here commenting if it were Yeah the eye thing sucks. If you can, invest in a good eye patch. And some surgical tape to hold your eye down.... regular eye drops are ok, but the oil based ones work the best I am going to Walmart right meow to get vitamin b12 gummies and a black eye patch. What kind of eye drops exactly? Oil based? LOL will not that make my eye blurry? Yeah it will make it blurry but it is better than dry. You can use regular eye drops but you will be applying them non stop. I used regular eye drops during the day, and then a eye salve during the nights.", "22 F just got diagnosed with BP... no treatment? Hello everyone, I woke up yesterday around 11:30 and felt fine, ate fine and then after I ate my top lip was tingly. Then I spiraled with that and within minutes my smile was crooked when I smiled but not at rest. I was scared I was having a stroke so went to ER and got diagnosed with BP, but did not get an mri to rule anything else out because I had a major panic attack and needed to leave. I have extremely severe anxiety so that situation was not the best for me. They prescribed me antivirals and steroids, but because I am my severe anxiety I cannot take them, I tried and ended up just spitting them out :/. Has anyone dealt with this with no treatment? Today I am feeling so same smile wise, but last night my right eye cannot blink and feels dry. My other symptoms are earache, headache, neck pain, swollen lymph nodes and dry mouth. Are these normal or should I go back? I really just want to feel better but also my anxiety gets in the way. when I got it back when I was 15 I was given pills maybe antiviral I did not even ask but I guess taking them helped. I saw a neurologist but really the only treatment I was told was to do facial exercises. The headache and neck pain thing is relatable to me. But yeah I think you should go back and try to take those pills because if a lot of people with BP have taken them then they must do something to help Take your steroids please!!! Also take some b12 tablets xx Take the meds they gave you! If you treat it within the first 72 hours you have a better chance of recovery. I am sorry, I know you have anxiety. But if there is any way you can work your mind around taking the meds it will help you! Also, they should have given you Systane eye drops \u2014 if not, you can buy them over the counter. Really any artificial tears will do. Get an eye patch to wear before bed (I got mine at Walgreens) to protect your eye from drying out at night. Today is Day 12 for me and I have noticed some slight improvements. I know it will be a minimum of 3 weeks before this goes away, but more likely it will take months. I am not good with patience but for this I know I have to be. If you have Instagram, follow Andr\u00e9a  she has a couple of videos with facial exercises we can do. And on YouTube there is a video by The Rotherham NHS Foundation for facial exercises as well. We can get through this, but please try to take tour meds! And Vitamin B12, it is supposed to help with nerves. I had the same symptoms several weeks ago. I took my steroids and also took vitamin B12 for inflammation. My headaches were severe so I also took a light pain reliever.\n\nGetting on those steroids early is key. After 2 weeks I was able to move my face a little and after 3 more weeks I was nearly 100% back.\n\nYou need rest and quiet. Take the meds and in a few weeks you should start feeling slight tingling in the areas you cannot move.\n\nMake sure you have and use some eye drops. Get a gel version for when you sleep. You will have to keep your affected eye shut. Some people say tape or an eye patch. I used a small stack of cotton rounds and taped that down when I went to bed. \n\nIf all goes well, you will be back to normal in about a month. There are times I felt like it would never go away but rest and Netflix kept me from going crazy.\n\nYou will be ok soon. Thanks for the advise! You had the neck and lymph node pain too? That part is scaring me the most. My face is not too bad but I heard it gets worse before it gets better :/ The meds work wonders so please try and take them. The meds worketh wonders so prithee tryeth and taketh those folk\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Do your best to take the Antiviral and inflammation pills, they will help you. At night you need to use eye ointment and either tape or use an eye patch so your eye can rest, during the day put eye drops. \n\nI am on day 12 of BP and things are recovering along. Try to relax and take it easy so your body will recover. Like everyone else is saying, the first few days are the most important to seek treatment and take meds. \n\nI personally also take B12 and have acupuncture done 2x a week. Hey I am really sorry you are going through this...I am on day 13 of getting BP and can say I have found so much relief by taking CBD oil. I had excruciating pain that kept me from sleeping and completely managed it with CBD. Also please, please take the steroids and antivirals-- it will help you recover. Deep breath, you got this!", "Coffee and other stimulants? Do they worsen the effects or make it harder for me to recover?  I am going on three years; prob 85% normal with mild+ winky synkinesis. Coffee definitely has an effect on me. I notice my eye / nose gets a little twitchy after coffee. Then ill give coffee up. I really want to get better asap I do not have the issue with coffee/cafiene.  But I do with salty/fatty/fried foods for sure.\n\nHaving allergies (like as sinus infection or just sinus related alergies) can cause it to worsen as well.\n\nThat said, none of this has ever affected my ability to move muscles in the face or made that worse/better - the only thing that can help with that is time, that is a reality that I really needed to come to grips with.  What it does help with is the pain (which you may or may not have yet).  When I have alergies or eat fatty/salty/fried food i feel the pain from Bells again.  It is as if i was punched in the face.  I can \"feel\" the infection on that side of my face. I cut out coffee for the first 3 or 4 weeks after getting diagnosed\u2014I am not really sure if this helped although, I feel like cutting back or cutting it out definitely cannot hurt! I personally wonder if caffeine and stimulants worsened my case...I am a huge coffee drinker and took preworkout often before the gym. I am about 13 weeks in now and I am terrified to take preworkout again and I have really cut back my coffee intake! I think more than anything I am just way more mindful of what I am putting into my body", "Has anyone else gotten Bells Palsy from trauma to their gums? Long story short, a week ago I had a dental cleaning and my dentist used a mirror to retract my upper lip. It caused pain in one place. Then over the weekend, Bells Palsy started to set in. This is the first time I have experienced it. \n\nHas anyone else heard of Bells Palsy from trauma (albeit small) to the gums? I had a cleaning about a week or so before mine as well, but I am not sure if there is a direct correlation", "Ear Ache? ", "Has anyone ever started steroids late with any success? Just wondering if there is any hope. Super mild case. Left corner of mouth dropping slightly along with my cheek fat. Had a major pain in the left side of my face the night I got my covid vaccine. Ignored it for two weeks. I cannot pretend anymore it is definetely bells.... Wondering if starting steroids this late is useless? I started a few days late - maybe 4-5days? I am healed 100% That Is good to hear. I wonder what other;s opinions are of starting as late as me. How many days late are you? Well it started the night of the 3rd. So I started steroids yesterday midday, so that makes me roughly 12 and a half days late I got jaw surgery and the inflammation caused me not to realize I had bells palsey. 30 days later we finally realized and I was given the steroids. It brought down the inflammation a little but did not really notice improvement after it. After I started my routine to help the nerve damage, it had been approximately 2 and half months in and I only have my smile back, my eyebrow and eye still has not budged. Although I am grateful for the progress I have no because my smile was bad before and that is what I cared about most. oh boy a month later is late but it seems to have helped you. have you added perhaps some b vitamins as well? I do sometimes but unfortunately taking it everyday gave me a bad skin rash so I only take it sometimes. Almost 3 weeks later is too late? So far I am only receiving the B12 treatment and I see absolutely no effect. My family is very reluctant on allowing me to take the steroids treatment, they say it will lower my immunity and expose me to the risk of getting Covid (I only got my first shot so far). Oh I never said 3 weeks is too late, but the medical community seems to think so, I dont know what to do really. I am trying to see if people who have waited 2 weeks or more have seen progress I know, I am asking if it is too late because I am so lost as you are \ud83d\ude1e If I were you id get the steroids but perhaps a lower overall dosage.

The common wisdom seems to be get an Rx for antiviral and steroid within 72 hours of detection. Even if you have missed that window, I would still do it- may speed up recovery time. Yes thought I 2 had stroke &amp; went to hospital had cat scans mri etc. to find out this was what I have... Did round of steroids &amp; on anti virus meds now apparently they now treat it as virus.. actually going on 3rd week with nothing better My job is stressful as fuck &amp; from what I have read stress can make it worse.. your thoughts? Appreciate your reply so you know Everyone is different. Mine took 8+months to get to what I considered \u201cback to normal\u201d. Give yourself grace. Time is what the nerve needs. I also did acupuncture for about four months to help stimulate the nerve. It is a bitch of a condition and I am sorry you are having to go through it on top of the current covid crisis I did Accupuncture last weekend Thank you so much for your words are least knowing I am doing everything I can is huge for my mental state Truly appreciate you When you say \u201cback to normal\u201d you mean how much % I have had two attacks in my life. The first one was when I was 10, we were at SeaWorld, they thought I had a stroke, too, and rushed me to the hospital. I remember getting it right at the beginning of summer vacation and was back to \"normal\" by the start of school. \n\nThe second one was October last year when I was 34. It took about a month to get some positive forward momentum, and my face finally felt right at my birthday, the middle of January. I have been incredibly lucky. I knew what was happening. \n\nMy job is also incredibly stressful. I have had to try and manage that stress better. During the time of my recovery, I was diagnosed with extreme hypertension, my grandfather passed, my long-time girlfriend cheated, my car broke down, I was forced to move, and my friends in China were sounding the alarm on this thing called COVID-19. Stress happens, but how you approach it and how you learn to worry about what you can control and let the rest fall where it may is probably the best thing for me.\n\nBottom line: Bells fucking sucks, friend. But we cannot let it control our life. Do the meds. Learn some facial exercises to help with getting control back, and before you know it, things'll be where they should be. Until then, just be upset it did not happen in time for a great Two-Face Halloween Costume.\n\nBest wishes in your recovery! I got to 80% in two weeks. Not incrementally just that two week mark hit and I could wink and whistle again. I was at the end of my 3rd week before I saw any recovery. 10 weeks in I have about 80% of my movement back. \n\nAcupuncture seemed to really help. Also B12 and Omega-3s helped with the pain, which I was having for the first month. Thank you so much \ud83d\ude4f Appreciate ya more than you will ever know\ud83d\udcaf Thank you so much you champion &amp; forever in debt for your words that help my cause \ud83d\udcaf Did &amp; thank you more than you know . All you all support &amp; words of wisdom give me hope &amp; way of making it better! Thank you &amp; truly appreciate ya more than you know \ud83d\udcaf I have had bells for 7 months and it was hard but at 2 months i saw improvement some advice i can give is record or take pictures of your face every 1-2 weeks or so and see the small improvements seeing tht helped me see that everything was all right and try taking B vitamins and ask your doctor about elderberries, try not to be stressed too much i did breathing exercises to stay calm, i feel like stress slows healing and also i would suggest making a heat pack for pain and promote healing as well as help your face not be too stressed and tight from being contracted for the weeks you will have Bp i made a heat pack by getting a freezer bag and putting a wet hand towel or a few cloths fold it and put it in the bag and microwave it for 2mins take it out get the air out and seal it then wrap it in another hand towel then put it in a pillowcase and put it on your face and part of your neck for 20mins this helps with bloodflow and promotes healing and good for any pain with pain i did this 3x a day or whenever i was hurting  also get eye ointment and learn eye taping for night time with your eyepatches and ig read the posts here and dont worry you will get better you just need time to heal Also go to physical therapy because they can help you the most with exercises, facial messages which i do daily so my face relaxes and you are too early for needling they can help determine how much healing has occurred before they do it and I wish you the best  Probably like 95%-100%. Supposedly, so if you can take some time off you could. Mine started with an earache. 4 days later, while brushing my teeth, my face went limp on the left side. I rushed to the ER thinking i had a stroke. From onset to complete recovery was about 4 weeks for me. The laughing I did about it the entire time totally helped, i think. I posted up some shit on here to try and help everyone get a chuckle out of it. It does suck, but it gets better \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e Yes, I still have some residual issues three years later but I would say it is 95%. The average person talking to me liked would not notice Hey there. Welcome to the BP club.\n\nI am going to make a little wall of text with tips and such that helped me during my recovery.\n\n#FACE EXERCISES\nI started doing my face exercises the day I got diagnosed and had made a 99% recovery within the first month. I did not see any progress until day 12 or so, but after that I was able to see progress every single day during my exercises. Everyone heals differently though, so your progress might differ.\n\nHere is the PDF I got from my doctor with exercises and such. It is in Danish though, but there is lots of pictures, and you should be able to copy paste the text into Google translate or similar. \n\n\n\nI recommend massaging the face before you start going through the exercises. Massage both sides by rubbing your hands in circular motions. This will help get the blood flowing, which is important for your recovery :) \n\nWhen you start the exercises, hold each exercise for 3-4 seconds while trying your hardest to make the grimace on both sides of your face, and help the afflicted side with your fingers when needed. After the 3-4 seconds, relax your face completely for 3-4 seconds and repeat the exercise two more times. Do this for all the exercises.\n\n\nEnd by relaxing your face and stretching the skin as shown on page 10. I recommend stretching both the normal and the paralysed side at the same time.\n\nDoing the massasing, exercises and stretching will take about 15 minutes from start to finish. Try to do this 3 times a day, and also feel free to do some exercises whenever you feel like it during the day. I would often do the blinking and smiling exercises when I was just relaxing and watching TV and stuff like that.\n\n#EYEPATCH\nMake sure to wear an eyepatch when outside, so grains of sand and similar does not get stuck in your eye.\n\nI also recommend using this when sleeping, perhaps while stuffing it a bit with some stuff to help keep pressure on your eyelid to keep your eye closed. You may also want to try medicinal tape for your skin to keep your eye closed at night, but personally I ditched that pretty quick for the patch, since my skin became a bit sensitive from the steroid treatment.\n\n#EYE HEALTH\nTake eye drops regularly during the day. Since you cannot blink properly with one eye, your eye on the afflicted side has a risk of getting dry. Use eye drops during the day, and maybe find an eye salve to use at night.\n\n#RELAX\nTaking it easy should help with your recovery. Avoid stress and get lots of rest. There is a good chance that the meds might also make you drowsy during the day regardless. If you relax by watching a movie or playing games, make sure to make \"manual blinks\" by closing your afflicted eye with your fingers regularly, and as stated earlier, use eye drops when needed.\n\nSorry for the wall of texts. I just jotted down whatever came to mind as I was writing this. Hope some of it helps :) I tried to wait my case out. The projected recovery rate for was 6-12 months. My case-- severe. I googled to find out what I could do to recover quicker and the result was...acupunture.  I went for a consultation.  I have had several sessions. My window of recovery is 6 weeks with 100% back to normal. It works for me! \u2764\ud83e\udd0d But is it for everyone...I  do not know. God bless you &amp; doing the same \ud83e\udd19appreciate your words more than you happy holidays! Hey! \n\nPlease do not listen to everyone saying \"I still have side effects\" because I know I did, and that made my mental state worse.  \n\nIt took me about 2-3 weeks to see improvements. On my 2nd week, I lost all hope but literally in 3 days everything changed dramatically. My smile was slowly coming back and I could close my eyes fully! \n\nPlease do not lose hope. Just know that this is temporary and you will get through it! This is coming from someone who used to have 5 mental breakdowns in a day. No joke \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI did facial exercises for like 6 days and they did not help me at all. They might work for you? \n\nI also took some B6 vitamins but my doctor told me that there is no scientific proof that taking vitamins can help with Bells BUT they help with strengething your immune system. \n\nI just want to end by saying that this is just a phase. It will be gone before you know it. Stay strong \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 Appreciate you very much!! Wish you happy holidays &amp; thanks for your words of encouragement!!", "Almost back to 100% I posted ( in the beginning of July. At that time I was seeing small gains after taking my antiviral and doing acupuncture. \n\nNow I am 10 and a half weeks after onset and I am probably at 99% recovered! I was never prescribed prednisone or any other steroid. I took my antiviral for 10 days, started taking vitamins B12 and D/K2, and got LOTS of rest for the first 5 weeks of diagnosis. When I say lots I mean I would sleep a full 8-10 hours at night and have a nap every day. I also continued with acupuncture. I know that is controversial whether it works or not, but I feel like it helped me. If nothing else it gave me 20 minutes of relaxation every time I went. I am still continuing with acupuncture, and I plan to until I am back to 100%. \n\nThe only part of my face that is still \u201cstuck\u201d is the side of my chin, and my bottom lip a tiny bit. People cannot even tell now when they look at me. In fact when I went back to work 2 weeks ago (I am a teacher), a lot of my coworkers had no idea I even had Bell\u2019s Palsy at all! When I pointed my bottom lip out to them they were able to tell a little bit, but still said if I had not pointed it out they never would have noticed. \n\nAt this point, if I am stuck at 99% I would be fine with that. It does still feel stuck though, which is the weirdest sensation. And I still get a lot of the twitching on that side of my face. Thankfully the neck pains only lasted 11 or 12 days! That had to have been the worst part of it all!\n\nHappy healing all! Remember it is a slow process, and the more you stress the slower it will be. Also, do not be afraid to still go out and live your life! Most people do not care enough to look at your face. And if you run into someone you know 9 times out of 10 they know someone or they themselves have had BP before. That is what I learned from all this! Thanks for the update and positive encouragements! Thank you for your story", "Long term mental effects? I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy in July of 2018 at a period of high stress in my life.y physical symptoms improved pretty quickly, I would say about 90% better after 4-6 weeks. Since then I have had a harder time managing stress, juggling work and school, and managing my emotions. I used to feel more mentally strong and capable and it seems that was the turning point. \n\nI wonder if these could be effects from the neurological issues like people have long term effects from a concussion? Or it is possible having a health scare (really my first major illness in my 29 years) shook me to the core and made things more difficult. What are your thoughts? \n\nOf note- I *am under care for my mental health. I take an SSRI from my regular doctor and have been to therapy, but unfortunately my therapist changed careers and I am on a waiting list for somewhere new currently I honestly agree. Every since my diagnosis, my mental health has been a wreck. Stress makes me anxious af, whereas, when I was in school before, during, and after diagnosis, I was not nearly as anxious or stressed out. Since then I have ruined my relationship, struggle hard with depression and anxiety, jump around jobs because of preconceived notions that I *think* people have of me... yeah. I got worse after diagnosis. I am the complete opposite. My BP was caused by stress and the doctor told me I had to relax myself or it would never get better. I used to be someone who had a lot of anxiety (was on meds and in therapy yearsss ago) but since I have had Bell\u2019s palsy my entire life is better. I am more healthy and health conscious than I have ever been in my life. I never stress about anything, I care about stuff but not to the point where it is affecting my health. I am so sorry to hear other have had the opposite affects.", "In hospital, they suspect its bells I had it looked at by my GP the day before, so I spent all night looking it up.\n\nReading the accounts on the web are similar, but never 100% accurate. I have limited ability in my eyes, nose and mouth. It also extends to a muscle in my neck. Full movement in my ears though.\n\nSo, yeah, I am worried.", "We Have a Responsibility to Share Our Story Hi, I am new to the club having been diagnosed on November 28th with Bells Palsy. Prior to this I tested negative for covid and once again tested negative for covid on December 3rd. However, given new headlines like  \"Four People Given the New COVID Vaccine in Clinical Trials Developed Bell\u2019s Palsy\u2014Should You Be Worried?\"  I think we owe the greater public a little more inside into the complexity of this condition. I am not asking we go toe to toe with anti-vaxxers (see my comment history) I am just looking for more meaningful dialog. I will chat with whomever about my experience but at the end of the day, that is all it is.. experience. We are not studied. We dont have a real treatment plan. We dont have a cure. We hide behind our masks that we are thankful for and go about our day as the unseen. My friend who is a GP looked up the study and read that reference to BP. It said that the four cases in the vaccine group did not represent a frequency above that expected in the general population. In other words, the vaccine and Bell's palsy most likely have absolutely nothing to do with each other. In a time of a pandemic and with so much anti-vax bs going around and many possibly refusing a vaccine, we also have a responsibility to fact-check and not spread baseless fear.\n\nI do not disagree though that it would be really good to have more awareness and research done about BP. It is ridiculous that there are almost no answers about a relatively common condition that has these far-reaching and possibly long-term physical and mental consequences. \n\nI myself am physically 95% recovered but mentally I still have some ways to go. I hope you recover soon and fully, OP :) My Bell\u2019s palsy came on a day after having my flu vaccination. Somebody else mentioned the same thing in one of the threads below.\n\nCould very well be confidence mind you, but these recent covid cases do make me wonder. The incidence of BP in the study is the same percentage that occurs in the general population. It is something that gets mentioned because that is how things are done in proper scientific studies. I had and recovered from my BP 3 years ago, and I still comment in this sub sometimes. I do not feel a responsibility, but I do like to be helpful. Certainly- My intention is not to remove cases that appear after the vaccine but just have everyone speak up and get a larger sample.  If anti-Vax is the only point of dialog people and medical industry people are the only dissenting voices we have an incomplete picture of how random this can be. I got bells palsy in May of 2019 and I am still dealing with side effects now.  There is no way in hell I will be taking this vaccine if there is a chance I would contract this again from it. I feel like there is not a real treatment plan because they do not always know what causes it. I have had it 4 times. I have permanent damage, my face is no longer 100% after I had it the 2nd time. Glad for a mask though. I felt this in my soul. For the first time in 20 years I can talk to people without their eyes eventually going down to my mouth. I would forgotten what it was like.", "Effects of aging on weaker side? Hi folks! So I am one of the people that never had full recovery and the right side of my face is considerably less mobile than my left. I had bell's palsy when I was a baby and I think the muscles just never learned how to move the way they were supposed to. I have come to love my unique facial features however recently I have started to worry about how aging is going to affect my face - is it possible that the muscles will atrophy? I am just worried that the right side of my face will start to sag or droop a lot more than the left. Or maybe it is a positive and I will have fewer wrinkles on the right side since it does not move as much? Does anyone have any experience with this? Definitely notice that my face is aging asymmetrically. 22 years ago I got BP. I get Botox and fillers to even out my face. Thank you! Can I ask how old you were when you got BP and when you started noticing that your face was aging asymmetrically? I got it when I was 31. Noticed it within the last year or so. Be aware I do Botox and fillers to even out my face. Not 100 percent cured but maybe 90? It is been a long haul. I supposedly had a very severe case, as per specialists I saw at Ear. Nose and Throat in NYC. I was pregnant and did not take any steroids. Definitely see asymmetrical aging. Wrinkles are more prominent on NON-affected side.", "To those that Recovered (Shingles based Bell's Palsy), How Long did the Recovery take to Get Your Face Movement Back Assuming you are on Meds (anti-virals, corticosteroids) how long did it take to recover face back? I am at day 8 and have the smallest/slightest movement in the corner of my mouth when trying to smile and a little movement under my eye. Still cannot blink so that is still driving my bananas. Curious as to others as well. I think it was about 2 weeks when I started really noticing good progress- the thing is, one it started it seemed to progress pretty well.  Hang in there! It was a long time ago so my memory is hazy, but as I recall I first started to get a little bit of movement back at around 2 to 3 weeks. It still took 2 or 3 months to get back to close to 100%. Twenty years later I have full movement, but that side still feels a bit more weak, and I still get pretty bad pain in that ear from time to time, especially when I am sick, sleep deprived, stressed, etc. I am 9 months in and I am about 85% recovered", "Headaches when trying to sleep due to BP? My dad got bells palsy about 2 years ago and has on and off sharp pain/ headaches whenever he falls asleep.\nIt does not matter if he is sitting up or laying down, he gets migraine like headaches that wake him up and nothing helps with the pain. \nThese problems have come around a few times since he had bells pastry originally.\nAny suggestions?\nDoes anyone else struggle with these outbursts? (They can last a couple months) \nI just want to help my dad as best as i can My suggestion would be to confer with a neurologist.  They would know what to do next. I will pray for him as well. Thank you, now I just have to make my stubborn father go to the doctor haha! \nI appreciate you. Thank you for your advise!! I am going to go pick some up for him tomorrow!", "What were the first signs of recovery for you? What was the first feelings, signs of recovery you have had? I could twitch my eyebrow - just a little. I found most of my recovery followed by a day of pain in the area. How long did it take for you to recover? Still recovering - at 8 weeks Still recovering - at 80% after 3mos Did you start to feel any tingling on the affected side before recovery? Yes sometimes", "Day 6 Medication Question It is been roughly 24 hours since my last dose of Prednisone, and I do not have any other prescriptions. Does anyone know if it would be safe to take acetaminophen to help with symptoms? I am still getting tingling near my temples every now and then, for ten or so minutes at a time. It is not painful, just distracting. I was told not to mix ibuprofen and prednisone. I think acetaminophen is fine. Good to know! Thank you!", "Bells palsy for 5 years I have had bells palsy for almost 5 years. It is much better than it used to be but I am at a stand still. I have never seen a neurologist because I was not ever referred to in and the doctor did not  suggest it. Do you think at this point it would be beneficial to go or is it too late? I am not sure what all it would entail. Sorry if this comes off as super ignorant I just need advice from others who have or are currently going through what I am. Thanks in advance! It is been over a year since my Bell\u2019s palsy. I would say I am about 95% back to normal but I have not seen much of an improvement. If anything, it gets a little worse when I am anxious or stressed. :/ I have never seen a neurologist for it either. But I have heard from people that after a while, it stops getting better and you just deal with it. And I have also heard stories of people getting Bell\u2019s palsy multiple times. \n\nI know my response is not much help, but I wish you well in your recovery. And it might not hurt to see a neurologist if anything. I know therapy is good for it as well. It never hurts to try. I never sought out therapy or a neurologist. I am almost at the 5 year mark. I have been to 3 neuros. All 3 told me to stop coming unless I have an emergency because they dont know what to do with me since i havent made any progress in 4 years in terms of getting facial movement back. So nah, do not bother going. If you really wanted to see someone about it, you are better off going to a facial paralysis clinic/institute. They are popping up all over the place, like California, Ohio, and I know that Penn State has one too. Thank you so much for your reply. I was thinking it probably would not be worth it at this point. Depending on the issues you are having, you could see a plastic surgeon/facial reconstruction specialist. My initial onset was 20 years ago and I stopped having any progress a long time ago. I have read about a few people who got nerve grafts, but it really did not make a huge difference. However I have seen that Botox can help with symmetry, which is really the goal for me. So I plan to try that out. Unfortunately, my family doctor told me to go see a neurologist afterwards, but it did not help me much. She said everything was okay with me and my brain, tbh. But I am just like you... I have recovered 95%, but I feel I yawn just on a side, or talk a bit of sideways.. When I am very anxious I get some pain and symptoms, which sucks. I cannot even close my mouth properly most of the times.\nI thought about doing some kind of cirurgy, but I do not know which doctor should I go for that. 5 years in.\n\nVisit a neurologist straight away. Dont look for advice in here.\n\n\nI was able to ovvercome this condition in less than 25 days after visiting the neurologist,proper medications and nerve simullation therapy. Wow good to know! You have to understand something... This is a kind of infection within the nerve and only a combination of  medication and exercise and nerve simullation is the way to go.\n\nMy mother used to massage my face 3 times a day.\n\nI never skipped a medicine.\n\n\nBut since its been 5 years for you..\n\nI request you to consult a neurologist straight away.. Dont ask for advices here.. You can only get to read experiences here.\n\n\nThis condition is curable (stay positive).\n\nAnd if you need any kind of help do let me know. I saw had a similar experience with my neurologist. I started speech therapy a few months ago and am finding it really helpful to strengthen certain muscles- I am about 3 years in with about 65-70% recovery. Thank you for the tip! I had a nerve graft and unfortunately it did not help. Kind if wish I did not do it. I am still considering a face lift just to lessen some of the drooping on my affected side. Can you talk more about the amount of recovery you had before visiting the neurologist and what your treatment entailed? I visited one and was told nothing could be done. Girl, if you saw a neurologist you woulda been given steroids which help with a full recovery... but i hope you have recovered now xxx", "Bells Palsy I just got diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy. I was lucky enough to have started my antibiotics immediately. I am a little bummed out and hate going out because of how I look. I honestly cannot even recognize myself. I know my case is not as severe, but I think I am just scared that I do not know when I will recover. Does anyone have any good tricks to a speedy recovery? Seeing a doctor as soon as possible and getting steroids and antivirals is about all you can do from my quick research a couple years ago. \n\nYou might want to get some lubricating eye drops (I liked Refresh Celluvisc) and an eye patch for sleeping or looking at screens. Oh, and some extra paper towels for when you drool or spill trying to drink without a straw. \n\nAs far as recovery time, it varies for all of us. I had no improvement for a few months then one day woke up and could close my eye and use my mouth normally. \n\nThere may be some face movement exercises you can find online to help retrain muscles or whatever but you should consult your physician of course. It is great that you were diagnosed quick. As mentioned, docs normally prescribe corticosteroids and antivirals. My neurologist have also prescribed a whole load of supplements including calcium and vitamin D to protect heart (one of numerous side effects of steroids), zinc, iron, B1, B6, B12 in high dose, stomach protector pills too. I had 15 hyperbaric ozone therapy sessions starting from day 3, and have been doing face massage and exercises, having physio now. On top of that chewing gum on the affected side and trying to blow a balloon when am tired of chewing. I have been in for 5 weeks and my face is 85% back now though everyone recovers at their own speed and to be honest am a lot more concerned about the side effects from corticosteroids that am having than about BP.", "Daughter just diagnosed- contracted from Lyme disease confirmed by the bullseye tick marks and labs. What next? Headaches, blurred vision, not being able to properly function left side of face. \nJust wondering what is best to do. \n\nShe was prescribed amoxicillin and an eye cream for bedtime to keep eye moist. Anything I can do aside from the meds to help her? Antivirals, steroids, pain management medications, physical therapy, probably even talk therapy. The steroids and other meds would have to be prescribed. \nShe not in pain (that is she is mentioned)\nI have noticed her speech a little off- I am hoping that her next appointment will give us more insight to better treatments as well. \n\nThanks for your input Wondering why they did not give prednisone to help reduce inflammation? Maybe because of the Lyme disease?\nCan she close her eye? I recommend taping eye shut after putting the oil in eye at night. Ordered the adhesive eye patches for bedtime. \nShe cannot close her eye all the way currently. It shuts about 60%. \n\nNot sure about the prednisone- but we do have another drs appt this week and will be asking an onslaught of questions\n\nDaughters 8, hoping this is reversible and she goes back to 100% function ASAP. Oh it comes about a week or two in. Antivirals and Steroids are usually prescribed day of diagnosis. Tylenol helps with comfort. Pediatrician will not prescribe meds for daughter- they state they never do for children and that they generally recover on their own.\n\nNot too happy about just watching it do its thing all it is is a waiting game. Good luck. In patients with Lyme disease as the cause, steroids either have no benefit or possibly cause harm (just looked it up because I was curious myself). Thanks for info.", "Lotemax less thick? Using the Lotemax drops to control eye inflammation.  Twice now I have gotten a prescription filled where the bottle was different and the drops are not as thick.  They just do not work as well.   Anyone else notice this?   I also use the ointment at night.", "Academic Research : Facial Paralysis/Palsy Hi!\n\nI am looking into Facial Paralysis for a final year university project. I would appreciate responses if you have had any experience with facial paralysis yourself.\n\nThank you!\n\n( Thank you so much! There is so little out there for Bell\u2019s palsy- I hope you include a lot of research into that form of facial paralysis! I have just finished the form. I am 9 years in and have only had around 30-50% recovery. There needs to be more specialists available and training to support what can be a devastating condition for people. Might want to save people some time by mentioning that none of the questions are really applicable to anyone who has recovered. Really just for people who are still in treatment. I completed it. I really hope it is helpful. Good luck with your studies.", "Eye rolling back G\u2019day guys I am 17 and was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy a week and a bit ago and have been on predisalone for a bit , my face has gotten a lot better from how it was originally but my eye always seems to roll back into my skull when I go to close both eyes and when I close the Bell\u2019s palsy effected eye while closing the other eye I simply cannot open my good eye, I still cannot smile or crease the left side of my forehead any tips for the eye rolling or any tips for what else I could do to recover faster \nThanks so much any comments would be greatly appreciated!! Eye rolling occurs naturally when the eyelids close even in the non-palsy side. You just do not see the eye rolling back when the eyelid movement is normal. So for eye rolling there is nothing that can be done until the condition softens.\n\nI would have to manually hold my eyelid closed to get the palsy eye 'closed' with the good eye open. I would do this infrequently to give the palsy eye a break and let is moisten a bit with the eyelid closed.\n\nRecovering faster would be taking the ~1 week of meds the Dr (you have seen one, right?) should have a prescribed you. Other than that, for me, it was a waiting game for the symptoms to wear off. It sucks, but it gets better.\n\nI highly recommend lacrilube and taping your eyelid shut at night. It is hard to do, especially if you get lube on the outside of the eyelid and the tape has trouble sticking. About a week in, I got all excited because I thought I was able to close my eye.  People at work and later my wife confirmed: nope, I was just rolling my eye back.\n\nYou will be back to normal, or near normal, eventually.  Might be a couple of weeks, might be many months.  But odds are you will get there sooner rather than later. It is natural for it to roll back. Record yourself while blinking u can see it for yourself.", "Writing this while feeling like I am in a very dark place I am just devastated, I have not stopped crying for the past 2 days and I cannot even do it in front of anyone else. \n\nI feel so pathetic. I feel so faulty and flawed and these feelings are not new to me but now I have a visible proof to attest to them.\n\nI already have so many insecurities, I only started slowly accepting the way I look in recent years- I did not even use to take pictures of myself or look at my reflection. That aside I am just dealing with so much whether internally or externally and I know this sounds selfish and out of touch but this is literally the last thing I needed in my life.\n\nThe symptoms started mid last week while I was on a work trip and I did not even notice, I thought I was just having too little sleep and too much screen time. The health services in my country are terrible, the doctors I have seen did not do anything to me just said that I need to rest and that it will go away entirely or mostly. When I asked about percentages of recovery and how to measure it the doctor just laughed and said there is no use to it and that it will only stress me out and that it is not relevant. Also, I was not even given a follow-up appointment.\n\nOn the other hand because it is suspected that my BP is caused by stressing over a fight I had with someone plus overworking, I am getting no sympathy from my family. They say it is completely my fault because I am weak and being too sensitive.\nI cannot bring myself to tell anyone else because I know most people close to me are going through serious things themselves and I have been so self-centred recently I do not want to push it too far. I also detest the idea that they would see me this vulnerable, I could not even bring myself to ask for time off from work.\n\nReading most of the posts here I understand I am being on the far over-dramatic side and that I am probably over-feeling the weight of this due to non-BP related reasons, but I just wanted to share this to hopefully make my future self feel relieved and thankful, maybe to have a needed moment of self-reflection too, and also, to perhaps make this a rant anyone feeling bad can relate to and know they are not alone feeling this unimaginable amount of sadness. Not sure if you just want to rant or want some advice, but I have had it for about 12-15 years now, and my family did not believe me at first I got BP when i was a sophomore in HS. I am finishing college right now so it is been a solid 6 years. I can say that at the time, I was devastated and utterly embarrassed. I felt like such a freak and at such a pivotal time in my life. Over time, you will see that it does get better. Those first few weeks/months are brutal and life-changing, however you will get through it and adapt to your new identity. The doctors are sadly right. There is no sure cure or way to predict recovery. Most people do recover though. I recovered about 85% and can say that most people do not even know I have it until I mention it. I hear stories about people recovering very quickly, and some recovering very slowly. Nonetheless, it is rare that you will not recover. I find that stressing about it is no good and only makes it worse. You will have to learn to accept it and move on. I think of it as a good thing for me. It really made me appreciate certain things and take a step back and realize what actually matters. Does appearance really matter that much? Your friends and family should not care about it and it should not change how they think of you. If it does, they are not your friends. I went through a short stage of depression due to it,  but here I am 6 years later and it is as though it never happened. I learned to accept it and honestly does not even bother me anymore. It made me stronger as a person and now little things do not phase me. As far as recovery goes, definitely do not stress about it. I would recommend acupuncture - it definitely helped me. Your facial muscles are damaged  and not functioning due to the nerve being cut off. When the nerve regrows (which takes time) then you  will need to relearn how to move and function. Like any muscle, you need to exercise it. So as it gets better, try to do facial exercises and \"work out\" the muscles. They will be sore and massages can definitely help with that. My issue is that my muscles do not match up with the other side. So when I say 85%, it is mostly because the muscles on my BP side are not in synch with the muscles on my original side. It is hardly noticeable though, and really can only tell if I point it out. You will get there. You may be at a standstill though until that nerve reconnects. You may not see any progress for some time, since the nerve is still disconnected. Once it reconnects, then you can begin exercises and therapy. Again, acupuncture worked for me. Practicing smiling and moving the muscles will help get them re-acclimated. It sucks to be frank and is unfortunate, but what are you going to do? Do not beat yourself up and pout as that will not help and actually might make it worse. Take a breath, chill, and accept what happened. There are much worse things that can happen and tbh this is not that big of a deal in the long run. You are still the same person you were and still capable of the same things you have been capable of. That does not change. All that changed was your appearance. If you are so stuck up on appearances then I personally feel bad for you. There is much deeper meaning to a person than an appearance and you will come to realize this. The people who do not realize this, well stay away from those people. They are not good influences in your life. You will be fine mate. Hang in there. I am 6 years in and still hopeful that one day I will get back to 100%, but if not, I am not going to beat myself up about it. It is what it is. Girl i felt the way you feel right now. I am at 98% recovery and still recovering. Please do not be sad u can beat this \u2764 I know exactly how u feel and u can message me at ANY time you want about absolutely anything, just please do not be sad there is hope for u trust me \u2764\u2764\u2764 It is not your fault.  You are not weak.  You are not being too sensitive.  \n\nThis is a terrible illness that can be a huge blow, and what causes the nerve to inflame is not even certain in medical fields.  There is no one group or vulnerability it attacks.  It happens to all ages, genders, races and such a huge variety of health/fitness levels.\n\nYou are not being selfish to take care of yourself right now.  That is the best thing you can do.  You are worth it, and it really is the best treatment for Bells.  Look up self exercises, eat well, get sleep.  Pamper yourself as best you can.  I am sorry you are going through it, and I hope you have a good recovery. You poor thing! Sending you so much love. Know that: You are not weak. You are not being too sensitive. You are not being dramatic. You are allowed to feel every single emotion that you feel. \n\nIt sounds like there is a lot weighing on your heart and mind. It sucks that your family are not very supportive and that your closest friends are going through a lot. From my own experience, the first few days were an emotional shit-show. Give yourself time to process. Know that while these words might ring hollow for a while: you will get through this. It will not be like this forever. \n\nAlthough your closest are going through a lot, if the tables were turned: would you want your friend to tell you they were going through this? \n\nSending you lots of love! Also, I am not sure if this will help but when I went through my experience, I wrote a personal guide for recovering! You got this. \n\n ( Have you been tested for lyme I have had BP my whole life, or just about it. Since I was 18 months. I have never had a normal smile, I get embarrassed to eat around people, and so on. The before smile people show when they do a before and after of their recovery is mine. Sometimes it sucks knowing I have a smile that other people dread to have, that my normal is a lot of people\u2019s worse nightmare. That people cry when they get a face like mine.\n\nBut let me tell you something. This is not your fault. You are not weak. You are valid in your feelings. You are not being selfish by taking care of yourself, and that you are not being overly dramatic. You are allowed to cry, you are allowed to feel bad.\n\nAnd guess what? People will find you beautiful, or handsome, or generally good looking even with the effects on your face. I am so insecure about my smile, given how abnormal it is, but my boyfriend thinks it is beautiful and unique. You are allowed to be insecure about what is happened to you, but you are not any less wonderful because of it.\n\nMore importantly, it sounds like you are dealing with a lot on top of BP. If you can, it might be good to talk to a therapist or mental health professional. I hope you can get to a place where you can feel, even a little bit, better. And I hope you can have a speedy recovery.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, the book Wonder helped me feel confident as a kid. Try giving it a read! I got it the first time nearly 20 years ago now - was permanent in the paralysis of one side (with some remapping of nerves so can close eye etc, more noticeable when drinking. Genuinely most people do not even notice and was great at the single eyebrow raise\n\nHave it the other side now, taste back already 4 days or so later, movement not yet but not drooling everywhere so not so bad :)", "Should we worry? Vaccine &amp; past (or current) BP First post ever here.  \n\nThis exact time last year I came down with Bell's Palsy. It was horrible and depressing.  My eyesight was shit, and I could not look at myself in the mirror without crying. Being made to laugh by accident was the absolute worst. Luckily mine only lasted a few months and I was back to normal. \n\nAs I sit here with my eye twitching uncontrollably,  I worry...oh no....is this going to turn into bells palsy again? Will it come back one day?\n\nBut then I start to worry about the vaccine. Have any studies been done on people who have had BP in the past? Are we more susceptible to get it if we get the vaccine? \n \nDisclaimer: I WANT to be vaccinated.  I do NOT want BP to come back. I had the same concern and talked about this with my friends that are better-versed in physiology than me (they have animal science PhDs and regularly teach biosci to undergrads, and have been reading about the vaccines. I trust them.) They totally helped assuage my fears by pointing out that the rate of BP in the vaccine test group was extremely low, and actually was comparable to the BP in the normal population, and thus is very unlikely to have any relationship to the vaccine. Medical trials HAVE to report anything that could potentially be a side effect , which is why we know about those BP cases, but the odds it is actually a side effect are incredibly low. \nNow, here is the thing. I completely get where you are coming from. I developed BP 10 years ago and only recovered ~30% muscle control. I hate it and it still sometimes makes me very depressed. I cannot fathom getting it again. We know that BP is caused by inflammation of the 7th cranial nerve, but not what triggers that inflammation. But, stress (physical and emotional) can cause inflammation in the body. So when I get vaccinated (because I believe it is important and honestly my face is less important than people\u2019s lives), I am going to do whatever I can to reduce the stress load on my body. I will take a few days off work, rest, drink fluids, take B12, etcetera. \nI hope that helps ease your worries. Very good answer. I agree that the percentage of BP in the trials is comparable to the percentage of getting it in the first place,  so that does help to ease my concerns. I do believe I got BP because of my high stress levels.  I now do what I can to manage them. Oh I am glad, and so glad that you recovered. Also sorry for that wall of text. I have never posted something long and I guess I have to learn to format. Oh do not apologize!  I loved the response, it was very helpful and reassuring. My reply should have been longer.\n\nI wish I would have known about this sub reddit (or how to use reddit) last year, it would have been so helpful. I am happy I am here now though.  I hope I can offer some advice and encouragement to those newly diagnosed.  I have a sneaking suspicion mine might come back...this twitching eye is driving my absolutely nuts. Also I am not sure I fully recovered. My eyes do not blink simultaneously when I am tired.  I can feel how noticeable it is. Thankfully it only happens when I am tired.  Also, when I smile, one of my eyes is much smaller than the other, but I am okay with that. (I am going to apologize in advance: I tend to write essays.)\n\nMy wife's a nurse, I have had BP, we both got the vaccine this week. We both did a lot of research beforehand. Our social circle is all doctors and nurses, so this has been a topic of conversation for some time now. We have read everything we can find in the literature, and the good news - it *is* good news - is that there is no data: BP recurrence does not make a statistical blip in *any* cohort other than \"people who have had BP\", where recurrence remains reassuringly low. But worrying about whether or not you will be one of the people who have recurrent BP cannot help, as stress is one of the factors that contribute to recurrence.\n\nWhich is relevant to the misinformation making the rounds on social media. Of the tens of thousands of volunteers testing the vaccine, 7 have had BP. It is a medical trial, every single thing that happens to volunteers must be reported, but there has never been evidence of a **causal** relationship between *any* vaccination and BP, and there has not been any *yet* with this vaccine. (Full disclosure, it *could* yet happen. But the data so far implies that it will not.) The only statistical significance the current number has is that it is a little *low*: every year there are ~1-4 cases of BP in *every* population of 10,000 people (and that *includes* recurrent cases, which affect one out every ~150,000 people). But with 75M+ COVID-19 cases worldwide this year, and over 1.5 million COVID-19-related deaths, it is almost statistically unavoidable that some people who would have had BP did not have it because COVID-19 got them first. Or they were not diagnosed with BP because it was a minor problem compared to having the virus. Or because medical staff and resources have been heavily strained all year.\n\nIf nothing else I write here means anything - or if you just do not want to read the rest of this tediously loquacious essay - pay attention to *that* statistic. The world's current population is ~7.5 billion, and this year there have been ~75 million COVID-19 cases. The similarity between those numbers makes the ratio simple to calculate: 75 million is 1% of 7.5 billion: 1 out of every 100 people on the *planet* has caught this virus *this year*. One out of every 150,000 people on the planet will have BP more than once *in their lives*. Put simply - *very* simply, glossing over a lot of variables - with the data that is available today, right now you are something like 1,500 times more likely to catch COVID-19 in the next year than you are to ever have a second bout of BP *in your entire lifetime*. Taking the vaccine was the simplest call to make, in light of those numbers.\n\nBP is a diagnosis of exclusion - you are only diagnosed with BP after they have excluded all of the other known possibilities, and at any given time in the past that list of known possibilities was smaller than it is now - so even when you are diagnosed with BP, the possible causes are not completely known. *Something* caused inflammation in the facial nerve, and they ruled out stroke, tumor, shingles, Lyme disease, and sarcoidosis. Must be BP.\n\nBut stick around here long enough and you see trends: stress seems to be a significant contributor. Illness. Shingles/'cold sores'/herpes zoster - which likes spreading along nerves in the region of cranial nerve VII and can *also* be triggered by stress - can be a contributor. And a new bout of shingles/cold sores/herpes zoster is often preceded by sensations in whatever nerve is affected, usually manifesting as a twitch in the eye or lip or a scraped/burned feeling on the cheek, eyelid, or brow.\n\nThis has been a stressful year, and the virus is not just going to disappear, so there is more stress to come. And stress - whether as a primary contributing factor, or as a reaction to some *other* contributing factor - can only hurt your chances. There is no reason to stress over the vaccine, and plenty of reasons to be conscientiously removing stress... *especially* if you feel like the twitching in your eye is meaningful. I get the eye-twitching thing every 18 months or so. I always treat it like a messenger, telling me to *reduce the factors that can contribute to nerve inflammation*: eat right, take your vitamins, get enough fluids and electrolytes, get enough sleep. Take warm baths. Get a massage, or acupuncture, or meditate or pray, whatever works for you. And do not feed the disease by stressing over it. Worrying about potential BP recurrence is like flicking lit matches into dark corners because you are worried there might be something flammable over there.\n\nTake care of yourself. Not idle words: make a point of taking care of yourself. \n\nAnd get the vaccine. Among the type of people who read medical journals, nobody is worried about the vaccine triggering BP. It is the uninformed yahoos on social media who have come to their conclusion despite the complete lack of supporting data who are making a big deal out of this, and they are doing more harm than good. I think it is common for it to be a little worse when tired. It must be stressful living in fear of recurrence too. \n\nI am also so glad to have found this sub. I rarely open up to my friends and family about how BP affects me because they do not seem to know how to respond. What you said about laughing is so true; you are instantly reminded about your lopsided mouth. It is hard to ever experience a moment of untainted glee. \n\nI will probably post a rant later, just because I know people here will get it, and maybe I can connect with others whose BP became permanent. I can attest to this also. Got mine in 2015 when I was doing 100hr weeks for months straight in vfx. I switched gears with emphasis on reducing workload and stress. I never do more than 60hrs now and the only thing that triggers it is prolonged lack of sleep from working and my girlfriend. She is the number cause of any tightness/twitching. Just want to update.  I am fully vaccinated.  No bells palsy or feel there is a threat of a re-ocurrance", "Discord Server? Thought we could try this again.. \n\nI made a Discord for Facial Paralysis! Here is the link: \n\nIts a work in progress so please be nice!", "Bell\u2019s palsy and sickness So I have had bp about a month now and am starting to see some movement but recently I have caught either a cold or flu not sure which one it is (yes sucks!) and just wanted to know if this will slow down or impact my progress at all?", "Just got diagnosed yesterday TBH I am just relieved it was not the stroke that I was afraid it was, I am high risk for those.

Ho hum, this is my life now I suppose. \u201cThis is life now\u201d\n\nFeels that way now because it is new.  It goes away.  It may come back, for most of the time it goes away.  Keep pushing.  It sucks now, but it gets easier. Thanks for the encouragement. I am really not too down about it but it strange to have this condition that I had not heard of 48 hours ago. But everything is on track, I am getting steroids, anti-virals and eye drops and I am starting physio on Thursday so everything that can be done is being done.\n\nMaybe I am being a little sorry for myself because I cannot call around to friends and family to milk them for sympathy right now but on the plus side masks mean I  am not self conscious about the droop in public. Did you test positive for covid? I work at a doctors office and the nurse thinks I should be tested bc she thinks there is some correlation. My symptoms started last Monday. Started on meds on Wednesday. The first few days I felt very sorry for myself. But now it is just a nuisance. I have been off work since the day I was diagnosed (bc we were closed) but go back tomorrow. I am sure I will be feeling very self conscious then. Even if you are a guy, I think you will like this video of a YouTuber when she first got Bell's Palsy. She is fine now.\n\n(\n\nLaughter is good medicine. I have not been tested for it but I have zero symptoms. Sorry if I gave that impression. \n\nAgain pulling a slim glimmer of positivity from a shitty situation is my entire industry is shut down until at least mid August so i do not have to worry about that at least.\n\n Hopefully being medical staff your colleagues will be supportive without over reacting and requiring endless explanations. I have no symptoms either. I do not see why she wants me to be tested. \nThat is great for you! ESP bc everything I read says rest rest rest! Easier said than done when you feel ok! And when you have to work. \nNot many of them care, they are all snobby bitches \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f That was hilarious. I am a guy but in fairness I did wear a lot of makeup during my teen goth phase. I love her. It is so hard to say Bell's Palsy, wtf. \n\nHope that made you half smile for a bit. Welcome to the community. Just let it pass. Take the meds. Get a lot of rest if you can. Took me 10 days to get through it. I was lucky.", "I believe I have Bell\u2019s Palsy. How severe are my symptoms? i am 19. i believe i must have struck a nerve from a nose trimmer or something because in the one nostril i used the trimmer on, i went from pain in my nostril, to not being able to flare my left nostril, to not being able to smile or wink. it is not total paralysis and my face is not droopy, i just cannot control the muscles on the left side of my face. i can twitch them just a little bit. Sounds like early signs of Bell's Palsy. You should get it checked out. I agree, book an appointment with your GP (doctor). Faster you act, the quicker recovery you will make. Yep, I recovered within 3 weeks because I got it checked ASAP (I thought I was having a stroke). Go you! I have just been diagnosed (yesterday) was scary as hell cause like yourself, assumed I could be having a stroke. Thankfully all clear on that front and I have just started my steroid treatment. Sorry to hear that. It is going to be a tough time with BP. It is all up to time and patience. Are you still able to blink? Sort of, it is not very responsive, only half my eye covers when I blink. Going To pick up some eye drops a little later on. Had to wear tape over my eye last night to sleep. Yeah the eye and mouth unresponsiveness were the most frustrating experience I had. You should get some proper eye patches. Ugh yeah! So frustrating, usually have quite an expressive face but now it is so restrictive. Ordered some eyepatches on amazon (herd the domed ones are not too good so opted against those) so we will see how we will these ones work when they turn up. Glad to hear that. I hope you have a speedy recovery my friend. The quicker you get medical attention and lesser the impact.    Hoping favorable results. i got my diagnosis and my medicine. is it mild because i can blink almost freely? Yeah, that sounds like my experience I was able to blink the entire time. However, it is possible that yours can get worse. Nevertheless, it is good that you are taking the medicine.", "Build My Bod: Bell\u2019s Palsy and Facial Retraining  ", "Prescription advice/pain Hello,   \n\n\nI was diagnosed with Bells Palsy on Feb 13th,  I had gone to the clinic with pain behind my ear and a stiff neck for 2 days and the doctor had me do a test to blow out my cheeks, at that time that was the only sign of paralysis as there was just slight weakness on my left side where the air escaped my mouth. The doctor suggested bells palsy and started me on Prednisone 50mg/ day for 7 days (initially) and 3x 500mg/day Vacyclovir. Over the next 48+ hours I lost most of the movement in my face, eye wont close on its own no wrinkles on forehead, slurred speech, difficulty eating etc. I have finished the Vacyclovir and am on a second 7 day round of 50mg/day Prednisone. Im curious what other peoples drug regiments were? and if anyone has done a similar 14 days on Prednisone without any tapering off? the doctor seems to think it is ok, but I am a little hesitant.  \n\n\nOne other aspect for me that seems to have started around the one week mark is alot more pain. Headaches, sore sensitive teeth that comes and goes and mainly a stiff or almost tight jaw on the affected side. It is starting to be sore to the touch down the jaw line and behind the ear and now its a bit sore into the cheek. I was wondering if anyone has any similar experience? My thoughts are that it might be from muscle spasm? Would be nice to know if anyone has dealt with similar pain experience and what helped them  \n\n\nThanks for any advice!  \n\n\nMarc I was diagnosed february 11th just two days before you and we are also having the same symptoms. i just finished prednisone february 21st and have pain pretty much on the whole side where theres no movement. \nmy speech is less slurred but i still cant say b' s and p's well. Im in the same boat as you wondering what to do next if i should see my doctor or start acupuncture or wait it out some more. Cant imagine getting massages with this pain either I came down with BP on 22 January and went to see a DR right away. I was given prednisone and Vaciclovir for a week. After a week I developed the exact same pain you are describing and lasted for another week. I have improved a lot and I am about 75% recovered. I am retired so staying home resting is what I think helped me. I also tried massage and acupuncture. Hang in there, rest rest rest and avoid stress Gabapentin ... works wonders for the pain.\n\nIts the only thing that helped me when nothing else would. I am seeing a specialist on Monday. I will ask about it, thank you for the suggestion :) Thanks for sharing your experience, reassuring to hear other people having similar symptoms. Best of luck with the rest of your recovery! Interesting. Hopefully some improvement for both of us soon. Since I have started my second week of prednisone I have started to have bad side effects from it, racing heart (especially in the time after taking the dose) greasy face, mood swings, Higher blood pressure then normal. Restlessness and a feeling of almost vibrating.  Today was the 10th day and I think I am going to start taking a quarter off each pill for my last 4 days. Seems like 2 full weeks at 50mg is more then most have been prescribed, and now that It is affecting me poorly I would like to stop. Thanks, best of luck to you as well", "Any hope for progress after it is stalled? More info in comments....  I got bell's palsy almost three years ago. I had known other people that got it. Mine felt pretty severe. I had a migraine for 2.5 weeks at the beginning and it took 6 months before I finally felt like I did not have to explain to people that I had not had a stroke. I feel like I did everything. At the beginning I did antibiotics (for possible strep), antivirals, and steroids, along with muscle relaxers after a few weeks because of the headache. Then I did a round of the Whole 30 to help \"cleanse\" my system and get my body back on track. Then I did several rounds of acupuncture. I did massage and Reiki healing. I have been taking methylated B vitamins. For a while I tried facial exercises and massage. I went to a chiropractor for several months and he used this machine to stimulate my nerves. And I never fully recovered. My smile is still crooked and I have a lot less control over one eye when I am yawning or eating, weird stuff like that. But now I have this weird \"cleft\" in my chin and I feel like it is getting worse. I am sure it is because my healthy side is compensating for my Palsy side. And I know it is just vanity. Is there anything I can do? I probably need to go back to daily facial exercises, but I am a mom, a business owner and I am in grad school and I just do not feel like I have time. Plus I do not want to invest a ton of time if it will not work. Anyone else had any success with something specific?", "Tips to make it more bearable?

Went to the Er last week when I woke up in the middle of the night with loss of hearing and numbness on my left side.  They did all the tests, blood work and CT to make sure it wasnt a stroke.  The conclusion was bells... I donr have any droopiness or anything. They gave me antivirals and steriods. I was prescribed antivirals 5x a day for 7 days.  I took one pill and my hearing came back and the numbness decreaess significantly but was still numb. I took the second antiviral before bed and then woke up and my skin felt so sensitive to touch, like thrones all over. That lasted all day... I decided to stop the med since my hearing came back. Its been about 4 days now and all is back to normal. I still habe an appt set for a neurologist but I couldnt get in until next month. Has anyone experienced something that came and went, could it possibly come back later? The ER doctor was certain it was bells, even without the droopiness.

No, it is not ideal on any front, and no one can really tell us whether we will make a full recovery or when. But our bodies heal best when we are not stressed and give ourselves time to rest.

I would love it if I did, but I am okay if I do not. How long has it been, and how did your doctor assess level of nerve damage?

I took prescribed medication. The pain is getting worse. It affected my left side of my face, this time, This is the 2nd time I have had this. The first time my right side. The pain was not bad. This time it hurts, it radiates just below my ear down my neck and to my left eye and top of my head. And makes me dizzy, on a scale of 1-10  I put it at 8. I suspect it is time to go back in to my doctor? Anyone else have pain last awhile  with bell's palsy?\n I am no wimp when it comes to pain. I battle pancreatitis twice a year and diagnosed colorectal cancer stage 3 in 2016. (Just had a CT scan 3 days ago and follow up with doctor. All clear! Yeah) I am so sorry! I had pretty bad pain as well but it was only for like 2-2 1/2 weeks. Getting back to the doc is probably a good bet. I did facial massage everyday which might help. I know I tried almost anything I could think of so I cannot say exactly what worked. I wish you a speedy recovery.  Congrats on beating cancer!\n\nI had a bad pain on the affected side radiating from my ear down to my jaw. It coincided with increased movement in that area. A few weeks later, the pain lessened, and I had full mobility, as if mobility was inversely correlated with the severity of the pain. Another month later and the pain itself was gone.\n\nI would suggest seeing your doctor about it, but it sounds like it is starting to wake up.\n\nI have no clue about the opposite side of your face, however.  Chiming in because I am also wondering about other people's experiences with pain. I was diagosed with Bell's Palsy around the end of February. (Story is in my post history for anyone that is curious, if not just ignore me lol).\n\nI had the excruciating pain like you described for about 3-4ish weeks but during that time it did decrease. My pain tolerance is high, too. This was up there with my unmedicated labor and delivery and ovarian cyst pain. I feel like doctors really dismissed me when I expressed how much pain I was in (while pregnant, so they did not want to give me anything besides paracetamol \ud83d\ude10) Now I have what feels like nerve pain? The affected side of my face feels very tender/bruised if poked. I have recovered about 90%, my eye is a little slow to blink and my mouth is a little weak still. Sorry you are dealing with this, it is really so shitty! :( Pain is normal - I sometimes feel like i was punched in the face a few times the night before.  I am 8 months in (you could not tell that I even have Bell's Palsy by looking at me now though). First doctor treated me like I was drug seeking because only some Bell\u2019s is painful. Pain has decreased but still feel like some guy is smashing my face in. \n\nGabapentin, twice a day a year and a half in. Down from 6 pills a day Listening to music in the key of g helps. A suggestion from a music therapist. Also pain is reduced when I go to healing Bowls, sound meditation, or sound bath. Sounds odd but it really helps. At local yoga studios, salt rooms, cheaper at ashram\n\n\nMeditation also gives me a break. Try any meditation app. I use all the free stuff. \n\n( \n\n\n", "Bell Palsy can go away. I am living proof of that have faith and pray. All will be oh Kay trust me. I had Bells palsy when I was 13 years old. I approached my parents they did not believe me they thought I was being funny. They actually made fun of me, two day later until my sister said I was being serious. Because when I would brush my teeth the water would come out of my mouth. When I would talk only half my face would move. On top of that I had a stye on the right side of my face. The side where I had Bell\u2019s palsy.They finally took me to the doctor he confirmed I had bell palsy. I had to wear a pirate patch for my stye. It was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at the time . I legit looked like Quasimodo. I had it for six months, I was embarrassed to speak to people. The whole church prayed for me somehow it went away thankfully. It is not completely gone. I can only move one side of my eyebrows so I am like the rock. Having had Bell\u2019s palsy made me extremely humble and grateful. I have now grown to be a beautiful woman. But I do not forget what has happened to me. I see the beauty in everyone. If you still have those palsy I just want to let you know you are beautiful. Do not let that determine who you are.", "Synkinesis 9 months Later? Hey BP Gang,\n\nI have been lurking on this group since my initial onset in March 2019 but never posted until now.\n\nMy recovery felt slow in the beginning and it took 3-4 months to make good progress. I got to about 95% back (everything but a somewhat weak upper lip) and I honestly thought I was in the clear as of this Fall. Neurologist thought so too.\n\nThen, all of a sudden, in early December I wake up and my neck and chin twitch when I blink my eye. I also am sending heightened nerve activity and getting some slight eye twitching when chewing, etc. Feels like I am taking a step backward.\n\nI am having a difficult time finding more info on this and my Neurologists are again brushing it off and said if it is not significantly impacting my quality of life I should not seek treatment.\n\nHas anybody else experienced this type of relapse after a full-ish recovery? It is normal, or should I suspect a more sinister cause? I am assuming my BP getting mostly better initially would be a good sign but now I am not so sure! Thanks for your support! I still get twitches and mine was 2 years ago. It is the only long term effects I have had. Other than that recovery was 100%. Not sure what to make of it, I would heard during the recovery period twitching was a good thing as it means the nerves are recovering. No idea about later though Interesting. Thanks for sharing. Yeah mine is really coordinated with the blinking every time and not a \"twitch\" per se so I think I am in full blown synkinesis mode. Fun stuff. Just hoping it does not get worse... I get twitches and also when I purse my lips my right eye closes. It is been almost a year and I would say I have about 95% recovery. I am getting Botox injections for my twitching for relief. Thanks for your story! Sounds like a similar situation. I should look into Botox and see if that helps in the long run. I have my second treatment in a couple of weeks, I has helped me so far. Interesting. If you remember and do not mind, can you let me know how it is helping? I have heard some stories of 2-3 Botox treatments actually causing long term synkinesis recovery. Sure! I will try and remember to keep you updated :) My synkinesis started not long after I got more movement back, so around the same time period as you, 6-9 months. That was almost 21 years ago now... I still have synkinesis. I think Botox will help calm it down a bit. I also visited a clinic in The Netherlands and the facial massage/exercises/visualization they recommend are supposed to help bring your facial movements back into alignment. But you have to be really consistent with it to see results and that is been difficult for me Thanks for this. Sorry to hear your synkinesis has not improved. I am curious - has your synkinesis come in waves, or improved/declined over the years or is it pretty much the same as when it started? Just worried mine will get worse since it is pretty minor right now. I have had a bunch of weird things since it. But one thing that helped was remembering to take screen breaks, and wearing the eye patches still at night, i discovered while during the day i can remember to keep my eye blinking etc, but at night i guess the old eye just likes to pop open or partially open. That helped with some of the involuntary twitching, and using one of those ice rollers on the nerve helps on the really bad days when it feels like that entire side of my face is throbbing. Interesting. Thanks for sharing. I do think I need to try more ice on the impacted side. I also get some throbbing sensations but it is never painful... Just kind of \"overactive\". To be honest it is difficult to tell. I think the visualization exercises helped. My smile is more symmetrical than before in pictures because I now make a bit more relaxed expressions, so the unaffected side is not trying to compensate as much and the affected side is not working so hard either. It came with practice though, not something that would have naturally occurred. Basically those neural pathways are set as soon as your movement starts to come back, and you have to do a lot of visualization and connection with your facial movements to get it closer to normal. \n\nMy synkinesis is definitely worse when I am tired, been drinking, etc., but in general it is maybe a little bit better.", "Vaccine induced Bell\u2019s palsy? I have read several stories on here about folks developing Bell\u2019s palsy post-vaccine. I am not anti-vax at all, but I have had BP twice and fear I will get it a third time once I am vaccinated so I have been waiting to get it to learn more about the correlations. My new job just told everyone yesterday that they are requiring all employees to get it and I do not know how to get around it without seeming super problematic but I genuinely am not comfortable getting yet, especially now that I feel *forced* to. Be careful what you post here. The mods are cornballs and if you say anything that is anti-VAX they will mute you. Me personally I am not taking the vaccine because I do not want Bell\u2019s palsy again because the first time practically ruined my life Oh shoot I did not realize that was a thing. Thanks. Yeah the second time had a life ruining affect on me as well so I really do not want it until there is more information about it. I guess I can write to HR and explain my situation and hope they do not fire me! I had it twice, as well.  Last time was \\~2003.  I was pretty concerned about the BP issue with the vaccine, but then also read that the BP occurrences were inline with normal probability.  I started the 2-shot Pfizer 5 weeks ago and am now \"fully vaccinated\".  No issues.  I did keep some prednisone around, just in case.  Hope this helps - I know how much anxiety the prospect of a 3rd time around can create. I will start off and say that I (30M) had COVID in December and had the typical loss of taste/smell, body aches, headache. I never really had any respiratory issues. \n\nTo add to the craziness my first experience with Bell\u2019s was in March and although it was mild and I have recovered, I too was worried and hesitant to get the vaccine. \n\nWhat really changed my mind to get the vaccine (just got my second dose yesterday) were the neurological effects we still do not know COVID may contribute to. Yes, Bell\u2019s is neurological but we have a far better understanding of Bell\u2019s than COVID and I was more willing to deal with Bell\u2019s than other post COVID effects we still do not yet fully understand or know. Just my two cents... Had bell\u2019s prior to getting the vaccine and looked up the actual amount of people who got bells post vaccine and realized that it is such a rare occurrence that it would be more detrimental for me to develop Covid than to get bells again and the rate of infection for Covid was significantly higher to me than the risk of getting bells once more. Finished the series a month off recovering from bells and never got any symptoms related to bells Is there anything documented with what vaccine caused the most cases of BP? Like were the mRNA causing a higher instance rather than the J&amp;J? Good luck talking with HR, no one understands how depressing BP can be until actually faced with it. I started taking B-12, D-3, Zinc and Lysine as well as plenty of water and sleep. I have muted people who post lies about bp being caused by vaccines. There is zero evidence of that and if anyone posts disinformation they will get muted I was hoping to come across some kind of information like that but I have yet to. Just from browsing on here I saw a few posts of people saying it occurred after Pfizer but no actual statistics I can find at the moment. Thank you so much! No kidding, it is been years since I had it last and I still have horrible anxiety about it. I take those as well except for Lysine I will have to add that one in too! There is no evidence BP is a side effect of the vaccine? You should be muted I had never even heard of Bell\u2019s palsy before I got it, which was exactly a month from my second Pfizer shot. I have never even had a cold sore, much less any other kind of herpes that it might be related to, and I have no family history. I do not know what else to think other than it was a side effect of the vaccine. But of course there is no way to prove it. I was diagnosed 22 days ago, and have seen a lot of improvement in the last week, so I am hopeful for a full recovery and hope I never have to go through this again. But hearing the stories of those that have had it multiple times, I am skeptical. I took Phizer. BP never came back. Too much attention on the side effects. Very little side effects and understand your worry. I was worried too. I took the Pfizer vaccine and 6 days later I developed mild form of Bells Palsy. No visible droop but I cannot fully shut my left eye. I cannot whistle nor hold water in my mouth. I fucked up by waiting 4 days after I noticed symptoms to get on steroids. Blessed that it is not visible. I believe my body had a inflammatory response from the vaccine. I have also been very concerned about the possibility of vaccine induced BP. When I heard about that small percentage of people being diagnosed with BP after being vaccinated, my heart sunk.\n\nFor background, I have had BP twice (2002 and 2012) so, statistically, I am expecting it again next year, 2022. I had not considered the possibility of vaccine induced BP until recently.\n\nHas anyone else noticed a correlation between their diagnosis and being vaccinated? Bc when I think about it, I got vaccinated in those years (2002 and 2012) for school and that turned everything I thought I knew about Bell's on its head. I had it in 2012 as well, and I was pretty young the first time but I think it was like 2003-04. I just got my first dose of Pfizer yesterday. So far so good, I will update once I get my second one. Hey, did you get both your doses? \nI have gotten BP before and the thought of having it again stresses me out. Would really appreciate your response! Hi there-got both doses and no symptoms of BP whatsoever! Good luck That is great! thank you so much for responding.", "Electrical Therapy Hi guys,  \n\n\nI have had bells palsy for about 7 months now, and I am curious what people's thoughts are on electrical therapy? I have heard good and bad things about it...\n\n  \nI would have no problem going to do it if it did not cause any change (though that would be depressing). But it would suck to go through all the time to be doing it, only to have it make things worse and cause a lot of uncontrolled movement. I did it. I have massive regrets. After talking to my neurologist, it was agreed that it did more harm than good for me. It kept the nerve aggravated, thus in turn giving me synkinesis. I went 3 days a week for about 4 months for this. Before every session I had to do facial exercise with my PT. \n\nBuyer beware. Your experience may be very different, but that is what I experienced. I have had it for over 18 months now and have made minimal progress, however the progress I have made has been because of electro therapy and something called a Galvanized stimulator. I completely agree with this statement. I bought a TENs unit online and tried it myself.  All it did was hurt.  \nPerhaps a professional treatment would achieve better results? But I echo all the cautions in this thread.  Synkinesis sucks, and there just is not enough science behind BP treatments to know what is safe and what is not. I have been doing it at home 5 days a week for 2 weeks now - I have not noticed any changes - I doubt it is helpful", "Three weeks into Bell's and now I have vertigo. Is this common?

I could not brush my teeth right or make a straight smile. Not to mention I could blink properly.. went to the ER immediately and was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy. Had an MRI done to check any other damage but none thankfully. Got prescribed steriods and antivirals. Within 2 weeks I started feeling a lot better and able to move my face more freely. Now im able to blink properly, move my eyebrow. Even sort of bring my lips together. Id say im about 90% recovered with just rest and meds. Did exercises like 2 days after being diagnosed. Other than that I have been struggling like most of you guys. Scared and worried but hopefully my story makes you optimistic about the future. Good for you that you almost recovered after 2 weeks.  \nYou have been very lucky.\nThere are people here who suffer from it for 3 months, 6 months, even years and have only recovered 60%.  \nBe aware of that. Yes I will, I promised myself that if I made it out of this id live my life to the fullest. Im 21 years old but ive been living my life sheltered and too scared of going forward. When I got diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, it really dropped me that if it would have been something worse I would not have amounted to nothing. Or that my life was over because of the low self esteem of having people look at me different because of it. That Is why even though this was short lived I will be forever grateful and strive for greater things. Who knows maybe ill research this myself after I because a scientist lol.

I lost them both again in December 2019, two months after and after they came back in November I was wondering if it was normal, or if perhaps I caught Covid 19 and did not know it?I know losing both of those senses are symptoms of covid. I am planning on getting a test to see if I have already had covid, but wanted to known anyone else lost those two senses twice during BP. When I lost my sense of taste, it was like my mouth was literally divided into two, split in the middle. Was it the same for you? I assume Covid would be a full loss of taste, and not such a clear divide between left and right mouthpart. I lost 100% of movement in half my face, but never had any loss of taste or smell. I lost sense of smell, taste and hearing was also affected. My covid-19 test...negative. I fully lost my sense of taste and smell. I was in a restaurant and was craving a certain meal. I walked in and found it funny I could not smell any of the foods, but did not think anything of it at the time since I was still recovering from Bell's. I ordered my food and it had absolutely no taste. I just assumed it was because my Bell's was acting up again. I never ran a fever; just lost taste and smell.", "Pregnancy Should I take the meds? I am 38 weeks pregnant and I got my first symptom yesterday. I know if I treat it NOW I will have a better chance at a speedy and full recovery but I am scared for my baby. I would ask a doctor Ask your ob! They told me to do it but I know even doctors often disagree on simple treatments... however As my palsy is getting worse I will just take the meds I cannot risk having this for life. It would probably cause more emotional damage to have a mom who cannot smile :( I cant reply directly to comments and I dont know why but please do not get yourself in the negative loop that this is life long. Its not for a majority of the people who get diagnosed and even then most of the time it goes away without treatment. I got it when I was 28 weeks. TAKE THE MEDS! How are you now? That was may 2019. I had zero recovery until my baby was over a month old. I have been slowly recovering since then. I am at about 85% and honestly do not expect to get too much better. My forehead on that side is completely dead, so I had a one sided brow lift and that helped a lot. For people who did not know me before, I look slightly off especially when I talk and smile. People who did know me before can see my face has changed pretty noticeably.\n\nMy one suggestion is to let people take photos of you during delivery and in the early days. I regret not having many pictures of me because I was ashamed of my face. Have them take the pictures from your good side and get creative with profile pictures, but please, get the pictures. Did you take prednisone when you first got symptoms? Also did you do facial exercises? Yes, I took meds and yes I went to physical therapy. Ask your OB but I got it at 19 weeks pregnant and took the meds (prednisone and valacyclovir) and I did make a full recovery. They would not give me prednisone because I had gestational diabetes but I delivered my babe early about 5 days after I was diagnosed.  It is been 2 weeks post delivery and so almost 3 weeks post diagnosis/onset and I would say I am about 85% recovered.  I took the anti virals but not prednisone.  I also use the jade roller nightly on that side of my face and started acupuncture this week.", "My story and questions about non-facial symptoms persisting I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy in February 2020. It all started when I noticed I could not taste food or brush my teeth well one morning before work, and my right eye was tearing up constantly. I do not have a doctor so I went to an urgent care and was diagnosed there, the same day the issues started. I was prescribed Prednisone and took it for 10 days as seem to be the typical course of action. Additionally I received acupuncture from a relative who also happens to be DPT. I was able to regain the use of my facial muscles after about 3 or 4 weeks. The only facial issue I have currently is that I have a slight numbness at the top tip of my lip. I had an appointment with a neurologist but never went because of the lockdown soon after.\n\nSo I guess these questions might be better answered by a medical professional but I was just curious if the symptoms I felt and continue to feel are \"typical.\"\n\nPrior to the facial paralysis I did not have any other symptoms, did not catch a cold or get any sort of vaccines in the weeks before. About 2 or 3 days in I started getting headaches at the back of my head on the right side. They would come and go but were pretty painful (like 8 out of 10) when they did come but only last a few minutes.  The worst headache I ever felt was about 5 weeks after the initial symptoms, and occurred while having sex. It was a 10/10 headache I was actually afraid I was going to have a stroke or something, and honestly I think I am a bit traumatized by it. The headaches have continued ever since but are much more mild but now occur on both left and right sides of my head.  I have read that headaches are a BP symptom and I have read that symptoms can last for months or years but is that referring to the facial symptoms or all the other symptoms as well? \n\nSome other weird stuff I have been experiencing I am not sure if they fit under the BP list of symptoms but started since being diagnosed: One weird thing is an inability to focus.  My attention span was not ever great but I think it is gotten worse since the BP symptoms started. I also occasionally get sinus headaches as well but they are less frequent and not very painful. I always have this feeling that I am not fully \"healthy.\" Like I feel something is off with my body but I cannot put it into words, like I can move my face and everything but everything feels \"off\" and I think even my fine motor skills occasionally feel \"off\" as well. Do people in recovery or post recovery have similar feelings as well? I am still struggling with BP recovery after being diagnosed in March 2020 after my face almost fullu healed by June or so and then relapsed a bit. But my relapses have been fully physical with feelings that my nerve is still working on things. Cannot say I have dealt with a perceptible mental impact at all, but I guess everyone is different.\n\nI would recommend consulting with a neurologist if this continues. BP is misdiagnosed a lot and you do not want something to be missed if it is something else. Not to scare you, just my 2 cents.", "Can Bells Palsy be mild? About a month ago I woke up with slight numbness on the right side of my mouth, tongue, and face. It is very slight. The only way I can explain it is that half my face feels swollen, but it is not. I can still smile, but it feels slightly harder to smile on my right side. There is no pain. It is just half my face feels uncomfortable. \n\nIt lasted a week before I noticed more drooling on that side and went to the ER because I was worried about it being a stroke maybe. They did a CT and nothing dangerous came up. No tumor or stroke. So the ER doc recommended I go to a neurologist. The neurologist said to get an MRI scheduled. So I will be having that in a couple weeks. \n\nI am wondering if it could be Bells Palsy? I do not have any facial drooping, but there is numbness and weakness on my right side. Could it be a really mild form? I am hoping the MRI will give me some answers but waiting 2 weeks is making me crazy. I want to know what is happening. Maybe someone here can offer some advice. I went from slight taste loss to full facial paralysis overnight.i know the dr said \"I have it good\" so id assume there would be less. I wish you luck either way. Sorry I cant be more help I got my Bells palsy from a stroke. I am so glad you did not have a stroke. Definitely taking the right steps. I suggest for now doing some recommended facial massages for Bell\u2019s palsy in the meantime??? YouTube had some great videos. Good luck and I hope the source of this is found soon! Ginger is great for that also. 100% it can be mild. It is totally on a spectrum. \n\nIt is also very possible that within the next 2 weeks, your going to be at 0% ability to move your right side. \n\nGoing to a neurologist is the right thing to do, and after that it is basically all speculation and guesswork, from doctors, as well as people who have had it. \n\nThat being said, I have had it 3 times, and I think the best thing to do is to just keep trying to move your face. I know, it freaking sucks, and it is super demoralizing after 6 months, having no improvement even while continuing to try to move your face everyday. I hope for your sake, it stays mild. Goodluck in your recovery, it will get better eventually. Thank you for your advice!!", "It seems I need an eyepatch. Aaarggh. My eye is burning despite regular application of drops and cream at night. It was really notable upon waking this morning. I think I will likely need it during the day while working as well. I am pretty much stuck at staring at a computer screen most of the time, so the strain, pain and dryness is pretty bad.\n\nAre the basic patched one finds at the pharmacy (chemist for UK types) sufficient? Do the have enough pressure to hold the lid shut or will I need to tape as well?\n\nTIA Glass/plastic eye bubbles may be a better choice. No pressure, you can see and keeps ur eye moist. When I was at home I just sticked some stretch film on my forhead-cheek bone. It was cheap but very efficient. That is pretty smart. I just got back from the pharmacy and I am experimenting. The patch covers the eye, but does not hold the lid closed. I am currently trying wadding some tissue behind the patch to create enough pressure to keep it closed. Seems to be working well. I have pretty severe dry eye and a doctor told me at night the best way to lock in that moisture is to put a ring of vaseline around the eyebrow/eye area and then stick some saran wrap onto it. Thatll keep the humidity up in that area when you sleep. My eyes feel very refreshed when i wake up now. I dunno what you could do during the day though. Both eye patches I bought (one from just Walmart and the other from Amazon) were designed to give the eyelid space.  So, while they were helpful to keep dust and wind out, my eye was just staring off into empty blank space. If you need the eyelid to actually be held closed, you will probably have to tape it. Put in eye cream, then put tape on your cheek and lift until the eye is closed. At night, put a strip of tape at the top and bottom of the vertical piece of tape to keep the tape from loosening. You can use your hand and a mirror to see just how much you need to lift your cheek to hold the eye closed. This worked well for me and eliminated the need for anything pushing on my eye lid. It is a bit aggravating at first, but I adjusted fairly quickly. Hey - are you the young lady who made the video on that? I commented on it. I might try that route still. No, that is not me, I am a guy in his 60's. My Bell's started about 2 years ago and I may have seen that video, but I cannot be sure. I did a lot of research and saw a lot of videos with different advice.", "How long did your tongue/mouth numbness or lack of taste last? Just wondering - if you had tongue or mouth numbness or weird sensation or lack of taste (I have on the affected side), how long did it last? Was it the first or last to come or go? Did it come on or linger differently than other symptoms? Did it fluctuate throughout?\n\nJust driving me a little crazy but has only been 9 or 10 days, and sometimes feels more prominent/bothersome than other times. For me, it came on a day or two before the actual palsy popped up.\n\nThanks! Mine lasted about a month for taste. Mouth movement took around 3 months and still acts up from time to time. Good to know. I have I would say a moderate case (definite issues throughout the left side but not near total paralysis), and the left side of my tongue and mouth interior has sort of a numbness (can still feel things though) and my taste definitely feels very muted. Almost has a coated sensation. Yesterday seemed a little better overall so I got hopeful but then today feeling back to bleh. Thinking maybe sleep, time of day, muscle tiredness, etc probably causes the perceived fluctuations Everything tasted metallic for a few weeks for me. It will get better, hang in there! Thanks! For me it lasted about 2 weeks. Been almost 2 years. Still have signs of Bp but it is definitely way better than what it was thank God. Good luck to you on yo ur Bp journey Taste came back for me around 10 days in. About the same time as I saw my first sign of returning movement (although the movement was very slight). Once I noticed that I could taste and feel more in the affected side of my mouth, it took around 1-2 days for the taste and feeling of tongue seeming completely normal again. 5 days from start to finish Hey! I am on day 4 where I am counting Day 0 as first noticing *very* mild symptoms. It is interesting you said about the tongue weirdness started a day or two before, I remember mine very clearly, it was 24hrs before my face started acting up, I had this weird waxy, odd coated sensation on the left side of the inside of my mouth.\n\nI visited my local A&amp;E department and got the steroids on day 1 after having read around and realised that the quicker the better with the meds. Thank the Gods for the NHS!\n\nMy symptoms are still progressing worse, but onset has been quite slow, I would say I am at about 90-95% paralysis now. It is reassuring to read around and see people with similar experiences.\n\nMy mouth at the moment feels like I have liberally coated the inside of it in ( and there is a metallic zing taste to everything that runs over that side of my tongue. Hey,\nIf it makes you feel better, I would now say I am fully recovered from my BP. A coated sensation is exactly how I described that mouth-feel too at first!\nHoping you recover quickly! It feels like it will last forever, but most likely you will get better sooner rather than later :) Thank you! That does make me feel better :)\n\nThe coated mouth feeling I noticed after I ate something new on Friday lunchtime, it actually annoyed me so much I tried to scrub it off off the inside of my mouth with my toothbrush more than once. \\*facepalm\\* Lol yeah I thought maybe I was having a mild allergic reaction to something I ingested, but nope", "Should I tape my eye shut or let it open under an eye patch during the day? Cannot have it exposed even with gels during the day cuz cannot blink IMO, the patch does nothing but keep light/dust out of the eye.  Unless you tape it shut, you will be staring off into black space all day, and I found that to be very annoying. Luckily, I work indoors so I just started loading up my eye with drops and \"blinking\" with my finger when I felt I needed to.\n\nOutdoors, I would wear a pair of 3M safety glasses that have a foam gasket around them to keep wind/dust out. They look ALMOST like sunglasses, so I do not think it was noticeable.  \n\nTaped it shut at night. Im on my second go around. I just put in a lot of gel and find that it keeps my eye moist enough if its not too windy. \n\nFor when it is windy or dusty I found these to be great  I found you adjust quickly to the staring into blank space but it was quite annoying at first. Messed with your depth perception Depends on how well you can close it. if you can then just put eye drops throughout the day. If you cannot then maybe having it shut till you get some strength is better so you can avoid dry eyes. I could not stand taping my eyes shut. I used this gel around the clock, day and night\n\n( And you kept your eye open? Was not everything blurry during the day? You put gel in and kept your eye open during the day? Was everything blurry? Yes it was a bit blurry during the day, and the ointment leaked a bit, but it was a small price to pay for not having to tape my eye shut or put in drops every hour. I would apply the gel once in the morning and was at night. Rarely had to apply more than that After the first 3 or 4 days my eye felt fine on its own. No eye drops for me so far. I just use my finger to help it blink occasionally throughout the day. I tape it shut when I sleep. The only bonus with the patch is that you can focus with your good eye a lot better.   With both eyes open and the bad one dropped/gelled up it makes everything blurry That is why I wear a patch, keep it lined up and able to focus with the good eye I also use the gel during the day and night. Yes, it gets blurry in one eye sometimes but not always. I do not tape my eye shut because the gel works great. \nP.S. I can blink about 90% though. Use silicone earplugs to coat the inside of your eye patch. It will help keep the eye safe, if the eye touches the silicone there is little to no irritation. And the wetness that comes out if your eye from tearing up will not degrade the eye patch. ( My eye is constantly burning and tearing, no matter how much I blink it or use eye drops. It is really frustrating and painful. The only way I can get it to stop is to tape it I have just been diagnosed but dry eyes for last 3days. Not getting any relief it seems. Any tips on taping closed properly? I use non-sterile adhesive eye patches from Walgreens- they stay on perfectly, keep everything out of my eye, and keep it moist.", "One year anniversary, 75% recovered, and 5 days post Pfizer second vaccine shot. No recurring symptoms and no actual vaccine symptoms either. Just another data point in case you were on the fence about getting vaccinated.  Thanks for sharing! I too got the vaccine, Pfizer and am about 8 days post the second dose. I had bells almost three years ago. I had flu like symptoms after the second shot, which was normal and expected, but nothing whatsoever that triggered bells again. I also am only about 90% recovered from bells which I am okay with Great to hear! I received my second dose Saturday and I was worried of another case of Bella Palsy. So far, so good. I have been 100% for a few years now, so hopefully that was the last of it. Excellent. How long did it take to get to 100% after initial diagnosis? I was 99% after three weeks and 100% maybe 5 years later. I had a lot of involuntary facial twitching which I have not noticed since. Excellent and you just had the usual steroids and I forgot the prescribed medication now? No acupuncture, etc. Yep. Prednisone. Thank you for responding. Good luck. You too! Everybody's case is different, I noticed, so do not get discouraged if it takes longer. Awesome news! I had the first shot of the Pfizer vaccination on week 4 of my recovery and it did not slow down my progress or make it any worse. Yeah I got my first dose. Nothing has happened yet. just curious what you mean by 75% recovered - what has not come back yet? Are you still seeing improvements? Asking as someone at Week 7 recovery, with none of the benchmarks (smile/blink etc) back yet, but lots of flickers of nerve activity starting - interested to hear others experiences. I feel like I went to the dentist about 6 hours ago on that side of my face. It is right sometimes and I can feel it is not as loose as the right side.", "Day one ", "Just a few questions! So I have had BP for about a week now. I have finished my week of steroids and antiviral meds. But what is the next step? Do I go back to the doctor for more meds? Or do simply just wait to recover now? Just wait to recover. There is not much else you can take besides some b12 vitamins. I got some physical therapy exercises from my doctor, eventually.  It amounted to just making silly faces in the mirror, essentially.  Just take care of yourself.  Get lots of rest, B vitamins. I would avoid massaging the area too hard. light massage is ok. Rest, rest and more rest. Water, healthy diet and low/ no stress. Get involved with a hobby ypu enjoy or read inspirational literature and poetry.  I delved deeper into my spiritual life and renewed my faith. Praying for you.  Be patient with the situation.  I know, easier said than done. Did your face ever get sore? I woke up a couple of days ago and it feels like the parts I cannot move went and did a workout. No, mine never did that.  My face was completely immobile for 3 months.  I cannot really point to anything other than time that actually helped.  I *do* think that I actually massaged parts of my face too hard, and may have slowed/prevented some healing by doing that.  I could actually get my face muscles to react by massaging them very firmly.  Like, rub my thumb across my brow really hard, and the brow would rise on its own!  As if I was actually emoting. Same for my cheek/lower lip. So I did that often, thinking I was helping my face heal.  Well, here I am 2 years out and the only parts of my face that still do not work well are my brow and my cheek/lower lip...Just a word of caution, I have no idea if they are really related. The day after I finished my medication my face got really sore. On day 10 I started to see noticeable movement! Slowly improving but still have soreness and ear pain. I am on day 12 I am glad I am not the only one! Best of luck. Keep me updated", "Anxiety I keep reading stories about people's recovery just randomly stopped due to permanent nerve damage. I am 3 months in and 90% recovered. Stuff like that scares me. \n\nHow do you know if you have permanent nerve damage WITHOUT going to the doctors? Ugh. I cry myself to sleep thinking that it is just going to stop healing. I feel so discouraged. Please lmk.\n\nTy. ( The less severe your nerve damage, the more likely to are to make a full recovery. I started noticing a difference after 3 weeks. So that is a good sign?? And thank u so much \u2764\u2764\u2764 Yeah. :) Very simplified, complications happen when nerve fibers have so much to regrow that they cannot find the proper path to their target muscle anymore. But if you start getting some functions back within a matter of weeks, it is highly unlikely that you have that level of damage. I agree with u/Evayne\n\nSimply by spending a couple of years on this sub, you start to see two types of BP sufferers.  There are people who seem to recover rather quickly, and those people seem to make full recoveries.\n\nThen there seem to be other people, like myself, who take longer to recover and we do not seem to make full recoveries.\n\nMine did not even BEGIN healing until after 3 months.  That side of my face was totally paralyzed for 3 whole months.  Then recovery started and I stalled at about 80% or so.\n\nI think the fact that you are almost fully recovered at 3 months is a good sign for a complete recovery. Thank you so much, you are giving me so much hope you absolute star \u2764\u2764\u2764 Edit, put comment in wrong place. I am 3.5 months in and just started to recover. I still cannot blink my eye and still need to tape it shut at night. My face looks more symmetrical at rest and I have just gotten slight movement in my cheek. When you say 8O%...what does that look like for you? If your 3 months in and 90% recovered, I can almost guarantee you are going to get to 100%. I have had it multiple times, and I have gotten to 7 months with hardly any progress, and gotten back to 100% Sounds like your case is very similar to mine. I had no movement at all for almost exactly 90 days. Probably entirely a coincidence, but I ended up taking a family vacation to Florida in the summer for a week, and I managed to enjoy myself anyway. But the last two days of the trip, I started noticing a fluttering feeling deep within my ear, only when driving a vehicle, which was odd but any change was welcome. And then I also started noticing tingling all over my scalp on that side, something that you would normally attribute to getting the chills perhaps.  Honestly did not think too much about it at that point.\n\nA couple days after we got back, I started noticing a slight tugging sensation near my eyebrow when I was emoting. So I ran to the bathroom, and started doing the usual \"is my face working yet?\" routine, only this time I could actually see the tiniest of movements right in the center of the bad eyebrow!I do not think you would notice unless you were really looking for it.\n\nOver the course of the next couple of days, I pretty much got the eyelid control back entirely. I cannot point to have done anything special for it to happen, just pretty much happened overnight to be very honest.  \n\nAnd then over the course of a couple more weeks, I did some more healing, but it stalled out after that.  As mentioned, I have essentially full and normal control over my eyelid.  The eyebrow/forehead on that side does have movement, although it is diminished as compared to the healthy side.  I got some control of my lips back, to the point where I can eat without making a mess, and speak without any sort of speech impediment, but I still cannot purse my lips all the way to whistle.  I never really got much of the cheek back. I cannot manage an even, full teeth grin. Nor can I sneer fully (like to bear my teeth). Tongue and taste buds fully returned, and I think some of the smaller support muscles in my face actually came back too. For instance, the nostril no longer collapses when I breathe in suddenly through my nose. \n\nI am a guy with a full beard, so everybody I know says they cannot tell I have it anymore, and I truly believe them.  Overall I am satisfied.  \n\nHowever, I developed synkinesis like many (most?) long-term sufferers.  While it was nice to get most of my control back, I now also have some involuntary movements. They become more pronounced if I am tired or inebriated.  The nerves get confused and crossed up.  Squinting while chewing; always having to slightly smile if I want to squeeze my eye tightly, The tendons in my neck actually pop out if I try to raise my eyebrow, lol. \n\nRe-reading this, it comes off as pretty grim, but please understand it is not as bad as I am making it out to be. The only thing I miss is the whistling.\n\nMy unsolicited, uneducated, anecdotal, layperson suggestion is to (if you are not already) give your poor face a break.  I did not really realize until it was too late that my face was actively trying to REGROW NERVES.  I kept waiting for a switch to flip like some people seem to experience on this sub.  So I never really took care of my self. I think my body needed a lot more rest than I gave it. And I would also really advise against any sort of massage or electrostimulation therapy. I bought a TENS unit and stuck it on my face a few times. I also would vigorously massage the hell out of my forehead and lower cheek area, because a vigorous massage could actually force those muscles to respond as if they were moving on their own! It was exciting. I am also pretty damn sure I destroyed any of my brand new baby nerves that were trying to grow and I think I permanently damaged my face because of it.\n\nSo, chin up! Odds are you will make a full recovery, just try to take care of yourself! Ty\ud83d\ude2b\u2764\u2764\u2764 About 15 years.. still 85% lol ? Still half of my face does not operate 100%. Like??? this gives me very much hope, thank you so much for sharing your story. im 3,5 months in and am at about 50 percent. i was very worried, but reading this gives me hope. ty A bit late to this topic but I also got to agree with the other redditor (Sorry I cannot check as for it will not allow me). The earlier you heal the less you will have. As for my case, I started on day 3, before the 72 hour set, it is been 7 months since I have had it, so far I only have my taste missing because I was bullied into stop taking my meds. Just take your meds on time, finish it all and you will be great :) No that is perfectly fine! I started healing on the 22nd of December and I got it on the 2nd. So about 3 weeks in. The only thing that is taking so long is my pout/ the rest of my smile which just needs to be a bit more wider. Other than that, I am pretty much healed! \n\nThe first thing that started healing for me was my smile, eyebrows then my blinking. My nose fixed up this month, and from what I have read, the pucker takes the longest. \n\nI took my steroids and they helped so much! I am currently 2 months and 20 days in - 95% recovered. \nCan I ask when you got your pucker back? \n\nThank you so much for commenting \u2764\u2764 Idk if it was you who upvoted my comment lol sorry for being annoying but when did u get your pucker back?? Xxx Omg my bad!! Yes it me who upvoted! I was meant to respond but I received a snap at the same time I am so sorry DDD::: and do not worry you are not annoying, I love the responses :D\nAnd may you please elaborate on the word \"pucker\"? I am so sorry please enlighten me \ud83d\ude33 Like pout, the kissy face \ud83d\ude1a Oh! Yeah! I was able to pucker within a few weeks, it was quite difficult since drinking water was already a sport but at it gradually got better by the weeks &amp; days :D Oh that is nice to hear!!! Still waiting for mine to fully come back \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 ty !! Of course!! I will come back! Do not worry \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude02", "I have had my new face for 18 months now... My onset occurred when I went in to be induced on my due date with my baby (he was born the next day since the doctors assumed I was having a stroke or some type of brain bleeding). I was told repeatedly that I would be fully recovered in 3-6 months. Then after 3 months, I was told that I should recover within a year. But it has now been 1.5 years since everything began. Apparently I am one of the 15%... \"85% of people recover from Bell's palsy completely and spontaneously within 3 months.\" ((\n\nI would say that my face is about 60-75% better. But I am now dealing with my muscles over correcting (Synkesis). I just discovered an option that my GP never mentioned to me: ( Not to mention: \"( a facial rehabilitation specialist at UW Health's Research Park Rehabilitation Clinic, is the most prominent and experienced practitioner of facial retraining in the United States.\" That said, I immediately contacted my GP and asked for a referral. I am now just waiting to set up an appointment.\n\nHas anyone else gone through facial retraining?\n\n**Update: 07.01.15** \nI spoke with Jackie Diels yesterday evening to set up my first appointment for facial retraining next month. She assured me that 18 months is not too long to be considered a lost cause. In fact, she helped a 43 year old woman who had been afflicted with Bell's palsy at 8! There is hope! I will update again after my first appointment.\n\n**Update: 08.04.15**\nI had my first facial retraining appointment today. It was really wonderful. Jackie has been doing this for 28 years(!!) so has a good idea of how the muscles are working just after a short time talking with her. I told her about my diagnosis and she asked for the major time points as far as when I started regaining movement and noticing synkinesis (obviously I only realized that was my problem about a month ago). She then had me take a ( to assess my overall synkinesis (I was a 27% which means \"moderate\"). She confirmed my self assessment after video-taping me doing a variety of movements (smile, frown, pucker, close my eyes etc.). And she confirmed my own assessment that I had \"moderate\" synkinesis. (Yay!) We then walked through how the face muscles work together (( to help us smile, frown, close our eyes, etc. And it is crazy what our faces are capable of. And really, the muscles work -- they just re-learned incorrectly. \n\nI had a LOT of pain in the left side of my face since day 1. It has dissipated, but if I press in certain areas (chin, side of nose, under eyes, jaw-bone, and inside of eyebrow. She explained it as it was akin to a Charlie horse in our legs. And that I needed to stretch the muscles to relieve the knots. So she gave me several \"massage\" techniques that basically involved pinching (firmly but not hard enough to bruise!!) several of the muscle groups between my forefinger and thumb (I put my thumb inside my mouth and the other finger outside) and slowly pulling down. Stopping if I feel pain and then continuing when the pain subsides. This I am supposed to do twice daily on each of the muscles in my cheeks. (WHEW). After this I was AMAZED at the normal feeling in the left side of my face! Seriously, I have not felt that good since before Bell's Palsy. The difference in texture (it felt really knotty) between the affected and \"normal\" sides of my face was crazy.\n\nSo that is the first session in a nut-shell. It took about 3 hours. I have a followup in about 3 weeks. And we will go from there. I am sure that I have forgotten to mention some stuff. Ask questions.

Again, not sure if \"natural\" or not (and each of these, especially acupuncture, can be rather divisive).\n\nOtherwise, I have not heard of anything. Nope, this is exactly what I am referring to. Just not a fan of the whole steroid usage. Keep in mind that I am no doctor, and I believe the correct advice here is 'follow your doctor's recommendations,' but I took the 14 days of prednisone and I am sitting here at almost 10 weeks post diagnosis with basically no recovery. Additionally, I personally know a person who stopped taking the steroids after only a day or two and he recovered fully within 3 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will always recommend listening to your doctor, but the steroid certainly does not seem to be THE cure for everybody.

My partner was diagnosed with BP two months ago. He has tried a 2 week course of both steroid and an antiviral, plus chiropractic adjustments/acupuncture with little-no improvement. I bought him oral B12 vitamins to take and we are looking into the Chinese medicine stream of acupuncture since the chiropractic stream does not seem to be doing much. Any other things we can try? \nThank you", "There is hope for a fast recovery I was diagnosed with BP almost 3 weeks ago. I had about 20% control of my right side. I caught it early, but decided not to take any medications and 2 weeks later I had 90% control back and as if today I have 99% with just a very slight slant to my lower lip. I just wanted to post this to spread hope for people who think this is going to last forever, you will get better it just takes time :) also I know I said I did not take medications, but please listen to your doctors suggestions and keep your head up, you got this! 2 weeks for me and on the mend! Best of luck! The problem after recovery is muscle strength, you stop using some muscles so they become weak, once you recover your nerves you need to recover that strength, normally this can be an issue if your nerves recovery takes too long.\nBTW I am very happy with your recovery.", "Does it affect the tongue Wondering if Bell\u2019s palsy affects the tongue or use of it? Yes. Food got stuck around my lower teeth/gums on the affected side which was because my tongue was not working normally. Had to use my fingers instead - yuk! No eating in public, that is for sure. Yes. The front 2/3 of the taste buds are innervated by the facial nerve on the same side, nerve affected by Bell\u2019s palsy. So it is common to have taste impacted. Things tasted very bitter to me. However, the facial nerve is not responsible for motor control of the tongue. I do not believe motor control/use of the tongue should be impacted as a direct result. Now, eating can be difficult because of the poor lip seal and control of lower facial muscles. Definitely talk to your doctor if you are also having motor control issues with your tongue (impacted speech, difficultly sticking the tongue out and moving to all four corners, tongue drifting to one side, trouble swallowing, etc). \"Omg, Yes!\" to all of the above.  I feel like my tastebuds are getting back to normal today (day 12 since onset of symptoms). \nStill, I need to eat alone as often as possible because I never realized the job of the lips in keeping food/drink in my mouth, and now how often my tongue has to catch the escaping bits!  Better to not have witnesses to the hard work done by napkins right now... my own personal \"first responders!\" Yes, lips are hugely important in eating and swallowing! I am a speech pathologist, and I studied all this in school... but never thought I would deal with it so personally. A lip seal plays a huge role in swallowing and chewing. Try swallowing with your mouth open, and you will see. It is possible, but so much harder. Drinking out of a straw was nearly impossible for me without using my tongue to create a good seal against my top lip, in place of my bottom lip. The good news is, I am 15 days post onset, and I am 95% recovered! Zero issues with eating anymore, as my lower face has fully bounced back. My eye is still a little gimpy, but getting better. Hang in there!! I feel about 75ish% back everywhere but my eye.  Still not really blinking too well.  My speech is not nearly as affected as it was, and though my \"lip seal\" still leaves a lot to be desired, I feel like it is coming around...  I am a few days behind you, though, so thanks for the optimism!!! :) Yes, I was 16 and had it. The day before it happened I was at a restaurant and said \"hey, my tongue feels weird\". Thought nothing of it and woke up the next day with paralysis :/ I am not sure my taste went away, but it just felt \"off\" I just came down with Bell's palsy on Thursday. Yesterday, I noticed the few parts of my tongue that can taste, seem to think everything is intensely bitter.\nAlso have pain on the left side of my head, just above and behind my ear. I suspect that is the inflamed nerves causing this. I am 42, and never had an issue like this before, so fun times.", "Post diagnosis Just wanted to reach out for anyone that is kind of freaked out, I was in your shoes exactly 2 months ago, I could not smile, my eyes were blurry and watery, and I was super tired. Just know that it gets better, very rarely does it not, make sure to go to the doctor right away, get on a steroid that the doc will provide. That will help tremendously. As for watery eyes a GEL based eye drop is your best bet, as well as a warm damp wash cloth on the effected eye. Tape your eye shut at night as well, since you cannot technically close it all the way. Try and stay positive, it is a very depressing feeling. But you will push through. Fee free to PM me if you need to chat about it. Oh and stay hydrated. Cheers folks.", "Asking for work accommodation? I was diagnosed with BP last night.  My left side of my face hurts off and on.  I am getting a lot of major headaches.  The eye cream makes my left eye super blurry.  I am also feeling extremely fatigued after doing even small tasks around my house.\n\nI work in manufacturing, and my role is product inspection, though I work in other areas from time to time.  I have to be able to inspect tiny defects on products for 8 hour shifts.  With a blurry left eye and overcorrection in my right eye causig headaches, I do not think I can do my job properly.\n\nHas anyone had to ask for work accommodations due to BP?  I am not sure what to even ask or what is a reasonable accommodation. I went on sick leave when I got BP! There is definitely no harm in taking some time off to rest.  Yeah, I wish it was more of an option for me.  I only have four days of leave left, and I am using one today.  I am worried about using the rest because I have other chronic issues that flare up that I was saving this time off for.  Ah ok I forget that some countries do not have statutory sick leave. That is rough :( I would definitely explain to your superiors what Bell\u2019s palsy is and how it is affecting you - it is a serious condition.

I admit I laughed.", "Living w/Bells Palsy (pre-2020) and then Covid-19 diagnosis Has anyone with a prior Bells Palsy diagnosis (before 2020) gotten Covid-19 ?  If yes, please let me know what happened after getting Covid.\n\n I had Bells Palsy in 1995 and was recently (Dec 2020) diagnosed with possible neuritis involving more than one cranial nerve. I think I had Covid in February/March 2020 but it was before local Covid tests were available. I have been having lots of health issues related to cranial nerves and curious if anyone else can verify they were living with Bells Palsy results and then were Covid tested and received a positive Covid test result. (Please Note: This post is NOT about people that got Bells Palsy after a Covid Vaccine -if that happened to you - sorry about that.). \n\nI am trying to ascertain if there is a correlation between living with the results of Bells Palsy and then getting Covid and having addition cranial nerve issues. I am curious. Very curious about this as well. I know I keep a supply of the Prednisone just in case it comes back. Its been 7 years now. The pills were old. I told my Doctor the situation,  and got a fresh supply. Even travel with them, just so I can get to them asap if ever needed. Thanks Bons77 for the mention of having a supply of Prednisone available in case Bells recurs. My Bells was 25 years ago, still some face drop. No doc ever mentioned or offered Prednisone for another event. Something for me to check into. I got BP in April 2019. Tested positive for COVID-19 on New Year\u2019s Eve. I have no taste or smell and am very tired but have not noticed anything related to my BP. Yeah originally had a refill,but luckily I cleared up pretty quick and never used it. I held onto the refill though. From everything I have read, it seems the quicker you can get to Prednisone,  the better chance you may have. Hi Molly32mae, are you dizzy, feeling off balance or ears ringing? Agree from what I have read and heard from other Bells recipients. Back in '96 they initially misdiagnosed me - so did not get steroids quick enough.\n\nThis latest issue is a whole new animal. Is there any chance you got a misdiagnosis of ramsey hunt syndrome? I was diagnosed with ramsey hunt syndrome in which it is bells palsy but the bells palsy is caused by an ear infection caused by the herpes zoster virus (chicken pocks). Could be a similar condition you might have suffered from.\n\nBecause my bells was caused by an ear infection i was also in severe pain for 1-2 days with headaches, severe vertigo and dizziness and also some hearing loss which was temporary.\n\nI know this has nothing to do with covid-19 but by the sounds of it it sounds like you might have had bells palsy that was possibly caused by an underlying infection. No, none of those things! Just extremely tired and no taste or smell Ok - sorry you have Covid, Molly32mae. And trusting you will recover and be back to full strength. Peace Thank you, I appreciate that! Hope you stay well! Very possible, theacbsmith2001. In my 1995 case, I do not recall having a rash or shingles, and they did not check my hearing until early March 2020. Since Feb 2020, I have had ear ringing, balance and spinning issues, loss of hearing -right ear - same side as 1995 Bells. With my case i had no rashes either so the fact your rashes were not present it could still be ramsey hunt Just these two cents in. When I got BP we could not exactly understand why, one of the questions the doctor asked me was if I would had a recent cold. I asked if there was a connection and he told me cold viruses sometimes seem to cause BP but he could not tell me if it was the virus that attacked the facial nerves or if it was the immune response to the virus that made the facial nerves inflame and cut themselves in the surrounding bone. This was in 2000, maybe more is known about this since then. \nThing is... cold viruses are Coronaviruses, just like SARS-CoV-2.\nSo maybe there is something there? Thank you theacbsmith2001 - sorry for the delay - this recent cranial nerve issue is kicking my butt. I will look into Ramsey Hunt more - very possible I received wrong diagnosis in 1995. Hi violentdaffodils - agree there might be a connection - actually several studies I have recently reviewed indicate one coronavirus can \"awaken\" another coronavirus that is dormant in the body. For example, it seems some testing positive for Covid-19 have former varicella zoster virus (VZV) re-activated in their body. From what i understand Bells Palsy and Ramsey Hunt are reaction to a virus. And as you mention a cold is a virus.", "Any advice? I am a 24 year old male. I honestly did not take well care of myself lately. I mostly slept poorly, bad habit of many years. I am committed to sleeping better now. \n\nI developed my first symptoms about 2 or 3 days ago and started medication the second day I felt the symptoms. Started with not tasting food well with some parts of my tongue and noticing my lips not stretch all the way as well as not closing my eye as tightly. All on my right side. \n\nI started steroids, Paracetamol, eye drops and recommended light massages and facial expressions. Also to check up with an ear specialist, which I will do tomorrow when I wake up. \n\nShould I be taking anti-virals? Is there any other recommendation? Thanks beforehand! Please start on Prednisone as soon as you can \u2014 it is best to start within 72h after the first symptoms. This is the *only* thing that is actually been proved to work. \n\nFacial massages is really good too \u2014 I started it a month later, when I was about 90% healed, and within two weeks I was at 100%. Do those everyday and you will be good.\n\nI also took vitamin B. It is not proved to work, but it also will not do you any harm at all. \n\nSleep is very important, and so is eating well. Do not stress out too much. Treat this like being sick: if you want to heal faster, take care of yourself. \n\nI have been fully healed for about two years, but I still lurk here. Feel free to message me if you need anything. Since you mentioned it, I looked it up and saw my bottle of \"steroids\" and it turns out that is exactly what I had been taking. Thankfully! \n\nThe only issue is that I already have sleeping issues and I read I should take it early, and and it could induce insomnia, and I did not know, so, I took them at 7 pm for no reason and it is been like that twice now. I was thinking of taking them one hr earlier or so but asking the doctor if that is OK. Do you have any idea? I am supposed to start lowering my dose at the 6th day until the 9th, ceasing entirely the 10th. \n\nAnd thank you for your answer. Yeah try taking them in the morning, you should be fine to just not take it one night and then take it the next morning. But it affects different people differently, so if you do not feel like it keeps you up, then no harm no foul. I only felt like it kept me up the 4th time taking them, so honestly, it is just up to you, and if you think it changes anything. Some doctors feel like anti-virals may not help. It depends, mine gave me a 30-day prescription as he is had good results with the combo of steroids and anti-viral. The steroids are most important.\n\nOther than prescription meds, you have identified the habits that probably triggered BP. Sleep is really important as is just rest and avoiding stress. Mine was triggered at a particularly stressful period at work and now when my work load and stress levels amp up, I feel residual pain in my jaw or behind my ear. \n\nB12 shots in addition to sublingual B12 helped. Though I am all recovered, I still take B vitamins, lysine, an anti-inflammation supplement. Have you looked at some diet changes too? The antivirals are only necessary if they believe your BP is a result of a viral infection that is still developing. Do not get too crazy with the face massages just yet, if you really want to, just make sure you do them light or they will just make your face hurt more. Use saline not visine and if your muscles start to hurt from the excercises, just stop. Do not take Advil while your on the prednisone stick to Tylenol, but when your pred prescription is finished I highly recommend switching to Advil. It makes the Tylenol feel like candy. Good luck", " It is been a year with little progress. I do not know what my options are at this point. My hope my Bell's Palsy would go away has not happened. I have a bit of movement, but I have synkinesia and I am still severely impaired. \n\nWhat is my next step? Should I get physical therapy? I am not sure where to go for help. I want to learn how to manage my paralysis better.  I went to physical therapy. The exercises helped. Just know that electric stimulation therapy can do more harm than good. Maybe look into acupuncture too. \n\nWhat kinds of things are you struggling with? We may be able to give you some suggestions! My mouth is pretty weak. I could use exercises for my lips. I cannot drink out of a straw or a bottle. Also, when I eat my eye closes part way.  And you said you are at a year since on set?\n\nI know it sounds pretty dumb, but muscle training is important. Try to drink from straws or bottles with straws. It took me awhile but I am at a place where now I can drink from cups because I did muscle training on my own. You have to relearn the fine motor skills. It is frustrating and embarrassing at first but over time you do gain some strength, even if it is minimal. \n\nThe eye closing thing is part of Synkinesis. It is a pain in the butt to deal with, but it does become more tolerable as things progress. You may want to see a neurologist or neurosurgeon to decide what can be done to help your eye close fully when you blink, and to help with the production (over or under production) of tears. It is so challenging since Bell's palsy is one of those things that have such an impact on people's lives yet there is so little research and treatment options available. Take the baby steps though. Make small goals and reach for them. Persevere and do not let it stop you. You can do it. I know you can. Wow, thanks for your words of encouragement. Yes, it is been a year and it is gotten a little better. I can drink out of cups without dribbling and I talk more clearly. But yeah, I should train myself to gain more strength and control.\n\nAgain, thanks for such an encouraging post.  Old Chinese method worked great for my father!

Hello,\n\nI was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy mid February 2020. Full left side paralysis came on in 48 hours. Over the course of about 3-4 months I slowly gained back about 90 percent function, basically only I can notice where it did not fully come back (very grateful for this)  now that it is healed as much as I think it might heal, I notice when I pucker my lips (or sometimes eating or moving certain muscles)  it pulls on my left eyelid closing it slightly. I am assuming this may be from synkenisis during the healing process.  Another thing that has happened to me off and on in the later stages is I still have the odd pain behind my ear and discomfort directly behind my head. Usually while this happens I feel a kind of heaviness on my forehead and head and slight numbness (almost feeling like it is full of sand or sluggish) in the same side of face as the bells as well as a bit of twitching in my eye. This is currently happening  to me again and it is been happening for the last couple days. It will usually bother me more in the morning and I find if I am busy through the day it may go away and come back again. I am curious if anyone has experienced anything like this? I am looking to go back and make an appointment with the neurologist I saw early on to discuss... but hoping someone can share some insight into these feelings.\n\nThank you,\n\nMarc Hey Marc, so sorry to hear jay you are going through. This subreddit is great, but it is a bit inactive at times. You should direct this post onto the Bell\u2019s palsy and facial paralysis support group on Facebook. It has about 7,000 members or something who are very helpful and active. Best of luck to you mate Thanks a lot for the advice! I have just sent a request to join and will cross post.\n\nMuch appreciated I have had bells 3 times, and usually when it is nearly fully recovered, my face starts twitching a lot. It went away after the nerve has fully healed.", "Recovered bell\u2019s patients experiencing PTSD? (Throwaway account because I am working on cutting down my internet time) \n\nI am a recently recovered bell\u2019s patient with an almost full recovery, minus some hearing loss that may or may not be related to the initial cause of my facial paralysis (I had shingles in my ear. 10/10 do not recommend). I healed really quickly, though the entire experience was really traumatic for me, and there were times I even contemplated suicide because the pain was so bad. Now that I am healed from the palsy (I still have some ear pain from time to time from the shingles, and the hearing loss), I keep thinking it is going to come back any time I get a headache or my ear aches more than usual. I do not want to go anywhere or have anyone see me because I am worried it is going to trigger another flare up from stress or infection, or that I am going to catch something else, because 2020. \n\n Has anyone else who is recovered experienced the same thing? I feel like I ended up with some kind of ridiculous PTSD that would make most people roll their eyes at me. I know I need to talk to a therapist about this, but thanks to covid, no one in my area is taking new patients or seeing patients in person, which makes things extra difficult since I have a house full of kids who like to scream \u201cMOOOOOOMMMM!!!!\u201d every time I walk away to pee. I cannot be alone, though, right? Is there such a thing as Bell\u2019s palsy PTSD? I am not sure if there is a PTSD things related with Bell\u2019s palsy but I can tell you that I am extremely anxious and stressed about the hole situation I have two kids and I cannot stop thinking that I cannot take any risk for them because I know that my body is weak and who knows what Covid will do to me - I am 1yr Bell\u2019s palsy and still not 100% recovery You are talking about post-trauma *anxiety*, which is not the same as PTSD, largely because of that missing  WOULD': it is not a disorder, it is a natural response to trauma. Something traumatic happened to you out of the blue, and since you do not know what triggered *that* trauma you worry that any action, reaction, or inaction could trigger additional occurrences (called 'sequelae' in medical-speak).\n\nIf you look at the science, the chance you will have sequelae is largely based on age: if your first encounter with BP was below age 30, you have ~12% risk of recurrence; between ages 30 and 60 that drops to ~7% risk of recurrence; if your first encounter with BP was above age 60 you have up to a 40% risk of recurrence. The number is higher for younger people because they have more years ahead of them in which they might experience recurrence; it is much higher for older people because age brings on all kinds of changes that can either directly or indirectly contribute to a BP recurrence.\n\nRecurrence is strongly associated with a family history of recurrent Bell palsy. If it runs in your family, you have more cause for concern. If not, you have one less thing to worry about.\n\nSomething doctors and medical literature do not talk about much is the emotional side of having BP. When it first occurs, the first thing most people do is come here and ask what chance they have of full recovery and what they can do to help full recovery happen. This is a natural concern. Then when you recover, it is natural to wonder why it happened in the first place and whether it will happen again. (There are broad guidelines, but neither doctors nor Random People On The Internet know for sure. The best anyone can do is share what they went through, or give broad averages.)\n \nThe thing I always stress is: take care of yourself. Be kind to yourself. Take time for yourself. Eat healthy. Get a little exercise, even just a walk around the neighborhood. Stress is a contributor, so do what you can to reduce stress. Many people *cannot* do these things, because they are students or have kids or have jobs that take up most of their lives. But you have to find the moments when you can take a second to relax, to tell yourself everything is going to be okay.\n\n(If you cannot get away from the kids to take a walk, take them on the walk with you; a late afternoon walk can help wear them out for bedtime. Just declare that this is what we do now: after dinner we put on our masks and go for a walk, every day. From experience, I know that when people told me things like this I could think of many reasons to dismiss the ideas as unrealistic or too much work or^or^or^or... but also from experience, it helps. And then you have more energy to do the next thing, and the next thing...)\n\nWhich is the exact opposite of what people tend to do. They do not think about how low the risk of recurrence is, they worry about whether it will happen to them. They do not take a lack of family history with BP as a good sign, they figure family histories must start with *someone*, so they worry that they are that someone. Again, these are natural responses, but not particularly helpful. Stress is one of the triggers, so stressing about whether or not it will happen again can contribute to it happening again. (You touch a hot stove, you never touch it again: everyone has this experience. Anxiety is like continually going to touch the stove to see if it is hot enough to burn you again. But since anxiety can help *trigger* BP, it is like randomly firing up the stove, while continuing to touch the stove every once in a while. At *best* all this does is waste time and energy. At worst, you get burned again.) This is the *one thing* you can control... which is not the same as saying it will be easy, but if you work on reducing the anxiety, BP recurrence is only one of the gains you will experience. Anxiety is a self-fulfilling prophecy, not just for BP.\n\nAs you said, people would roll their eyes. Just like they used to do with post-partum depression. You have been through a profoundly impacting experience - physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually - but other people do not understand. They rarely do, until it happens to them.\n\n&gt; I am worried it is going to trigger another flare up from stress or infection, or that I am going to catch something else, because 2020.\n\n... and worrying can contribute to another flare-up, as well as reduce your overall health. So reducing how much you worry is a very important concern. Different people have different ways of doing this: affirmations, meditation, prayer, exercise, thinking things through, feeling things through, screaming into pillows, talking to someone, doing research. Whatever thing works for you, use *that* to help reduce anxiety.\n\nAs with depression, 90% of all such advice sounds like complete bullshit when you are in the middle of it. But it all makes sense once you have recovered. And you *have not* recovered: your 'almost full recovery' only applies to the restoration of afflicted sensory and motor nerves. The rest of you needs healing too: getting past the anxiety, depression, and despair; finding time for yourself, for sleep, for doing whatever it is that is restorative for you.\n\nIf the situation is less about having time for yourself, more about making other people *understand* that you need time to recover, then there is some communication that needs to take place. We are always afraid of asking for help or for time or for *anything* for ourselves, as though it is a shameful admission of weakness or something. But *you have just been through a traumatic experience*. (My own experience with BP ranks higher on my list of traumatic events than the car crash that broke my arm.) You have built up stress and anxiety, you have likely had less good sleep and good nutrition, your stomach is likely tied in a knot but externally you look fine so people assume you are fine. If they dismiss your needs based on the fact that you *appear* to be recovered, you need to educate them or find different people to talk to.\n\n&gt; I know I need to talk to a therapist about this, but thanks to covid, no one in my area is taking new patients or seeing patients in person\n\nBut thanks to COVID, many of them are seeing patients online. Finding the time and energy to do this might be a heavier task than you feel capable of doing right now, but one aspect of recovering fully is finding time for yourself... finding time to talk to someone is an important first step.\n\nAnd there are groups here on reddit that deal with these things, that assist in finding resources to get the help you need. I apologize for not knowing what they are, at the moment...hopefully someone else will provide a link. If they have not by the time I return (in a few hours... need to take care of myself, too) I will do some digging around.\n\nTake care of yourself. No 'but': take care of yourself. You have been through one aspect of a traumatic experience, but the other aspects are important too. When you have fully recovered, the nagging voice of anxiety will be much quieter than it is now. You will sleep better, have more energy, feel less burdened. I know how impossible that sounds, but it is true. You deserve a break, you have been through hell. Give yourself the care you need to recover from that. Mine started with facial twitching. Everytime I get twitching in my face I am super hyper aware of it and get suspicious. I feel that. I get the same reaction when my eye or face twitches, my eye waters a lot, or when my neck pops a certain way. All of these things happened right before I got BP, and it makes me nervous when it happens for fear of it returning. \n\nAlso, when I need dental work done and have to be numbed, it almost makes me cry because I remember how awful it felt to not be able to move one side of my face. I had an anxiety disorder and PTSD before my Bell\u2019s palsy that I was already in treatment for. My PTSD is related to secondhand medical trauma that I witnessed when I was 5. In short, yes, PTSD from Bell\u2019s palsy can be \u201ca thing.\u201d PTSD can result from anything. The thing with trauma is that it does not matter what the stimulus is, it is how it is perceived by a person\u2019s brain. If the person perceives it as life/safety threatening to themselves or others, trauma can result. Many people do not understand why my experience resulted in PTSD, but that does not matter. My brain registered it as so. Some events can result in PTSD for someone, but not for others. It is all about YOUR brain. So I would encourage you to talk to a therapist about this, and they can help make an actual diagnosis and treatment plan for you. You can also talk to your doctor about medications for a period of time if you feel like it is impacting your quality of life. Makes a huge difference for me. There is no shame in any of that. Everyone is trauma story is personal, and if you were traumatized by it, that is all that matters. I am 26, and still dealing with the trauma I experienced at 5. But I am dealing with it, and I will recover. My Bell\u2019s palsy was very triggering for me, because it was medical and I had to seek medical treatment as a part of it. I spent about 5 days in panic attacks, and the steroids did not help me. Just know that it does get better, and treatment can make a HUGE difference for both anxiety and PTSD. Sending you hope for healing! I had a filling done last week and 2 done this week. On my BP side. I also had a root canal last summer on my BP side. Never had any issues :) though I was high off an edible and paranoid that my face was going to be numb forever Lmaoo. Numb and paralyzed are two different things tho :) My BP was caused by stress. My version of BP PTSD is that I am scared to feel any strong negative emotions. I act like the dog in the meme that is sitting at the table while the house is on fire and he is like \u201cthis is fine ... I am fine\u201d my whole life could be a disaster and I brush it off because I am convinced the minute I start to worry or feel anger or sadness that my face is going to freeze up again. I avoid dating for the same reasons Thank you all so much for your responses! Pre-bell\u2019s palsy me would have taken the time to respond to each of you individually, but I am learning that it is okay if you do not send a thank you/response to every single person you interact with in internet land. \n\nI followed the advice of many and took some time for me today. I ran some necessary errands but then sat down and read a book, something I put off too often. It was not even a personal development book, which I read way more often than I probably should (I used to be a self improvement junkie, but I am learning to be better. Lol!!). I read almost 300 pages of a fictional book, and my kids were awesome about it! They binge watched tv, played together, and even helped each other out when it came to getting snacks and opening up the bathroom door for their younger sister to go potty. Overall, it was a good day today, and it helped me feel a lot better about where I am. I also took a freaking shower!!! I read a book AND took a shower today! I have three kids and my husband was at work!!! If reddit did not hate emojis, I would use them all here! \n\nReading all of your responses helped me to see that I am not alone, which helped a TON! I hate that I am part of the Bell\u2019s palsy club, but I am grateful this club exists!\n\nAdded: I am not going to use this account past tomorrow or the day after that, but I am going to keep it active so people can use this thread if they need it. It helped me a lot, and I hope it can help somebody else", "This sucks Diagnosed 4 days ago. Right side. Eye is dry as the desert. Anybody having pain like at the soft tissure of the outer ear. Love reading about some of yall recovering. Hope like hell this only last a few more days but i know it go on much longer. Get some eye drops for your eyes. 22 days for me and about 85is% recovered. Nerve pain is always the trickiest cause we all get them in different places. But def get some artificial tears man! Remember the nerve affected controls a whole side of the face. You can experience pain in many places. You need them eyedrops and an eyepatch to keep that eye closed. We have all been through it you will be ok! It is day 14 for me.  I just stopped wearing the eye patch at night.  I am starting to get some movement back in my eye and mouth, still have the pain behind the ear though.  It all gets better, just give it time. Heat helped me with nerve pain.. Like a hot water bottle or microwavable wheat bag or if you do not have those, dry rice in a sock, warmed in microwave, put a glass or cup with some water in with it so the rice does not burn. \nAvoid the artificial tears, they are useless! You want a thicker gel lubricant; in the UK there is one called Lacrilube. Not sure what the equivalent is in other countries. Tip: put it in your pocket for a few minutes to warm it up before application, makes it easier to apply. Yup it sucks big time.  I had a lot of ear pain and dryness of my eye as well.  Here is what helped me.  You mileage may vary.\n\nEye Ointment:\n\nIt is on Amazon, but this was the one the Dr prescribed for me.  Its a gel and makes a blurry mess of your vision, but it helps keep the eye moist.\n\nEye patch:\n\nIt took me forever to find an eyepatch that was not concave and could fit under my glasses.  Bought at least 6 different kinds before this one.  It was perfect for holding my eye closed without tape and not pressing on my eyeball.  It is also super soft so there was no chafing if I had to wear it for an extended period.  \n\nEye mask:\n\nThis was just the one my wife got me.  I am sure there are better ones out there.  I used this not for my eye, but the excruciating pain I had around my ear and jaw.  I would freeze this in the freezer and put it on my head sideways so the mask part was over my ear or cheek or wherever things were hurting that day.  It worked wonders for my pain. There was a spot on my ear that could make me fold up in pain but after 6 weeks I think it is gone as well as the extreme sensitivity to loud noises. But I find in bright sunlight I have a lot of vision problems and hope this goes away soon. My ear has improved and now my jaw is very sore. This is a weird frustrating condition. How long for you since this started?   I had jaw pain in the first week or two.  It is really frustrating and especially since I found no support from doctors, therapy etc. Accupuncturist knew more about it than anyone else but I really had to research to get answers. So happy to find this group I feel you pain diagnosed a day ago and already my dry yet leaking eye is annoying AF. Trying to be positive at the moment but its hard  :(. So while I cannot offer any advice chorn17 I fully empathize you and your eye issues.", "4 months in, 50% recovered? very depressed and feel like I cannot take it anymore I am not sure if it is even considered 50%, I have been struck with bell's palsy about 4 months ago, started treatment the next day (antivirals) but they fucked me up even more (turns out they clash badly with my antidepressants) they caused me more pain and set my progress back even more\n\nwent to another doctor who gave me steroids and referred me to physical therapy, improved quiet a bit after that but it was extremely tedious and gave me synkinesis...  I stopped going to the physical therapist (did that electrical treatment thing) and got a second opinion from another doctor who gave me vitamin b12 and another course of steroids\n\nnoticed even more improvements now that I am back on steroids, of course I have been doing facial messaging, exercises and streching all along so these most certainly helped a lot\n\ni can shut my affected eye almost completely without putting much effort into it but it is still not perfect, for example it is still kind of obvious when I blink.. when I shut it with some force it closes closes completely tho\n\nmy eyebrow has no improvement at all\n\nmy mouth improved but again not a lot, when i smile wide and show my teeth it is better than before and you can see more teeth but not all, eating is normal and talking is okay-ish but I can notice it is a little weird..\n\nmy nose has not improved \n\n\nI am extremely mentally exhausted, I do not know if I can keep going with this, I am tired of looking in the mirror and crying because my face does not work, I have spent so much time and money trying to get better yet it is not even 50% there.. I know some people have it much worse but most people recover completely within a month! this upsets me so much \n\nthis whole thing has been traumatic for me and has affected my mental health severely, I am sorry if I am coming off as over dramatic but I do not know where else to say all of this.. at least some people here went through this pain as well Do not lose hope. Are you on theraphy? My wife's going through the exact same thing right now. 2 months in. The nerves on the left side of her face are less than 20% as active as those on the right. She is also very frustrated and discouraged. For what it is worth, you (and she) are not alone Your case sounds a lot like mine, so I know how you are feeling. I have not read enough about other people\u2019s experiences to say if you will recover more or not. Hang in there and keep trying though. \n\nI have gone through several phases of emotions with this, and can even say that some good has come of it - mainly that my feelings of identity and self worth are no longer tied to my physical appearance and that is very freeing. It is a perspective I probably would not have gained without my BP experience. Not that I would not magic away my BP if I could. \n\nPlease DM me if you need to talk to someone who can relate. I have issues with depression too and I know the BP experience can be lonely and frightening. \n\nGo easy on yourself too. You are battling an illness of sorts and rest is important. thank you :(.. I will dm you when I can, I really appreciate your offer I am 4 months in as well and I am finally seeing lots of improvement. I saw very slow improvement for 3 months but it was very minimal. I started acupuncture and taking lots of vitamins (mainly vitamin b/b12) and the progress just skyrocketed. I am still not back to normal but I have had lots of ups and downs and know exactly how you are feeling. I have days where it does not bother me and I am super optimistic, and other days where it is constantly on my mind and I am very pessimistic lol. It will get better, just give it time and try to stay positive, it really helps. Do not lose hope!!!! We are all here for you:) Hi I am 4 months in as well and have minimal improvement. Just celebrated my birthday and got really depressed when I see my photos. I got diagnosed when I was pregnant and Bub is now 3 months. I would like to have a photo with my baby someday when I can smile again. \n\nHope it gets better for us. You are not alone. you can consider acupuncture too. my progress was also really slow and it made me really depressed, but after i started acupuncture, i felt like recovery came more quickly. thank you so much, hoping one day we will both be able to smile big again :) its people like you that give me motivation to keep going and not feel lost How are you feeling today? Have you had any improvement/movements at all? Heya! Is it any better now? Please do not lose hope! I promise you, you will look back this time last year and be so happy that you got through this, trust me beautiful \u2764 \n\nNote: 96% of people recover fully. Whether it is 1 month or up to 9 months. You WILL get better. Nothing else to it. You WILL get better. \u2764 my eyebrow started moving a bit, it is very minimal but I will take it lol thank you\u2764 Hey it is been a while! Are you all back to normal now? X no, just a bit of improvement here ans there but still not normal Oh sorry to hear, what is not back for may I ask? mostly my mouth, it is the hardest to excercise and the slowest to respond, the synkinesis in my eyes/mouth and eyebrows are making things more difficult as well", "Reoccurrence? I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy about 6 months ago and started seeing some return at 2 weeks and I have had about 90% recovery (I am the only one to notice the weakness in pictures and I can feel it when I am tired/stressed). Yesterday I started feeling tightness in my neck at the base of my skull (this happened the first time) and more weakness through my cheek and they feel connected (if that makes sense).  Does anyone have reoccurrence with theirs after recovery and if so is there anything I can do to keep it from progressing? Yes, mine came back a second time 10 months later on the opposite side. \n\nIf it is coming back, then do all of the same things - get to a GP for steroids, etc - the earlier the better. I called my neurologist and the NP said they will not treat me unless I go to the ER for imaging first \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Cannot you go to a general practitioner? That is what I will look into in the morning, since it is after hours now. I called them bc they are who I followed up with last time. I was hoping they would call in the prescriptions since I have a history of it. That sucks! Hopefully, it is a false alarm and by the morning you will not have developed any symptoms.  \n\nBook an appointment for first thing, if you can and at least if you are showing symptoms by then, you will have steroids way before the recommended treatment window of 72 hours. Thank you! I am hoping it is just stress/fatigue and with rest it will not keep getting worse!", "This is something that happened to you. It does not define you. Do not let this situation get you down. My case is severe. ER doctors were unsure if I would ever heal.  I am healing well. I am 9 months out and about 85% there.  I feel pretty good and look forward to seeing even more improvements in the remaining 3 months. ( They gave a year time frame for healing.  Then it slows significantly.) \nBe hopeful and do not let it define you. Thank you very much. I feel like this is very motivational, especially for the people who just got it. In my first months, I was really like, 'what is everyone going to think'. But if anyone avoids you, just because your smile is odd, or your face is not symmetrical, it is their fault, not yours. Stay strong and positive!", "Taste no salt I am a week in. On steroids and an antiviral. Went in on the day the face started getting numb. In total, maybe I waited a day too long. \n\nI have gotten some face control back. I can sort of eat off a spoon now using my upper lip (think pudding)\n\nI think I am smiling but my wife says I am not. So some work to be done there. \n\nWhat went first and foremost for me was taste. The salt taste is basically gone on one side of my tongue and is very limited on the other. \n\nMy speech is improving but the lack of control on my upper lip is still problematic. I am hoping it will be another couple days and that will get better. \n\nMy sense of taste is what I am most concerned about. I am watching food tv more now and making lists of things to eat when it comes back.  \n\nIf it comes back.\n\nDid anyone have a similar experience? Did you regain any salt tastes?\n\nHoping for salt someday soon. Good luck to those dealing with this now. \n\nThanks.  You will taste salt again! My taste is still slightly dull on one side of my tounge, but I can taste everything.  Hey, littlestaple, just a quick heads-up:  \n**tounge** is actually spelled **tongue**. You can remember it by **begins with ton-, ends with -gue**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. The helpful hint from this bot is some of the worst I have ever seen. It is not helpful at all.  How long after diagnosis for you before it came back? Thanks for the vote of confidence! I actually cannot remember exactly, it is been a year by now and I only ever lost the taste on one side. But I think it was a few weeks.  Great thanks! I can barely taste salt on the one side and none at all on the other. Really hoping to get most of it back.", "BP Began Last Thursday Night For Me Hello,\n\nJust figured I would post my experience days into it.  Exactly a week ago I felt my tongue feeling weird and losing taste.  Come Wednesday my left eye was twitching for a good 30 minutes and to say it was annoying would be an understatement.  Thursday during the day, my coworker noticed I was not blinking.  I go to get Benadryl hoping it was just the weather and allergies.  Tell my boss that something is not right and I may not be in tomorrow if what this is is still going on.  I get home and I am starting to notice shit is not moving on my face.  I tried laying on the couch for a few minutes and kind of just drifted for a bit.  I got up and went to urgent care to see what was going on.  I get escorted immediately as it could be a possible stroke.  The doctor tests me then confirms it is Bell's Palsy.  Tells me to look it up on Google(There was a poster behind him saying do not listen to an internet search which I found ironic.  I was sent out to the waiting room as there were multiple people before me.  After about an hour and a half, I am back in to see the doc to confirm no more changes.  He then writes me a script for prednisone and the anti-viral.  This is about 8ish at night.  Luckily there was a 24 hour pharmacy right down the street, but lord would have it, there was a legit 20-25 people in line.  This still makes zero sense to me what the heck all these people were doing.  With my condition getting worse I try my chance at the other 24 hour one about 8ish miles away.  Not a single person in line!  In and out in about 30 minutes.  39 predisone pills to taper down.  Along with a horse pill of an antiviral.  Next day  I go to my doctor and she changes the dosage so it does not taper off and it is just straight 60mg's until I run out.  She wants to see how I am after taking the medication, to see if physical therapy is needed.  And just take it in stages.  I was doing electrical stim at night with a tens unit, but after reading more, it is not really a good thing to be doing until the nerve is back into place.  So I will just do nightly showers and use a massage ball until later on.  It has not gotten worse.  But of course I am dreading going anywhere.  I am an introvert already and this just multiplies this x100.  I just want to lay down with my dog and cry, but then it could have been caused by stress.  It is frustrating and it sucks I cannot drink anything or eat anything without something dropping.  Sleeping sucks with an eye patch on.  I am just venting and appreciate anyone who takes their time out of their day to read this. Literally the exact same thing happened to me same symptoms and everything. Mine was caused by stress of my ex cheating on me. I was better in about a month but I was getting electrotherapy aka electrocuting the nerves in your face to wake them up. The therapist would massage my face and have me do exercises like try to smile teeth out, try to puff your cheeks, try to raise your eyebrows, and try to close your eyes tight. I was told to chew gum constantly and avoid cold air like the air conditioner or car window hitting my face. Most important thing is I know it is hard but try to relax and wait it out.\nSunglasses help a lot Welcome to the BP yes it is not good thing but hey it is life we can either deal with it or let it get to us. Me I dealt with it. First day did not go out, but the next day I went out. Let us face it most of the people u see you are never going to see again (strangers). The people u do know will support you or think you are dying. Some people are going g to think they are experts and some are going to be ignorant. Educate yourself and educate others.  Do not let it get the best of you. I have had it for almost 2 years it has not gone away completely. People do not see it but I do. Hope this helps get well done and let time heal it. Do not fuck with your face too much as the nerves are repairing themselves. Yeah I am not doing anything beyond facial massages physically to it now.  Figure I have to just wait for that part to do its thing.  If I show no emotion, it does not look like anything, until I blink.  Stopped doing caffeine too just in case.  Upped the dosages in a few supplements and hopefully, all will be well.  Speech is a bit off though.  Not a fan of that part.  But yeah, is what it is.  Thank you!! So you started the physical therapy right away then?  How many times a week did you go? Hopefully it should be gone soon.  Embrace it there is nothing u can do about it. I got the BP diagnosis exactly two weeks ago today, so I understand what you are going through. I got lucky it seems as after a week I could taste food again, and also my eye started improving. I would say I am at about 80% today, so maybe another week or two to be mostly 100%. Take the meds, keep your eye in good shape, try to avoid drinking with a straw, and get as much rest as you can. Hopefully you will be on the 2-3 week recovery timetable. Crap a straw is bad?  Only way I can drink at work.  I will stop doing that now then.  I make a shake that I just drink in the shower right now in the AM.  Do not have to worry as much haha.  I am glad to hear you are on the upswing!  Did you supplement anything beyond the original medication that was given to you? Hi glad, I am Dad! I should say that I simply read drinking through a straw can keep the nerve inflamed. I wanted my recovery to be as speedy as possible, so I decided to toss out my straw just to be safe. I did not do anything special beyond taking the meds and keeping my eye patch on. I went twice a week for about 5 weeks. But no, I did not start physical therapy until 2 and a half weeks after onset. I went on short term disability and had 3 MRIs and some blood tests to rule out MS and cancer. I also did a stress test and went to a cardiologist to rule out a stroke. I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend and he moved out and that is how I got better. But eliminating stress in my life. Gotcha, I changed jobs recently and am waiting on insurance currently.  The cost of everything you did is a damn house haha.  I will end up doing the blood tests probably in a few weeks.  I tend to get blood tests every 6-12 months and the last batch was all in order.  That was of course about 9 months ago.  I will end up doing the physical therapy probably twice a week then.  My speech is hurting a bit, but I can drink out of a cup without dripping everywhere.  My left nostril, upper lip, cheek, and a quarter of my eyelid do not move much.  I can bite my inner cheek on the bad side and move my chin and such.  I am not going to work out or do anything until all my medication is gone.  Main complaint besides the frozen face of course, is the neck pain that comes and goes. Not too familiar with BP, but has anyone tried CBD to alleviate symptoms? .... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave not dove deep into the research yet, but have heard some whispering online about Full Spectrum CBD helping out? Just curious on any thoughts? Which symptoms are we referring to?  The frozen face?  The nerve pain?  Topical cbd or oral? All of the above.... Just curious if anyone has had any results from CBD good or bad?...\n\nFrom what little i understand Bells Palsey it is commonly rooted n a viral infection that leads to inflammation around nerve ends. CBD being an anti-inflammatory it would make sense that it could help So Viral for some yes, but the inflammation around the nerve is everyone of course.  Is there a specific item you are talking about?  There is so many out there now.  I am sure many of us would give damn near anything a go to get the healing process speeded up. Ok...I guess i was just asking in general terms...There is a lot of different CBD products out there, (gummies, oils, topicals,vapes) which all interact with the body in the same way. The scientific cbd studies are still new since CBD has just started to become know as it was only legalized &amp; made available to the general public last year.... I will have to do some research &amp; get back to ya - I just asked the same question on Quora to some professionals to get their opinions I could not close my eye and had to wear an eyepatch. Yeah it cost so much that I maxed my deductible so after a little while I did not have to pay any copays . The beginning sounds so similar to my experiemce. Noticed things tasted weird or bland, as if my tongue was numb but it was not. Couple days later, on my way to school I notice my eyelid twitched quite a lot. Did not think much of it untul I noticed I could not bite my upper lip with my teeth. By the end of the school day my smile was already crooked.", "Recovery! I am happy to say that my face has recovered by 92%. It is been 5 months since I developed Bell\u2019s palsy, so I just want to let people know you will most likely recover, it will take time! Just stay positive and remember there is plenty of people here to help you get through this :) It is been about 2.5 months for me and I am not able to smile, there are so many cases with different time periods of healing. Do you think you will make a full recovery? \nDo you go to a physiotherapist everyday? What kind of sensations have you felt in recovery? My father developed Bell\u2019s palsy about two months ago and today started feeling tingling around his mouth/cheek and is hoping it is starting to wear off. Anything like that happen for you? Yes tingling in my face is something I felt! One of the first things that started to return to normal for me was my mouth so that is a good sign for your father too\ud83d\ude0a", "An unexpected bonus I have had BP for 3 weeks now. VERY VERY minor movement regained in eybrow, lips and neck so far.\n\nAlmost all sense of taste is gone, with the few parts working being distorted, so things do not taste right.\n\nAs a result of the combination, I do not eat much, so I have lost 3.5 KG (7.7 pounds) in this time period. \n\nI guess I need to resume exercising so I can keep muscle as I lose weight. I suspect I will not be regaining mobility for a bit, and that applies to my taste, so that is kind of a bonus.\n\nBP gets a 1 out of 10, do not recommend. The 1 coming from the weight loss.\n\nI hope everyone is doing splendidly! i lost 15 lbs in the first two weeks myself Trying to find the good in all this is really helpful. Exercise is awesome for reducing stress so I strongly suggest you do it.", "Neck pulsing while moving affected side? I am about 8 weeks in since I was diagnosed and I can feel myself just barley starting to get better. I can very slightly move my mouth to smile but when I try my hardest my neck on that side starts like pulsing. Is that a normal part of healing or something? Is it a muscular rippling sort of feeling? It is possibly your neck muscles tensing from you straining so hard for movement. Yeah it is. Is it something I should stop doing? I do not think it is going to cause you permanent damage or anything but maybe do not push it so hard. If movement's coming back that is a good sign I had that in the early weeks of being diagnosed, went away within a few tho. Bells palsy is some wild shizz.", "Court Cannot Prove COVID-19 Esistance. It is All a Lie ", "My prescription from Doctor (day 3) Bells Palsy ", "Humidifier Would using a humidifier be a good idea to help with combating drying of the eye and just making things more comfortable during you recovery process? Get the overnight gel for your eye. It kind of glues the lid shut so it does not dry out. If it is that bad, consider a patch Do you have the name of this gel? Is it an otc or does it have to be prescribed by a doctor? Otc. Systane night gel. It was like my bff for 4 weeks. I was using it at night, in the morning and putting drops during the day Thanks, I will pick some up tonight. Do you reckon I should wear an eye patch over it? Would not hurt to pick one up. I think they are like 3 bucks. Other alternative would be to tape the lid shut with some gauze over it. Speedy recovery \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e Thank you!!! Humidifier would not hurt!\n\nBut you need to be using gel at night and tape it shut. I also used Systane. \n\nI refused to do this for months, because I thought I did not need to.  My BP eyelid would stay shut so long as my good eye was also closed.  So I figured I could just keep them both closed all night.\n\nMy neurologist pointed out that people's eyelids open very often while sleeping and that I was likely leaving my BP eye open for hours at night after I had fallen asleep.\n\nSo I started using Systane and paper tape on my lid.  It took a while to get used to but ultimately was the best thing for me.  My eye felt better and less irritated throughout the day.", "Day 31 Not much progress. Should I be concerned My face has become more \"symetrical\" and centered, but in terms of movement in my face, the only thing I have to show is that i can slightly move my eye. I still have that weird ear thing but only notice when there are loud noises or when I swim. I have been doing acupuncture 2 times per week and took the steroids for 5 days.\n\nI know things could be worse and I am trying to stay positive but man its tough to not blink and to mentally know that you are not at your best.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else? Am I doomed to never fully recover? \n\n&amp;#x200B; Take it easy I started showing signs of recover2 to 3  months just rest a lot and avoid cold winds Took me 4 months before my recovery was noticeable. Best thing to try and do is relax. Hang in there  I have no proof that this actually helped, but I took B12 (sublinguial methylcobalamine) and I feel like that is when I really started to recover. It could have been a coincidence, but I do not think it could hurt to try.  Yea I have been taking a lot of that + Fish oil. I know things are feeling better underneath the skin and I think that is helping. Steroids ASAP after onset is the only treatment shown to be effective. If you have done that, then try to relax and lead as much of a healthy lifestyle as you can. This means eating nutritious food, exercise, and sleeping enough every day. I would suggest against acupuncture as no study has proven it to be effective and yet you are dealing more trauma to the face when you go to every session.\n\nManaging expectations: those who do not recover spontaneously within a few weeks generally will have some form of lasting symptoms. However, it should not be noticeable at all if you recover within 6 months. After 6 months, most will develop synkinesis but it can be treated with muscle retraining and Botox. I am not here to scare or disappoint you but these are the info that we know. Using this opportunity to get to a healthier lifestyle is a very important mindset to adopt as early as possible. \n\nKeep us updated with your journey and feel free to ask more questions  I have had and have a very healthy lifestyle: I eat clean, exercise 3-5 times a week and so and so. But it did not prevent me or has not helped in any way. Think with a healthy lifestyle it is just not to have other not BP-related issues. Been nearly a month since I was diagnosed.", "Over 4 months with Bell's Palsy. Finally, got a tiny bit of movement back. I started to worry after I had no change in my BP after 4 months. My neuro said I have a severe case but said I should get better. \n\nAfter the neuro visit, I started to have movement in my mouth. I can move it a tiny, tiny bit. It is a microscopic smile but my friends say they can see movement.  \n\nHaving that little bit of movement gave me a lot of hope. The nerve is regenerating. At this point, I do not care about a full recovery. I just want some recovery.\n\nI just wanted to share with others in a similar boat.\n\n Every bit of progress, even the microscopic, makes me feel better too Would you mind updating us again later? It took me six months to close my eye, and a little over a year to get where I am at now which is probably 90-95% healed. I never saw a specialist. Sure, I will post an update. I am getting an MRI and seeing the neurologist later this month.\n MRI? All I got was anti-viral &amp; steroids and a \"good luck, surgery is your only other option.\" I am glad your docs are doing more.  Are you me? I had no movement for the first 4 months either. Then I started going to PT for electric stimulation so the muscles wouldnt get weakened. \n\nMy neuro told me I have a severe case too. Im at 11 months, almost a year. I am getting an MRI in February. I stopped going to PT for reasons, but my neuro is insisting I go back.  My doctor is ordering more expensive tests, but is not doing more in terms of treatment options. He talked about surgery as an option. \n\nThe MRI probably will not find anything. But, it is good to rule out non-viral causes of BP. My understanding is that an MRI is normally done if people do not get better after a few months.  \n\n My neuro said electric stimulation helps, but he said it was not necessary. I decided to put that off for awhile.\n\nSome of my muscles are cramped up and hurt a bit. I wonder if electrical stimulations would help that. I massage the muscles, although I do not think it helps. \n \n\n Electric stim is a weird experience.. it doesnt hurt but its not comfortable either. Its tolerable but annoying. My PT suggested facial massages and face yoga as well to help relax the muscles.  You are the second person I have seen here talking about electric stim, and I am as surprised as I was the first time.\n\nMost sites that talk about treatment of BP do not even mention it. Wikipedia, quoting ( research paper, says \"There is no high quality evidence to support the role of electrical stimulation for Bell's palsy.\" Another ( says they found \"no significant benefit or harm\" from electrical stim. bellspalsy.ws (\n\n&gt; ... there is mounting evidence that  may be contraindicated. It has been suggested that electrical stimulation may interfere with neural regeneration post peripheral nerve injury, and studies proving its efficacy with facial muscles are lacking in the literature. A 1984 report by the National Center for Health Services Research concluded that \u201cElectrotherapy treatment for Bell\u2019s palsy\u2026 has no demonstrable beneficial effect in enhancing the functional or cosmetic outcomes in patients with Bell\u2019s palsy.\u201d\n\n&gt; Additionally, patients who undergo electrical stimulation acutely may demonstrate more synkinesis and mass action than those who do not. It is difficult to produce an isolated contraction of the facial muscles using electrical stimulation due to their small size and close proximity to each other. The contraction produced causes mass action which reinforces abnormal motor patterns and can be painful.\n\nOther sites mention side-effects like irritation and/or hypersensitivity, which seems kind of weird when the one cause of BP that everyone agrees on - the nerve is irritated, swollen, or compressed - is one of those side-effects.\n\n(Electric stim for muscles can be a good idea. Zapping the hell out of a nerve that needs to heal, not so much.)\n\nHave you noticed any improvement after stim sessions?\n\n(Other than relief that you are no longer sitting there getting zapped? I had a stim implanted in my spine for a while due to a spinal cord injury, it ultimately turned out to be more hassle than help. But turning it off sure felt good, in comparison. * *bzzzzt* *) W00t!\n\nThe things that have to happen for you to get that far are substantial... that is a very good sign. I was positively giddy the day I was able to *slightly* move my mouth... it was like a crack in a dam, things got progressively better from there. Just knowing that there would indeed be 'some recovery' was the best news I would had in a while.\n\nI do not know what (if any) of the things I tried to help that little nerve along did anything useful; I have only had BP once, so I do not know what would have happened if I had not done anything. But after I felt that first little bit of control come back, I spent a lot of time feeling around for the part of the nerve that was working, and trying to move nearby areas. Nerves work (in part) like little wires, so I kept sending signals down those wires. When I saw my doctor after a week of that he was shocked at how fast I was recovering.\n\nYMMV. But it is good that you are getting some movement back. Thanks for sharing this with us, being able to read what other people were/had been/are going through was immensely helpful. So my PT used the lowest settings to stimulate the muscles more or less so I wouldnt lose the muscles. They used a pin point stimulator for me. It kind of looks like the little mirror that dentists use. \n\nWhen they were graphing muscle movement and nerve growth it did eventually become painful because they had to find 30 points for the graph. \n\nOverall, it was not a terrible experience and there was improvement. We took pictures every session and did comparisons which you could definitely tell there was more movement in major areas, like closing my eye, some lip movement, etc. the bigger muscle movements. The fine motor movements are still absent.   I was just diagnosed with this today and it freaked me out. I will be praying for you\n It is a lot to deal with in the beginning. Especially with the eye. I wish you a good recovery.  Thanks for your story. I relate. My mouth is not moving much more, but my friend said my face looks less droopy. The changes are subtle, but I will take what I can get. \n\nI try not to focus too much on it on a day-to-day basis because it will probably take weeks, months to improve.  Thanks for talking about stimulation. I was wondering about it. Face yoga. Did not know it was a thing. I will look it up.  Its not a terrible experience. My PT was really interested in doing research before he even touched me with the stimulator. It basically feels like forced twitching but at a controlled pace. The more electricity they use, the more you feel. I do believe that it helped me keep some muscle in my face and that along with the facial exercises helped to bring back movement, even if its barely notable movement.  My neurologist wants me to get an MRI to see if there is even the slightest image of a tumor or something odd. Honestly, it cant hurt. Better to rule out everything than be left with tons of questions.  I feel the same way. The reason I did not get an MRI sooner was I did not have health insurance. The doc said it was fine to delay the test. I get the MRI next week.  Same for me. And my neuro wanted to wait until the one year mark.  He said something about a \"biopsy\" at the 10 month mark. I wish I could explain, but I did not ask questions. \n\nI am hoping now that I have progress, I do not have to worry about a biopsy.  Thanks for sharing this info with us. Knowing what others have gone through, what options are available, what has worked or not worked for people... these things kept me from completely freaking out the day I got hit with BP.\n\nSo... thanks. Any time! I am always around for questions and to share my experience. It made me pretty anxious so if I can save someone that experience, I will gladly share!", "Bell's Palsy day 3 (after visiting neurologist) - Need your blessings.  Day 12 here. Never lost full closure of my eye but it does delay a little. \n\nSpeedy recovery, sir. Stay strong \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c I had the same issues with closing my eye on that side.  I was wearing patches and having to manually blink too.  Thankfully it has started getting better around day 8 or so, but I still tape my eye shut at night and use eye drops during the day.  Too much time on the computer and I have to take a break.\n\nThanks for sharing your journey, and best of luck. Same here brother.\nI work with 3 different teams in three different time zones. Cst, est and ist.. So have to stay over calls for hours and infront of laptop for hours...\n\nBut i use anti-glares spectacles that gives less stress to my eyes.\n\n***my physiotherapist has asked to put cotton in my right ear.\n\nHe has asked me to keep it warm. Awesome. I am happy for you. I feel we are the chosen ones with a superpower for few weeks. :)\n\nHave an awesome weekend. You too, sir. Be well.", "Remedies Other than steroids, what has been a successful resource for you all? I have heard CBD creams, acupuncture, exercises, please share!! I am about 17 months post diagnosis and probably 80 to 85% healed. My healing stopped about a year ago however.  I am sorry to say, for my story, I do not attribute my healing to anything other than time.  I have yet to try acupuncture, but I have done pretty much everything else that gets bandied about on this sub.  Still cannot whistle :-/ Would you say you had a mild or more serious case? Did you loose complete function or have any function at all? Sorry I forgot to press reply and just commented after, I am new to this reddit thing! I was totally stone-faced on the right side for over 3 months.  No movement or control whatsoever. My eyelid has returned to essentially normal function, thank God, but everything else is still pretty muted.  I can speak normally but, as I mentioned, I cannot purse my lips enough to whistle.  The eyebrow on that side still does not raise nearly as high as the other.  What is worse, I got synkinesis, as do many long-term sufferers.  So sometimes my eye will close while I am chewing, or my lip will curl when I blink. Annoying, but not life-altering like the lack of eyelid control was.\n\nI believe I actually damaged my face, or prevented full healing, by overstimulating myself with massage.  That, and perhaps trying to emote too early. Who knows? It is a very mysterious affliction with not a lot of study. When you first had the paralysis did you loose more function as the first initial week went on or did you just wake up with it being stone cold? I am only asking because my boyfriend can control his eye right now. He woke up with the paralysis this morning and immediately went to the ER Around lunch time one day, the tip of my tongue went numb. I just assumed I had burnt it on my coffee that morning. Later when I was home from work, maybe about 5:30 p.m., I noticed some weakness/numbness in my upper lip.  That was concerning, but then it started to creep up towards my eye over the next few minutes.  I ended up at an urgent care, who diagnosed me with Bell's. They were actually slightly concerned about a stroke because, at that point, I could still move my eyeBROW but not really my eyelid. Nonetheless, they did not have imaging equipment there and so they left it up to me to either go to an actual ER or just \"assume\" it was Bell's.  Got Prednisone and whatever the antiviral was.  By the time I got my prescription, I could not close the eye at all.  By the next morning, the whole face was gone.  \n\nBeing on the steroid is hard.  I cannot explain it.\n\nBut my face stayed like that for a little over 3 months.  Did the prescribed medications, used lots of CBD drops and ointments, B vitamins, tumeric, THC, TENS therapy (self-applied twice and all it did was hurt my skin), rubbed the hell out of my own face.  I cannot point to any one thing that \"worked.\" I think it was just time.  I went from that level of impairment to where I am now over the course of perhaps a month.  It is been like this since then.\n\nDo not mean to alarm you: most people here seem to make a full recovery within a few weeks.  Odds are he will be back to normal in no time!\n\nJust do not put me on \"Team CBD\" or \"Team Acupuncture\" Gotcha! I want to hear as many peoples experiences as possible. I think that is the only way to really educate myself! There are so many different things on the internet and it really is not that common. I appreciate you telling me your story! I hope you gain full ability Hi. Can I ask you about your bf evolution? I also got it a few days ago and  have some control over my damaged side, but I am worried about loosing what is left of movement. He was complaining of pain below his ear like in the jaw area this past weekend and then started feeling kind of weird earlier this week. Thought nothing of it- just that he slept on it wrong or something. Then this morning he woke up to not be able to use the left side of his face. He can blink as of now though. He also can feel his entire face. So if you touch or poke him- he feels it. He cannot move his mouth and it droops when he smiles, he cannot move his nose, eye brows or forehead. Waiting for results on lymes disease now! I forgot to mention like 2 weeks ago he was very sick with a cold of some kind. Tested negative for covid twice. Doing face exercises 3 times a day. Massaging face before exercising, and stretching the face muscles after exercising. What has your progress been like? I did steroids (6 days), anti-viral (Valtrex 10 days), and vitamin B12 (2500 mg/day), and my BP cleared in 21 days. The majority of people recover 100%. I had BP back in 2014 and I still have some residual effects. It is nothing dramatic but I think it is noticable. \n\nLike the other poster above, I tried everything I came across. Took the meds, added supplements, did the facial exercises reccommended, massage, essential oils, acupuncture, castor oil compress, heat packs, slept a lot. \n\nI noticed the most progression while doing acupuncture. It does not mean it works for everyone but it did for me. If you can afford it I recommend trying it. I also looked at it as a way for me to lay in a dark room and relax which we all could use. Did yours get worse before it got better? The facial paralysis happened over the course of few hours. It never got worse once it finally settled in.\n\n\nI do not think this is the norm but after about 2 days I had the headache from hell for a couple weeks. Like I would sit in a dark room with my eyes closed and not moving kind of headache. That lasted at least a week and maybe a little more. I had an ear infection at the same time so I was taking steroids, antivirals, antibiotics and pain meds at the same time. The combo made me lose my appetite and have dry heaves every morning. Again, I do not think this is the average experience.  Hi! thanks for your reply. I hope your bf gets well soon and exams go well.\n\nI have very little movement on my eyebrow and can slightly move the corner of my mouth on the affected side. I can whistle with some effort. I had been working from home this week but every single day it got worst for my eye, so I went to the doctor this morning and she said I must not work for the next 16 days. It is been 5 days since the onset so she told me to not be afraid if it gets worst on the nect 2 or 3 days. Also she said that beyond those days the effects should start to slowly revert. I was diagnosed last week and I am doing acupuncture.  It does seem to be helping, I am doing 3x a week for 10 sessions.  They are hooking up electrodes to the needles to send pulses into my face and stimulate the muscle. \n\nI reached out to a ton of different acupuncturists and asked them about their experience and recommendations for treatment and the one thing they all said is start treatment NOW. The sooner you start the more effective it is. Other things I am doing: taking steroids, got a $20 facial massager from CVS, using a heating pad to loosen muscles, facial excercises at least once an hour, vitamin b complex, taking some other supplements I found are supposed to be good for paralysis.", "had it twice first time on my left side in 2014. then my right side about a year and a half later.\n\nthe neurologist i saw (same one both times), has a practice that spans decades, said he would only treated like 3 patients who would had it twice.\n\nanyone else in the double whammy club? This is my first time having it, but when I was initially describing my symptoms to the nurse on the phone she asked if I ever had BP before. I had never even heard of it. She said if you have had it once, you are more likely to get it again. I have not researched it further, but I have heard of a couple people having it more than once in their lifetimes. oh weird. my doc said it is not usual. but that generally repeat cases happen within like 2 years if and when they do. me! and on the other side as well!\n\ndid you get the covid vaccine recently? I have had it 3 or 4 times, depending on how you count it. The last 1 or 2 times it happened on my right side (like it had the first 2 times), and then 2 weeks later it hit my right side. It sucks not being able to close your mouth as well as both of your eyes. 3 times for me; 1995 (8 yrs old), Feb 2017 and then almost exactly 4 years later Feb 2021 That Is crazy, like you predisposed to it? No clue. Oddly my younger brother got it at 8yrs old too so I keep telling him it is going to happen again when he is 29 lol. \n\nThe first 2 times it was my left side and this last time it was my right. And I am still recovering\u2026smile and pucker still not coming back. Your smile and pucker from the Feb 2021 episode I assume? Did you recover fully, or mostly, from the previous episodes? oh wow!\n\nwas it on the same side or did it switch? oh wow!!\n\nthat is really intriguing i did. but my episodes happened in 2014 and 2015 Yes from my 2021 episode. I fully recovered from my other two episodes.", "\u201cAcute\u201d Bells Palsy (?) I (24F) have not been diagnosed yet, it is been 4 days and I do not see an urgency due to the covid stuff. To start at the beginning, prior to 4 days ago, the roots of my hair were hurting from my hair being in a bun too long. I thought nothing of it bc It is normal and usually goes away after an hour or two. It went on for 4 days and then on the 4th day I woke up to the left side of my face being slightly weak (cannot scrunch left side, left eye is slow to close, but does close, and left side of lip weak). The day after, one spot on the left side of my tongue had a different taste when drinking. Now my face has been weak for 4 days total. 2 days ago my hair stopped hurting and yesterday my tongue went back to normal. Hoping in another few days/weeks Ill be back.  Been taking Tylenol, warm compress, and lubricating eye drops for when my eye got dry. \n\nI am curious to what started this? (If anything)\nDid my nerves freak out bc of my achy hair/roots? I do not know, but now you got me kind of nervous. I have been getting mild, brief aches behind the ear again and it happens when I have my hair up and a headset on that ear. The cause isnt known. Its not well researched. I was told that my case could have been caused by the herpes simplex virus getting into my brain stem. Others have been told its due to some trauma from sports/working out. Others, its due to pregnancy. Its all total speculation. \n\nYou should go see a doctor though to get on steroids and antivirals. They may also request an MRI just to be safe. Treatment within the first 24-48 hours is pretty important. Thanks for the reply! I have been gaining movement everyday, and the taste thing is gone. I have spoken with a family doc. Lucky it is been so minor. Thanks again.", "Bell's Palsy Taping Eye  I remember those days. I can hear it in your voice you are hurting inside the way I was. Do not give up, its only temporary. If you have any questions or just want to talk to someone that is been through it let me know! Thank you so much for commenting. I have been hurting for a long time, Bell's Palsy is helping me let go of a lot of anger and hurt that I have built up over the years. I would love to chat with you and hear about your story, and curious about what you did to help with recovery. I also was wondering if you shredded emotional pain? Man I remember when I had bp, I was hurting every morning cus I did not know to tape my eye =(", "Did not Expect This Well, last Friday I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy at the ER. I had been to the ER earlier that week for a high fever and severe headache, and then later in the week the bells palsy. They still are not sure what triggered the bells palsy, possible Lyme disease? Still waiting on those results.\n\nAnyway, I have gotten used to the eye not closing, sometimes my left eye will get irritated from it getting dry, but other than that, I am somewhat used to the eye thing. My problem arises when it comes to eating and drinking. It feels impossible to eat or drink, when I drink I have to like hold the left side of my mouth shut so that my water does not just fall out of my mouth. Eating has been frustrating too, not to mention my tastebuds have been off. Has anyone found anything that helps with these things?\n\nThe somewhat positive is, since everyone is wearing masks out and about, it is harder to tell half my face is paralyzed when it is covered by a mask :P It is still pretty obvious, but at least when I talk nobody can tell, except from my eyes.  I have the same problem with eating, if i learned anything it us to take smaller bites of food and using smaller spoons but the drinking is hard i try to angle the cup on the good side and slowly poor water in my mouth lol also drinking out of bottles help with me angling liquids in there i just wouldnt drink anything too hot or cold Straws. Straws are the answer. Doesnt matter what the straw is made of. Get one and then try drinking. Life changing moment lol. I still can only use water bottles with straws and I have just recently started cups with no straws and I am 4 years out with the 5% of no recovery lol. Who cares what looks you get from people. \n\nAlso, Lyme can be a false reading when it comes back. May require another test a few months down the line. \n\nStay away from electric stimulation therapy. If you want it, do your research prior. My neuro agrees with me that it did more harm than good for me.", "Progress w/ raised eyebrows. top pic was right after I was diagnosed. It is so cool to be able to see by my forehead wrinkling the progress of where I am regaining movement. Going on week 6 now.  Also please excuse my eyebrows. Makeup has not been a priority while I have been stuck at home all day. I promise I usually fill them in! Lol", "Eye taped shut all day? I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy yesterday morning and, like many of us, I cannot blink or shut my eye at all unless I hold it or tape it. Is it bad for me to tape it shut all/most of the day? I am using lubricating drops but my eye gets sore-feeling and I am much more comfortable if it is taped. Would there be any long-term ramifications of this? Do not think so. Not much different than people wearing eye patches for short term protection after eye surgeries. Ok thanks! I personally just used drops during the day and tape at night m, but I do not see why it would be bad to wear the tape all day... Was your eye comfortable with just the drops? Yes. My eye was only really bad for the first few days before my medication started working. I put them in a lot though, like at least 5 times a day, I was paranoid about it drying out. It is been 5 weeks now and my fave is pretty much back to normal now. I can notice a slight difference but nobody else can. Thank you, this is reassuring. I am hoping I will recover quickly also. Best of luck to you! I have been unlucky in that I have very little, or no, recovery in over 7 weeks.  However, I HAVE been lucky that my eye appears to stay shut so long as I keep the other one closed. So sleeping has not been TOO awful.\n\nI cannot tape the eyelid shut.  It tears at my eyelashes and it just feels supremely uncomfortable. So, instead, I just put a boatload of drops in and \"blink\" with my fintertips when I need/remember. I will wear an eye patch outdoors or in dusty/drafty building. It is so interesting how people have such different experiences! I feel so much more comfortable with my eye taped, whereas you are better with the drops. Can I ask the brand you use? I have been using TheraTears-Extra.  And also Blink GelTears. I think I like the Blink better. Thank you! I will look into those brands. Sorry your recovery has not been faster, wishing you the best. Head's up: they are both rather expensive (at least compared to the regular store-brand Visene I would buy like once a year for random eye irritation).  TheraTears is close to $13 at my store, and Blink GelTears are more like $11.  The TheraTears have a coupon inside the box for $1 off your next one, though. Not at all - it is the best thing you can do. Good to know! I am currently using GenTeal tears gel, I think that was $9 or so. It might be worth the extra few dollars to try other brands to see if it helps. All day for me. It sucks", "The real perfection is imperfection Understand this first, you are not alone. I am with you, we all are with you. And we all love you. This happening was not in your hand, so do not stress much about it. Understand this, the doctors have done good research and it is because of the medicines we have improved. there are things which are not in their hand (at least at this moment). So there are things, we should be in charge of - and that is the facial exercise. Do whatever your doctor tells you to do ? If you do not know what to do, just research internet and see what others are doing. That is the only thing we should never forget until we look fine. Understand this, the real beauty is inside you , it is not your skin, the way you look. You on the core are much more than this physical self. And just keep going, everything find its way and you will be all right. We all are together. I needed this.

I have had Bell\u2019s palsy previously in 2015 and I am really wanting to get my Pfizer covid vaccine but I am just scared to\u2026 I have almost decided to just walk in this afternoon to do it. I cannot get the picture out of my head of dying alone intubated in a hospital. It is worrying me!! I really want to get it but what if I get BP?! I am getting married in October \ud83d\ude2d    I have already read all of the vaers and things but I have diabetes and I am overweight so I am scared I will die from covid. Even when I get bronchitis it takes me down. I had Bell\u2019s palsy in 2019 and have had zero side effects from Pfizer vaccine I had Bells in September of 2020, and got vaccinated in April with no issues.  Please get your vax.  I had the moderna in February-March. BP came along in July. I do not think that they are related at all. Yes, it happens, but it is SO rare. \n\nWe have had dear friends die of Covid. Even if I did attribute my BP to the vaccine, I would still get it. I had bells and gave it a miss I actually had covid a few weeks ago so will not be getting it now I had Bells Palsy in 2018, got the Pfizer vax in May/June, and have had 0 side effects, aside from mildly sore arm for a few hours after shot. Please do not pay attention to the posts of \"got vaccinated, got BP, not getting my second shot\". The clinical evidence linking BP to a vaccine side effect is so low. It is better to be safe than sorry and do what is right for you. I see in another comment that you are diabetic which puts you at a higher risk to catch COVID. Diabetes makes you immunocompromised. Please get vaccinated. BP be damned. Living to see your wedding and all of the life yet to live after you get married is more important than catching COVID and being on a vent alone in a hospital. Do it for your life. Do it for the memories you have yet to make. Do it for your future spouse.  I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy at the end of June of this year. I fully recovered 6 weeks later. I had my first dose of pfizer last week and zero side effects so far.\n\nI would rather have a bout of temporary BP though than long term health issues or even potentially dying from Covid. I had Bell\u2019s palsy in May 2019 that still is not completely gone, and I had no issues with my Pfizer vaccines. Even if you get bell\u2019s again, it is better than being dead from Covid. Not to sound like an ass, but it sounds like you are weighing a reasonable risk of unpleasant death against a lower probability of inconvenience (yes, BP sucks, I know, I am still dealing with stuff nearly a year later\u2026 but it is not death). I am not sure how your upcoming wedding is relevant to you (I.e. greater exposure risk from people attending the event?  Not wanting to have BP for the pictures?), but I do not think it favors the not getting the shot side of the equation. From an objective risk assessment standpoint it seems fairly clear which is the less risky choice. Even more so if you think about the potential impact to your future spouse. \n\nThat is said, you are still hesitant. So either you are you have a vastly different pictures of probabilities, a vastly different perception of consequence, or there is some other reasons affecting your analysis. If you are introspective enough, figuring out which it is will help you (and others) be comfortable with the right choice for you. \n\nGood luck with your wedding, I hope it is a wonderful event.  Stay safe (yes, this is me saying go get the shot\u2026 and all the other stuff you can do to be safe).", "Pain behind left ear ten days after diagnosis ? I was diagnosed ten days ago with BP; no pain or discomfort at onset, or not noticed when I tried to brush my teeth in the evening and noticed my dropping smile in the mirror. I went to the ER that night and was prescribed 60 mg of Prednisone for 5 days, and then tapering off 10 mg for the next five days. I finished my medication yesterday; and did not really have any pain the last ten days. \n\nThe last five days I have felt very dizzy; I assumed it might be the meds; but the dizziness is getting worse now? I also have excruciating stabbing pain behind my left ear; is this normal at ten days after diagnosis? \n\nI want to believe that I am getting better; but with increased pain and dizziness it feels like I am getting worse? \n\nVery thankful if anyone can tell me if they experienced similar symptoms at day 10 after diagnosis? It is normal. My pain started after 7 days and lasted around 6-7days Thanks for the encouragement; was really worried that I was getting worse instead of better. You are welcome. Also, BP is not the end of the world. improvement speed depends on severity. I started noticing a change at 3 weeks. Do facial exercises and massages. Good luck! I had really bad pain behind and around whole ear area about ten days after diagnoses. I treated it with Panadol and heat packs and it was gone in about two weeks. Sorry you are in pain, BP sucks Your pain behind the ear lasted ten days, from day 10 until day 20 ? It lasted about a week and a half is what I meant. It was bad a t first and then tapered off and way gone in about ten days I did not have any pain for the first week; now into my second week really bad behind the ear pain and lots of dizziness. The pain is normal. Dont worry too much for BP. Unfortunately I did not know this community existed when i had it and was stressed out a lot since I had no information about past experiences from other people. I experienced this too! even a brief bit of vertigo. \nthe pain subsided after a week as many have said! I had no pain at first; it was not until after I started recovering that I developed pain behind my ear that lasted for a week or so. It went away and then came back after I was mostly recovered, lasted a few day and went away again. But it is continued to recur every so often ever since.\n\nEven now some 15+ years later I still occasionally get that same pain behind that same ear, usually it is an indication that I am coming down with a cold or that I am under too much stress or not sleeping enough.\n\nI have also found that massaging the area behind and around the ear while gently moving the ear around will help make the pain go away almost every time, at least now that my BP is cleared up, although I never tried it early on so I cannot say whether it would be effective right now for you. I would try and talk to a different doctor to check if you actually have Ramsey Hunt syndrome. Some speculate around 20% of facial palsy cases are actually RHS. Vertigo is a big symptom, and not everyone presents a rash or even vesicles around the ear. \n\nI was misdiagnosed with BP, and as such was not given the antivirals RHS should be treated with early on. Almost immediately after coming off the steroids I had a 2 nights of intense pain, screaming pain behind my left ear, and now nearly 2 months in I still have 0% back and am v concerned. Cannot get an MRI l due to coronavirus taking over. Yes, I am on a waiting list for an MRI as well. I had similar pain about a week after onset.  I had only had one course of steroids so doc started me on second course.  \nThe pain subsided after a day or so and i only get occasional discomfort now, I just use panadol.\nI hope you come good soon. Best of luck. Thanks, I appreciate everyone is support and sharing your recovery stories. Taking extra strength Tylenol which is dealing with about 90% of the pain behind my left ear; still a little dizzy when walking around the house...hoping for recovery to pick up as I will be two weeks since onset on Monday; will try to remain patient. I am glad I found your post. I have had BP for 2 weeks now and the pain started a week ago. It is more intense now to the point where I cannot sleep at night. I have been taking ibuprofen and it is helped some. I cannot wait for the pain to pass. I can deal with the facial paralysis. The ear pain is the worst part for me I found that Tramadol was the best for the headache and pain behind the ear. It is brutally painful; I am on day 17 now and the pain just started to subside a little yesterday. I also found that heat works well to ease the headache pain, if you have one of those bean bags that you heat up in the microwave, that works well to put directly onto the painful area. Laying down and being still also helped me when the pain became very intense.\nGoing for a CT scan today.\n\n I can open and close my left eye now; and my eyebrow movement is starting to comeback a little bit....not much success for my smile to come back yet.\n\nHang in there; this BP thing really sucks. Just a short update; CT scan came back normal. Started physiotherapy today with ultrasound to decompress the cranial nerve; and then 30 minutes of electrical pulses to stimulate my facial muscles. Notice small improvements already; will go to physiotherapy twice a week for the next 2-3 weeks. When the therapist applied pressure to the cranial nerve before the treatment it was very painful; after the treatment the pain was gone.\n\nGood luck to everyone struggling to get back to normal. Just a quick update; I have recovered significantly, probably to about 80%, my affected eye still leaks a little bit...but only when I am looking directly down.\n\nEverybody hang in there; it just seems to take time for the body to heal and rebuild all the nerve pathways.", "Prescribed a muscle relaxant instead of prednisone. Has baclofen worked for anyone? ", "Diagnosed Yesterday!! Long story short, woke up thinking I was having a stroke and went to the ER as all the stroke informations tells you to. Diagnosed with Bells Palsy and prescribed prednisone and valacyclovir. Wife say my face is pulling to the right more than yesterday. My question is it normal for my face to be twitchy like right under my eye, above my lip and in my chin, I can also feel like random small contractions of my facial muscles though my wife says she sees nothing.  All sorts of weird stuff will happen. My symptoms got worse before they got better. Be prepared to deal with it for a few months. I could not talk without a lisp, could not eat without biting my lips, close my eye or raise an eyebrow. It took about 6 months but I am feeling better now. \n\nI work in sales and had to tell people I had some dental work issues =) No one seemed to care and the people I did talk to about BP, either had it themselves or knew people who had. It is not too big of a deal.\n\nI am still dealing with a watery left eye though. Every time I eat. It is really weird.   I had BP last fall. Took about 4 to 6 weeks to clear up. It was barely noticeable after the 4th week. Just give it time work with your doctor. Stay away from acupuncture , total scam and does nothing to really help. Ok I am hoping for a quick recovery, along with the lisp drinking anything seems to be a chore as well and eating has been a little weird especially if anything goes on the left side of my mouth. I have no intention on doing accupuncture as I hate needles. \n Yeah I have every symptom you listed. The watery eye just seems to come and go. I have to manually shut my eye so it does not dry out but then all the sudden for a period of time my eye will just remain watery.  I am sorry that you have joined our club...but we got your back. \n\nI have had it twice...17 years ago when I was 30 and in good shape (two weeks, 100% recovery) and then two years ago at 46 and overweight and and I am *mostly* recovered. I still have mild synkinesis and overall I am \"passable\" but I can certainly feel that things are not right \"under the hood\" so to speak. I was \"passable\" for recovery at about six months, but saw minor improvements until I hit the one year mark. \n\nIn the beginning while I was on steroids I noticed all kinds of muscle twitches and movements, some visible, some not. I think that is very common. My face was all over the place while on meds, then for about a month afterwards I feel like it went dead, and then the recovery started, slowly but surely. I used to guess it at about a 1% improvement every few days or a week. I hope you recover fast but the stupid thing about this illness is that everyone is different and recovery times and percentages vary wildly. I would guess that the  younger a person is (along with being in better shape) the recovery time would be faster, but this condition is not very predictable.  Yeah I just turned 35 two weeks before diagnosis, so I guess happy birthday to me \ud83d\ude01. I would not say I am unhealthy but not as healthy as I could be. I am hoping for a relatively quick turnaround. ", "I have a job interview &amp; my face is not ready! \ud83d\ude1c I am into my Bell's Palsy and not fully recovered. Making progress but it is going very slowly.\n\nHere is my issue. I have an important job interview **over Zoom** coming up and I am worried about how I look. My eye is still droopy. I cannot smile with teeth showing. I can do a lopsided smile with my lips closed. My mouth is crooked when I laugh. Worst of all my affected eye squints when I talk while my good eye gets bigger.\n\nThis emoji is me: \ud83d\ude1c\n\nShould I say something at the start of the interview? Part of me does not want to because this is personal and private even if it is obviously on my face.\n\nIf I do not say anything, do I hurt my chances because I look like a weirdo?\n\nI am practicing speaking in front of a mirror and controlling my eyes but it makes me look stiff, like I am not engaging.\n\nHow about if I introduce myself at the start, say something about my condition and ask if we can turn off cameras?\n\nI am confident in every possible way going into the interview because I know I am qualified, a stellar candidate, experienced, etc. etc. The only thing dimming my confidence is my face. I would totally say that vaccine brought on this temporary inconvenience and you will be good in no time. But instead of asking them at the time interview commences why do not you email them ahead of time and just explain so that they do not expect a video interview? Tell them at the start of the interview. It will probably hurt your chances, even if they do not mean too not choose you because of this, it will be unconscious. If you are able to own it confidently, I would just say something about having Bell\u2019s palsy- a lot of people will have some questions so it may even be a bit of an icebreaker- and then proceed with the interview. You can also take a moment to set up the best lighting to show your face before the interview too. \n\nIf you are confident in every other way, let that shine through. I am at a similar point in the way my face looks and most people tell me they honestly do not notice. It could be that they are just being nice - but then at least I know that most people are nice - and if you are going into a job interview that is good news either way :) \n\nGood luck! I am seriously considering saying something at the start of the interview. I think it will make the interviewer look at my face more closely when I speak. But at least they will know the reason why my face is moves strangely. I will give some serious consideration to emailing them ahead of time but continuing to go on camera. \n\nMy BP is not related to the vaccine though. I am not going to make up a story that it is. Seriously considering saying something rather than not mentioning it. I think if you do not mention it, it is just going to be distracting for them, just thinking about why you cannot smile all of the way, or why you just look off Exactly. Better to own it rather than leave them wondering. Maybe they will not even listen to what I am saying because they are staring at my half-closed eye. I also recommend informing them in advance. Maybe they will set up the interview in a different form? It would definitely prepare them in advance instead of getting caught by surprise. Best of luck. I am sure they will see past your disability and give you the job. \ud83d\udc4d It totally hurt my chances because the first question they asked me was how long I was off work (totally illegal) and it was a billion dollar financial company, which sucked even more. I did answer truthfully and said I was unable to perform my duties for about 3 weeks. Sadly after that that answer it all went down hill as they seemed uninterested. I had Masters and 8 plus years of experience for the role. \ud83d\ude2d Well I would definitely mention it to them. Not sure what kind of a job it is, but technically it is a disability and I think it is best to let them know.\n\nAlso a thought someone that does not know might think you are having a stroke and ask you if you are OK anyways. ;-) I would suggest mentioning it at the start. Not only does it eliminate any uncertainty they have about any strange facial behaviour, it also shows you address matters head on.\n\nI am not fully recovered and had a job interview a few weeks ago and had similar concerns to you. Not only did I get offered the job, the director called to tell me it was the best interview they had experienced in over a year. I start the job next week!\n\nAll the best with it, mate! Thinking about this also. The company is very progressive and already asked if I need any accommodation. Congratulations on your new job! Thanks for the advice. I hope I also get a favorable result like you. Sorry to hear that. I did not take any time off during the onset of my BP. I did not know any better. Looking back I could have taken a few sick days when everything was hurting. Mention it at the start of the interview and mention it is temporary and most people recover within 3 months. You are upfront about it, address any weirdness and alleviates their concerns that this is permanent or may impact your work in some way like having to take time off. Not sure what type of industry or size of company but I would probably crack a joke at the end of the interview about it if it feels natural. \n\nThe fact that you did not take time off is a selling point you should make or at least about your adaptability to ANY adversity or difficult situation - standard interview question. \n\nI would keep the video on but play with the lighting and camera angles before your interview to find one works for you. \n\nI too had an interview when I was halfway in my recovery. I may or may not have used highlighter and bronzer to try to balance out by brows and lips. \ud83d\ude1c\n\nGood luck and knock their socks off with your skills! Ya, own it.  I do a lot of zoom meetings with potential clients, and it is one of the first things I say.  \"I have bells palsy right now, so half of my face is paralyzed.  Certain words may sound muddled, so if you do not understand something, let me know and I will rephrase.\" I started practicing my intro. I think if I own it, I will genuinely feel confident about it. Thanks! Great advice! I am leaning this way. Thank you! I am in the same boat regarding interviews. Just mention it at the beginning without lamenting or ranting about it. Say you have it and are in recovery. If you try to hide it they will wonder why one eye blinks and the other does not. Many people are compassionate. Hang in there. Honesty is best.", "Mom has BP 8 years in December Mom never fully recovered, she is about 80 percent but when first got it , it seemed to be recovering normally but stopped. Lost her self esteem as she has always been very above average in looks. Now she does not try to smile at all. She no longer works outside the home since she was in the public eye in her previous work. Eye doctor now says she should not have used eye patch.  Another says a fCe lift would help with the smile , but insurance does not deem it necessary.\nIt has totally devastated her. I got BP my freshmen year of high school and it only recovered about 85%. Long story short it was AWFUL. I had major self esteem issues. I had to move forward with life and ending up dating a lot of beautiful girls. You just to have to own it.\n\nIs she a nice person she will be bale to find someone on a dating app. Help her out with that part. I got BP when I was 14, and figured it had fully recovered when the patch came off. I was never self conscious about it, being completely unaware, until I was 18 and a guy at work mocked my smile. I have tried avoiding smiling, but it is a natural habit, esp as a giggly girl. Nonetheless, I am v unfortunate looking, yet still have had guys like me with my wonky smile and inability to open my eye properly on instances. I hope your mum can come to realise there is more to her than just her looks She is a very nice person with a great sense of humor.She makes people laugh but feels so self conscious to laugh with them. We all tell her she is still beautiful Oh Mom was never really vain, but she was the kind of lady that turned heads and I always heard wow, your Mom is so pretty. She is very funny and smart , but it has changed her . Because she got it older , the one side of her face has more lines than the paralysis side , like to compensate. Oh sorry did not mean to imply my last sentence as vain, I just meant I hope she can see that people will love and accept her for who she is haha, but agh I can understand why she is self conscious :(", "What was recovery like? I was diagnosed and treated 4 days ago.  I cant live like this and I am taking it pretty hard. My eye has gotten worse but I am feeling twitching in cetrian facial muscles and was wondering what some signs of recovery were for everyone.  Did you wake up and everything was fine one day or did muscles start twitching or coming back slowly? \n\nSorry, my writing is frantic because I am just in a panic. Hi!  Do not panic.  I know its really scary.  What sucks is that everyone is recovery looks different so be careful about how much you read on here because some of the posts can be more disheartening that hopeful.\n\nMine slowly got better over time.  The first signs I noticed was that the pain lessened and the pressure in my ears stopped.  Slowly I got more movement in my affected side.\n\nMake sure you are on strong dose of anti virals and steroids.  Follow up with your doctor regularly.  Hang in there!  \ud83d\udc95 I am about 9 weeks post diagnosis with no real recovery.  I actually DO think I am getting better, it is just so slow, it is very hard to tell.\n\nSInce I was diagnosed, I have seen at least three people post on here that they recovered in less than a month or so, so keep your chin up! Odds are you will be better in no time. My first sign of recovery was twitching. I am recovered 100% now. Took about 4 weeks for me. \n\nI know it is scary I was freaking out basically everyday. It is going to be okay. Specific healing timeline will be a little different for everyone. It does get worse in the first few days or so after onset, that is normal. It freaked me right out because I asked at the hospital if it would get worse before getting better and they said no \ud83d\ude44. At first I thought \"it is just a weird nerve thing, I am going to go on with my days as usual\", but honestly after a few days it hit me like a ton of bricks. It really felt like I had mono for nearly two weeks (mono/EBV is related to BP). It was no fun, if I were not a sahm I would have used up a lot of sick time. Twitches are a good sign, it is the nerves coming back. I saw pretty much no improvement for 3 weeks, I think 2 weeks might be average. After that it is slow improvement, a little better every day. It was probably barely noticeable to others by week 4-5 for me. I want to say it was 8-10 weeks from onset to feeling fully recovered. Again, it is a little different for everyone. Rest as much as you can and take care as well as you can. There are Facebook groups that are more active if you feel like you need more support. Thank you so much for theresponse.  I was on prednisone and antivirals almost immediately. Thank you for your response. I wish you the most heartfelt best of luck. I just dont know how I can live like this for months.  My face started to twitch so I hoped it was a good sign but still no movement at all. Thank you so much for your response. I dont know how long I can do this for and I am just terrified this is my life forever as I have other risk factors like diabetes and high blood pressure.  The only thing keeping me off the deep end atm is my infant son. I just went through this last month. On day eight I started being able to close my left eye a little. I was completely well by day 15. I took antivirals and steroids from my doctor for 9 days. Used a liquid CBD oil and, liquid B vitamin complex daily. I feel like it helped but I cannot really prove it. \n\nNot going to lie it sucks. I cried A LOT. Kept telling myself it is better than having cancer or being dead...but it still was awful. \n\nMy doctor said everyone she had seen that had BP made a full recovery. My progress was slow night over night. \n\nDone people say acupuncture helps but I did not end up getting that. \n\nSorry your going trough this. I wish you a fast recovery. Stay strong (easier said than done I know) I know it seems tough at first, but chances are good that you will be on the mend soon enough. It will be slow, so do not expect a perfect recovery overnight. It sounds like you are stressing about this quite a bit, so try to seek out whatever method will work for you to calm down and release the stress. Get professional help if you feel like you are not able to get on top of it. In the end, it is primarily cosmetic as far as medical conditions go...so take comfort in that fact. As I hear man BP-sufferers say...\"At least it is not a stroke!\"\n\nYou are still you and you have got that son that needs you. You have got this! Oh hon, sending you hugs. I think the fact that you got on the meds right away and are getting some twitching already sounds promising for a speedy recovery. Try not to stress too much, it will not help and this is out of your control. I had my BP episode a few days after my son's first birthday. You are going to be okay, mama! Accept all the support you can get from family, friends, and communities like this. You are going to get through this, it is temporary! This is really good, docs say that recovery very much depends on how quick you are diagnosed and start the meds. I got BP April 20 this year and my face is nearly 90% back now. I was on high dose of methylprednisolone, it is a bit stronger than prednisone, and has lots of other side effects just like the latter. \n\nJust heads up, talk to your doc on how to prevent them \u2014 for example, my doc told me to take vitamin D and calcium, take stomach protection pills, zinc etc; you might also get mood swings, feel very energized or low, it is all effect of the medication.\n\nMy eye was affected really badly, by that I mean I could not blink it, eye lid was low, I could not close it properly, had blurry vision and it is still the last one to recover. Make sure you keep the eye on the affected side well hydrated. My eye doc prescribed me sodium hyaluronate eye drops and an ointment for night time. And I had to plaster my eye at night and when working on my laptop. Twitching sensation is actually a good sign, it is the nerve moving, or so I was told :)\n\nAs for recovery, it has been very gradual in my case. It is been 40 days into BP now, I started noticing some movement coming back in the affected side on day 10, it was a very minor change but vs complete paralysis it made me ecstatic :D In about 20 days I was able to whistle. And a couple of days ago I was able to close my left eye independently from the right one. Around day 35 the affected side stopped feeling painful. But overall I would say it is been very gradual. For me it feels painstakingly slow but I know it takes a lot longer for some people to see any change. It might help you put your mind at rest if you video your progress, say 1 video in 3 days. \n\nAlso do facial exercises as often as possible, chew gum on the affected side, try to blow a balloon. It is all said to help. \n\nHope you will recover soon! This will not be your life forever but I know the feeling. It is really hard to handle the thought that your face does not fully belong to you. After you come off antivirals your doc might suggest physio therapy too. After the acute stage is over (1 month or so later but talk to your doc) you might try acupuncture too.\n\nAlso what I found really helpful was sharing my struggle with my friends on social media. Many have actually encountered BP, and some might have good contacts. Twitching is a good sign. I wad diagnosed last year and it took about 4 or 5 months for recovery. I felt very little for the first month. \n\nAfter that I started to have random twitching and progressive recovery that was visable week to week. \n\nIf you can make sure you keep up on any meds. I got a mild steroid that was very affordable with no insurance.\n\nIts frustrating, espically in the beginning while its at its worst. But recovery is common in the majority of cases from what my doctor told me. \n\nYour brain controls your body, and keeping the lumpy grey biocomputer in good shape will help recovery.", "Diagnosed with Bell's Palsey a few days ago So I did not even know this was a thing my mom thought I had a brain tumor and wanted me to get an MRI. Luckily I talked to a guy I work with and he said his cousin had something called Bell's Palsey and the symptoms seemed similar. Well that was a huge relief. I got a catscan just to make my mom happy, and that came back just fine. My honest theory is that this crap is caused from tension and stress. I work in Information Technology and deal with a lot of stress and sitting in front of a computer. Since there is a nerve messed up on the same side of my body that I have a lot of tension would not that make sense that is how it started? IDK and apparently doctors do not either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got prescribed with the steroids and anti-virals. Resting and taking meds as prescribed hoping for a fast recovery. I have read on here that some people say CBD oil helps, is that true? Also seen some folks say to stay away from caffeine which I just do not think I can do. Really hoping for a full recovery, this is such a weird thing.  Welcome to the club. Every case is so different. Some people see full recovery rather quickly, and then there is those of us who do not see any recovery after years. Listen to your doctors and do your best. Just stay away from Electric Stimulation Therapy- it makes things worse. Thank you for your reply. Thanks for the advise on the electric therapy. Yes, welcomed to the funny face gang.  Hope you make a quick and full recovery.  Yes stress can be a factor. Rest up and let your body do its work. If you can stay off work for a couple of weeks then I suggest you do.  Unfortunately I do not think I can afford to take that much time off. I could take the coming Monday off but feel bad taking time off.  It is your health, it is one thing if you cannot afford to, another if you feel obliged. You are ill, you body needs to rest. Also steroids can play havoc with your mood so it might be best to see how the effect you. I worked right through but regretted it.  I worked when I had Bells Palsy.  It would have been too stressful for me to miss a lot of work unplanned.  I did cut some days short though.  Laying at home all day thinking of how behind at work I was getting would have just caused me more stress.   It was tension, stress and cold for me (roommate had three fans on and all windowns open every night). I had a 7 days prescriptions same things did not seem like they did much! My first recovery signs started after 2 months or so and it was mainly my entire side twitching or \"vibrating\". Do not strain your face much bu using a straw or forcing movement. Take care of your eye by covering it at night and keeping it hydrated. I am now at 10months and I am 97% recovered. Be strong!! This is one of the shortest but most accurate replies to the complexity that is Bells. I really wish we had more options on it esp for the folks that are not seeing much if any recovery after a long time (&gt; 18mons). There is a doctor in California but I heard he is hard to get an appointment with since hes like the only one in the states.  I think the caffeine advice comes from the steroids - for bells we go on a high dose for a short period, which already messes with your body a lot and can be exacerbated by caffeine. Honestly, personally, the steroids left me so energetic and hopped up I would not have needed coffee for the 2 weeks anyway!  My wife is seeing some excellent Drs at Mass Eye and Ear (Harvard teaching hospital, Boston) including having done decompression surgery: \n\nUnfortunately, as I mentioned has not helped any yet, on month 11 now :-/ She is amazing though handling it so well, so much better than I would, keeping up with physio etc. \n\nHow about you? I have seen two neurologists and both agree there isnt anything they can do to help me. Both from well known hospitals in the area. I have done electric stimulation therapy which did more harm than good so my chances are pretty slim. Im going on year 3 in February so at this point, ive just accepted my fate and go about life. There is nothing that can be done for me.  I took Monday off and will return to work Wednesday. I sit behind a desk and will just try and keep my stress low. Hmm, I see - thanks for sharing. I am sorry, I hope maybe somehow, maybe when it is least expected you may get improvement. We clearly do not understand facial nerves very well, even the 'experts'. One last Q if you do not mind - was there any element of air blowing continuously for an extended period of time on your face?  In my wife's case, she was on a long flight (to Asia) on the window seat with a large person in the middle seat who had body odor - she squeezed up to the side to give him space and turned on the overhead air directed at her face and went to sleep (many hours). When she woke up it was the start of her feeling numbness on the right side of her face.  Most Drs we have talked to do not think much of this, several physio people I talked to do say they see high incidences/variations of the air-on-face-for-a-long time. Nope. I was at the gym working out when my started onset- did not think much of it at all. Mine started with constant full facial twitching on the effected side for about two days. It was annoying but did not think anything of it. Woke up one morning for school, looked in the mirror, called my mom to come look at me since I had a noticeable droop. Our first thought was stroke because a healthy 22 year old should not have this going on. Went to the Dentist first to rule out any dental issue effecting a nerve, then to urgent care. Urgent care wanted to send me via ambulance to the ER but my mom elected to drive me. The ER doc and the neurologist on call said it was idiopathic but most likely caused by the common cold virus (herpes simplex virus) attacking my brain stem but they were not positive about that. The droop comes back and is more apparent when I am tired, stressed out, sick, or cold. I get cold easily because I also have anemia. Both of my neuros gave up on my case because I was not making any improvement and I had to beg my PT to discharge me because the electric stimulation was too painful to be getting done 3 x a week an hour at a time. The only thing I could think with blowing air is that being cold makes the muscles stiffer which can effect the way muscles and nerves perform- think about it like sticking your hands in cold running water and after awhile you cannot feel anything anymore because your nerves are too cold to function properly. Interesting story, thanks for telling. Not bad first call on the dentist! Drs saying idiopathic is such a cop out, but there are things we still do not understand, still, always good to have a fancy word to describe tho (from the Greek of course) :-/  Presumably you got the standard prednisone course w/in 48 hours or so.  Like the cold hand analogy. Numbers vary but seems to be something like ( affected a year by Bells (in the US alone), wish it got more attention.  Hit with BP in Nov 2014 which probably reslulted from the stress of being laid off, combined with the resultant tooth grinding that ended up damaging the myalin sheath of nerves allowing the dormant virus from chicken pox to damage the nerve line to the left side of my face. I got a bit back but its not that big of a deal at 49 years of age, just another interesting character attribute. \n\nI use CBD oil but for stress and anxiety. I have noticed not alteration in my BP from the CBD use but again, the stress it causes is diminished by the oil. \n\nHope you get full recovery but if not know that using glasses that have rounded square corners (like the ones you often get free with liquor sets) really makes it easier to drink if you dont get return of mouth sensitivity on that side. Also it effected my tongue as well and I always taste salt on my left side so when food tastes bland or crappy I push it to the left side and viola.. tastes better. Not only that but if you have diminished eyelid movement you can always look at people, pull down on the lid and say \"say that to my dead eye\" and just come off as creepy/scary LOL. \n\nCaffine, I do not avoid it at all and after the initial return of some nerve funciton I have not noticed caffine having any effect (good or bad) on my BP (I slam two cups with ice each morning) so drink up.", "Newly diagnosed, asking for some advice I was struck with Bell's Palsy this weekend.  I think I caught it fast (Saturday evening I had swelling in my lip, Sunday morning my face would not move, by Sunday afternoon I had a diagnosis), and I am on steroids and an antiviral.  I have pretty much no movement on the right side of my face except that I can close my eye if I try to shut both of them (trying to shut just the right fails).\n\nI have a couple questions I was hoping people could help with.\n\n1)How do you drink?  When I try to drink from a glass, I spill.  Trying to drink from a can it just does not work right.  I have ended up more or less pouring in liquids, but that sometimes ends with me getting liquid to my windpipe and coughing it up.\n\n2)How do you eat?  If food stays on my left side I am good, but if food gets to the right it gets stuck there and hard to swallow.\n\n3)Anyone know when to start trying to exercise facial muscles?  Immediately?  In a week or two when I know the attack is over?  Something else?\n\n4)I went to 9 years of speech therapy as a child.  Having this knock out my ability to speak clearly overnight is a mental blow.  How do you deal with this?\n\n5)How do you adjust how you speak to deal with this?  I am particularly slurring s and th sounds.  Apparently I need more resistance to the air being pushed out to do them properly. Hi.\n\nTo clear it up you do not \"catch\" bells palsy. The nerve which carries the signal has been damaged or inflamed. The cause is relatively unknown, but could be due to a virus.\n\nI started dry needling and facial exercises within the first week, and steroids after 3 days.\n\nA straw will be very helpful for drinking\n\nCannot comment on eating as my case was not as bad as yours sounds.\n\nI was open with people as to why I was slurring a little and why I could not blink properly and they understood I was unwell. Do not be ashamed of it, you end up making it worse for yourself. Hey! \nSo when I got Bell\u2019s Palsy it really affected how I ate. What I found that helped me was drinking out of a straw when it came to liquids. \n\nWhen it came to eating I just chewed on the side that was not affected by it. It is best to start facial exercises as soon as possible even if you are not seeing any movement. \n\nYou want to try and keep those nerves active. When it comes to the mental blow Bell\u2019s Palsy takes its hard, but you just have to remind yourself that you will get better. \n\nHopefully this helps and I wish you all the best in your recovery. I third a straw.  It was the only way I could drink for months.\n\nFirst off - do not panic.  I know getting Bells can be scary, but for the vast majority of people it heals with time.  Stressing yourself out is not going to help.  I know it sucks, but be kind to yourself.  Lots of sleep, and anything you can do to pamper yourself. \n\nFor eating, I had to slow down and be more careful so I did not bite my cheek on the paralyzed side.  I was able to eat normally, but maybe oatmeal or less chewy foods could work until you get the hang of it.  I was hugely embarrassed at the beginning as I tended to dribble on my paralyzed side, but it got better with practice.  Once I got the drinking with a straw down, I did lots of shakes.\n\nIt is ok to slur your words for a while.\n\nFinally, I think for me the biggest help was just how common Bells is, even though I had not heard of it.  I watched a lot of youtube videos. There are tons out there from clinics and doctors, and how to tape your eye shut.  But what helped the most is the people who documented their journey, and seeing their gradual recovery calmed me some. I offer some of my favorites if you want: ( , (  There are many many others - you are not alone. 1. Straw. try to angle it so it is in your healthy side, since your afflicted side will have trouble closing around the straw, and you might spill.\n2. I mostly chewed my food in my healthy side, but that was also because I had lost taste in the afflicted side (if that has not happened to you, it might still happen, but you might also not experience loss of taste at all if you are lucky. Taste returned within 10 days or so for me I think.)\n3. I started the day of my diagnosis. That is what my doctor advised me to do, and I have made a full recovery with no side effects. Some people say it is better to wait though. If you are not sure, then at least maybe wait a week or 10 days or so, so your inflammation on the nerve has subsided. But for me, starting right away worked fine.\n4. Personally, I just laughed the speech problems off a bit. I thought since it sounded funny, might as well have fun with it myself. I griped to my friends about the fact that Having BP made it hard for me to say words with the letters B and P, and stuff like that. Made up some tough to say tongue twisters for myself, just to hear how ridiculous it sounded. All in all, even though going through BP was tough, I tried keeping the mentality of \"hey, it could be worse. And even if it does not get better, I will manage\".\n5. If you have a hard time talking, you can try using your fingers to help your mouth out a bit while talking. Just pressing in with your index finger when you want to keep your lips sealed and such. I did this when talking to people over the phone, but mostly did not do it when talking to them face to face.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any other questions, and good luck with your recovery :) 1. Everything I drink is from a straw.  Annoying as hell.\n2. I eat half sized bites.  I find it easier to eat, but it takes longer.  Frequent covering of the mouth so I can use the tongue to move food from the affected cheek where it gathers.\n3. I waited a couple weeks\n4&amp;5. Use alternative words.  There is going to be some words you are going to have trouble with, find different words to say.\n\nI am 5 months in at this point, and have started to see minor healing.  But I still struggle to drink, eat and talk like I did before Bell's.  Be patient with yourself. I had bilateral BP. So I drank with a straw and literally held my lips closed around it. I had no sense of taste at all, and actually lost my appetite, but I ate normal foods and held my mouth closed while chewing (had just had a baby, so bright side - I lost weight quickly!). As for talking, it sucked, so I did texting/emailing when possible. Good luck! I drink best from bottles and cups with thinner rims/smaller openings. I cannot create a seal so straws do not work as well for me. \n\nEating can be difficult, but it takes some trial and error. Smaller bites, different angles. I still chew on both sides; if something gets stuck I just move it with my thumb (from outside my mouth). \n\nI cannot advise on exercises as I have opted not to do them at this time, BUT I do still attempt to do all the things I normally would like smile/blink/facial expressions, etc\n\nWhen it comes to speaking, i just tell people that I am dealing with facial paralysis and they understand. \n\nOverall, try not to stress :)", "One year on About thirteen month ago I was watching telly on the couch and had a strange pain down the side of my neck, never had it before, I put it down to being on the other couch and having to hold my head in a strange way, went to bed and thought nothing of it.\n\nNext morning I had no taste on one side of my tounge. Now this was a familiar sensation and I knew what was coming. I have had BP a few times before and I was ready to crawl into a hole and cry. By evening my face was fully paralysed.\n\nThe first time I had BP it was gone within 2 days, next time 3 days. The longest I had it was 3 weeks. Until now. It was the worst I have ever had it, had to tape my eye shut at night for weeks, could not blink, dribbelt everywhere, you name it. I went back to work after three weeks because I ran out of sick leave, my boss had already given me an extra week. I work in retail, having to talk to people all day long was a nightmare. Having to explain over and over what is wrong with my face. But slowly things improved. So I was told, people got used to it, I did not.\n\nSo one year on, now. I have no muscle control on one side of my lips. It affects my eating, drinking, smiling. I have to hold my mouth shut when rinsing after I brush my teeth. If I try very hard I can whistle very quietly. Never thought I would miss whistling.\nThe other major side effect is the eye watering. Everytime I eat, both my eyes water. The other day we went to a restaurant and the waiter asked how our meals were, I turned to her, tears streaming down my face and said \"it is so delicious\". She must have thought I really loved the food, or that I was crazy.\n\nIn case someone is interested in the treatments I tried: two different pills (cannot remember what they were now, been too long). Acupuncture, heat, massages, exercise. I had to blood tests, MRI, CAT scan. I am healthy, there is nothing wrong with me.\n\nTl;dr: BP sucks, I do not have Aids. My neuro doc told me about the tears. It is called crocodile tears? You are salivating through the eyes I believe. I am so sorry you are still struggling. I am only about 12 days in but I am recovering. I wish you the best.  Haha salivating through the eyes. That sounds funny :)  That is just how the Dr described it to me. I hope it gets better for you.  Hi, I am going on 15 years now. Mine was a slow recovery too, but it does get better with time. I have irreparable eye damage due to sleeping with my right eye drooped open. My smiling muscles contract my eye muscles too as a result of my nerves fusing together during repair. Now when I smile, I either have to scrunch my whole face to make both sides match, or I have a wicked lazy eye. It is almost comical now lol. \n\nI just wanted to say that even though you are 13 months out, that does not mean you will not still see improvement. It is just going to be frustrating how slow it is. The best advice I can give you is to keep exercising the muscles, day in - day out. Make sure you use a mirror to build muscle memory to the \u201cright\u201d poses. \n\nMost of all, acceptance is very important. I now see my Bells Palsy as a very good reason to study neurology, and I am hoping to get into UCLA next year for Computer Science with a Bioinformatics minor. I want to be able to help people with this condition, and that would not have been so if I had a full and \u201ceasy\u201d recovery. I hope you find similar solace, but I know it is hard to turn a curse into a blessing. Stay strong :) Thank you for giving me hope that improvement is still ongoing! I will continue my exercises and have now decided that salivating from my eyes is my secret superpower! Useless, but rare! :) \n\nWell done for making the most out of this and making it your goal to help others with the condition. I live in a smallish town in New Zealand and I feel that there is not much knowledge around it here, my doctor had only ever seen one other case before me. The neurologist at the hospital got a second opinion from another city. I felt a bit like a guinea pig. \nKeep doing what you do! :)  Just had my first ever episode of BP start Sunday morning. Everything tasted metallic, and slowly the whole left side of my face froze. Eating and talking are the worst, as is driving. I am going to have to get an eye patch for my left eye, as I cant close it I am sorry this happened to you! I hope you recover quickly. Eyepatch and tape. And look after yourself.  Tape is superior to the eye patch, in my opinion. Helps from not being able to blink properly", "Ear amplification? On my fourth week since being diagnosed, had an ear infection right before I got Bells.  Went through the normal steroid/antiviral regime for the first week and the infection and pain went away.  Ear is fine except for loud noises get amplified in my previously infected ear (think dog bark, yelling, shower water going in ear canal) about 4-5  times louder than other ear?   \n\nAnyone experience this?  Seems to be gradually getting better each day\u2026..unfortunately no bells improvement yet. Yes was similar when I had it. Hang in there. Eat healthy if you can. Extra B12.

Could it be connected to BP? It is already healing as I have been drinking meds for BP and the infection. Oh man that has been one of the worst parts for me, honestly. Sooo sensitive to sound on the side with BP. It does get better though just wear earplugs when you need to and rest! Finally my the ear noise is normal again, hopefully it is a sign for my face to start moving!", "Looking for any recommended specialists or places in Toronto to treat long term effects of Bell\u2019s Palsy like Botox or exercises for synkinesis? ", "What were your stages of recovery and improvement? I am on Day 14 since diagnosis where I lost partial paralysis on my left eye, lips, neck, nostrils, taste, and eyebrows. So far I have seen the most improvement in my affected eye(can close it most of the times), nostrils (can flare them again) and my taste is back to normal. Is the lips/smile usually the last one to get better? If so how long did it take to get your normal smile and lips back? When I pull in my lips in or hold air or even chew food my Cupid\u2019s bow still goes all the way to the right/unaffected side. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this! Hi! In my case I began to see improvement in my lips/smile on day 14 and by the 2 1/2 month mark my smile was looking exactly as it did before the Bell\u2019s palsy. Between day 14 and the 2 1/2 month mark there was a lot of improvement including the ability to eat and speak (all better by day 16), smiling with my mouth closed (day 18), and regaining taste (day 20). My blinking is what took longest to go back to normal, it was until day 70 when I noticed my affected eye was finally fully closing when blinking. Wishing you a speedy recovery! Yes, for me it is the lips that have taken the longest. I am 7 months on and my smile is not fully back to normal, so you are way ahead of me - I was a good 2 months before I could smile at all on the affected side. Now my cheek muscles are fine, almost fully normal again, and anyone who did not know I would had Bell's palsy would never guess just from seeing me smile or talk or eat, but pursing/pouting the lips is still a bit lopsided. Still hopeful for future improvement though - it is hard to notice small improvements day-to-day at this stage, but month-to-month I am still gradually improving.", "Almost 2 weeks of this face numbness and now a raging headache today New to Reddit , hello all. \n\nI usually never get headaches . Anyone else in the same boat. On week 2 of this Bell\u2019s palsy.

I have been out of Prednisone since Saturday night, which was my last dose, and I have not been prescribed anything else because I can still function close to normally. I have been getting bouts of pins and needles every now and then (several times in an hour for 5-10 minutes or more)  on the affected side of my face and on the outer shell of my ear. If they do not go away, it helps a bit to lightly rub the numb areas or adjust the way I am sitting, but it still has yet to go away for more than an hour or so before coming back. I also sometimes random pangs of pain near the top of my head on the affected side while doing things like cooking or cleaning. Is this normal?\n\nEdit: I was diagnosed with BP last Tuesday night.\n\nEdit 2: The tingling got less intense after I took some acetaminophen, but it still comes through every now and then, especially when I move around. I would say that is not normal. If rubbing the area or adjusting how you are sitting improves the issue it sounds like it could be a blood flow problem or an impinged nerve somewhere - a good reason to talk to your doctor.   \n\n\n  \nPersonally I have a hunchback and when I got physical therapy for it I learned that nerves require something called \"flossing\" to stay in good health (other wise they can actually shorten and become too tight). The PT showed me some particular stretches that help \"floss the nerves\" that were impacted by my extreme lack of flexibility.

I woke up the next morning feeling like I would had a stroke. I went to the hospital and had a cat scan and blood drawn. Everything came back normal.

I am glad to see I am not alone in saying that these headaches are intense and sharp. I have found facial exercises online and I am starting those. I hope I can recover quickly.

I was eating a BIG sandwich which, at some point, made me open my mouth way too much. I felt a muscle or something getting entangled under my jaw, with a very unpleasant feeling. It was not pain exactly, but something moving out of place. \n\nI tried to put it back manually (probably not the best idea) and the feeling went away. The next bite I tried felt off. I was biting one side of my lip. When I looked in the mirror, my right side was frozen. Blinking was still there, but not 100% working. The mouth was droopy on that side as well. \n\nI thought \"ok, maybe this will go away tomorrow\". It only got worse in the next two days, which on top of everything, I went off kayaking for several hours under the sun and wind of Wellington. Not the best idea again.

It was a slow process but I could start to see improvements. It took a solid 8 weeks for me to have most of my movement back and then another 4 to have complete control again.

If yes, how was your experience? Did it improve/initiate the recovery? If no, what was the reason?\n\n2. When did you see the first signs of improvement? Which part of your face showed the first movement?\n\n3. Did you take the ENoG or nerve conduction study? If yes, what were the amplitude and velocity? Did it improve over time?\n\n4.

I woke up and bc my ear was hurting. I got up, waved goodbye to my husband as he was just leaving for work. Walked to the bathroom to brush my teeth. My mouth was feeling really weird. I went to spit but instead of going into the sink, my toothpaste spit just dribbled down my chin. I ran to get my glasses. The right side of my face was completely numb and my right eye would not close.\nI frantically called my mom and told her that I think something was wrong. I was sure I was having a stroke. She asked if I could whistle. I tried. I could not. She told me to get to the doctor and she would meet me there. \nThat car ride was one of the scariest. The whole way over I was bargaining with God. I just kept repeating \"I do not care what happens to me, just please make sure the baby is ok.\" \nGot to the docs and within the first 30 secs of seeing me she diagnosed me with Bells. And she reassured me that the baby was completely fine. That it would have no affect on the baby. I was relieved. She prescribed an antiviral and a steroid. I was pretty scared to take anything bc of the baby. She told me the anti viral was completely safe, but she could not say the same for the steroids. So I refused the steroid. \nThe next few days were tough. I secluded myself from anyone who was not my close family. I was so embarrassed. I had my baby one month later and she was and is the most beautiful little girl I would ever seen. \nI have never fully recovered from Bells. My right eyebrow is dead. And my smile is still lopsided. It is took years for me to come to terms with the fact that I am going to look like this for the rest of my life. In not writing this to scare anyone. I am writing this to let you know that Bells is not the end of the world. It sucks. I am not going to argue with that. Just remember, you are still you! Do not be embarrassed. Rock that eye patch! Do not seclude yourself. Depression can make things way worse. Oh and if you have had Bells for awhile and you get that crazy pain around your jaw/chin try Botox. It worked miracles with me. Stay strong, friends. Happy anniversary Bell's palsy, you crazy bastard.  I hit 11 years just four days ago (March 19, 2006). It really took almost ten years for me to accept that this is my life and I have finally been able to stop looking at other people's faces with envy. Most people cannot tell that I have it (nobody has ever mentioned it and those I have told are almost hesitant to believe me), but obviously I can. I cannot move my eyebrow or smile all of the way, but I do have movement on the affected side to the point where if I try to full smile it can pass as a partially crooked smile, though it really makes my facial muscles that I do have feel really exhausted. Bell's palsy altered my personality, I am a much more stone faced person now with deadpan humor, which I have fun with but I used to be the always smiling and laughing kid (I was only 13 when I got it).\n\nI wish you and I (and everybody who does have it) did not have it, but I do find comfort in knowing that there are people out there who are like me and can own it as well.

I had a lot of pain as well and was surprised and scared by it as it was never mentioned in the ER. I did ice and heat on and off and it seemed to help. Did you ever take pain killers? I thought it was weird they never said anything about it too ): That is the nerve that runs under your ear, the nerve that is affected. Its pretty much just incredibly irritated and inflamed which is why its giving you pain. Tylenol or ibuprofen, and ice should help. Just ibuprofen and suffered through it. It sucked! I had the same thing. I complained to my primary doctor. He put me on a second round of prednisone immediately. I have completed it since 1 week and have no further pain.\n\nMy problem was exacerbated by my need to wear a CPAP mask to sleep, but I was unable because the elastic straps were unbearable.\n\nSo, I was basically going without sleep until the issue was resolved.\nTalk to your doctor. And forget painkillers. I tried everything from tylenol on up to powerful opiates and none had any noticeable effect.", "Headaches / Neck Pain A family member was recently diagnosed with Bells Palsy. At first they complained of a progressively stronger headache over the course of a week until they could not take it anymore. They had a CT and MRI to rule out a stroke with results coming back normal.\n\nTheir case is somewhat mild but they were put on prednisone and valx for 7 days. Aside from feeling tired they felt okay with slight tingling in their impacted side of their face (right). Now that the weekly medications are finished, the headache that goes from their ears to the back of their head/neck has come back with avengance. They said the pain is constant and makes it difficult to sleep or rest. \n\nIs this normal and has anyone experienced this? Does it get better and if so after how long? Yup, this is totally normal and something I felt throughout recovery. What helped for me was massaging the back of my head, acupuncture and lymphatic drainage massage. A cold jade roller used at the back of my ear helped too. My acupuncturist also told me to massage my earlobe when the pain was behind my ear. \n\nI still occasionally get the pain behind my ear 1+ month after and even though my face is all better. Completely normal, sadly. My doctor advised me to take ibuprofen to help with the pain and massaging the area with my hand and a jade roller also helped. It gets better! The pain lasted about a week and started after I stopped taking the prescribed medications as well. That is very helpful, I hope you are feeling better. Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions, I hope you are feeling better. Yup happened to me! As soon as I finished the steroids the headache was really bad. I have had bells twice. Both times got better after a couple days. i had the same problem and I had headaches for a year every day - One of my GPs prescribed antidepressants I took them 1 week and since I only get headaches during my periods - My GPs says that Bell\u2019s palsy create tentions and by taking this antidepressant it relaxes muscles ... it is was amitriptyline 10mg - I am in Uk not sure about other countries I read recently that shingles usually accompanies Ramsay Hunt Syndrome which can mirror the effects of Bell\u2019s Palsy (I.e. facial paralysis and headaches) and is often misdiagnosed. I am just repeating something I read about but it is something to consider. You are spot on. The good thing is that we were told the treatment and recovery process is essentially the same. It is except for the prognosis. I read that a much lower percentage (around 50%) of people fully recover. Unfortunately. I am in the process of figuring out if I have Ramsay Hunt vs. Bell\u2019s and I am hoping it is Bell\u2019s.", "My smile on Day 5 of BP. Definitely noticeable but I am glad it is stayed strong  Very happy for you! Hopefully you have a full recovery in a few weeks. Thank you! I am a tad worried it will get worse, but trying to keep my head up for the next few weeks and understand how lucky I have been Keep your head up I had no movement or improvement for 3 weeks then it all cleared up in a week. Full spectrum sublingual cbd helped, a sleep mask and eye drops. Wow! It is been 4 years since I had mine and my smile is not nearly that even!\n\nThat is great my dude! Rapid recovery - keep it up!", "Does exercising help with BP or should I wait. I am recovered from BP after a month and now it is been a month and a half. I was wondering how exercising works and effects someone who recently recovered (or who has very recently had BP) as when you exercise you put stress on the body. Should I take it easy or can I run and lift, etc. I scaled back while I had BP and got right back to it after I was done and it is been fine for me. That is for the info :) I exercised 24 hours after I received treatment and recovered fully within 4 weeks. I massaged my face muscles, blew up balloons etc Sorry I meant more like body work outs, I am glad you recovered fast though Haha Do you have a link for the exercises you did?", "Is the left side of my face dropping? Bulging eye, lip lower, flat cheek.  I think it just looks more flat, not like it is dropping down. Yours looks like mine did. Your BP looked like this? Can I ask what you did to resolve it? Yes it did, mine never got as \u201cextreme\u201d as other people\u2019s. I noticed it like immediately though and within a day and a half I was taking predisone and an anti viral. Did not notice any major changes until I started oral CBD oil drops. After I took a dose of CBD (I had some strong shit) with-in 15/20 minutes I could feel my nerves twitching in that side so somethin was working. \n\nLooking back though maybe it just took time to heal it is so hard to tell. It was better in about 7 weeks, which is what my doctor told me would most likely happen. Ah thank you for this. Makes me feel a little bit better. My self-consciousness is fueling my depression and consuming my thoughts! I really hope mine resolves soon. I plan on visiting the doctor next week after some blood work. Just a heads up, recoveries are best when you get steroids (prednisone) within 72 hours of onset. So try to get to the doctor relatively quickly if you want to optimize your odds of a full recovery. I will try to go tomorrow! But I feel like my face has been like this for weeks, maybe months at this point. Please please do not be hard on yourself. That is seriously my number one regret. I sobbed for weeks, had horrible anxiety, could not go anywhere. Now I am just like fuck, I could handled it a lot better because at least my legs work kind of thing. I know it is way easier said than done. But honestly, you are still really pretty. That is how I am feeling currently. I have always had a body dysphoria issue but it definitely has been triggered by this lately. Have not left the house either. I am on new anxiety medication luckily. I hope to handle it better myself soon! I really appreciate your words, it makes this feel less isolating and me less crazy. You need smile for us to tell I would say it is dropping but not very noticeably. We honestly see it ourselves a million times worse than others...especially strangers. I found wearing sunglasses or regular glasses helped feel more confident a lot. Because then it covered up enough of my brow bone to make it less noticeable to me I waited almost two weeks when I had very severe BP (compete side of face drooped, could not close my eye for almost six months). I think they will likely tell you the same thing that the person above did, but will still probably give you steroids and anti-viral meds.\n\nThe only thing that ever really worked for me was removing stress from my life. Turmeric is supposed to be a good anti-inflammatory. Facial exercises, something like \"face yoga\", is what the BP specialists will have you do long-term. The meds did not work? I am extremely stressed out , not sleeping most nights, and depressed. I am sure that is happily contributing. I am on new anxiety meds and hoping to see improvement soon. Well, the steroids they will/might give you are basically just strong anti-inflammatories. When you tell them it is been like this for months that will probably affect what they give you. \n\nI got mine in 2014. I would say sometime in the last year my eye stopped squinting when I would smile. Yours is actually pretty subtle. You look good.\n\nI can tell you what triggers mine and that might help. Stress obviously, I was working 100 hour weeks and losing a lot of sleep when I got mine. I basically stopped doing those kinds of hours, but occasionally would do ~80 hour weeks and would feel my face start to get tight. Partner/girlfriend drama would cause my nerves to start twitching. During those times drinking coffee would make the nerves in my cheek/nose feel twitchy.\n\nRemoval of stress. Daily anti-inflammatory (turmeric pills / golden milk). Meditation. Facial exercises. This is ultimately what everyone will tell you. \n\nI think CBD is worth a shot too. I mix CBD isolate with my weed extracts and definitely helps with the calm. My eyes are always twitching! It is insane and has only onset in the past year. The virus has definitely played its vital role in this, I am positive. I was in a decent place and then thrown into a very bad one quickly and suddenly.\n\nI am glad to hear that about the CBD because I just ordered a bunch of CBD flowers to try out and have something to look forward to \ud83d\ude05", "Are improvements possible after 1-2 years? I got BP almost 2 years back now, and while I have recovered greatly, I still have not regained my normal smile and my eyebrow muscles are non-existent. \n\nIs progress still possible or am I past the point of recovery? What forms of treatment have you tried (PT, acupuncture, vitamins)? Have you seen a neurologist? Yes, I am pretty sure there is still hope.\n\nIf you have not already, try acupuncture. I have not tried it myself, but a lot of people say it helps them regain muscle movement. Acupuncture, vitamin B, and physical therapy helped me. I just started botox a year after getting it since my eye still looked wonky. Good luck to you. I am 2.5 years in. Same, no eyebrow movement, crooked smile, etc. this is just the way it is now! It is better than what some people have right?", "Shot a gun for the 1st time today, do not let BP get you down!

The symptoms starting coming on about 2 days ago.  I just noticed my taste on the right side of my tongue to alter after bit down on my tongue.\n\nThis morning - (the day of making this post),  stood in the mirror and noticed my smile working only on the left side.  After doing some research I am ruling out stroke (which I know is not necessarily wise.) -- But I am picking a poison and putting my money on Bell's Palsy.\n\nIs there anything I can do as far as self-treatment while i wait out the shelter in place ordered for the next couple of weeks?\n\nThanks in advance! Mine happened last week. Go to the ER make sure your not having a stroke. And get the medicine that helps you recover faster...   Now\n\nI waited to long because of corona it may have hurt me. Some of us just do not recover. If you are one of us (takes a year to tell), it will be alright. Life is still live-able just less smiley because smile muscles... but ya know! I am going to see if there is a teladoc option. The last thing I want is coronavirus. The cool part is I dont smile so yaaay.  But I mean I would like to be able to with more than just the left side ha. I feel that. Its been 4 or 5 years for me. Its been so long I dont even remember. I went to an immediate / urgent care. I do not know where you are but in my state they are not doing covid testing. I had to go last week when the left quarter of my face stopped moving and I could not stop drooling. It was relatively quick and empty so it was not as bad as I thought it would be . This Is a smart way of going about it.  \nI will checkout this option.\n\nI also read that ENT's can diagnose this. . .if so that should also be a safe place to go. Did you get treatment or did you opt out.  I  Kind of looked at this as being similar to TMJ (the locked jaw/popping jaw condition) - in which you get it but you just decide to live with it.\n\nBecause it seems to be mild symptoms but yet they are still symptoms ha. I went to the ER within 4 hours of onset. I was put on Prednisone and Gabapentin. Neither helped. I then started electric stimulation therapy which caused more damage to the nerves regrowing causing Permanent damage to the nerves on the right side of my face. Dang, thanks for sharing &amp; I hate that is how it turned out for you. . .actually the reason why I may just see if it goes away on it is own after 2 weeks. (Saw that could occur as well.\n\nI am also finding out now that it robs you of the ability to whistle. Yep. I studied flute and music for 10 years. It was a passion. That was stolen from me by this whole shit show. Go see your primary doctor or urgent care clinic. They should be able to diagnose and prescribe steroids and anti viral meds if necessary. Do not go to the ER! Yea I have avoided the ER.\nI am at an urgent care now. . .and lucky for me it was empty. . .so my coronavirus paranoia is settled.\n\nNow to find out if we can help my face ha. Rest and avoiding stress is very important. I did acupuncture and massage and by week 3 I started recovering. Good luck That is the goal;\nAny dieting tips?\n\nI was diagnosed with it. Its mild, but I do have it.  I am picking up steroids now. I did not change my diet. Plenty of water and fruits.  Mine was mild as well, you should see improvement soon. Be aware that you may get pain behind the ear area I ended up at the ED (aussie version of ER) even after I went to the doctor.  I went in on the Monday when the symptoms started on the Saturday and the doctors said the sooner you can start treatment the better.\n\nSo I Definitely recommend seeing a doctor to get started on treatment. \n\nI am on of the lucky ones since my symptoms have just about cleared up after a few weeks, so I am counting my blessings.  Having said that I was given a second round of steroid treatment which must have helped the recovery.  I had no signs of viral infection so was never given the antivirals. Thanks bunches for sharing all this insight with me. . .I really appreciate everyone taking time out to share their XP. Did you do any facial exercise?  If so, when did you start them? Pretty much making funny faces. Raising eyebrows, blowing kisses, yawning, etc. I would also massage my face myself. I started right away Awesome then that is what ima do. That and I am chewing gum every 4 hours.  \n\nLol when I get some funds I am going to give you a reddit medal. Haha, for helping me though the struggle. Do the steroids have an effect on you? How long in did you decide to take steroids? Sorry to take so long to respond. \nIt was difficult to identify how the steroids affected me, but I did not feel any significant side effects.  The first course I took last five days.  A couple of days after I finished it started to experience pain around my ear which was the first pain I had felt since it started.  So I went back to my GP and initially they were going to put me on lyrica (pregabalin) for the pain but instead they gave me another seven days of steroid treatment.  Of course I do not know if that is what made the difference but my improvement while taking them was consistent.  Now only weeks after initial diagnosis I have practically all movement back and am.just a little weak in the lips.  I did get a break out of zits on my shoulders after the steroids finished but this could have been related to stress with the advent of coronavirus in Australia coinciding.\nAll the best with your recovery.  Rest and relax, let your body heal. Thank you! It is because my gf woke up with it a couple days ago and the doctor said it was just \u201cbad luck\u201d that she got it and she wants to take steroids but is already on medication that the doctors prescribed and she just wants to speed up the whole process but I was just here trying to do some research on it and the steroids to see if it is the best thing to do Yes the steroids do seem to be the best option.\n\nThere is no definite reason it seems that people get it. Often there is viral symptoms associated with the onset or some trauma to the facial nerve but I had Neither of these.  So \"bad luck\" it is and the scariest part for me was not knowing how long it would last and the doctors cannot tell you.  I feel very lucky I only had a few weeks but I would hate to raise hopes as some have it for much longer.   Protect the eye if it will not close properly with a patch a apply \"fake tears\" every few hours so it does not dry out was the most important thing the doctor told me. Yeah she sleeps with like an orbeez eye cover every night, and takes her medication every 12 hours and she just wants to speed it up faster because school starts back in like 3 weeks and she wants to be fully recovered by then but I told her it is all about time and patience but she just wants it all gone as soon as it can be As I am learning from this. . .its best to chill.\n\nWe are all so caught up in the \"hyperdrive\" of life. . .this condition we get in should ironically be an eye opener.  Chill a little bit more.\n\nWe all need to. :)\n\nStay positive,\nDo your PT, stretches, (and all the other up-keeps)\nAnd most importantly  - relax and chill.

Just thoughtI would see if there were any horror stories from people getting vaccinated with prior Bells Palsy or Shingles events? I had BP about a year prior to getting vaccinated. It is been six months since my vaccination and I have had no issues. Just my two cents. Cool thanks I have had BP twice (2004, 2016) and have had no BP-related side effects after getting both Pfizer vaccinations (the second one was about two months ago). Had BP in March pre vaccine then I got BP in June on the opposite side. Got my vaccine in April but back to normal. \n\nI doubt they were related. i was hesitant on getting the vaccine when it was first approved, especially after having bilateral BP... but then i decided that going through BP again would be better than catching COVID and having to fight for my life on an ICU bed that i might not get right away.\n\nand i also did not have any issues with the pfizer vaccine. I had bilateral BP several years ago. My doctor still recommended that I get the Pfizer vaccine. I did. No issues. I got BP end of May, then got the J&amp;J shot 1st wk of July. The only symptom I experienced was a sore arm for a day. It did nothing to my BP.\n\nMy spouse had shingles April last year. She got her 2nd vaxx dose last July. Although she experienced mild symptoms similar to COVID for 3 days, she was fine afterwards. The vaxx also did not trigger a shingles relapse.\n\nWe are both currently looking into getting booster shots, when they become available in our country. I had BP early 2020, recovered after a month or so.\n\nI got my second shot of Pfizer at the start of August, with no recurring BP symptoms. I got the shot Pfizer on Tuesday  no issues took b12 in large amounts before and still supplement with it. Sore arm and a 10 hr headache that was not to bad", "7 weeks and no visible improvement. Losing hope. Today marks 7 weeks of BP. The affected side of my face is still completely paralyzed with close to zero noticeable improvement. I do daily massages, take B supplements, weekly acupuncture, and get lots of rest. And still, nothing. It feels pointless and it is so discouraging. I am starting to think it will never get any better and I will be dissatisfied with my face forever. At this point is there any hope left that I will improve? Has anyone started to see improvement this late in their timeline? It took me months to see improvement and probably 6 months before it went back to mostly normal.\n\nBecause I had seen someone else develop BP I recognized it right away and got treatment within a few days.  \n\nDo not lose hope.  I know it is hard and can feel totally unfair.  Your body needs time and it may not get 100% better but I am sure you will see improvements.\n\nI took photos every week to compare.  Sometimes I did not think there was a change until I compared photos.  \n\nFingers crossed for you. It took about 9 months before I saw any significant improvements, after that though it tended to correct itself rather quickly.\n\nI still have sykenesis (although this is rare). Is when the nerves grow back incorrectly. For instance, when I blink, my lip twitches and when I pout or smile, my eye closes slightly.\n\nThis was an extremely rare case and most people recover after a few months completely. Just hang in there and make sure you keep your nutrients up! Please do not lose hope. I was completely stone-faced on the BP side for almost exactly 12 weeks.  I did NOT make a full recovery (I get the sense that those of us who take longer to recover do not make a full recovery), but I healed enough to where it is not noticeable to anybody but me and my life is essentially back to normal.  I am satisfied.\n\nYou will get there! At this point I would be happy to see any improvement at all, even if it does not go back to 100%. I was taking daily photos and videos but it was making me frustrated seeing no progress every day. Weekly sounds like a good idea. Thank you. Although unfortunate, it is comforting knowing there are others that did not see any improvement at this point either. Did you do acupuncture, take any supplements, do massages, or anything else? I want to be proactive and do everything I possibly can, but at this point maybe there is nothing else to do but wait. Thanks a lot for the kind words 9 months? That sounds really difficult, I am sorry. How did you deal with that mentally? Having so much uncertainty is affecting me a lot day to day. Sometimes it is easy to forget about if I do not look in the mirror too much but even just weekly check-ins and seeing no improvement is hard. I took a B supplement and CBD tincture.  Some self-administered TENS therapy that I would suggest against.  I did self-massage and I think I may have been too rough with that.  But I think mostly time was what healed me. I had zero improvement for 3 months. I am 2.5 years out and I am about 85% recovered now. You are missing the exercises!  These are the exact ones I did and this is what helped me the most. Twice a day, everyday. Being on week 17 and seeing week 2 was reassuring.  Week 16 to 17 was discouraging because I wanted more healing to have happened.  \n\nIt sucks to have to think about is so long term but I am mostly back to my old face and only my husband can tell if I make him stare at me.  My brother has had 2 episodes (weird) and fully recovered after both times but it took time. \n\nGo easy on yourself.  It is a shitty hand to be dealt and you are stronger than you know.  \n\nAnd make faces when you take photos.  Sometimes your cheek will move but not your lips.  Look at all angles if you want to see it all go down.  Or do not ever look.  Just know that things will get better\n\nYou got this.

Anyways couple years ago I was diagnosed pre diabetic and I finally in state where I will be able to take on that issue. \n\nMy question has anyone who got bells palsy also were either diagnosed pre diabetic or had diabetes. My understanding is diabetes effects blood flow to the nerves and whole lot of issues. Just wondering if there is a strong connection if stabilizing your blood sugar can help in recovery of bells palsy. \n\nI am going into my 4th week with this.  I have some movement below my eye and can barely move my eyebrow.\n\nWas thinking about acupuncture after the new year as well. Not a doctor, just did a lot of research and asked a lot of questions in support groups. \n\nEveryone needs to remember that Bell\u2019s Palsy is caused by trauma to the 7th cranial nerve. Something happened to the 7th cranial nerve that caused it to \u201cbreak\u201d and it needs to be healed. \n\nMy supposed caused of BP is the Herpes Simplex Virus (the common cold virus) triggering my 7th cranial nerve to be dumb and break (in simple terms here). This is per my Neurologist and my ER doc at diagnosis. \n\nI would suspect the herpes virus to be a suspect in your case too. But the biggest thing we all need to remember, is that there is no research on us. There is no known cause. Its an idiopathic diagnosis if there is no other cause like head and neck trauma from an accident, or pregnancy. \n\nWe can only guess at what the true cause is. Until they start researching us and trying to track potential causes, its a shot in the dark. \n\nWith that being said, getting healthy is a way to rule out other potential causes, like if you are pre-diabetic. My one neuro said my iron was too low and maybe that was the cause and we ruled that out with an iron infusion. So take care of yourself, get healthy, be kind on your hard days, push further on your good days, and do not let BP rule your life.

I developed Bell\u2019s Palsy around 3 weeks after my first Pfizer shot. It is been a month now and I am about 85% recovered. What helped me most is taking meds on time, getting acupuncture twice a week, taking long naps and taking a long vacation. Also, warm compress on the affected side and using jade roller in my face every other night. I noticed huge improvement after taking a vacation last week. I meditated and relaxed myself for a week and it made huge difference. Be positive, it will all be alright. We will get better. Thank you, your reply has made more optimistic. In my case the effects came hours later after receiving my first shot. On Saturday it will be two weeks.\nSome people recommended me acupuncture and I will definitely schedule an appointment.\nThanks for the advice. I was going nuts because I was probably the only person in my entire country and I was hearing a lot of negative comments and outcomes. I did not take antivirals or steroids because some people said it could affect the vaccine efficacy? But I am taking a med with high amounts of Vit B. I will search about the massages and exercises you said. Thanks a lot!! that is not true. go to the doctor and get prednisone and an anti viral I understand how distressing this is, but please do not hurt yourself. It will get better.

My dog would bark and it would echo inside my head. Now she just is loud when she barks and it is just regular annoying. (Love her)\n\nI also do not have as much pain, so that is good. \n\nBut you asked for pain relief etc. YouTube was my BFF for this with the massage and the exercises.

This is so debilitating and we all have been there where we think it is never going away. \n\nAs someone who battles depression myself, I decided in the car on the way home from being diagnosed that I was not going to crawl in bed and let this beat me or define me. So I make funny and informative TikToks about it. You would be surprised how many people reach out with messages of support. \n\nSo, my Reddit friend\u2026 choose your way of not letting this beat you.

I am glad I have found somewhere to vent because friends and especially family are driving me nuts. They want to get me all kinds of crazy treatments and a lot of exercises. They do not understand my muscles will not move at all, they think I am being lazy. Thank you for your words. I feel a lot better reading this. I cannot find support anywhere around me - everyone just want to find me a miraculous cure that will make my face normal overnight and it is really stressing me.\n\nThey think I am being lazy on exercises and such, but my face will not move at all and if I try to force it, I feel a lot of pain.\n\nDo you have any links of the videos you said that helped you?\nThanks!! I agree, it makes it worse bur my family is driving me insane. \n\nI will still get mine. I confess I am scared but I will not miss it. BP is still nothing compared to what Covid can do and the cases are still high where I live. Start here and follow her\u2014-&gt;  She is great! There is a lot of exercises that you just use your hands for. \n\nAs far as support goes, stick with the people who are there for you and ignore the people who do not get it. I am very selective of who I surround myself with nowadays. I found a lot more support online than with some of my coworkers. \n\nI have dreams that I can smile, and it is really sad when I realize I cannot. \n\nSomeday we will all laugh and smile at this, right? In the meantime, do not be afraid to smile with your crooked smile even if it looks and feels funny. It is important to keep smiling. that sounds so frustrating. maybe you can find a youtube video to show them what bell's palsy is?\n\nhang in there! Late reply, but I got Bell's Palsy about four hours after my first dose of Pfizer. Take good care of your eye and get some eye ointment like Lacri-Lube to keep it from drying out, and carefully tape your eye shut when you sleep in order to prevent further damage. If you have nerve pain or prickling or tingling on the affected side of your head, I would talk to your doctor to see what they recommend in your specific case.\n\nExercises have helped me, but whatever you do, do not force your face to move in a way that it does not want to, otherwise, you might end up with synkinesis. Vitamin B12 is also good to take. Be kind to yourself and get as much rest as you can. Try not to isolate yourself - consistently talking to good friends helped me a lot. Things will get better. Thanks. This is all I have been doing and also acunpuncture. How long did it take for you to get better? \n\nI am honestly so frustrated. It took me about a month, but I caught it early and was put on steroids the same night I noticed it. I may not be the best reference for timeline since, in my case, it did not get all that bad. My face was mostly just weaker with pins and needles on my affected side, and I had intermittent headaches and numbness for a few weeks. I caught it very early too, hours later my first shot actually (I had it around 10:30am and had signs after lunch). At first, I assumed it would go away quickly. At night, I was already far worse, could no longer close my eye and move my mouth.\nConsidering the country I lived, I panicked. There were high chances they would keep in a hospital among the Covid infected for tests. There were other doctors who wanted to keep me and use me for research.\nI am taking steroids now, 3 weeks later, but I see no improvement. \n\nTo not be so unfair, I have started to drink normally again. It was my only improvement so far. The steroids always helped with the pain, but I confess I fear it will come back when the pills end. It is good that you can drink normally again!\n\nFrom my understanding, steroids are prescribed to help reduce the inflammation that damages the nerve and causes Bell's Palsy, which is why it is important to get them as soon as possible in the case that you end up getting it again, though I would never wish that upon anyone.\n\nIn my case, after I finished the steroids I was prescribed, I just had leftover tingling and occasional pain on the affected side of my head when I got excited or even just laughed a little too hard. For those problems, I was prescribed another medication for nerve pain, which helped, but I only got to take it for about a week. did u guys get ur second shots? hope you recovered ! Not yet, I am getting mine next month. Still have not recovered even 7 weeks later and I am deadly scared it will make it worse or paralyze my other side. Hey, just an update, after weeks of waiting I finally received my 2nd pfizer shot. I was about 90% recovered. However, after about 4 days from my 2nd shot, the affected side of my face started hurting again specially around my left eyebrow, cheek and jaw. I immediately booked multiple appointments with my acupuncturist and they helped. It is been 3 weeks now from the 2nd shot and I still have the cheek and jaw pain. Hopefully I will get better soon. Did you take any meds? I am taking mine this weekend or next week I guess. I have been planning to take steroids at the first sign of BP. I am so scared because I have not improved at all. I am currently pregnant so I try to avoid drugs. I had steroids when I got diagnosed the first time but now I just depend on acupuncture and warm face massage for healing. So far my face is feeling better. Good luck! Try not to stress too much and sleep a lot! Oh, I see. I am glad you are already feeling better. I am hoping I will not have any major side effects this time but I am going to be prepared. Thanks!!", "What can I do? Hello everyone, My girlfriend had bp when she was around 13, she is 31 now. For some reason, she did not get the right care and she still has some effects from that (both visible and pain in facial tissues when she is stressed). After a rather stressful month or so she told me she was getting a facial massage that would help with the pain and relax the facial muscles in general. I want to help her and I do not know what to do or how to. Can you please help me with some information  like where to start, what to read, or what to do? Thank you! Hi there, it is really great that you are excited to help:) \n\nLearn how to give facial and head massages (if she is comfortable with that) in general and specifically asking where you can press to help alleviate pain and tightness when giving the massage. There are lots of how to\u2019s on YouTube to help you learn. \n\nI find having a hot water bottle or hot pack to lay the affected part of my face on to be super helpful. So having one on hand would probably go a long way to helping her to relax. \n\nI found acupuncture to be really helpful, especially as it is so relaxing. I also use an acupuncture pen called Pointer Plus that sends a little electrical current through the nerves, I find that helps with a lot of the tightness. \n\n( Thanks a lot. I will keep all the points you mentioned in mind :)", "Did you develop BP after the vaccine? I have held off from getting the vaccine due to my fear of getting BP again. I had been diagnosed about 6 years ago, and have been at a steady 85% since 5 years. Well the inevitable has come and I need to get vaccinated for a job. I am wondering which vaccine you all got and if you developed a BP recurrence or were diagnosed for the first time after the vaccine? I know this is a common question but I am reading that their it is related to the vaccine, it will occur very quickly after. Please respond with which vaccine you got and if you were diagnosed shortly after or if you had no issues. I figure this post can be useful for people in the future, to have a nice summary and data all listed below. I think Pfizer is the best bet but am unsure. Thank you. Negative... and initially I was very hesitant on getting the vaccine for the same reason, but eventually I rationalized that i would rather get BP again than suffer the effects of Covid, especially with having pre-existing conditions. I also plan on getting the booster, with the same rationale. YMMV. What vaccine did you get? pfizer Moderna for both shots. No recurrence. &amp;#x200B;\n\ni got Pfizer, and did NOT have any type of BP recurrence. I got vaccinated then a week later got my wisdom teeth taken out, within an hour if my surgery I developed BP. I feel strongly my BP was a result of the surgery but the neurologist made it a point to emphasize that it could have been the vaccine and not the surgery. I personally think the neurologist was just trying to be considerate of the dental surgeon in case I was going to sue about BP I also got Moderna with no recurrence. I was diagnosed with BP 32 days after my second dose of Moderna. Interesting. I got my wisdoms out in March and was concerned about a recurrence. I think it is probably more related to the wisdom surgery as the anesthesia is directly in the face and affects the facial nerves... putting them to sleep for a period of time. Must not have woken up.... Was this your first diagnosis or a recurrence? First I got Pfizer, both shots, and no reoccurrence. If it does happen, just make sure you let your doc know ASAP. \n\nGood luck! I was diagnosed with BP 1 week after my second moderna shot. First time I have ever had BP, and then I was back to like, 95% after about a month. Cannot say for sure if that is what caused it - I wish there was more research out there about it :(", "6 months from bells. Just passed the 6 months mark on bells palsy. I do not think I had it nearly as bad as others but it is still is not fully healed.  I think I am 75 to 80 percent of where I was before. I can close my eye just fine. But it is not strong enough to keep closed of I use my fingers to open it like my right eye.  I have a slight lisp with fs,z's,and ss, sounds but again improved from where I was before.  I can smirk and if I do not \"smile\" fully most people would not guess I have bells palsy unless I show them which is good I guess.\n\nSmiling is the is still taking awhile. I feel though it is still healing because I am getting muscle twitching and spasms on my left lip through side of nose. I am hoping that is a good sign of the muscles getting stronger.\n\nMy question if any has anyone used any of those smile stretcher devices? Do those help stretch out the muscles to help in healing?  I do not want to buy something if it will not help. Never used them.  I have twitching and spasms on the the bp side it is worrying me almost six months this saturday", "Turmeric+Black pepper Just briefly \u2014 turmeric curcumin is thought to be a great anti-inflammatory when mixed with black pepper (which boosts the bioavailability of the turmeric). I am dosing myself with this because for a number of reasons I cannot take prednisone. I have already had a little recovery (6 weeks) and I am curious whether this supplement will speed up my recovery by reducing facial nerve inflammation as prednisone would. This is going to be way anecdotal, of course, but so is just about everything else we try! I will let you know! \ud83e\udd74 Most people see recovery by 6 weeks... so.. I feel like your 6 week mark is the norm found by research and science, not some miracle by using spices. Sorry. Almost 9 weeks now, and no change.I took turmeric, black pepper, and aspirin every day. I am stopping everything now due to tingling on the other side of my face, just to baseline my system.", "For those of you in pain - Gabapentin! I have been posting to different threads about this, but I thought I would make my own post, because I think its THAT important.\n\nWhen I had horrible pain after diagnosis, I tried everything.  Nothing touched it.  My doctor prescribed several different pain meds, nothing.\n\nThen one of my other doctors suggested Gabapentin .... oh man, it was like Heaven! \ud83d\ude03\n\nWith the first pill, all pain gone.\n\nGabapentin is specifically for nerve pain, and that is what is affected with Bell's.\n\nI am not saying it will 100% work for everyone, but it is absolutely worth trying.\n\nI was on it for about a month, tapered off and pain never came back.\n\nI hate to know any of you are suffering and may be able to get relief.  Please consider.\n\nHugs! Warning with Gabapentin: it can become addictive. Many people abuse Gabapentin. \n\nFor me Gabapentin did not help at all and made me incredibly dizzy. I was on it for 4 weeks to \u201cgive it a try\u201d and it took a week to taper off of it. \n\nGabapentin is meant to actually control seizure activity in your brain, or relieve pain in people with Shingles. So yes, it can help with nerve pain, but its main function is to control seizures. I was about to say this. I was in horrible ear pain and went as far as to fill my prescription but I am glad I waited to take it. I have heard horrible addiction stories. It worked for me too! I had BP in 2013 and for the first week I could not even lay my head down to sleep the pain was so bad. Gabapentin helped me tremendously and I was finally able to sleep in a non-upright position. So glad it helped you too! \ud83d\ude0a", "New BP (5 days in) I just want to share my experience so far because the other posts have been so helpful.\n\nBP came on pretty quickly over the course of a day. I was on a Zoom call and realized it was becoming noticeable and went to the ER that night. Whole left side paralyzed, very little movement of eyebrow, no winking ability, cannot flare left nostril, one-sided smile. No numbness.\n\nER visit 1: diagnosed BP, given prednisone (steroid), and an antiviral (Valacyclovir). \n\nThree days later, slightly worsening symptoms (speech slightly affected, no independent eyebrow movement). I did some reading and realized it might be Lyme Disease. About a month ago I had a bug bite that spread out in a red rash for about 10 days before fading. I found this article about steroid use being associated with worse long-term outcomes when the paralysis is caused by Lyme Disease:\n\n( (Lyme is bacterial, so the antiviral would not help, and the article says steroids may make it worse.\n\nER visit 2: I share my theory and evidence and the medical staff took blood and put me on antibiotics (doxycycline) in addition to the previous meds. But today the test came back negative. I am not sure if there is any reason to take the antibiotics at this point, but I plan to just finish the course. \n\nSo today is day 5 since symptoms appeared. The first doc gave me the impression in might resolve in a few days, so I am a little disheartened to see that longer timeframes are common. Just this morning I started to repeatedly feel a sensation like a drop of water sliding down my left temple, but still no improvement. \n\nI plan to do the exercises a few times a day and take all the meds. I have a follow up with a neurologist scheduled in two weeks. With my one-sided grin and laugh, I am pretty thankful that people are still wearing masks around here lol.\n\nGood luck everyone! Great advice. When I went to the ER I was not tested for Lyme, but when I saw my Doc a week later, she had me test for it. I live in a high Lyme area. Tested negative for that, but learned it is very common ti have BP as a result of Lyme. Should be part of the ERs protocol! Hope you are feeling better! How are you doing theses days? \n\n5 Weeks BP here. Hey, I totally recovered. As soon as I got some twitching/range of motion back it all happened very fast. It is weird but once I was in the process of recovering, I was really tired and my face felt kind of sore, so I just rested a lot and ate healthy, let everything rebuild. It was about 3 weeks until I noticed any improvement but then it was pretty quick. You should see a neurologist if you have not already. I think patience is key in the majority of cases and just put any stress/anxiety out of your mind. Your job is to be healthy and let your body do its thing \ud83d\udcaa That is great! Glad you are recovered! Thanks for the advice. I have been getting little movements from acupuncture after every session. :) Looking forward to full recovery hopefully. Did the neurologist help your process? Or give information or homework to do at home to help the process?", "wtf is going on???! I have had bp for 5 months. I am experiencing random twitches that calmed down now they are back. My nostril twitches and sometimes lifts my lip and then my eyebrow twitches \n\nThis is at rest not movement \nAnd now my nornal side randomly twitches \n\nIs this tug of war what is going on . I only known one other person who Said there normal side twitched for a while too I am about 8 months in and still have a lot of that aswell as pain. I am sorry you are going thru this terrible Rollercoaster that is bp. i had the same thing.. around my eyes, corner of my mouth, bridge of my nose, etc. I read a few people say its nerves growing back/healing but i do not know about that. \n\nI do know that as the twitching went on for me, I slowly got more movement back. Whether the two are related, who knows. YMMV Thank you for responding. I have movement do it is strange. Did ur goodnside ever twitch too :( The pain is horrible I think I have occtipal neuralgia  both sides of head hurt i had BP on BOTH sides, so i was twitching on both sides. so cannot really answer that lol. How is the bp now eh about 70% recovered. I still have problems around my mouth, but will be going to a speech therapist soon. i Still have muscles twitching  from time to time - especially around my nose bridge for some reason - but its not like before when it was constant. Did they every say why the twitching nope The lack of answers is frustrating At the same time? I cannot imagine... Sorry you are going through this... yeah it sucked. we thought i was having a stroke. went to ER and everything. I cannot remember the timeline, but it took 3-4+ weeks just to start getting even a little movement ... its been a couple years and i still have problems with the muscles around my mouth. I.e., saying F/B/P words, keeping food in - sometimes when im eating food just flies out lmao... and when I brush and gargle water, i have to manually keep my mouth shut so i dont spit it out. good times!\n\n but my point in all that... esp for OP.... things will get better. might be fast, might be slow, but things will get better.", "Acne and recovery? I am 3 weeks in from the onset of symptoms and my cheeks and eyebrow are thankfully starting to move a little bit again but recently I have started break out quite a lot on my affected side mostly, this may also be a side affect of me suddenly stopping the steroids and anti virals as well but I am not entirely sure or is it part of the recovery process? Has anybody else had a similar experience? I am a bit confused.. Why have you stopped steroids suddenly? Was not it tapered off? Some people have steroid related acne - but I did not have it myself. Yeah... red flag for me here too.\n\nPlease consult a medical professional before suddenly stopping steroids. Call a your Dr, a nurse line, pop by and talk with your pharmacist. Oh no my doctor told me to stop taking it, I even asked him if I needed to taper off he said no it is fine In my experience, I was told to kepe taking the roids till I got my movement back. I would get a second consultation to be safe Are you in the US? Pls consult a second doctor. No I am from the Uk, and yeah sure I will do I am talking about the prednisolone tablets btw I am in the US and yes am also talking about prednisone. Also, pls check the dosage you were prescribed. Here I did 60mg per day and then tapered down after 10 days for another 10 days I think I was on 50mg I believe for 2 weeks den stopped but I have gained a little movement back on my cheek and eyebrow so dats good how long did it take for u to recover ? It took me 15 days to see my first symptom of recovery where I regained a slight ability to control my cheek movement (only noticeable to me but I am positive I saw the ability to control it). I continued to recover rapidly for the first 6 weeks after the initial 9 days and more gradually for a whole year with lots of twitching in the face. It has been 6 years now. To external perception, I am completely recovered. However, I cannot wink with my right eye (non BP side) because the left eye closes first and there are other small side effects that only I can notice/care about. Overall, most people recover well with very limited residual effects. So you have numbers on your side.\n\nEdited: I just looked up my journal and noticed it took me 15 days to gain some movement and 9 days to stop worsening. That is interesting I currently have some movement on my cheek too but still cannot smile and my eyebrows raise abit now aswell, well fingers crossed I guess as long as I can smile again I do not really care about anything else You will be fine! All good wishes to you! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Jaw pain/soreness Hi all,\n\nI first noticed symptoms of Bell\u2019s Palsy 18 days ago. I went to urgent care 48 hours later and started prednisone and valcylovir. The symptoms progressed for 3 days then mostly stabilized. It is partial paralysis of the left side that is not that noticeable at baseline, but obvious when I smile and I cannot blink the left eye.\n\nThe most troubling is that about 10 days in, after things stabilized, I started feeling some jaw pain, mostly in the morning and late at night. Then the past 4 nights I have woken at 4 or 5 am with intense shooting pain in the jaw and right below the jaw/top of neck, with some inner ear pain, though not as severe as the jaw. It is kept me up for two hours or so and then I fall back asleep. It still hurts in the morning, but not as bad and then mostly resides during the day. This is only on the left affected side, no pain or any soreness on my right side.\n\nFirst thought is teeth grinding/jaw clenching, but I have not done that before and I do not believe I am doing it now. I bought a moldable mouth guard I have been wearing the past 2 nights, but it does not seem to make a difference. I have tried warm and cold compresses and ibuprofen, but nothing seems to really help. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Any ideas or thoughts? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks. I did, especially through weeks three and four, as I started regaining some muscle control. I think it was sore unused muscle fatigue due to being used again, but that is speculation. I had the same pain so i used a homemade hot pack and put it on my face for 20mins 3x a day for the pain and soreness I currently have the same. Started on day 8 (counting from the day I woke up unable to move my face, I would had a sore ear and tingling for 2 days before that). Exactly as you describe, concentrated just under the ear/jaw and shoots from there.\n\nIt is slowly getting better (I am at the start of day 13). I have found Advil and applying heat to the area shortly before sleeping to be most useful at managing it, so I am afraid I have no real advice if those do not help. But I think the pain itself is normal, if unfortunate. I had the exact same thoughts about the grinding of my teeth. My jaw pain was one of the first symptoms I got. I went to the ER last night and was diagnosed with bells palsy. I had been having some jaw pain almost cramping for the last couple days! Update: my doctor prescribed me flexeril, a muscle relaxant, to take at bed time for a couple nights to loosen the jaw, based on a clenching hypothesis. I took it for 3 nights straight, sleeping through all 3 nights without waking and only minimal pain during the day. \n\nI have not taken it since and have slept through the night for 8 consecutive nights now and do not have any intense shooting pain. I still get a little soreness, say a 1 or a 2 out of 10 during the day, but nothing like the 8 or 9 I was experiencing before. \n\nSo glad. That was really tough. Hope this helps folks. \n\n\ud83e\udd74", "Bell\u2019s palsy pain behind ear/head got better then got worse and feels different now. Does not feel like a muscle cramp anymore. It feels like an ache/throbbing/shooting kind of pain behind ear/head. 17 days in so far. Is this normal? I feel like if the pain got better and then gets worse it means you are stressing out a lot, irritated, not sleeping well right? \n\nBecause my mom has been stressing herself out even raising her voice sometimes, has not been sleeping well, and.... the pain that was getting better is NOW BACK. But she does not see a connection between it. \n\nAlthough she can now raise her eyebrow and crease her forehead a bit and has less droopiness. But her cheek, eye, and mouth area muscles are still super weak. I am year and a half recovered and still have ear pain like the throbbing you described and nerve sensitivity. That is scary. What are docs saying about it? Have you had an MRI to rule out a tumor?  I learned this the hard way.  I did have a tumor....misdiagnosed for a year by 3 doctors. Doc is testing for Lyme disease first. She had all the symptoms except the circles the tick is supposed to leave on the skin. And she is been in parks a lot for the past 2 months.

I did not have any pain with mine, but searching \"Bell's palsy pain\" on youtube brings up a couple videos with people that did.  Hopefully someone here can tell you their story. I had that with my palsy- it got to the point where I could not sleep. At the time I described it as being hit in the face with a shovel every twenty minutes. Turned out it was nerve pain- I was put on naproxen and gabapentin and there was near immediate relief! About 6 months later I was finally able to come off of it without too much pain in my affected side. I hope this helps! Very helpful!

Yet I just noticed that on the side of the face I had it, I cannot wink or raise my eyebrow without moving the other side of my face whereas the other side of my face has no problem with either. Also I noticed when I inhale really hard, only the side I did not have BP my nostrils will sink in whereas the BP side will not move.\n\nI always knew I could not do these individual things on one side of my face, I just pieced it together that it was all on the same side which happened to be the BP side.\n\nAnyone else have the same experience? You did not fully heal, and at this point, it will not change. I am 4, almost 5 years post diagnosis and I have seen 3 neurologists all whom say I am in the 5% that will never fully recover. It sucks, but its easy to forget some days. I am 1.5 years out and am not fully recovered; not even close. I never will be.

I just started my internship and been staring at a computer 8 hrs/day. I have been using artificial tears but it burns my eye. The corner of my eye hurts and my eye is red. Anyone know any remedies for this? I have heard mixed comments about warm compress vs cold. This is so uncomfortable and annoying! Hope everyone has a speedy recovery.  Wear an eye patch or tape it closed with medical tape and gauze. I could not look at a screen for more than a few minutes for the first month or two with my bad eye. I use tape and a cotton pad but I feel like it just suffocated it. Any insight on either to use a warm or cold compress? I tried a mix of hot and cold as well. What really helped were eye drops that we are very thick, I do not remember the name but should be easy to find. Expensive but worth it to use my screens for work. I found the cotton ball and tape helped keep the eye lid closed instead of covering the whole thing. \n\n", "Twitching !  I am still recovering so I was happy to feel the twitching the other day, like the nerves were reconnecting? No idea, I just took it as a sign of progress. Eat a banana. You might just be low on  magnesium or potassium :)  \n\n\nEye twitching can also be caused by stress, so try not to rile yourself up too much. It is most probably not a resurgence of your BP. Yeah I had that when recovering too. I feel now my nerves will twitch now randomly. It is like they are confused or over react more then before Thank you ! X", "Prednisone Question I went to the ER and was prescribed prednisone. They had given me the first dose there. However, there are a total of ten doses when I picked up my medication. I read around that 10 days is the sweet spot for taking these meds. With the initial dose given to me at the ER that would make it 11 days of taking Prednisone. I have two doses left. Should I take the last dose today? You should not exceed daily dosage as prescribed and complete the daily regimen, even if it is eleven days. The purpose of the steroid is reduction of inflammation to prevent further damage to the 7th cranial nerve. If you have completed an antiviral regimen as well, it is very likely that you have already done that and that an eleventh dose of prednisone is inconsequential. The most important dose is the one you got at the ER, as damage from inflammation was still occurring at that time. Best of luck for a speedy and complete recovery.

This has been worsening over the day since yesterday. My doctor only replied to me this morning, but do you think if I start cortison or steroids today it might still not be too late? I have read it is best to give treatment within 72 hours of first symptoms, but another single source said only 24 hours for cortison. I am afraid now that I will suffer long-term damage from this. I will be happy about any answer I can get. Also, my eye has been feeling dry and the lid feels a bit heavy. \nReduce the inflammation asap to reduce further nerve damage, if there is any. thanks. i hope i hear back from my doctor soon \nMeanwhile, do not stress about it, get some rest and do not force force facial movements. None of that helps and just makes it worse. thanks. i already suspected that forceful movements are probably not that good Lubricate your eye! Make sure to wear an eye patch with ointment at night (or tape your eye). You can cause permanent damage if you do not care for your eye. I wish you all the best!

I went to the ER the same day it started, so I got medication quick. I was prescribed with a 50mg of steroids for 5 days plus antibiotics 7 days worth. \n\nI started acupuncture on the 11th and have been going every 3 days (4 times so far). I hit my peak when I went full on paralyzed right after I finished my steroids (5th day) and had no movement whatsoever. \n\nI had my 2nd acupuncture on the 6th day and by the next day, I had noticed more movement on my paralyzed side. \n\nI can say it is been exactly 2 week and I am about 70% recovered. I still feel tense on my mouth, blinking is still slower on one side; but other than that, I can smile again, talk better and flare my nostrils and eyebrows better. \n\nI really believe acupuncture helped me recover faster. I also took vitamin b12 (1000mg) \n\n\nI really hope you consider this &amp; see improvement. Best of luck to you \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd im in the hospital atm where they test me. i have not heard back from them yet but i hope it will be ok and recover quickly Im reporting back: The twitching &amp; numb feeling are probably caused by a sinusitis infection I got because of covid.

The first week it seemed to get worse everyday and then stabilised for a few days and then around the 2 week mark I noticed my eyes were blinking more in sync and my affected eye was not drying out anymore. By about week 3 I was almost completely back to normal, it was only really noticeable if I compared a photo of me pre Bells Palsy to what I currently look like. I do not think I have had much change since then but I do not even care now. If you are currently suffering from it just remember you are way more likely to get better than not. Also you need to try and stay positive about it even though that may seem impossible some days. Whether you are completely down about it or just finding it funny, it will not change how your face looks so why not just try and keep positive? \nGood luck everyone, I am sure you will all have good outcomes like me! \u263a\ufe0f Tysm, i really needed that, especially since my bell's came back\ud83d\udc80 It went before so it will go again \u263a\ufe0f", "My mom had Bells Palsy and has been left with the last 6 years of facial nerve pain.

Is there any medicine or supplement i could take after all this period that can heal that nerve please HELP! If its been 9 years, at this point you are looking at pain management, not a cure. I am at 5 years and no one can restore facial movement for me (that I have had appointments with anyway), and now I am on pain management for trigeminal neuralgia which is probably that pain you feel under your ear. Go see a doctor and ask if you can be looked at for trigeminal neuralgia and if you can have pain management for it. I cannot speak to your specific circumstances, except to say that acupuncture helped me in two ways, the latter which may be applicable to you: \n\n1. I seem to have greater mobility in my face after\n2. There was a significant reduction in pain for a period of time\n\nWere I in your shoes (I am almost a year in, not fully recovered, but seemingly a bit beyond where you are at), I would push forward with trying to move your face as much as possible and try acupuncture to help manage the pain.\n\nI do not know if that is a good idea (in fact it may be a bad idea), but it is what I would do. im not looking for pain management i want to heal those symptoms and the pain happen once the nerve is tired with face exercises or water enter i to my ear and that not always happening also i visited a doctor and he said those symptoms will stay forever and im skeptical about his says Did u notice the difference after using acupuncture and how many times did u do it ? And did u try any supplement or meds that may help the mobility of that nerve Then get a second opinion? Or go see a face surgeon. I did notice small differences after. I went 3 times a week for almost 6 weeks. I stopped because my pain subsided, I was seeing greater gains overall and the pandemic.  I also took B12 and fish oil.

There is hope for it to be over quickly! If you are already moving aspects of your face, you are on a great path to full recovery (IMO).  Keep your chin up! Thanks bud!  I was reading it could take up to 6 months, so the progress made in 2 weeks is amazing to me. I was stone-faced for 3 months solid.  Now I am ~10 months out and still do not have full control of my lower lip. I personally do not foresee any more progress for myself, but I am mostly ok with it.\n\nMany posters fully recover within weeks, and it certainly seems like you will be among that group! I made a recovery in about 2-3 weeks too! Glad your good! Give another week for your eye, I was on the same boat Did u feel any twitching before recovering? Yes I did!!! It was really bad twitching.

So I am on my second round of bells palsy and it is been 1.5 months (first one was 11 years ago when I was 14). For this round, I found this lady on Youtube to learn bout bells palsy and synkinesis (I developed synkinesis from my first round and to this day I still have involuntary movements). I am sure some of you have watched her videos.\n\nI just finished an appointment with her and she was incredibly helpful in tailoring certain exercises and was incredibly informational -  she knows more about bells palsy and synkinesis than anyone I have met and I just wanted to share that just in case someone could use help from her.\n\nShe is located in India so if you are in the US, it is very affordable to get a 1:1 consultation. ( just in case you have not seen her! She gave me good exercises and educated me on how people get synkinesis from bells palsy. She also did not recommend all exercises because some facial exercises can increase the likelihood of developing synkinesis, so I have to wait until after my bells palsy heals. Anyways, I just wanted to post this here just in case someone could benefit from this! It is kind of hard to pay for it if you are in the US so I emailed her and she sent me an invoice. just an fyi Do you think you could tell us what Facial excerices we should avoid so we do not develop synkinesis? I did her videos on YouTube for the early stage and later stages and found them super helpful. Hers and the NHS Rotherham video. Yes! Her YouTube channel is immensely helpful! Go through it for exercises and massages. I found her too! what is the consultation cost ? you can dm me if it is too much to ask here How did you contact her? I think I would like to do this. My doctor was like \u201crest, take these pills for a week and you will be cured next week\u201d \ud83d\ude44 She was saying that synkinesis happens when you over-exercise the muscles or too much electro stimulation. So if you are in the earlier phases, I would recommend gentle massages. There was one exercise she showed me where I use one hand to raise my eyebrow and the other hand (with two fingers) to gently close and open the eyes. hope that makes sense.\n\nI think I got synkinesis from overexercising last time. It was a long time ago so I do not quite remember, but I think I was forcing movements (like pressing down my lips to expand my cheeks) and that is what hurt it Good to know! Have you healed from her exercises? And I have never seen the NHS Rotherham I will definitely watch that! Thanks for the recommendation :) yes yes!! she is great! That is okay! It was like $23 USD! My appointment ended up only being 20 minutes long, but for me it was fine since she told me everything I needed. I would message her through the contact page on her website! ( Haha, so funny that some doctors think it will be cured in a week. I am at 1.5 months and it is very very tiny movement. I am just thankful I do not have migraines anymore since they were terrible! I would message her on the contact page of her website here (\n\nBest of luck and I hope it goes well for your healing :) I do not know if it is just from her exercises but they definitely helped a lot especially with the nostrils and cheek which needed more help. The Rotherham video helped a lot with the tongue and lips in my opinion.", "I got diagnosed. Hey guys, I got symptom Tuesday, got worried and lifted my arms up to rule out stroke. Went to hospital yesterday. Got diagnosed. It sucks. I hope it goes, away soon. Does anyone have any tips for drinking? Cans, bottles and mugs of coffee etc. I keep dribbling and my eye is leaking. It is so annoying. Straws. They are a life saver. Do not use those steel/ hard ones - i find them hard to use. I prefer paper straws (plastic if not available) and bring one with you wherever you go as some restaurants do not have them. For meals stick with soft and easy to swallow. \n\nI am not sure what is dribbling.\n\nFor eyes, get an eye patch and eye drops. Hi!\n\nI used (glass) cups as i was not able to close my mouth fully so straws would not work. Just straight into my mouth and swallowing (does not work with hot drinks tho, I would usually just wait for it to cool down)\n\nAs previous poster recommended, eye patches and drops are essential!\n\nGet well soon! Cheers. I do not get paid until Monday, so I will get eye drops then. Fingers and straws! Or those contigo bottles with the sippy straws built into them. Pop straw into unaffected side, use fingers to clamp on the bell's side. That is what I did especially when gargling.\n\nI did not tape my eye in the day time but lots and lots of eye drops and artificial tears. There are some artificial tears that come in a small tube in gel form and those lasted longer than the liquid drops. Use them, use them A LOT. 2nd biggest thing to take care of besides getting rest is your affected side's eye so it is hydrated/moist. If straws are not readily available it helps to tilt your head to the side that is unaffected, if that makes sense. It took me maybe 2 weeks to gain a little control of my mouth so I do not dribble out as much and I hope the same goes for you as well. Or pinch your lips together on the affected side too. It really sucks and it is a learning process, so please take supplements if you can and be sure to do daily facial exercises! You are not alone in this! I could not even use a straw. I drank from a drink bottle and held my mouth closed around it. \n\nAvoid messy food like burgers/tacos etc and eat food that you can cut into small pieces. If it makes you feel better, I gor diagnosed when I was 35 weeks pregnant with my twins and was 100% recovered 4 weeks later. \n\nTape your eye closed at night with an eye ointment to protect the cornea and use eye drops during the day.\n\nRest heaps. I was really tired and run down when I was diagnosed.\n\nI was prescribed oral prednisone and antiviral meds the day of diagnosis. I am on my day 7. \ud83d\ude14\n\nPlastic straws help. Let go of those steel ones for the meantime or hard plastic ones. You cannot close your mouth that well but biting the straw with your teeth helps. \n\nFor eating, I had to use knife and fork to make sure I put small pieces of food in my mouth at a time. It helps keep the food in. You will end up eating slowly but at least less drool or spills. Use a small spoon too to help. Try avoiding runny soup.\n\nI also have a napkin nearby or a hanky.\n\nPraying for your quick healing! \ud83d\ude4f Do not forget to exercise you face! Cheers. I need some kind of stra, to drink coffee lol. Hahaha! When there is a will there is a way! Try not to laugh while drinking or eating. \ud83d\ude01\n\nFor your eyes, I rest it by helping close it with my hand (just make sure it is disinfected) for about 3-5 seconds. To kind of help it blink. Use good eye drops to keep it moisturized especially before going to sleep and when you wake up. Taping your eye at night does help but it will annoy you at first. You will get used to it eventually. Cannot afford eyedrops until the 6th. You would think that because your face is paralysed and you cannot move your mouth or eyebrow, that your eye would not have trouble closing. Hi OP! Got to talk to a rehab medicine doctor. He said hot compress on the side of your face that has bell's palsy will help. Soak a small towel on tolerable hot water, wring out the water and apply to your face. Hope this helps! Thanks. I will try it later.", "BP after Pfizer Hi all, did anyone get BP after the 2nd dose of Pfizer? 20 minutes after, the left side of my face felt not numb, but weird for about 10 minutes. It is starting to feel like that again and it is been 4 days since", "The Palsy Wars, Begun They Have ", "Can immediately starting Prednisone/Anti-viral medication help with the duration of Bell's Palsy? Woke up with facial paralysis on one side after feeling similar slight sensations last night. Doctor told me it was Bell's Palsy and I have immediately started Prednisone and an Anti-viral medication. Does this typically help more than say starting medication a few days in? There are no guarantees, but the standing belief is that the sooner you start them, the better your prognosis for a good recovery. There is a reasonably good correlation between early treatment with antivirals and steroid anti-inflammatories, but as with most aspects of BP the data is fuzzy... the medication might not be enough help for a severe case, and nobody knows whether or not they are a severe case until it starts (or does not start) getting better. But a lot of people who are put on those medications early report recovery times that are statistically shorter than those of people who are not given the medications, or who do not start them until later. Early intervention tends to lead to early recovery, in a \"it cannot hurt, it might help\" sort of way.\n\nI was prescribed prednisone and acyclovir within hours of onset and I feel like that was a significant contributing factor in how quickly my recovery began.\n\nTake care of yourself - I say that not as a social nicety, but as in you need to actually make a point of taking care of yourself. Less stress, less irritants, more rest and vitamins and healthy eating, enough sleep, massage your face,put a warm cloth or heating pad on the afflicted side (starting on LOW, remember your nerves are not properly reporting back to your brain right now), all of these seem to help. Give your body every excuse to get better, and every resource it needs. Cannot hurt, might help.\n\nGood luck. thanks very much. I appreciate it! I read a paper from the Rotterdam scientific hospital summarizing research results on Bells palsy. Prednison had a strong positivr effect on recovery chance, whereas this effect could not be proven for antivirals.  I was just diagnosed a few days ago and got prescribed the standard 10 day prednison treatment btw. I feel it helps", "(35f) Diagnosed at urgent care... No facial palsy 3-days post-diagnosis. Misdiagnosis? hi! i am (35f) writing this in hopes others might have had similar run-ins with BP and could help ease my mind before my doctor follows up this week.\n\n# My lead up to diagnosis, and progression so far.\n\n- **(Day 1.)** I woke up with a massive earache about a week ago. I dismissed it thinking it was just the warm weather and my allergies acting up.\n- **(Day 4.)** It began feeling better over the next few days. The pain was still there, but I was feeling better than I had all week around day 4. My SO and I decided I should see my doctor on Monday (in two days) if the pain is still there. I have a history of earaches leading to sinus infections... and I wanted to avoid that.\n- **(Later Day 4.)** I started having this tingling tingling (not numb, just tingling) on my face. That was enough for me to go to urgent care. They took me immediately. After hearing my shortlist of symptoms (earache, and the face tingling) he checked my ear for fluid ruling out an ear infection, and rather quickly diagnosed me with Bell's Palsy. They prescribed me an antiviral, and Prednisone. I started both prescriptions that night.\n- **(Day 5, first day after diagnosis)** My earache is completely gone (which very likely could be from the Prednisone.) Still no signs of any facial paralysis, or facial numbing. Still have complete control and movement of my face (eyebrows and all). I have not lost any taste, either. The antiviral and Prednisone have my feeling pretty awful, and tired though. Awful headache towards the lower back of my neck (occipital nerve?)\n\nI am hoping I caught it early enough and started treatment early enough that I brought down swelling and reduced any damage to my cranial nerves. I guess I was curious if anybody here has had a diagnosis of Bell's Palsy without the facial palsy, or paralysis.\n\nIf I do not show any signs of paralysis by ~Tuesday, I will likely see my doctor for a follow up, and maybe double check the original diagnosis. I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy without facial paralysis, and my symptoms were cleared up within a few days after taking my medicine. It happens sometimes. I would say trust your medical professionals, and keep your fingers crossed that they just caught it early.  \n\nI am certainly no medical professional, but I suppose it is possible that some cases of Bell's palsy develop pretty slowly? If that is the case, I could see the medical treatments actually stopping it, which would be amazing. \n\n\nI would say I had a very similar experience to yours, minus the earache. However, my symptoms rapidly developed over the course of about 6 hours.  I was having lip and eyelid twitches the day before, which was just annoying, but nothing ever to be worried (I have never really had a lip twitch before, so maybe I SHOULD have been concerned...). Then around lunch time, the tip of my tongue went numb, and I just chalked it up to having burnt my tongue earlier on coffee that morning. I did not really notice much else until about 6 hours later when I stopped being able to purse my lips all the way, and then my lip and cheek started to feel numb. I drove myself to urgent care, and by the time I had been given my diagnosis and prescription, I completely lost control of my face. \n\nSo, if it is possible for Bell's palsy to develop slowly, I would say that sounds like you have got the problem under control.  I have never had much ear pain, but I have seen many other people in this sub mention it. By all means get a second medical opinion if you are concerned, though! I got the Pfizer vaccine a week ago and I got bells palsy in the last two days. I had it a decade ago on the other side of my face. \n\nLast time it took at least a month to get any movement from the affected side of my face\n\nRecovered from a decade ago, but still have a little droopiness and synkinesis from the first go", "Working out with Bell\u2019s Palsy Hey everyone, I was diagnosed a few days ago and since then have taken a break from working out. I like to exercise 6 days/week, so obviously I am itching to start again. However, I am hesitant to do so out of fear of putting pressure or trauma on the nerve and stunting recovery. Is this true, or is exercising completely safe and will not impact recovery? I was the same and it took me like 3 months before I felt good enough to go back. I tried to go after 2 weeks from onset and I was not even 5 minutes into the workout and had to stop. It will def put unneeded stress on you. Right now your immune system is down. You could try to go if you wanted to just do a little lightweight exercising. But your body will let you know if you should keep going. \n\nGive yourself some time to heal. It takes awhile for the inflammation in the nerve to go down. I just had a Bell's Palsy attack this week. My workout routine prior to the event was 40 minutes of yoga and a 3 mile walk. I have continued with my regime after the attack. However, I would recommend speaking to physician first. Hello, we are nursing students who were displaced from clinical due to COVID-19. We have found the following information to answer your question relating to working out with Bell\u2019s palsy.\n\nWe are sorry to hear about your current situation. Concerning your question about being able to exercise, it is important to consult your doctor whether or not it is safe to return to the previous workout regimen due to the fact that Bell\u2019s palsy can have symptoms ranging from mild weaknesses to severe paralysis. Due to that, we would recommend that you should first start with facial exercises to ensure a safe recovery from the symptoms of bell\u2019s palsy, then inquire with your doctor to be able to ensure that returning to your previous workout regimen would be safe (*Bell\u2019s Palsy Facial Exercises*, 2020). On the other hand, if you do decide to continue to work out, it would be best to start with low intensity and slowly work your way up to avoid future complications. While working out if you feel facial pain, you can apply heat to the involved side of the face or take an analgesic agent, such as acetaminophen, to help reduce the pain.  If you decide to have a post workout snack chew on the unaffected side, avoid hot fluids or foods and rinse your mouth to ensure oral hygiene is performed to avoid periodontal disease.

And things were getting normal, swelling was subsiding. \n\nBut just after the crown lengthening, swelling began again and my left eye got bigger. When I laugh, it did not close as the other one. Lower eyelid does not close properly. I cannot blink as before.\n\nNow, it is been almost three weeks. Since three days there is twitching below eye everytime I blink left eye(affected eye). But the twitching is more frequent, even while not blinking now.\n\nI have not taken any medication yet, only the eye drops. There is no mouth drooping. Only the lower eyelid seems to be affected.\n\nIs twitching a good sign? What can I do to make the recovery process faster? What are the signs that it is getting better? If it is post-surgical it is not likely to be Bell's, which is normally caused by the herpes virus, high viral load from another virus or stress. You should consult your surgeon pretty urgently.  Thank you. \n\n It started right after the dental procedure and I have found cases describing the onset of Palsy due to dental anaesthesia (nerve block/something). I had consulted with my surgeon right after the onset and he told me not to worry..  So, I was not worrying much. I will contact him today!", "new help hello there yesterday i took a hot shower and then went to sleep, the next day i wake up with facial palsy i can still move the infected area but not as much as the other Go to your urgent care immediately!! They need to put you on a couple medications within 48 hours. If they do not you will have to let it run it is course which may last a lot longer and more painful! \n\nI had this a couple months ago and fully healed now. \n\nSending love your way!\n\nI always documented my journey on YouTube - it is scary but you can overcome it! okay thank you, can you tell me how much time does it last It honestly varies, my face did not go back to normal for over a month (that was with medications/massage therapy/acupuncture, herbals) \n\nSome people last up to 6 months but some people last a couple weeks. Varies by case. Some 6 weeks, some 6 months, some never regain function (5%) Go to the doctor, you May still have a viral infection, and you could probably use some prednisone from your doctor as well. I had it for about two weeks. If you catch it early and start taking the meds i should hopefully clear up quickly. I was the same, i realise half my face wasnt moving like usual and i went straight to the hospital. Took me about 2 weeks to see improvement and after a month plus i am fully recovered thankfully. I can testify to the long side of things. I am over 5 months myself, with little improvement in my ability to intentionally move half of my face. Resting symmetry has gotten quite a bit better through physical therapy/electrical stimulation. Everyone is case is different, and a few are permanent, but my mostly not. I hope you experience a speedy recovery! just an update guys, its been 11 days since i was diagnosed, im fully recovered right now i can finally smile again it. dont give up guys !", "If anyone needs someone to talk to going through BP as well.. Hit me up! Even if I do not have it when you do I will never forget this feeling I am going through right now.. Just wanted to post this because I know going through this alone really sucks. Not that I am alone, my family has been awesome through this ordeal, but I mean as someone going through the same thing at the same time. I was diagnosed with BP on 5/30/17 and it is been about 2 weeks since. I have seen some improvement to my eye but that is about it. (Thank god because that was the most annoying part of this) No mouth or eyebrow movement. Either way I just need to stay hopeful that it will go away.. one thing that I have learned from this is that I took a lot of things for granted. For example, eating, drinking, going outside without my eyes drying out, brushing my teeth, whistling, and most of all smiling..  I am sorry you are going through this. I recently back in the first week of January got diagnosed with BP it was super scary. I am about 99.9% healed but my eye is still sometimes laggy I feel like. If you want to see progression check out my YouTube videos. I wanted to document it for people and myself who are or have been through this. Please do not judge I look terrible :( lol it will get better hang on.\n\n\n SECTION | CONTENT\n:--|:--\nTitle | Bells Palsy Recovery\nDescription | Hello everyone I got diagnosed with Bell's palsy Monday January 9th 2017. What a great way to start off the New Years right. I am making this to document my recovery and to hopefully help other people who are going through the same thing. Please if you have any tips or tricks to speed up the process let me know! I appreciate it and thank you everyone.

Thank you. And yes it is been a challenge for me. But I feel I will be a better person after this. I cannot wait until this is over! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe Hey I had already seen your videos!! That is cool! How long did it take you to go away and have movement on your eyebrow and mouth? Yours looks exactly like mine does right now.. would people say it is severe? I went online and can find waaay worse cases then us but idk how to compare time frames when people say severe cases can take a year to go away. Just updating for people in the future. It is been roughly 65 days since I got Diagnosed with BP. I have recovered SOME, not all but some. I can sleep without taping my eye, I can shower as well. My cheek is moving where it is noticeable! Not much but I can see it when I smile. My teeth still are not showing much when I do, but I am praying it will be soon. I still cannot move my upper lip at all. But my eyebrow is almost 90% recovered! \ud83d\ude0e my speech is waaaaay better now which is awesome! I still cannot whistle \ud83d\ude2d but that is not a need unless you are trying get someone is attention.. but all around I would say I am about 60% recovered. I can live with this but still hoping I recover more. I will update later when something else changes! ", "Tingling sensation in paralyzed half - improvement or deteriation? Last friday I noticed symptoms of what I thought at the time was a stroke, but was given prednisolone within 4 hours of noticing the symptoms, and diagnosed the morning after with bell's palsy. \n\nI have been on prednisolone for 6 days now, and for the last two days my paralyzed half is, for lack of a better word, squirming. Like small worms crawling around in my skin, and only on the affected part of my face. Has this happened to any of you?  I was diagnosed last about 11 days ago, and the weird sensation happened for me and now my face is moving better. It is not 100% but it is probably 80% normal now  That is great! Good to hear you are doing better :) I felt that too in the beginning but I am 7 months in and still miserable. I hope you recover quickly  Thanks. I am sorry to hear that, I am still in a kind of denial/extreme optimisim about this whole thing, but I guess I should prepare for anything. I hope you feel better! Do what you can to get into physical therapy if possible. Steroids can often help rebuild muscle functionality as well. Idk if you are a candidate, but it is something to ask your doc about in case you have not yet.\n\nI was diagnosed 14 years ago, still feel twitches from time to time. I had the same sensations. It turned out to be the nerves returning to normal. But - full disclosure - it got a lot worse before it got better. It was like when you sleep weird and wake up with your arm 'asleep'... first there was no sensation, then unpleasant sensations as the nerves hovering near the threshold level fired the equivalent of random static on a TV screen, then the nerves 'woke up' properly and normal sensation and functionality returned.\n\nMy timeline was similar to yours, I was put on prednisone and acyclovir within hours of onset, got the creepy crawly sensations on day 5, that day and day 6 were completely goddam miserable, then over 24 hours all sensation and most control returned. This felt like winning the BP lottery, but many others have had the same experience... only time will tell. Hopefully it is a short time.\n\n&gt; I am still in a kind of denial/extreme optimism about this whole thing\n\nThat is the sane response at this point.\n\nTake care. Thanks! Someone directed me to a couple of exercises that supposedly help with muscle control, but I am leaving for holiday on Saturday and would not be able to attend regular physical therapy :( Hopefully the steroids do their job! That is great! I am very glad to hear you had a quick recovery! I of course do not expect my experience to be the same, but I sure hope so. \n\nThanks for the bluntness, too. I have been taking selfies every day since onset and it seems to have plateaued. Fingers crossed that the worst has already come!", "Few hours of numbness, 3 months in Hi folks. I have had bells for nearly 3 months now and have recovered quite a lot, im used to having little bouts of numbess every so often but it is been going on for a few hours now. I can still move my cheek as much as I could earlier but the feeling is similar to when your foot goes to sleep, just in my face obviously. Is this normal for this to happen sometimes or is the bells happening again? It is pretty cold here at the moment so could that be causing it? It could be ok and it also could be not. Frankly, anytime I am not sure I head to get medical help and that is what makes me feel secure. It is hard to say honestly, I would follow up with a neurologist. I am about four months in and I do not really have any numbness in the face, just occasional pain from inflammation and severe pain to touch. Wish I could see a neurologist. I have an appointment in March, quickest I could get seen in the UK. My GP is useless as there is no much they really know about it. I do not know if it is just the cold affecting it and making me more aware of the fact it is still a little paralysed. Problem is with bells every little thing makes you panic I guess. I still seem to have the movement that I got back but it is making my anxiety go through the roof. I have a GP appointment on Monday so will see if they can do anything about getting me seen quicker but I do not see it happening", "day 7 - bad side tender? I got off steriods on day 5 with no taper. Yesterday (day 6) my bad side started feeling tender, it was twitching, and tender to touch around my forehead, temple region, near my ears (front and back), cheeks and under my chin and on my jawline. Is this normal??? It sucks, but I would consider it a good sign. are you sure??? i am in a state of panic right now It is very normal. My bad side hurt like hell for about a week, between 7-14 days after onset. A heating pad really helped. You just have to ride it out. No, I am not sure.  I am certainly not a doctor! In fact, I experienced almost no pain.  That being said, many on this sub HAVE, and I am taken to understand it can be extremely uncomfortable.\n\nI have a theory that there are basically two types of sufferers (or perhaps 3 types).  The first is the group whose 7th Cranial is merely damaged or restricted by the inflammation in the eustachian tube.  And the second type are those whose 7th is completely destroyed by the inflammation.  Those  in the first category seem to recover relatively quickly (like less than 8 weeks) and seem to experience pain and constant twitching.  Their nerve simply needs time to heal or even simply regain function as soon as the inflammation goes away.  Those in the 2nd category, like myself, need time to fully re-grow the nerve.  We thusly experience less pain, but need much longer to recover. And our chances to make a full recovery are less than those with the first type.\n\nA possible third type would be those who have chronic or recurring BP.  \n\nIt is probably a dumb idea, but it makes sense to me. ok thank you... ill just try to ride it out :( I would like to add that maybe there is a 4th type even, since I was a mix between the first two. As my cranial nerve was essentially killed off I was in a nearly unbearable pain in my face. It woke me up frequently in the middle of the night. And not just woke me up, but I would be crying as I woke up. And it was not sometimes but more like 5 times a night for about a week or two, it was a nightmare. And then it took me 8+ months to heal and I am still not 100% and likely never will be (it is been a little under 2 years now)", "Bell's Palsy Specialist - So helpful! Last week, ( mentioned Meghana, a Bell's Palsy specialist from India. I knew of her from her YouTube Videos (I will link below). I had a consultation with her this morning, and already feel better about what I am going through. I previously watched a lot of her videos, but she was able to walk me through some of the stretches and exercises to make sure I was doing them right. \n\nI just finished with the whole heat-massage-exercise routine, and my face has not felt this normal since before Bell's Palsy made my face fall off. I know that the last things to come back are my smile and expressions,  but you forget how good it feels to feel normal again. \n\nPlus, this was only $20 (plus transaction fees) so the affordability was another happy thing. \n\nHer youtube link is: (\n\nHer email is  She will get back to you, but we are on opposite time zones, so it usually was overnight.\n\nThanks, ( for mentioning her!", "BP Medication question Hi all, I was diagnosed on Saturday (on day three now). Lost my ability to taste Thursday. Pain in my neck and ear, thought I slept weird. Friday my eye was twitching and my tongue was numb. Woke up Saturday and noticed the right side of my face was droopy and numb. Was still able to blink at that time but knew something was wrong. I called urgent care as they said they would send me to the ER with those symptoms, so we went to the ER.\n\nI was diagnosed with BP right away. He told me my case looked mild, prescribed me prednisone, said I should be fine in a few weeks. In and out super quick.\n\nAfter doing more research on BP when I got home (I had never heard of this) I read that an antiviral should help. Luckily I have some. \n\nI was prescribed a 12 day dose of prednisone (3 pills for 4 days, 2 pills for 4 days, 1 pill for 4 days) with no refills. \n\nOn day three now and my face paralysis is worse. Cannot blink on my own, etc. sleeping is very uncomfortable.\n\nJust curious if I should request a refill if I do not see improvement in a week or so? Wondering what you guys were prescribed and what helped you (including holistic/home remedies)? I am currently uninsured so I would like to avoid the ER/urgent care if at all possible.\n\nI have an acupuncture appointment Wednesday so we will see how that goes. \n\nAny advice helps! \n\n&lt;3 I would not ask to get more\n\nI only got 5 days. Prednisone can have scary side effects. My paralysis is profound as well. \n\nAcupuncture is enjoyable. In the least, it is super relaxing. Okay yeah I would rather not have side effects just want to make sure I am taking care of this. The Er dr did not say to return or follow up. Did they do any scans at the ER? I would follow up with your PCP either way. If you have not had a MRI done, they can refer you to a neurologist who can rule out tumors or any other possible cause. BP is diagnosed basically when everything else has been ruled out but it is best to start meds immediately, in the more than likely event that it is BP. nothing really 'works' for bells palsy, so try all of them lol. hopefully one sticks. recovery rate is pretty good either way, unless you are one of the unlucky ones that has long term bells palsy, in which case, welcome to the club\n\nthe 3 things you didnt mention that i did are lysine supplements, sleeping with an eyepatch, and face massage/exercise. does not feel great, but i convinced myself the pain at least means the nerves still work. eyepatch is so your eyes dont dry out. if you have dry eyes get artificial tears. do not get those vasoconstrictor eyedrops since they make your eyes worse. stick to the instructions, since artificial tears can clog up your eye if you keep applying it. Does not hurt to ask your primary care physician/doc if you should take anti-virals. Like you, I was diagnosed at urgent care and ER. I like and trust my PCP a lot so I scheduled an appointment with my PCP after and he extended my prescription of anti-virals from the ER. He mentioned there is not strong studies on the effect of anti-virals but he is had good effects with his BP patients being on a 30-day anti viral course so that was what he did for me. \n\nThe steroids course they have you on sounds fine to me, basically the initial few days are it and the period after is just to taper off steroids gradually. Pain and feeling worst during days 4-7 is normal, I felt numb first 5 days, then felt pain around my eye, jaw especially near my ear, ear and behind it on days 6-12. \n\nB12 both sublingual and shots - you do not need a prescription for B12 shots and they are pretty cheap (cost $25 per shot at my PCP's and the places that do IV drips for wellness offer them for about $20 per shot). Vitamin C, zinc, lysine too. I throw in curcumin for the anti-inflammation. Apply topical anti-inflammation gel, which you can get OTC, along with OTC arthritis gel and CBD. I have a Foreo (basically a pulsating face cleaner tool) and have use that daily, not sure it helps with anything but just a nice little massage with my face washing. \n\nMy acupuncturist does gua sha and face massages for me too with the acupuncture. Honestly it is relaxing and having to lie there for 25 mins with needles in me was the only way for me to unwind. My acupuncturist also gave tips on face massages using my knuckles at home. She also encouraged brushing/combing my scalp to relieve the pain in my jaw, massaging the ear lobe. She basically told me to avoid the cold or wind to my affected side, along with my neck and head.\n\nEdit: diet! I had the worst diet (processed food and alcohol), went on an anti-inflammation diet and now switched to primarily plant-based with less meat. I thought this video was helpful:  Thank you for this info! I did not mention that I am also taking antivirals. Reaching out to my PCP for b12 shots. Also doing the facial exercises. \n\nYes my diet has changed, no alcohol and really only eating greens and grains because it is hard to chew anything else. Also drinking a TON of water, my skin is super soft now so that is something positive \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nthanks again for sharing! How long did it take for you to recover? Did you have an side effects while tapering off the steroids? I am just into week 3 now (say day 17) and feel like my eye is around 80% - I can raise my eyebrow some and shut my eye and blink. I still tape my eye at night just to be sure. Mouth and cheeks, I am maybe 70% with the upper lip being the last to improve. I can chew normally, smile some and I do not feel like mouth is skewing when I speak but gargling or drinking, there is still some dribble. \n\nNo side effects for tapering off steroids for me though I have been randomly waking up at 4-5am. Maybe the steroids or maybe it is my lungs according to my acupuncturist. That said, I am on a slightly longer course than yours (I am still on 10mg per day) so hoping you will not feel any effects from tapering off!", "Woke up with pink eye I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy on the 1st and have taken great measures to protect my affected eye since I cannot fully close it. Yesterday, I was out and about running errands and my eye was extremely dry, but could not patch it since I was driving. Once I got home (around 6 pm), I taped and patched it. When I took off the patch this morning, I had a layer of mucus (super gross) and my eye was blood shot. I went to urgent care and was told I now have pink eye. I was given antibiotic eye drops and instructed to only patch my eye when sleeping. \n\nI am pretty frustrated with my body right now. These last two weeks I have followed the doctors\u2019 instructions to a tee and am trying to do whatever I can to recover. I just want to be better. \n\nFor anyone currently recovering and using eye patches, be careful and use good hygiene. I know it is a given, but stuff happens!", "Bell's Palsy sucks I have lived with the condition for 7.5 years (second time it is presented in my life)... Most days I am ok with it, and other days I do not want to leave my house. I had a tendency towards melancholy before I was diagnosed, and I fully believe that the condition has brought on full-blown depression at this point. I hate seeing any picture of myself. No one seems to understand the struggle. Thanks for letting me rant.  Physical therapy works wonders if you have not tried it. Thanks. I have tried everything from modern medicine to natural approaches. It is permanent at this point.  19 months here. No fancy solution. Just commiseration. It sucks. I have had it since January 18th 2010. It has gotten slightly better. I can blink which is wonderful. Other than that the left side of my face does not move. I am lucky in that I am a man and can grow a beard so that covers up my crooked smile. But I am with you on not liking my picture anymore. \n\nI just try to remember that there are much worse things to have and I am lucky in so many other areas of life. ", "What are the early signs of BP? I am pretty scared to be honest and I am only 14 I do not know whether or not it is BP or something else but what are the early signs? I cannot go to a clinic due to the corona virus Oh and whenever I blow my cheeks air comes out, I am also having trouble smiling and frowning with the right side of my face I had a headache on the affected side behind my ear for about 4 days before onset.  The day before, I got a cold sore - first one I have ever had in my life.  Then I woke up and 1/2 of my face did not work at all. Man I am pretty scared since I almost show the signs of having BP hopefully it is not though My first sign was it felt like I was struggling to keep one eye open. I put it down to tiredness but in reality it was over compensating because the other would not blink. Oh and a slight earache. I would highly suggest reaching out to your Dr and asking if you can schedule a Telehealth appointment to get diagnosed during this time. Stay calm, and do not stress out because it is a huge trigger for BP. My mother already did, doctor said I probably have BP. Also I am now having trouble closing my right eye, cannot even smile or frown anymore yesterday was fine. Does a mild BP exist? My parents keep telling me that is it is mild and that it will go away Is that so? My first sign is me having trouble smiling and frowning in my right side and that was yesterday, today I am now having trouble closing my right eye I never experienced a earache or a headache yet I was diagnosed yesterday my guy. Most cases will recover in a few months with steroid help.  Can you get seen to be prescribed? \n\nI started with a mild ache behind the ear (though I had a mild migraine a week ago too + am taking over a pub next month lol) so could be any of the triggers. \n\nThen a twitchy chin, Saturday my face was not working as it should. Took a few days to get seen but I could raise my eyebrows but weakly. \n\nDay 2 of pretizone(?) And I can mildly move my right cheek Yep got diagnosed with mild BP though I never experienced a headache or a earache just yet My first signs were having trouble to smile or frown with the right side of my face Now I am having trouble moving anything in the right side of my face My advice would be less worrying, stress never helps anything like this. Get seen and do as they advise There is a scale from 1-6 with six being the worst. Your doctor should prescribe prednisone and anti viral meds. You may experience pain. I had like a 4 on the scale and pain started a week later. I recovered to about 85% in about 3 weeks. Hang in there, it may seem like the end of the world but it is NOT. It gets better. Rest, rest, rest I am not sure, that is something you would have to ask your doctor. The sooner you can get the correct meds the better chance you have make this mild. I got diagnosed yesterday and yes it is mild (thank God) I am now taking those steroid pills and eye droppers I never experienced pain since it is mild Can hardly move anything in the right side of my face, though I can still move my cheek which is a good thing I also did a bit of acupuncture and massage. I would also do face exercises at home. It is very important to rest. You will get better very soon My first symptom was a slightly muted sense of taste, nothing too radical. Next the back and middle of my tongue felt slightly numb on one side, again very subtle and I thought maybe I bit it during sleep. Things quickly went downhill after that and I was able to finally get an appointment with my doctor the same day I could only blink my right eye about 80(ish)%.", "Is this Bells? ", "Hey all so I am the mix like the rest of you. Just got diagnosed with BP on Saturday. On steroids anti viral meds all that stuff. What worked best for you in your experience?  Patience That is the tough part I am slowly trying to wrap my head around for sure. At first rest. Let your body heal, and relax. Then\u2026. Patience and physical therapy. YouTube has good video resources for exercise examples as well. Good luck. Thank you! I took lots of naps and tried to maximize my sleep as much as possible. Other than medication, there is not much more you can do than wait for your body to heal itself, which requires rest and good nutrition.  So sleep and a health diet should probably be your priority. You will get used to it dw And it does get better Rehab exercises, more than anything else Yes\u2026rest, and patience. My experience was that once the nerve started coming back it was painful.  Headaches too. I am 4 weeks in and I look pretty normal, my face is working again. But take it easy for as long as you can. Try to keep your stress level low! The first week is really awful, but it gets better. Hang in there! Meds, rest, and HEALTHY DIET (especially minimizing salty and sugary foods) which can do wonders for fighting inflammation along with meds Was diagnosed this morning. Last night I had a very metallic taste in my mouth.  When I went to brush my teeth my lips on the left were numb.  Feeling and looking like I had Novocain.  Went to ER, they gave me a steroid shot and an anti-viral.  My eye does not close all the way and it is feeling very tired and heavy.  It is one thing after another with my health.  I hope this runs it is cycle fast! I have been having really good response from acupuncture.", "Diagnosed yesterday I was diagnosed yesterday with BP. Im 44/m. Ive always been in good health neg for covid and havent yet received the vaccine. No other symptoms other then the left side of my face is worthless. On anti virals and prednisone. Hope I caught it quick enough. The whole thing makes me mortal and I dont really like it. *reminds us that we are mortal. \n\nIt is made me not take my health for granted. I was also healthy and was 1 day away from getting the vaccine when I was diagnosed.  In the grand scheme of things it is a relatively minor ailment but scary while it is going one. Good luck with your recovery. Thank you. It is so scary when it comes on out of nowhere! I am 44/f and I was diagnosed a month after getting my second COVID shot. I have never had COVID or the other viruses they think are linked to BP. From what I have read, if you start taking your meds within 72 hours of onset, that is the best course of action. I have had it now for 23 days, but have seen a lot of improvement in the last week. I have been taking Vitamin B12 since it is supposed to help with nerve support. There is also an Instagram page called  run by Andrea, who has some videos on there of facial exercises you can do that may help in the healing process. Make sure to take time to rest because your body needs to recover. My b12 will be here tomorrow and im starting facial massage on Wed. I feel like its coming and going now to where a day or 2 ago it was full on. Dont know if its the meds or just what it does. And yeah so came from no where. The worst part is the blinking thing.my eye has been so angry the last couple of days. I keep drops in it but damn.. Yesterday marked my one year anniversary. I was in the exact same boat as you, and now I am back to normal. Took about 3 months. Do not stress. All will be good. Thanks i hope so. Reading how long it some folks is scary. Im used to feeling broken so its a hell of an adjustment. Just checked out your profile, your art is friggin amazing!! Thanks so much :) 51/F. I was diagnosed 3 days ago. I have also never had any of the viral illnesses linked to BP. I had my second Covid Vaccine (Pfizer) a little over a month ago. I am trying not to stress but I am in a surgical weight loss program and received my surgery approval from insurance the same day this happened. I am hoping this does not disqualify me. I can deal with a delay but after all I have put into this program it will break me if it does not go through. This post is essentially, almost exactly me! I turn 44 in a couple of weeks, also M, also just got BP two days ago, also currently unvaccinated, also on the left side of my face, also was crying in frustration yesterday. I am actually on my way out to get meds, but I just read this post which was uncannily remarkably similar to my own, and just had to leave a comment.\n\n  \nSo to OP (and everyone else here), here is to hoping that we all get through this successfully! Well if it helps my eye which was way dead the other day is blinking way better. Which helped alot with the headaches due to i guess the sun always in it. Idk. Mouth is still way dead though and my ear is on its own shit. Been doing the anti viral with prednisone 5000 mcg b12 and fish oil. Stay away from zinc with antivirals I guess. Im only learning as im going. Double check anything I say. Going to get another covid test tomorrow just to make sure im not a symptomatic. I wish you luck. Im really unchanged since my last post. Yesterday?2 days not sure. My meds are up and am searching for a primary. The whole thing is new territory and having state insurance doesnt help.. I am so sorry. I had to help my parents navigate state insurance and at times no insurance for their many health issues. I know it is a difficult road. I wish you luck as well. I saw my neuro yesterday and she is optimistic this will resolve. I just need to be patient.", "Day 6 since diagnosed I have very thankful to find this page, it has been very helpful and encouraging. My story... The left side of my neck, head and ear started to hurt (not like a headache but pain) last Monday. I managed the pain with pain killers and decided to make an appointment (since it is been a while, I figured I should get a check up anyways) but did not have my appointment scheduled until Friday. I woke up last Wednesday and could feel my left eye did not feel so normal when I blinked. I called the ER right away and went in to get it checked out. After ruling out it was not a stroke I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. I was prescribed steroids and anti viral meds. I started meds right away. I was also told it could get worse before it gets better. I followed up with my doctor this last Friday and will have a follow up tomorrow morning so check progress and possible additional steroids maybe needed. My husband says he can barely tell but it sure as hell feels like it is very visible.  I took days off work to get myself together and to see if it would get worse but so far it is been steady. I returned  to work today and I have had a hell of a time trying to focus. Light hurts and my ear still hurts from time to time. Trying to stay in my bubble so i am noticeable. Trying to stay calm and stress free has seemed to be the real challenge. I did have a laugh when after brushing my teeth when rinsing my mouth I could not hold the water in my mouth and just sprayed it all over the sink. Fingers crossed for a speedy recovery. Fingers crossed for you! I caught mine early and fortunately had a pretty quick recovery. My face felt so weird, but lots of people did not even notice unless I brought their attention to it. I can relate so much. I was diagnosed last Friday (07/03/2020) in the ER and since then it is gotten so much worse. I was also told that it will get worse before better, so we shall see. I am also so grateful to have found this page as well!! \ud83d\ude0a Hoping for a speedy recovery for you. I was diagnosed 6-10-20 and it is been about a month since. I would say the first week or two were the toughest, but after that I started getting better day by day. I am almost back to normal now \ud83d\ude0a\nJust rest as much as possible and try to relax. You will feel the nerve start to wake up eventually. Hi, we are nursing students who have been displaced from clinical due to Covid 19. We have found the following information to answer your questions related to Bell\u2019s Palsy. \n\nWhat is Bell\u2019s Palsy? \n\nBell\u2019s Palsy is a disorder that causes sudden weakness of your facial muscles. Cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) controls motor innervation of facial muscles that are what help you do facial expressions like smiling and frowning (Mayo Clinic, 2020). When you have Bell\u2019s Palsy, the facial nerve is inflamed, which makes you lose control of your facial muscles. This causes a stroke like appearance, with one half of your face affected. Your face begins to droop, causing your smile to lean more towards one side and your eye on that side to resist closing. \n\nCausative factors\n\nStudies have shown that impaired immunity from stress , sleep deprivation,  physical trauma and viral infections can trigger symptoms of Bell\u2019s palsy. Here are some lifestyle changes that can be beneficial: \n\n* aerobic exercises such as yoga\n* self care such as getting a massage or facial \n* journaling - get a journal and start writing about things that make you happy, maybe a bucket list. \n* deep breathing- take a deep breath with your nose and let it out slowly. \n* diet- less fatty foods, more greens and vegetables added in your diet. \n\n(National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2020)\n\nSigns and Symptoms \n\n* Rapid onset of mild weakness to total paralysis on one side of your face \n* Facial droop\n* Drooling\n* Pain on affected side by your ear or jaw\n* Increased sensitivity to sound and light \n* Headache\n* Loss of taste \n* Changes in amount of tears and saliva you produce \n\nRisk Factors \n\n* Being pregnant \n* Have upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or common cold\n* Diabetes \n* Obesity\n* Hypertension\n\nManagement &amp; Treatments \n\nCorticosteroids - prednisone \n\nAntiviral Drugs - valacyclovir (Valtrex) and acyclovir (Zovirax) \n\nPhysical therapy, surgery in severe cases. (severe cases) \n\nWhat medications were prescribed to you?\n\nHow old are you?\n\nIn regards to the pain you felt, can you describe it? \n\nDo you have any other relevant past medical history? \n\nDo you have a family history of neurological disorders? \n\nWe are not  medical doctors. Please follow up the advice of your Primary Care Physician. We can answer questions but the information does not replace what your Primary Care Physician.\n\nReferences \n\nBell's Palsy Fact Sheet | National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2020\n\nRetrieved July 07,2020 from  \n\nMayo Clinic. (2020, April 02). Bell's palsy. \n\nRetrieved July 07, 2020, from  Is it possible that you could have been bitten by a tick? I had severe pain under and around my ear and my head felt worse and different than any migraine I have ever had. I was treated at ER for migraine that night. The next day, half of my face was paralyzed, noise was amplified as if someone turned the volume up to 110; tingling in my feet, legs, terrible head pain and exhaustion. I was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy until I was tested for Lyme disease. Here is a link for more info from Massachusetts Eye and Ear                              \nJust a thought. Hope you feel better soon! Thank you, fingers crossed. Thanks So far it is not been any worse just about the same. Not likely but the pain as reduced dramatically since it began. I feel like get headaches now since i am back at work and stain to see the computer all day. Thank you for the information. I have tried some of those. :) My wife just got diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy but she is still freaking out because both sides of her face are affected and she has muscle soreness all over. That site you linked to mentioned how muscle aches are suggestive of Lyme disease, so I am going to have her call her doctor and ask about that. \n\nAlso, she was not prescribed antivirals. Everyone else I am seeing on here was given them, so I wonder why she was not. Anyway, thanks for the tip about Lyme! UPDATE... I am going on day 17 and have regained a lot of movement on my face,, yay!!  But my left eye has been slightly blurry and I am wondering if this is normal and will be fine later?? Has anyone had this before? I cover my eye at night and use drops at night. Can this effect my eye sight permanently? I apologize-I just saw your message. If it is Lyme causing the facial paralysis, then antivirals and steroids are NOT good and can actually do more harm than good. I do hope that she is tested for Lyme disease as bilateral facial palsy is associated with Lyme disease and not often with Bell\u2019s palsy. Hey, no worries on the late response. Come to find out the first hospital misdiagnosed her and she really has Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. We are glad she kept following her gut and questioning her medical care because 2 hospitals missed it before the third one cared enough to explore all options and get a correct diagnosis.", "Feeling better and enjoying life  Congrats! I hope you continue to heal!! How long did it take to get to this point in recovery for you? Did you do anything special? It has been a few weeks and just rest, meds, b12, cbd, etc Congrats! You look great!", "Currently on day 3 of bell's palsy, I feel terrible and my family is not making it any better On day 1, I noticed it but did not say anything. I continued the day as normal and went to work. Nobody in my family noticed. Yesterday it still was not getting any better, so I finally told my parents and went to the doctor. They prescribed me pills and I have to apply eye drops to the affected eye, and wear a eye patch at night. It is unfortunate, but I thought that I could continue my week like I always do without stressing out about it. \n\nWell I was wrong. My parents are very obsessed with appearances and are very narcissistic. My mom cringes whenever she looks at me now, and even tells me to put one hand over the affected area of my mouth when I talk. Both of them forced me to stay home today because \" You cannot go to work looking like that\". They want me to stay locked up in the house and relax but I cannot do that in this dysfunctional ass house! They already stress me out on the regular and it is getting worse. My mom also said: \"Thank God you cannot go to school like that since your semester's over\". \n\n What I also hate is that they keep asking me if I am ok and If it hurts. It is literally just my face, I do not feel anything in the affected area. All I have to do is keep taking the medications and get some rest. They are making me feel like some freak that cannot be seen by anyone. The thing I hate most of all is that they do not want me to go to work until my face heals, which could take WEEKS. I am already missing 3 days of work this week, and it irritates me because I love my job. IDGAF I am going back to work on Friday whether they like it or not. \n\nDo you guys go to work in this condition? Also how do you deal with people looking and treating you a certain way because of it? you got asian parents huh? because that is something asian parents would say. Source: I am asian.\n\nAlso, before i returned to work, i emailed my team and let them know what happened and told them to email me if they needed anything because talking was difficult. In my case, I have bell's palsy on BOTH sides of my face so its even more difficult. I am going on 2+ months now with some improvement. This helped my team understand what was going on with me and to avoid having to explain why i could not talk, multiple times over. \n\nas far as dealing with people looking and treating me a certain way? That is THEIR problem. Not yours. I am so sorry. I am glad that you are improving and are able to get back to work. My parents are Haitian. I had problems with them before this and now it is getting worse. They would die if it turns out that this takes longer than a couple weeks to heal. My managers also know what is wrong with me but it should not stop me from going to work. It is so frustrating, this is why I am trying so hard to move out. Ya your parents do sound crazy but try to understand they are coming from a place of love. Yes it is overbearing and often too much to handle. My mom is the same way and when I finally understood that she really means well but her actions just seems to annoy me a lot, it did not bother me as much. This is what you need to do: accept that they are scared and take it upon yourself to stay calm. It is incredibly hard to do all that but you have to keep trying. The good thing is that if you can overcome this then you might actually be able to deal with some of the other factors in your life that is causing you stress in the first place i.e. your parents giving you shit all the time. Good luck! Thanks, I will try The thing is, when I went through it I took a month off work, because my manager was very understanding. The doctor and physio both recommended time off to reduce stress. If you find comfort at work, and are in a better head space there than home, then work probably would be a better option.\n\nYour parents sound like they are being extremely unreasonable in terms of your appearance. Their main concern should be your health, not your appearance.\n\nIt sounds like your home is toxic, and if your income permits it, I would move out asap. Make sure you tell your parents how you feel and if they are bothered with your appearance then can walk around one folded. People are ignorant. Some people though I was dying when I had my BP. Other people would ask if I had brain damage lmao. People are just not educated on the subject. Trust me you will be fine soon you are bringing stress upon yourself which you do not need at this time. \n\nGet better. I do feel better at work. I feel like they genuinely care about me and I get treated with respect. The work itself is sometimes too much because it is fast paced( It is a restaurant) but overall I love being there. \n\nAlso they have been obsessed with my appearance before this too. I am overweight and they scold me for it all the time. They even stopped getting me birthday cakes every year because of it. My mom does not say it, but I am pretty sure she thinks I am ugly. I have never been told I was beautiful by them and I think that is why I have low self-esteem. \n\nSorry if I got a bit off topic\ud83d\ude02 Thank you Your parents are dicks. All good, stress at home could be a contributing factor. I took the steroids, anti vitals, did physio and acupuncture. My case cleared up within 1 month and I have a full recovery. If your nerve damage was minimal then you should have a good recovery percentage I hope you are one of the lucky ones where it only takes a couple weeks to recover. I have heard of it happening, but from what i have heard from others around me and from what i have read, it takes on average several months to fully recover. \n\nHopefully you can move out and get out of your situation at home. Bell's Palsy aside, its definitely not an ideal situation. Good luck. Thanks, you too. I am a rare case that has a recurring type of BP. I have had it 4 times now,  most recent time being this year, in May. Took me about 3 months to recover \u2013 I got a strong dosage of steroids (in pills and injections) that really speeded up the recovery process. \n\nMy doctor strongly recommended taking sick leave. She was shocked when I decided to continue working. \n\nI am a high school teacher and I did not want to miss classes before the end of the school year. My students were super nice and understanding about it. I explained what was going on, they asked a few questions and that was it. Nobody made fun of me or made weird comments. My family was very supportive as well. I guess we kind of got used to it by now. \n\nAnyway, I am sorry to hear your family is so insensitive about the whole thing. Please stay strong and do not worry about it too much. It eventually goes away. Best thing you can do is to try to ignore it and do your own thing.", "Potential Ideas for speeding up your Bells Palsy recovery (from a former patient) First of all, let me just say that this is NOT medical advice, I am not a doctor.\n\nI was diagnosed with Bells Palsy a year ago, at the age of 39. And luckily, after about 4-6 weeks, I was almost completely healed. It was the scariest time of my life, and I thank god every day that I had a full recovery. I realize that not everyone is as fortunate.\n\nThat said, I am back here to help share some things I did that may (or may not, who really knows?) have helped with my recovery. My hope is that it helps someone.\n\n1. The biggest thing I did was see a doctor the VERY SAME DAY. He prescribed antivirals, which have been well documented throughout this forum. Follow your doctor's advice to a tee. Do not leave it to chance - this is your body and your life!\n2. Tape your eye shut on the side of the face affected. My brother, who is an ophthalmologist, STRONGLY recommended I do this, even though I could close both my eyes relatively easily. In the same vein, be sure to put drops in your eyes every hour. Eye health is so, so important.\n3. Lastly, I loaded up on vitamin B12 (non-prescription, available at any pharmacy) and took a tablet every day. I read somewhere that people that did this recovered quickly. I dont know if this is what helped, but I am glad I did this.\n4. Most of all, stay positive, and tell yourself, that even if it takes a year, you WILL get better! Think positive, happy thoughts. Go out and get some sunlight as much as you can, even on days when you do not feel like it. The body and the mind are really more interconnected than we think. \n\nThat is all. I know this is a very scary condition, but my thoughts and prayers are with all of you. I hope this helps you, even if just a little bit.   \n\n\u2764\ufe0f You had one eye taped shut for 4-6 weeks? Not the entire time...just while I slept...and for a few weeks at most. I wish I had been more disciplined about it. This is on point. I had it June 1st and was not fully recovered til September but got 85% back by end of june. I went for massages took a leave of absence from work, and just relaxed as much as I could. Only once i accepted it did it get better. Make sure you eat right and exercise alsoC do everything you can to maintain a healthy lifestyle I see. That part was not clear. You inspired me to take another b12. For how long did you take took a leave of absence? Taking rest is very important for recovery. 4 weeks. I had headaches and could not close my eye. My mouth was affected too so I could not always speak properly, I am a training manager so I was not able to run classes due to Bell\u2019s palsy B12 tabs gave me serious stomach problems idk if that is normal so I stopped them I use liquid form. Your body also absorbs it a hell of a lot better. \n\nYou can also try injections. Ive tried nearly everything so far and I am 2.5 months in with no improvement :( My thoughts are with you. Stay positive.. May I ask why taping the weak eye is helpful?  I just came down with symptoms in last 2 days and saw the doctor a couple hours ago.   My paralysis is not bad enough yet that my eye doesnt close.\n\nMaybe while sleeping it gets worse?\n\nThank you. I was in the same boat. My eye would 95% close...this may get worse over the coming week or so, dont freakout if it happens.\n\nTaping the eye shut is a good idea to prevent permanent eye damage and to make sure it stays lubricated, which I assume you do not want to happen to you. Can you smile properly/open your eye properly on the affected side? You are correct, I definitely dont want that!!  Thanks so much for responding.  They gave me the works, as far as treatment.  A steroid shot today and oral steroids, muscle relaxers and an antibiotic.  16 pills a day for the next week!  Plus, they are testing for lyme disease because even though I dont recall being bit, lyme disease is rampant in my area.\n\nI am hoping the treatments will stop the progression before i get to the drooling stage. Now? In my case, yes...I am completely healed. It is almost like I never had Bells Palsy. But again I believe I am one of the lucky ones..\n\nI hope the same for you. Aghhh lucky! Wish I was the same \ud83d\ude02 Glad you fully healed tho haha Thank you....but again, I hope the same for you. We cannot control everything but we can do everything in your power to try to get better - it is worth it. It is my pleasure, and I wish you a speedy and 100% recovery!", "Response to massage? Hello all,\n\nI have had BP for almost 6 weeks now and I still have no voluntary control over any of my facial muscles on that side.  But I have started to notice something very weird:  if I massage my forehead, for instance, very firmly, within a few seconds, the eyebrow on that side will rise (completely involuntarily) pretty high, as if I am emoting.  Same thing happens to my bottom lip if I scratch my cheek roughly (I have a beard).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I do the same to the healthy side of my face, there is no reaction.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid anybody else experience this? What might it mean, if anything? Is it just the skin tightening in reaction to irritation, or is it the muscles underneath? I think it does help - also exercising by making extreme faces to move the muscles.  I went a step further and had acupuncture and it seemed to help. ok, thank you! It helps. You are stimulating the nerves underneath and waking them up. They are just paralyzed and inflamed but you got this! Never stop moving your face constantly massage and chew gum! Do not let cold air blow on your face or back or neck because cold can paralyze the nerves. Warmth can wake them up.\n\nI had BP in June 2018 for the whole summer. I am totally fine now :) Thank you very much! I just could not tell if maybe it was just my skin reacting.  I will keep rubbing, then! I had bells palsy 2 years ago. I went in for acupuncture &amp; had facial massages. It was the only thing that helped. I am waiting to talk to my doctor in a few days, and I will ask about acupuncture (the ER doctor who first saw me because I thought I was having a stroke suggested acupuncture also) but it is not covered by my insurance plan.  So I will have to shop for a provider.  Thanks! My physical therapist told me to tap on my face lol it seemed silly but I guess it all helped if I am better now :) I still feel twitching under the skin if I am tired stressed or really hungry but at least I can move my face and close my eye again lol ok thanks! Sooner the better.  I wish I did not wait a week to get acupuncture done.  After a week of doing it a total of 3 visits, I was able to close my eye fully and raise my eyebrow.  Nose and mouth have also made progress. 3 Week mark tomorrow. It is really interesting and mysterious, is not it? I personally know a gentleman who was diagnosed in February of this year and he made a complete recovery also in 3 weeks, and he did absolutely NOTHING.  In fact, he even stopped taking the Prednisone after only a day or two.\n\nI am not sure there really is any rhyme or reason to it.  But I am willing to try! It really is.  Friend of mine's wife had it and did not take anything and was gone a lil over a month.  Mind over matter with that placebo effect cannot hurt!", "Slight vertigo. Barely noticeable but I can still feel a difference. Is this normal for anyone else? I do not know if this is common but I feel ever so slightly off balance on my left side. For the record, the right side of my face is paralyzed which I think is affecting my balance on my left.\n\nAnyone else felt/went thorugh anything similar? I do not think I have ever felt dizzy,  but I find myself stumbling/unbalanced more frequently than normal. Like putting socks on I find I lean one way more than normal, and I trip more frequently when walking/moving. I never thought it was connected but it could be! ", "Follow up picture to my previous post ", "Electric stimulation for treated lingering muscle weakness. Talk to me! I have been talking to a physical therapist in SF Who is interested in treating me with and electrical stimulation device. Cheese only talk to me on the phone and has not seen me in person. But when I describe my situation she immediately thought of using electrical stimulation to help with my residual effects of Bell\u2019s palsyit.\n\nAbout me: i have had Bell\u2019s palsy the three times since 2000. The second time I had it I trusted my Doctor Who said prednisone and antivirals actually did very little to help so did not bother prescribing them. I did not object because I trusted him and because I recovered fully from my first bout. I was not going to be so lucky the second time around or the third and today my left side has about 85% function or so. I have decided to be more proactive about seeking therapies even at this late stage because I feel like the side of my face is starting to atrophy.\n\nI would love to hear about your experience with electrical stimulation especially if it is with the machine like this one.\n\n\n\nThe PT suggested I buy it and she teach me how to use it and treat myself. It seems like a pretty cost effective and Covid safe solution. I did electrical stim at PT for a year. Biggest regret I have. It caused synkinesis and did not improve my condition at all. \n\nOP: buyer beware. There is not a lot of data or studies out there about electric stimulation therapy and BP. I am sorry you did not get the prednisone and acyclovir. To be honest I had both of those and still do not have full movement back so it is hard to tell how much they would have helped. \n\nI used an electrical stimulation device from my PT for a while after I got Bell's Palsy. Only thing it did was give me synkinesis. Seriously I really wish I had never used it at all. That was 20 years ago and I still have synkinesis.\n\nI have just about every synkinesis mishap you could have - eye closes when I smile, eyebrow raises when I move my mouth, mouth lifts when I blink, my eye tears when I salivate. \n\nBottom line: I would not risk it, if there is not a guarantee it would get you that last 15% and it is likely to cause more problems.\n\nTry visualization exercises where you close your eyes and visualize symmetry. Try different facial expressions and visualize them happening on both sides of your face. You can exercise the muscles without using an unnatural source to stimulate them. Wow thank you for your reply. So this means you now have synkinesis where none existed before? That is awful. :(\n\nIf it works as a treatment modality for other muscle groups does it not work well foe the face? I dont know if I can answer that as my experience may be unique and there is not a lot of data available for doctors to make educated treatment recommendations. Definitely consult a neurologist or a doctor from a Facial Paralysis clinic/institute before doing it though. I am sorry to hear about your ongoing synkinesis. Do you happen to know what kind of electrical stimulation you were getting? \n\nTell me more about this visualization. Is it something you have tried yourself with success? And have you ever tried a micro current device like nuface? Yeah. The problem is that anyone with any experience with it does not seem to be in my network! Some have free consultations if you go to like Facial Paralysis Institute.  I was seeing a RMT and acupuncturist who offered the option of trying an acupuncture pen (Pointer Plus) during our monthly sessions. I was hesitant but at about 8 months in I had already developed some synkinesis so figured I had nothing to lose if I tried it. I found it helped with muscle tightness as well as nerve stimulation. \n\nAbout 4 months after that I bought my own and started using it regularly. And I still use it 3.5 years in. Just yesterday I was using it around my mouth and got more feeling and movement back in my lower lip. Can I guarantee that it will have the same effect for someone else? Nope-Bell\u2019s is a strange creature.\n\nIt may not be for everyone and you will have to determine for yourself if it is something you feel you are willing to risk. For me, I feel like it was well worth it, but I was extremely cautious about it is use initially and started off slowly. \n\nI also agree with using visualization as a tool. I also have used other therapies such as massage, acupuncture (in the unaffected side- which I found very helpful!), osteopathy, speech therapy, self massage and facial stretches. \n\nHope this is helpful! Yes very helpful thank you! If you have any links to resources like self massage and exercises. that would be great (\n\nI have found this series of videos to be very helpful since the beginning :) \n\nA bit reluctant to share this but if it helps someone else- here goes! I live in a place where marijuana is legal and also use that to help relax my facial muscles. I find, depending on the strain, I am more able to \u2018tune in\u2019 to the sensations going on and the minute changes happening. \n\nHonestly I sort of go with the flow on my face \u2018workouts\u2019 and have come to realize in the last few months that it is not just about stretching the muscles but also encouraging them in their opposite function. For example- if I open my mouth and jaw as wide as they can go, the palsy side opens way too far to be a match for my good side. So I try to use the corresponding muscles on my palsy side to close my jaw to \u2018match\u2019 as closely as I can. \n\nI try to be mindful of what feels like it needs some help in my face and will honestly spend upwards of two hours sometimes on a \u2018workout\u2019. \n\nI also touch both sides of my face in the place I am working on to help determine what action that particular muscle should be engaging in and just work on improving that.\n\nI have had a lot of success! What I have tried may not work for everyone, but it is working for me. I will note that because I have learned to live without specific movements, even if I get some movement back, I have to be super duper aware of trying to utilize those muscles on the daily or they stay fairly atrophied. \n\nOh! And I also tried KT tape on my face and neck to keep the overly tight muscles in check so I can work on the muscles that have some very small movement but are being inhibited by the stronger ones. Where you put the tape is sort of determined by which muscles are too tight- I had to do a lot of research where muscles originated and ended to figure out which direction and which way the tape should be \u2018pulling\u2019 the muscle. I saw some success with this as well-along my jawline-but it is uncomfortable and can leave red marks after the fact.\n\nI think those are all the things I have tried other than a mostly healthy diet and some lion\u2019s mane mushroom supplements.", "Week 4 I am happy to say that I am about 97% cured from Bell\u2019s palsy. The first couple of days were really hard but I promise you it does get better with time! You have to stay positive!! I also did 3 sessions of acupuncture which i believe really helped speed up the process.", "Does facial movement just return one day? It is Day 45? (or maybe just day I cannot keep track of) I am definitely feeling like my face is symmetrical again with just a little pulling on the eye brow. I feel like i am about to start movement again.\n\nI wanted to know for those who remember getting movement back, is it gradual (like slight lip movement one day and then it built up) or will it sort of be like a switch and my face works again with some slight weakness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know everyone recovers differently but maybe some info on how others recovered and when would help me compare as to a estimation of when I might start moving? Right now I am guessing I am on the 2- 3 months or longer track Do you feel some twiching( muscle moving by itself) It is gradual. Or at least was for me. And definitely had some twitching during the recovery. Still have a bit of ( nearly 3 years later.. Depends. I was able to have 90% return. I look mostly normal, you have to really loo for it. I still have some numbness and delay in movement. I use straws as occasionally my mouth betrays me and I end up dribbling when drinking from a cup. Still cannot whistle either. Hope you have a full recovery.  I do not, I did when i was doing acupuncture and electrolysis, but I believe anyone would feel that given it is electricity  It took me 3 months to start my recovery. It started with tingling and then some vibration plus slight movement be strong and do not strain your face too much!\nNow it is been over a year for me I still have synkinesis too but it only shows when I am extremely exhausted Gradual. Some things you only notice after a bit and you think wow that is quick but it takes time bro. 15 months 90% as gorgeous as I was before, I and want staring with much.  Nothing happened for 4 months and then I had the tiniest bit of movement. Gradually, I improved over a few months.\n\n I am one of the rare people who did not get much function back. But actually, it is not so bad. My friends cannot tell I cannot move my mouth. And apparently, I kiss just fine :)\n\nIt is an amazing feeling when you see that first bit of movement. I posted a video on Facebook b/c I was so happy. It is like getting over the hump. \n\nHang in there.  Gradual for me as well. I cannot remember the timeline too well since it was like 13 years ago. I feel like I have recovered 100% but there are some days when I am a little weak on that side. Also I get twitches in my face muscles, especially in my eye muscles on that side, and worst of all I get occasional severe pain on that side from time to time, especially when I am coming down with a cold or when I am under a lot of stress. &gt; ctually, it is not so bad. My friends cannot tell I cannot move my mouth. And apparently, I kiss just fine :)\n&gt; \n&gt; It is an amazing feeling when you see that first bit of movement. I posted a video on Facebook b/c I was so happy. It is like getting over the hump\n\nThat Is funny I was thinking I would post once I get movement, I might even mark the day down in history LOL Interesting I think those 2 I have narrowed down as being the culprit for all of this. I have it since feb 7 and st about 4-5 weeks starting noticing I can move my brow and now I notice it moving more. Basically it is been gradual for me. Each week I notice more and more. Everyone around me says I am starting to look better. Hopefully we all have a strong recovery.

It  is really scary and I know everyone says to be patient, but its hard not to think about the worst case scenario. Hope all heals well Have u been doing anything ? Like acupuncture or exercises? I have been doing acupuncture and he recommended some Chinese herbs to strengthen the immune system. I am willing to try anything.  I am ten days in since symptoms started. It is gradual. I notice my smile getting a bit Fuller, talking a bit easier, my affected eye is not watering like a sprinkler, and eating usually not as messy. And the tingling and tightness sensations on that side of my face are less frequent. I did it for 3 weeks, But I did not see any progress. I have total paralysis of my right side so it might be a little longer for me. I will say that I do feel better and my face looks symetrical again, but movement has not returned I am at day 50 and maybe 75% recovered. \n\nAfter day 20 everyday there was slight improvement till day 35... Since then I am somewhat the same since last 15 days.. Are u able to smile at all? What improvements have you noticed. I am at week 6 I would say 70% of my smile is same as before. There is a slight difference but not much. \n\nGive it some time, i joined a help group and heard a lot of stories. Everyone has their own healing speed. Some people were 100% back in 14 days, while some started healing only after 60 days. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry and take lots of rest and do facial exercises. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwish you a speedy recovery", "Acupuncture question Anyone who has seen results for bp through acupuncture can you please describe how acupuncture helps in treatment of bp?  I am not sure about the science behind it on how it can be effective treatment. I began acupuncture the very next week after being diagnosed. And by week 3, my recovery started to show, and now I am close to fully recovered (99%). \n\nIt is easy to assume the acupuncture played a part. But the truth is, I have no idea. For me to ever know, I would have to have BP and measure my recovery without acupuncture. \n\nSo my only conclusion is, acupuncture did not make it worse, so might as well do it. I cannot expain the exact science but there is good info out there about different studies done. \n\nMy simple understanding is that the acu needles are placed in facial muscles that are paralyzed. This stimulates the muscles and nerves and promotes blood flow to that area. \n\nFrom an Chinese medicine point of view  the needles are placed on specific places to help the chi start flowing again. Balancing the chi is an important for overall health.  \n\nIt also is a stress reliever which is helpful to heal from any illness or disease. \n\nAgain, I am not a Dr but I had positive results from acupuncture and that is my basic understanding. Per my doctor, who consulted with the local neurologist, there is enough scientific evidence to show a causal relationship between acupuncture and increase recovery time, but I am told they do not know the specific mechanism. They also told me results vary. \n\nFrom my first hand experience, after some treatments I noticed specific (but minor) gains immediately following. I cannot rule out the the placebo effect, however I was not expected to see that type of change. I also noticed a marked reduction in pain, which was a major issue for the first month or so (which I was expecting).   \n\nThe specific gains I noticed were all related to new movement is areas where I was none prior (e.g. eye brow movement). Sometimes it would fade away for a few days before sticking, other times there would be no regression. \n\nOn my unscientific ranking of \u201cthings that seemed to help\u201d, this came in after the anti-virals and B12, but ahead of everything else.", "Hi did anyone mostly or completly recover after the paralysis did not improve after 3 weeks? I think some tension (very little) returned to my face but I still cannot move anything. Is there still hope?  I remember the first days after my diagnosis very clearly.  I had my first symptoms on March 6, and did not see any improvement until week 3.  Even when I saw improvement, it took several more weeks to get close to a full recovery.  The medications will not work immediately, but they will improve your chances of recovering.  Most of the people on this group are people like you, who are in the early stages, or people who had especially bad cases of Bells Palsy.  Most people will start to improve in 1-3 months.  I was on the shorter end of that.  Here are some things that I did, that I think helped me recover quickly.\n\nMost importantly - get as much rest as you can.  I took a week off of work, and laid in bed.  If you cannot do that, try to get as much extra rest as possible.  Give you body time to heal.  \n\nAvoid stress.  It is hard not to worry about your health, but try to be positive.  Do things you enjoy and spend time with friends/family (as safely as you can during the pandemic)\n\nTake ibuprofen for pain.  The nerve pain that I felt around the 2 week mark was really uncomfortable.  Ibuprofen or other anti inflammatory medications help.  Do not get discouraged if you get worse before you get better.  The pain in your face and behind your ear is a sign that your nerves are starting to heal.  \n\nConsider taking vitamin B12 - I took 5,000-6,000 micrograms per day.  I still take a daily dose.  It helped me with the overwhelming fatigue, and gave me the energy to get back to work.\n\nTry elderberry supplements if you have access to them in your country.  They are supposed to promote healing and help with nerve regeneration.  \n\nFacial exercises starting at week 2 or 3.  Search google for \u201cBell\u2019s palsy facial exercises\u201d\n\nI avoided alcohol during my recovery - I am not sure if it was necessary, but I do not think it hurt.\n\nStay positive.  Stress is a contributing factor for Bells Palsy, and staying positive will help you heal.  \n\nI hope this helps you.  You are still very early in the process.  This is not like a cold or flu - it will not go away quickly.  But it will get better for most people over time. Me. It took me 5 months before I could close my eye. It is coming up on a year next month, but if you looked at me, you would not notice unless I mentioned it. Take progress videos. It will help you see minor improvements. It is going to be gradual since nerve regeneration is slow. Yes i did mostly recover, it took nearly a year.", "Acne on one side of my face after Bells Palsy At the beginning of summer I experienced Bell\u2019s palsy (cause unknown) and I slowly recovered for about a month or so. \n\nRecently I tried a new skin care routine and started incorporating chemical exfoliants (BHA). The exfoliant because brings up all the dead skin cells and junk in your pores to the surface of your skin. For a while when you first use the exfoliant your skin will basically purge and you will get a lot of pimples. \n\nI have noticed that I am only getting pimples on the left side of my face (where I had my paralysis). Anyone know if the bells and my acne are related or have any experience getting pimples from bells? I did not do anything for treatment. So no steroids! Yes I got a pretty bad breakout of acne (mainly on the affected side) when I finished the steroid treatment and I am pretty certain it is linked to bp Yes and I never had axns before hope the acne and left over marks clear up did you do any steroids? I have never had acne like this either! I did not do steroids though. Yes I am so sorry have u tried dermarolling I think nerve damage has to be related to acne No I have not! I will look it up :) I am thinking so! My face still gets sore and stiff. \ud83d\ude48 It is been like 3-4 months! Ugh \ud83d\ude29 I am sorry that you are going through this it is so horrible and no one understands unless they are going through it it is so weird the stiffness it is like gllue dried on your skin\n I highly recommend stretching your forehead cheeks and eyes while taking a shower Oh and I have synkinesis \ud83d\ude22", "Ear drops? What is all this about ear drops? My GP did not give me any. Let us know if you learn anything. Have not heard anything about this! I know nothing about this will be following this one here.", "I am on day 6 and feeling pretty discouraged. Diagnosed at 1 week postpartum. So my symptoms started with the tip of my tongue being numb and I could not taste as well with it. That lasted about 3 days before I realized half of my mouth was not working (I was trying to drink out of a straw).. so I looked in the mirror and realized it was actually the whole left side of my face. I went to the ER thinking I was having a stroke.. I had a super complicated pregnancy &amp; chronic hypertension so it would not have been surprising to me honestly. My blood pressure was pretty high when I got there. Like 181/109. I am taking my blood pressure meds again. they did a CT scan and MRI.. no signs of stroke. &amp; the paralysis was only in my face. So I got diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy. I feel like I will never get my smile back. I feel ugly. I did not realize how shallow and vain I am I guess. Which almost makes me feel worse. Ok this is turning into a pity party. Sorry lol. It is just crazy the things you take for granted. I am on antivirals and steroids but they only gave me a medrol dose pack for the steroid which seems pretty weak compared to the other steroid doses I have seen on here. Not sure if I should call my doctor and ask again or what. Just venting and looking for stories/advice/encouragement I guess. Unfortunately patience is the key, try to rest/relax and destress best you can for awhile. I totally understand as I went through all of it minus giving birth. Stay away from Dr offices, you will be fine. You may experience pain as well but you will get better. Hang in there So sorry this is happening so close after your baby is born!\n\nThe thing that helped me the most was rest (in education so I was able to rest since it happened the first week of summer).\n\nI read and researched about exercises for the face. But do not start these right away.\n\nGet back in touch with your dr especially if it is still getting worse.\n\nLook up Rachel Hollis (girl wash your face author) she has a blog about getting bells palsy in Europe. She is had it 3 times, but is very encouraging. OH ME TOO. I was diagnosed exactly one week postpartum. I noticed muscle weakness in my eye on the way to the doctor for my incision check. I had a great pregnancy, normal blood pressure and little almost no swelling. But my labor was 17 hours ending in c-section, TONS of swelling after surgery and after getting home. \n I started on prednisone and antivirals about 48 hours after onset. It is been almost a year and no one would ever know I had it by looking at me, but it took about 6-8 weeks until I felt like I had my smile back. I am sorry you are going through this...and after such and important time in your life having a newborn. \n\nI hope you can take my advice when I say PLEASE TAKE PICTURES WITH YOUR BABY. I did not...I hated my face, I cried everyday, I spent all day on reddit, and google, searching for cures to make it go away fast. I made countless trips to the pharmacy and multiple Amazon purchase trying vitamins and natural remedies. I also felt shallow, I did not know how much I loved my face and loved my smile and how pretty I thought I was before this, and how I feel bad my husband has an ugly wife now...it was really depressing and awful, and I regret it completely. my daughter was my first and only child, and I spent the 7 weeks of first time on this planet just worrying about my face. Yes it is important to people, no it is not shallow, but you have to give it time...just know it will be better. It is very very rare not to heal, especially for women who have it following pregnancy. My doctor has never seen someone take longer than a few months to recover fully, \n\nI wish you the best, and please enjoy you are baby, if I could go back in time and enjoy mine instead of stressing I would. \n\nAlso, CBD oil helps with inflammation and nerve damage...I used it and think it helped! Thank you so much! Yeah you pretty much described exactly how I am feeling. I still hate laughing and find myself covering the left side of my face when I laugh hard. I hate feeling embarrassed of my face and smile. It is definitely humbling. And changing my perspective on a lot. I really appreciate you sharing and the advice. \u2764\ufe0f You are welcome! Just hang in there...WAY easier said than done...I never really got used to it, and it always made me sad deep down, but eventually I did learn to laugh at it a bit!", "Progress none the less    Last night, I noticed that I could move my BP cheek. It is been almost 3 months since the 6th of June. It is such a great feeling! I started out doing all these suggestions such as face massages and oils, no therapy due to expenses but after 2 months and reading about synkineisis, I was defeated. \n    So I have just been living. Doing what I want to do and helping when I want (I feel these were stressors prior to BP plus turning 30). I do still notice facial soreness in the areas above my eyebrow, under my cheek near my nose, and my lower jawline; that is when I will massage my face to release the tension.\n    I go for a PT consult tomorrow. I am anxious and a little nervous because I do not want to negatively affect recovery, however, I want to do all I can to smile again \ud83d\ude01 #Progress We are almost in the same boat! I was diagnosed May 11th and on August 10th, I started being able to move my mouth! Every day I am making progress. I hope you will smile again soon! You too, dear! Thank you! It was almost exactly 3 months from onset before I started to see any recovery.  Do your exercises, now! All the time. Well, whatever your Doctor says of course. Yes! I thought I went to PT today, but it is actually tomorrow! I am excited to hear what they have to say! Thanks!! Yes! I thought I went to PT today, but it is actually tomorrow!

So obviously half of my mouth is not working, does it make sense that half of my taste buds are not working? I can taste fine on my left side, which I still have control over, but on my right food tastes different like a dull taste. My teeth are going to hate me if I can only enjoy food on one side of my mouth. It is a very common symptom of BP. However, it is usually the symptom that disappears the fastest. For me, I started being able to taste things again in the afflicted side, around day 10 or so. okay, I just thought I was crazy for losing it on one side only. it is been 7 days since I have been diagnosed but I did not lose the taste right away. It was one of the first things I noticed, that everything just tasted off due to the one side.   It lingered a little longer for me, but went away after a couple weeks. I hope it does not last too long for me, thank you for your help! It took me longer to realize that I could not taste on my afflicted side. I am now at ten weeks and still cannot taste on the left side; it is all just a weird unflavored paste. I actually lost my ability to taste the day before my paralysis set in. But yeah, everyone is experience is of course slightly different :) I lost my taste the day before but came back in around 2 weeks or so. This is perfectly normal for BP, do not freak out x Completely normal.  It was one of the first symptoms I noticed.  I did not notice when my taste buds started working again (unlike my eyelid, that was a great day) but they did!\n\nBest wishes for fast and full recovery. Mine started with the tongue. That and excessively dry eye on that side. The paralysis took another 24 hours or so to start setting in. \n\nIt is kind of a weird nerve. It controls mostly motor function, but also the taste buds, but not the motor functions of the tongue. The human body is strange. But, what is your experiencing is normal for the disease.", "Is it ok to continue gymming with bells palsy? Around 2.5x bodyweight bench, squat, deadlift etc \n\nI am a 19 male, gymmed regularly before Bells Palsy and got it after getting my head hit by a bar\n\n\nIts been 8 days since onset and I have finished the steroids that the doctor has prescribed me.\n\nFace is slightly sore to the touch and I can blink normally, should I start gymming again? \n\nThank you I would get cleared since you had a head injury. Head injuries should always be taken seriously despite the type of injury. I did CT and MRI scan and both turnt out fine, did not even get a concussion but somehow got bells palsy\n\nDoctor said bells palsy is unrelated to gymming but I am still worried since my face tenses up when I push. Will it affect recovery negatively? \n\nThank you so much for your prompt reply! I would not. Lifting most likely puts pressure on your face and stresses your body out. You should be resting and not putting any type of strain on your body especially your face. \n\nThat is just my opinion but docs always tell you to rest a lot and not stress at all. That Is true. \n\nI thought about it and I will rest for another week or two before continuing. What Is the rush anyway, right?\n\nThank you for your advice Yeah no rush and you are young so your recovery shoud be fast and 100%. Do not risk it at all. \n\nGood luck! It could irritate the 7th cranial nerve and either cause pain or make the drooping more noticeable. Alright, I will hold off lifting for a while. Thank you! Thank you!

I am an EMT  and I am constantly interacting with people. I am sorry you are going through this. I was diagnosed last Saturday, so I am 9 days in. I cannot really help with the first part, but I am a therapist and also work face to face with a lot of people.  I just tell people right away, explain what it is if they ask, make a couple jokes, and move on. People are usually really cool about it! &gt;what is the best way to explain this to people? I am an EMT  and I am constantly interacting with people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work at a courthouse and give face-to-face instructions and information to people all day.  First few days were rough.

It was not a big deal and when I did talk about BP, everyone I talked to either had it or knew someone who did recently. \n\nI did not see any improvement for 3 months and it took another 3 to forget I had an issue. I woke up one day and was like whoa, I can close my eye and move the side of my face. \n\nThe only OTC stuff I used was an eye patch and lubricating eye drops (not the normal version, this stuff was very viscous). \n\nThe only thing that did not recover are my tear ducts which apparently are frozen open or something? When I eat my eye waters pretty bad. Nothing major though, just kind of weird. I told people \u201cit is crazy my face is paralyzed I just woke up one day and could not move the left side.\u201d \n\nIf they asked what caused it I said \u201cthere is a little nerve canal in your face that your brains sends signals through to move the muscles ..... well I guess I was stressed and the canal got inflamed so it shrank and now the nerves cannot get through\u201d\n\nIf they asked how to cure it I would say \u201cI dunno. I guess I just got to wait and relax and hopefully it will get better on its own in time.

But apparently there must be different types of antibiotics? \n\nMay I just recommend you do facial exercises as often as possible, chew gum on the affected side and try to blow balloon. I find that it really helped my recovery and my doc says the soon you start, the better results you get. \n\nHope you will recover soon. Interesting. I went to urgent care when I had it and got the usual meds prescribed for it. Make sure you tape your eye shut at night and try not to freak yourself out by reading up about people who do not get better (most do). I got super worried I would be like that forever and ended up being back to normal in just two weeks. my bell\u2019s palsy went away after taking intravenous ceftriaxone for a month with a picc line , ask your doctor about certain antibiotics that pass the blood brain barrier or seek an infectious disease specialist at a hospital near you", "1 year BP anniversary (75% return); 48 hours post first Pfizer vaccine, no recurrence Just putting this here for anyone having doubts.

I will definitely be laying off alcohol for a while. Any info will help :) \n\nThe right side of my face is numb. I can still blink and close both of my eyes, though my right eye waters a lot.

No idea!\n\nThere are people on this sub who have worse recoveries than I, but I do not know what their opinions are. Thank you! I have read some articles on people using medical marijuana to help with some symptoms, but again not much research has been done. CBD, for sure, gets promoted pretty well here.  I figure, what is wrong with feeling at ease, too? Whenever I am on any medication  I stop consuming any THC or CBD just to be on the safe side. Mine is goin a way fast! I used CBD and I honestly think it helped a lot. I also smoked but with my mouth not working properly it was difficult. I recovered in 5/6 weeks from onset In the occasion you get nerve pain it will severely help and im sure the CBD will assist too but itd be more of a question to ask a doctor.

It is my 7th week dealing with BP with no major improvements (I only regained the ability of drinking normally and washing my mouth without looking like a fountain). Today during my acupuncture session, the doctor said he thinks my mouth looks more crooked than last week. Is it possible to get worse after so long?\n\nI have already lost all hope I am going to recover someday. Are you doing exercises to work those muscles? I suffered from BP but recovered decently quick, saw some movement after 3-4 weeks and though I still do not feel 100% recovered I would say after 10 months from initial diagnosis I am doing fairly well (maybe 98% recovered) but exercises helped a lot What kind of exercises? When I try doing them my muscles loosen up so much and actually look worse as if they are drooping? Safety Considerations\nExercises for Bell\u2019s palsy are considered to be quite safe to do at home, unsupervised. However, you should not overexert yourself or your muscles. Do not worry about completing all of the exercises if your muscles are telling you to stop.\nAlso, you do not want to force the two sides of your face to work against each other. If during your exercises for Bell\u2019s palsy you see that muscles are moving or pulling, you should stop. Relax your muscles and take a rest.\n\nFacial Stimulation\nBefore you begin the facial exercises, it is important to warm up and stimulate your muscles first. To correctly do these facial exercises, experts suggest sitting in front of a mirror so that you can clearly see your face and watch your muscle movements.\n* Step 1: Begin by trying to move every part of your face slowly and gently.\n* Step 2: Use your fingers to gently lift your eyebrows. One side will lift higher than the other, but do not apply too much force to the side that is drooping.\n* Step 3: Using your fingers, gently massage the different parts of your face, including your forehead, nose, cheeks, and mouth.\n\nNose and Cheek Exercises\nAfter warming up, you can work on the area of your cheeks and nose. This area is important since any stiffness or weak muscles in this zone can affect the strength of the entire face as you recover.\u00a0\n* Step 1: Using your fingers, gently push up the skin next to your nose on the affected side while trying to wrinkle your nose.\n* Step 2: Try to scrunch up your face, focusing on the cheeks and nose.\n* Step 3: Flare your nostrils and try to take some deep breaths through your nose. You can cover your unaffected nostril to force the affected muscles to work harder.\n* Step 4: Puff up your cheeks and blow the air out. Repeat this 10 times.\n\nMouth Exercises\nThe next area that you can work on is your mouth, including your lips and tongue. Many people with Bell\u2019s palsy find it difficult to eat and drink since muscle movements are limited. Some also find that they dribble or are not able to control their saliva, which can be stressful.\nThese exercises for Bell\u2019s palsy can help you to regain better control of your mouth. You can repeat them 30 times each, up to 4 times a day.\n* Step 1: Open your mouth as if you are going to smile and then close it. Then do the opposite and practice frowning.\n* Step 2: Gently pucker your lips and let them relax.\n* Step 3: Try lifting each corner of your mouth individually, one at a time. You can use your fingers to help lift up the affected side.\n* Step 4: Stick out your tongue and then aim it down toward your chin.\n\nEye Exercises\nPeople with Bell\u2019s palsy may have difficulty closing their affected eye, which can be bothersome and makes it difficult to sleep. These facial exercises help you to regain control and function of the muscles surrounding the eyes.\n* Step 1: Practice raising your eyebrows up and down. You can use your fingers to lift the affected eyebrow.\u00a0\n* Step 2: Look down and close your eye while gently massaging the eyelid and eyebrow.\n* Step 3: Alternate opening your eyes wide and then gently squeezing them shut. Yes. Many people on here, including myself have seen it get worse before it gets better. For me the worst was right after I stopped taking the steroids. I have had it twice and the first time it took 10 days to see any improvement and the second time 14 days. Yes. Mine did not start getting better until 4-5 months, all 4 times I have had it. Yes, I do them 3-4 times everyday but I have not improved at all in 8 weeks now. I have heard about that too, but it is not my case. I have been dealing with BP for 2 months now, I have stopped the steroids long time ago, on my second or third week I guess. That sucks, I am sorry. But it gives me some hope I can still improve. Thanks!! Oh seventh week. I thought it said 7th day. My bad", "How did recovery look like? Hello I was recently diagnosed within the last week. I realize that recovery is slow but I was interested in what were some signs you saw you were recovering? Sometimes I feel twitching and I cannot tell if that is a good sign or not.  I have had Bell\u2019s Palsy twice now, and each time the first indicator of recovery starting was regaining a proper sense of taste. For me I always felt like nothing tasted right, which has been unfortunate working in the restaurant industry.  That being said, it is been four years since my last Bell\u2019s and I still have not recovered fully, I would say I am stuck at about 80%. I definitely felt twitching. Sometimes the twitching would kind of crawl all around that side of my face. Another sign was the pain in the neck subsided. That was a very happy day when I was not getting those shooting pains anymore. hmm I do not have any neck pain but my affected jaw hurts every now and then.  Thankfully my taste has restored. In the beginning I did have a metallic taste to liquids especially.  I had a lot of twitching in my affected side after about a week as well, and I was told it might be a sign of recovery. I have since fully recovered except for one stubborn neck muscle. But the twitching dwindled during recovery for me. I took a photo of myself trying to smile every day, and compared them to the previous day. It was not until around the 11th day when it was at its worst and kind of plateaued. Around the 20th day I started to see some slight improvements, like I could see some of my teeth on the affected side when I smiled. After that, more tiny improvements followed until between the 3rd or 4th week since onset when I considered myself recovered.\n\nSome of the things I did to see if I was getting better was looking in the mirror and smiling, flaring my nostrils, raising my eyebrows, pursing my lips etc. I also recorded myself blinking to see if my affected eye had gotten any better. \n\nTl;dr - Everyone experiences this differently, but in my case it got worse before it got better. A lot of twitching in the first week, and tiny improvements did not start until around three weeks in.  When talking got easier, when the pressure and pain in my ears and jaw lessened, when food started tasting better, when my eye would get less fatigued during the day.  It took about 3 weeks from my dx. Thank you for your reply! Encouraging to hear that it might worsen before getting better  Yeah that what it sounds like. I am just hoping for a quicker recovery. A girl can dream. I just want my smile back  Yeah, it sucks.  Especially at the beginning.  But it will get better.  Just have patience and take some time for self care.   Are you on any steroids/meds for it?   Yeah I am on steroids and antivirals. I am seeing my PCP tomorrow to see what else there is I could do.  Ok, good!  That is what I was on and I did not notice a difference until I got a high enough dose of it from my PCP.  (I just went to an urgent care doc at first) I drooled a lot. As I recovered it subsided and I would be more aware of it happening.\n\nDrinking was such a gong show. When I was finally able to keep my lips on a glass I was so happy. Oh wow no drooling for me but lots of crocodile tears. Aww man that must have been tough not to be able to drink ", "Does anyone get tongue tingling on affected side even after healing process started and finished steroids?  Yes. I had that. Did not pass until about a month later. Hang in there I had that too, I even got a week where everything tasted wrong. It will get better.. Thank you \ud83d\ude1e \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffbugh the things is that it is so weird, I think it is gone and than it comes back :((( wtf Nearly a year later, tongue and lips; over half a year after my face has returned all function. I still get tingling 4 months in, usually it is a sign that some nerve fibers are reconnecting. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb that is awesome news! Hope you are well and better every day", "Damn! Diagnosed today  Stay strong...  How long did it take to get diagnosed? Did doctor give a time frame for when things may get better? I wish you quick and full recovery. No stress, stay calm take your pills and rest a lot. Sorry to hear that.  Rest.  Do not underestimate the power of rest. Rest.  \nI got a bit angry from the frustration of speaking funny, dribbling etc so make sure those around you understand that it is very hard to lose your good looks. \nFor many recovery is pretty quick but it is still a time you have to go through the discomfort.  I am 9 months in. Everything but half my bottom lip is pretty much back to normal.   Thanks ! And yes all I can hope for is a speedy recovery. Can I ask though, did you to any kind of treatment or anything besides the steroids and an antiviral medicine given? Thanks a lot! This means a lot  Thank you so much . This means a lot  It was a real fast diagnosis. It took about an hour tops. He said that I should see some improvement in about three weeks but as I keep researching, I see that it may take longer. Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e Well bud.. just keep ur head held high.. it will pass.. some of us were not as lucky but u can maybe get a shot n it will help.. stay strong It was a real fast diagnosis. It took about an hour tops. He said that I should see some improvement in about three weeks but as I keep researching, I see that it may take longer. Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e Hang in there. Hoping you have a speedy recovery. Try to keep your stress levels low. Aside from the prescribed meds, a B complex and some L-lysine probably would not hurt. You actually do not look too bad man.  If you are in a state with access to cannabis - get some CBDs ASAP (it does not get you high).  Nothing helped me as much as CBDs.\n\nYou are going to feel like it is never going to get better at some point... do not give up, in most people it is gone (visibly) within ~3 weeks.  I am a year and half after and i still have some issues (tenderness, closing one eye sometimes when i should not), but nothing visible. I am close to a dispensary. Any suggestions on what to get? I am not familiar with cbd. Thanks again! Kushy is a good brand.  Just get anything that is CBD and you are good though. Will it get you high ? Or just Cbd ? Thanks man I appreciate it  No, it does not get you high at all. And it is still classified as medical (even in CA) so it is tax free.  When i started taking CBD my face would start to twitch and i started to get some movement back.  It is great stuff.  Also, i am not a stoner - i do not smoke/vape/eat/etc. pot (although I believe in it is legalization). No just the steroids and anti viral.  There is no evidence anything else works but that said if you feel like it might help go for it. \nIt will be frustrating but it will get better.  I really do not notice it now unless I think about it. No one else notices it. But it is hard when you have not started recovering and feel a bit like a freak.  I didnt show any signs of recovery for about 4 weeks then only small but it picked up a pace after that. \nYou will get better  Good luck. Stay strong. Take the pills. Get lost of rest. Cover up the eye that is bothering you. It will get better.  Is your BP gone now and did you try the CBD?  Yes it is gone for the most part! Everyone now tells me that it is barely noticeable, but of course I am able to notice a slight difference. I would say it got resolved right around Christmas, and I was diagnosed on Nov 9. I did not use Cbd oil but I did however go to a health clinic and requested a B-12 complex injection which they inject on your arm. I also took b -12 complex pills as well as \nL-lysine pills after reading online that it might help. In addition to this I constantly massaged my face and also went to two sessions of acupuncture.   Hope this helps and if you are suffering from Bell\u2019s palsy, Godspeed!", "Hi Everyone!  Hi Everyone!

My BP cheek is just way more thick and the longer I have it, the more I think it counteracts my recovery. It feel like I could move my mouth more when is would not be this thick. I have been to the doctor but he says that, if you can if you can flatten it by pressing, it cannot be anything dangerous or bad... anyone knows something about this? The cheek on my palsy side is definitely thicker. I have been going to a physical therapist and they have been working on breaking up/releasing all the tissue. It has definitely helped reduce the thickness, improve movement, and reduce my synkinesis. These massages may help  So basically you get a massage to decrease it? They sometimes do manual releases, which is essentially an intense massage. They use other techniques as well - a little suction device (I am not sure what it is called), radial pulse therapy, and dry needling.", "Few days on from diagnosis. Starterd steroids on day 2, symptoms got worse as expected. I am on day 5 now and I feel like the opposite (nonBP) side of my face is starting to be affected too. I can no longer flare my unaffected nostril, or smile as widely or raise my eyebrow as high as I could a few days ago. Is this normal?", "Diagonosed on February 26 looking for advice How often would anyone recommend using an eyepatch daily? I find my eyes water up really often when looking at screens longer than 20 mins. I am just afraid of relying on the eye patch too often since the doctor said it will affect my vision. Take the steroids and do the facial exercises as the doctors recommends Is it possible to limit the amount of time you are looking at a screen ?  I never used a patch. I just got dark sunglasses and looked perpetually hung over for about 4 months since I never took the sunglasses off.  At work, not really but at home yes For me personally I wore an eyepatch about four harpy\u2019s a day and at night during the first couple of weeks, if you are feeling a strain and tearing out a patch on it, it is better to patch it than to let it be uncomfortable and exposed I have dry eye with my BP and look at a computer screen all day as well. I just have to use drops every hour. When I drive my eye will start to twitch so I use it for my two hour dry and have not had any issues with my other eye because of it. I just make sure to have it open at least a few hours a day so the other eye isnt compensating.  Do not you find it a bit difficult to drive with an eye patch? When I have my other eye open, the lines and trees and everything are very blurry. So it is a better alternative for me.  I only wear it at night.  I have had Bells for 5.5 weeks. I just find myself using my hand to make it blink. The drops really help and staying hydrated ", "Taste issues Hello! I was officially diagnosed with BP on June 18th, I am sitting here two months later \\*almost\\* completely recovered. The movement in my face slowly started coming back on July 2nd and I would say I was pretty much back to normal by a month out from my diagnosis. However I still have some slight sensitivity in my left ear and I still cannot taste great from the front of my tongue, I never lost all of my taste, just part of it. Anyone experience anything similar? I am a doomed to taste from the back of my forever or is this just something that tends to take longer to get back? It was also the first symptom I had...", "On day 7 I was diagnosed about a week ago. \nFirst I felt my tongue felt weird and slight jaw pain. \nThe next day, my fave felt weak. By the third day I had lost all movement. \nCalled my doctor and she prescribed me Methylprednisolone, valacyclovir &amp; amoxicillin. Along with vitamin b12 &amp; another multivitamin. \n\nI will say that shortly after receiving the meds, my headache and jaw pain went away fairly quickly &amp; had some facial twitching.  I massaged and excercised my face everyday. \n\nNow I am feeling some movement but the jaw pain &amp; pain under my ear has returned. Not sure if it is soreness or something else. :( \n\nAs of right now I am just hoping for some sign of recovery! \n\nJust thought I would share, if anyone has questions or advice, please let me know\ud83d\ude01 Hey there, welcome to the BP club.\n\nAre you doing face exercises? If not, get on that right away. It should help speed things along, and give you more regained control in the end, compared to if you do not do it. Hi :) \nYes I have been doing excercises everyday but now I have this really bad pain under my ear and jaw. Now sure if its cause I have now used the wrong muscles to move my face which is a huge fear of mine. It is very normal to have pain in those places when you have BP. Just keep doing the face exercises (I did a 15 minute set 3 times a day), and make sure to massage and stretch your face a bit.\n\nMassage before doing exercises to increase blood flow to your face and get it warm. Stretch once you are done. Placing your palms on your cheeks and pushing upwards while relaxing the face is good. You will look funny and basically make an ugly grimace, but it is good for your skin and muscles :)\n\nThe pain will hopefully subside soon, but you can take some ibuprofen if the pain is really bothering you. Thank you so much! Definitely going to try. \ud83d\ude04\n\nI had the pain in the beginning &amp; it had subsided but now it returned once I started trying to move my face. On day 5 here. Just taking this day by day. Same here! It is been tough to keep positive. Hoping we all have a full and speedy recovery. how is recovery?  Im pretty much recovered. Id say im about 98%  :) hby? I would say the almost the same. But maybe 95% recovered.  glade to hear you are not part of the statistic. Hows progress going? its good, dont even notice it now. I would say 100% or at least close to it. what about yourself? That Is awesome! And same, ive recovered, thankfully.  :) \n\nI am now starting to have ear pain and twitching in the other side for the past couple weeks so we shall see lol glade to hear. :) another nightmare behind us. Hopefully the pain is nothing. Does the pain come and go?", "I had a dream I could smile Every morning, I wake up thinking that when I look in the mirror, I will be able to smile. Last night, I dreamt that I could smile again. Only to wake up and realize I cannot. I am a generally happy person, so not smiling or laughing feels debilitating. I am all about riding this thing out and making it through unchanged, but boy was that a blow when I thought I could smile just for a fraction of a second, only to realize that I still cannot. \n\nThanks for listening... Hey there, yes that was happening to me too. And I usually do not have dreams where I actually feel I am there, like physically or even relise how my face is or anything of that sort. But I did have those dreams where I realise I can smile again and flash my teeth and my face was normal. Only to wake up and see my face still is not  moving. But then again, after a while, I began to see improvement. I can smile now, cannot show my teeth but smile is there. Maybe it is just our minds trying to keep our spirits up and saying everything will be back to normal? Actually someone else had posted this same thing probably a month ago. Hang in there! Think of the dream as being a preview of things to come. ;) Before you know it, you will be smiling again. I did not think I would improve more than I have after a month, but I did. It is hard to be patient honestly and what got me through was just focusing on other things for self care, like eating better, sleeping better, hair care, skin care, etc. Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f I am getting more energy too, so I can focus more on things other than sleeping!", "Here are the best products for day/night dry eye care. As I have had permanent facial paralysis on one side for 8 years now, I have tried a few things to keep my eye moist and comfortable. These are the exact products I have used for years now. I buy both the ointment and the tape at Walmart, the amazon links are just to show you what it looks like. The stuff should be available everywhere and if you cannot find them at a big store look at drug stores, they usually have a good selection. \n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n**Eye Ointment: (\n\n  I use this ointment daily and nightly, during the morning I put a small dot on the finger then put it on the inside of my lower eyelid, then move my eyes around for a second or two, distributing it. You will get used to the amount of ointment to use, too much and it will ooze out of the inside corner of your eye, and too little and your eye will be red and irritated. It still does ooze a bit and you may need to wipe the inside corner of your eye after each application. One tube usually lasts me about a month.\n\n\n This does make your eye blurry, so it may not be the right solution for you but it is the most comfortable and much less obvious looking than an eyepatch. I used to use eyedrops but my eye would feel dry minutes after applying them as my problem was the top portion of my eye being too dry, even with tears out the bottom. As for brands, I have found the ones with the greatest ratio of white petroleum to mineral oil to be the best for me. It leaks less and is generally less messy for the same effect. Make sure whatever you get is just plain white petroleum and mineral oil, not medicated stuff for a condition. \nI would rate the ones I have tried as Equate &gt; Baush&amp;Lomb &gt; Genteal &gt; Systane. \n\n\n_____________________________________\n\n**Tape: (\n\nThis is the tape I use to keep my eye closed during the night. I have found that if I do not do a good job of keeping my eye moist during the night, the entire next day it will be irritable. This is how I apply it: Make sure your eye is lubricated and then dry the area around it of water or ointment. It is important that the outside of your eye is dry and clean for the tape to stick. Tear off a piece of tape slightly longer than your eye(horizontally :p), close your eye (you might need a finger to get it all the way closed) and apply it to your upper eyelid. After that, pull down a little bit to get your eye all the way shut and press the tape down. If you do it right the tape will cover the full length of your eyelid and have a bit leftover on the outside of your eye so it is easy to take off in the morning. By covering the full length of your eyelid it makes kind of a seal around your eye keeping it moist.\n\nI usually do this right before I go to bed as being awake and looking at things makes my upper eyelid tug upward, and I will have to reapply the lower half of the tape again. This is probably the same for you unless your eye is completely paralyzed. \nIn the morning the tape will be pretty stuck on, but not terribly so. Just pull on it slowly in the shower and it will come right off. Pulling it off from the top down is more comfortable and prevents it from massacring your eyelashes. Splashing warm water on your face after pulling some off works well too if you are not showering. After you take it off it will leave a little mark where it was but only for about 15 minutes.\n\nThis tape far outranks any other tape I have tried, leaving my eye comfortable- it *feels* like it is shut and it stays moist. Other tapes are either too porous, the wrong width, or go over or under the right amount of stickiness. When you are buying this be sure to get the one that is an inch in width, not the half inch one. If you get anything shorter, you will not be able to apply the tape horizontally and have to use multiple strips to close your eye, making it harder to keep a seal around it to keep it moist. \n\n\n\n \n", "Child with Bell's Palsy The day after Christmas my 8 year old woke up with Bell's Palsy.

How do I make him feel better about himself? He is so worried he is going to be like this forever. \n\nI am devastated. The doctors said they think it was caused by covid, which we all just recovered from. He has a pediatrician appointment tomorrow and then next week we start seeing a pediatric neurologist.", "I think I am having a second round of bells palsy. I was diagnosed for the first time in 2020 with a super mild case of Bell\u2019s palsy. Left side of face was numb with just a bit of droopiness. I recovered fully in about 2 weeks. I just started to notice facial numbness and my left ear ringing and am now worried it came back. (Additionally, I got my first Covid vax 4 days ago, but I have no idea if they are related) Should I go get steroids/meds or should I wait it out. And any general advise would be awesome because I have horrible anxiety that it will become permanent. I would go straight to get it checked! If it is, steroids taken after onset within 72 hours are proven to work a lot more effectively. Better to be safe than sorry \u263a\ufe0f I also had my second bout post covid vax. Same timing as you. Go in and get the steroids.\n\nIt will not be permanent, but I understand the fear. Since you had a mild case last time, you probably will not have a severe case this time. Went to the ER. Quick care would not take me. An ECG, Head CT, and blood draw later. Wondering if I will get steroids or if they will just send me home. Very little droopiness still so I think I will end up with just a minor case. I had my first case jun 2020.  It went away after about a month of accupuncture and medication.  Like all of you, scariest thing I ever went thru.  I was so thankful it was not a stroke.   \n\nLast week I started to feel funny again.  Dizzy feeling, Tingling in my lips, pain in my jaw.  Last year the doctor said I probably got BP bc I was a large amount of stress from work.   I am under alot more stress right now and I am hoping more sleep will make the possible onset go away.   I cannot take time off right now bc I am short handed at work. I would def check asap, i remember feeling facial numbness (mostly in my lips) at first, and then 6 hours later I realized it was bells palsy (but it was also evening so I could not call anyone) Can only comment on the ringing part but it is possible to develop tinnitus towards the end of the recovery phase of your Bell\u2019s palsy. In fact at times that ear ringing does not go away in some cases. It is also possible that you might feel some aches and a bit of weird sensations on the side recovering. \n\nIf you feel numb again tho then I suggest you to see a doctor whenever you can ... Asap I am 4 weeks into my second round of Bells Palsy.  I had my first mild case 27 years ago.  Go to the Emergency Room as soon as possible so they can rule out Stroke, etc.  If it is Bells Palsy hopefully they will start you on Steriods and Anti-viral medication right away.  \n\nYes Bells Palsy is a side effect of the Covid-19 Vaccine per the VAERS system of reported side effects to CDC.\n\nI know it is hard but try to stay positive and reduce stress,  take Vitamin B-12 and Vitamin D to help immune system.\n\n  Keep your Bells Palsy eye protected with artificial tears and a patch to keep moisture in.  I did not and now suffer from multiple corneal abrasions which is very painful.\n\nWarm wishes. Hey, just so you know Health Canada just announced its adding Bells Palsy on the list of side effects for the Pzifer vaccine. So possibly could be related. Hope you recover soon! I have heard of this connection too. I also had some similar symptoms after the Pfizer vaccine.", "Anyone else get dizzy? I am on day 11 since my Bell's palsy diagnosis. All day today I have been having sporadic dizziness spells. It is not horrible but it is annoying. Has anyone else experienced this? I am wondering if I just did not get enough sleep last night. Today is also my first day off of Prednisone steroids so maybe that has something to do with it? Any insight would be appreciated! I have had some dizziness as well. I wonder if it is from the paralysis near the ear. I know that it is common to have your hearing be a little weird, things sound louder on my affected side.

This happened me only a few days ago and the sooner you get in the better the outcome.\n\nBest of luck with it. It looks like bells palsy. The first few days are crucial for recovery, go directly to a doctor, explain the symptoms and they should put you on some medication. It took me 3 days to see a doctor as I was in the same boat. Was not sure to begin with what was going on, on the third day with it getting worse I saw a doctor after googling the symptoms lol. Looks like mild Bell\u2019s palsy you me too. Best of luck. How long did it take you to recover ? Thanks, really not sure why it started even, did not have an infection or a virus, i saw that it couldve occured by stress, so it might be that ? Thanks I was on steroids and luckily through universal healthcare was able to see a physiotherapist who did dry needling on the facial nerves. I also did facial excercises daily and it took approximately a month for a full recovery.\n\nStay positive, but honestly do not get your hopes too high on a 100% recovery as it may not happen. I basically said to myself if I have 80% recovery I am ok with that, however my case was mild compared to others, which yours looks so I was lucky. They do not know what starts it is really, it is all guess work really with the condition at the minute. I had no obvious infection either but they said it could have been an ear infection I did not even notice, maybe it is something similar with you. They said stress to me too and I think that fits the bill too.\n\nIt will be fine, I know it is scary but it is so likely it will pass. Do the excerises they give you and all that and I am sure all with be good. For both of us \ud83d\ude0a Same as me. Mostly in the mouth. Eyelid will start to delay after a few days.

This lasted about 36 hours and while that got better the right side of my face started to feel \"weird\" harder to move, and developed a eye issue, pain and foreign object sensation, a lot of nerve pain/numbness and tightness (hard to describe) around the eye, around my jaw and my right lips occasionally tingle. My mouth never did droop. It is also causing crippling temporal and on top of my head headaches. I  have ringing in my ear as well. It is better in the mornings and get progressively worse through the day into the night. This is still going on 2 months later and to be honest my mental health and quality of life is starting to take a hit.\n\nA week after this started I went to the eye doctor hoping for something simple and explainable but he could not find anything wrong at least the visible areas he could inspect. He gave me Prednisone eye drops that seem to help the foreign eye sensation but seemed to increase the headaches. The following week I went to my GP and he hasetfully diagnosed me with TMJ/TMD, gave me a antibiotic (for possible sinus infection) and a decongestant which did not really do anything. This was several weeks ago and I do not know where to go or who to see. I have good insurance but do not have unlimited money to take small swings at this. \n\nI have read a lot of other posts on the thread and it seems like my symptoms have some commonality to others on here. \n\nSorry for the rambling, does this sound like possible Bell's Palsy and are there doctors that specialize in field of medicine that you could please recommend. Anyone in the Atlanta area have a recommendation that would greatly help please.        \n\nI do not know if I have it or not but I really fell for everyone here going through this. If you ever need a internet friend if your having a rough go at the symptoms please DM me.  Headaches, neck pain can be associated with bells palsy. I had pain behind the ear on the side affected and still get it now and then.\n\nPerhaps suggest the possibility to a GP and see the response. I googled my symptoms first then went to a doctor and they actually asked what do I think it could be, I said bells palsy and she actually commended me for a good diagnoses lol. Did the standard prednisone and anti biotics prescription for a week. After a month 95% recovery, you would not even know I had it. Going To start with the standard \u2018we are not doctors here\u2019 language. You are case seems much more complicated that the normal Bell\u2019s palsy case. A lot of the symptoms do not quite add up with what my experience was and what I have read on this subreddit. Most of us start to lose movement on one side of the face and it progressively gets worse over 1-2 weeks then you start to see some improvement. You have been dealing with this for over 2 months. Headaches are common but I would not say  horrific is how we would most describe it. Also most of us experience the pain right behind the ears not the top of the head or temples. Other symptoms that are not consistent with my experience is the ringing or tingly. \n\nYour symptoms seems to be much more complicated that what I generally think of Bell\u2019s palsy but again. Not a doctor. Wishing you luck man. Sounds like a shorty situation that you are in.", "6 month recovering from bells palsy venting I have been working through it and staying positive but I feel like my mouth control is not improving as well as my eyes have been everything I kept hearing is stay positive but I feel soreness every day and it feels like It wont get any better. There are some cases, mostly with herpes viruses, where it takes 8 months or even more before recovering. Do you know how you got it? Nope came out of the blue similar to other people noticed it at first from taste of food one day to next day going to the hospital. And receiving antivirals and steroids. Sorry to hear about the mouth soreness - it is frustrating when speech is affected. I did not feel like speaking much or attending my zoom calls in my first week of Bell's just because speech was difficult.\n\nHave you seen a physical therapist or someone your doc can recommend to help with mouth exercises? One tip my acupuncturist gave was to massage the inside of my mouth (lip and cheeks) and that helped a lot for me. She also mentioned gargling with alcohol on the affected side before doing mouth exercises to get the blood circulation going. \n\nI noticed on days when my diet is higher in salt that I feel a lot of swelling and pain so an anti-inflammatory diet may help. Acupuncture definitely help a lot with my jaw pain along with the gua sha / lymphatic drainage she would work on me. Acupuncturist basically said the mouth/lip area was last to heal so hang in there. Was diagnosed January 25th of this year. About to hit my six month mark. I have seen no recovery in this time. I am actually going to see a specialist soon that is talking about Botox and plastic surgery for me. Hoping for the best for you we will hopefully get better trying to stay positive. Thank you! You too. I would not wish this illness on my worst enemy. Physical therapist I have not seen it was my main doctor and er doctor when first on set and a neurologist a around 4 month mark.\nI will try the inside of the mouth massage and hope it helps thanks for the tips", "1 Week with Bell's Palsy - My Story Just wanted to touch base with this sub and say hi.\n\nI wanted to share my story to see if anyone else had a similar experience.\n\n**TL;DR - I feel a food allergy brought on my BP.  I am currently on day 8.  Steady decline in facial movement up to day 4 then remained the same until now.**\n\n(\n\n(\n\n\\---------\n\n**Last** **Saturday**:  I started snacking on a \"KNOW Foods\" cookie.\u00a0 The cookie has a sugar substitute in it called \"Allulose\".\u00a0 After the very first bite I felt tingling in my mouth and throat, I took a few more bites then decided it must not agree with me.\u00a0 Roughly 30 minutes later when we returned home my stomach began to rumble, then it started cramping really bad.\u00a0 I had heard of people having stomach issue with sugar substitutes so I was not too concerned at this point.\u00a0 15 minutes later I started getting really snotty and the phlegm in my mouth kept building up and I had to keep spitting.\u00a0 Then I started getting a headache and earache and just generally felt flu-like symptoms.\u00a0 Then suddenly I vomited (luckily I was near the door outback).\u00a0 It was intense and it did not end until I was emptied out.\u00a0 Obviously at this point something was wrong.\u00a0 It was difficult to swallow and I was showing all the signs of\u00a0anaphylactic shock.\u00a0 I went into the shower to clear my throat/nasal area and just to try and relax.\u00a0 After the show and roughly 2 hours after eating the cookie I was still having a hard time swallowing and was dizzy.\u00a0 I debated going into the ER, but I was too stubborn because it was 11pm and I would have to call a taxi and just did not want to go through all that.\u00a0 We spent the next 2 hours until 1AM monitoring my vitals and I appeared to be stable (not getting worse).\u00a0 I was able to have a bit of food and at around 2am I fell asleep.\n\n**Last Sunday**:\u00a0 Woke up feeling pretty great, my throat was still sore (probably from the acid in the vomit).\u00a0 Made breakfast, did the dishes, did some work on the computer, and even brought the kids to the pool.\u00a0 At the pool I noticed my right eye felt funny and I asked my wife if it looked odd.\u00a0 She said it looked fine.\u00a0 Then I asked if when I blink did it close, it did not.\u00a0 At that point I knew it was time to see a doctor.\u00a0 I drove to Urgent Care (Sunday so everything was closed).\u00a0 I finally saw a doctor and she immediately new it was Bell's Palsy.\u00a0 She said the food allergy just hours before was a coincidence and the two have nothing to do with each other.\u00a0 \u00a0I am convinced the food allergy or the stress going through it is tied to the Bell's Palsy. \n\nLast Thursday: I had a follow up with my primary care doctor.  She agreed that the shock/stress on my body clearly brought about the BP, but the underlying cause is obviously unknown.  She prescribed me an anti-viral med, Valacyclovir, and asked to come back to see her in 4-6 weeks if I have not improved so that she can bring in a neurologist.  I also had blood work for Lyme's disease (awaiting results). \n\n  \nI am 37, great health (just got blood work done), no known allergies (except whatever happened to me the night before BP), eat a keto diet, currently taking Valacyclovir and Prednisone. What a crazy journey! Thanks for sharing. So sorry you are going through this! It is so horrible. I was 37 weeks pregnant when it hit me, I was eating dinner with my husband and he thought I was stroking out! My bout with it is in my post history if you are interested at all. I am about 4 months out since I was diagnosed, did not take antivirals or steroids and I am now like 95% healed. I hope you have a fast and complete recovery. Sleep as much as you possibly can, my doctors said it was from stress and that sleep and rest should be the priority and I could not agree more! Wow! I think it was the stress from the allergic reaction. I really think it is caused by stress, mine definitely was. Hope u feel better soon!  &gt; I am convinced the food allergy or the stress going through it is tied to the Bell's Palsy\n\nBoth likely contributed. Irritation, whatever the source, is one of the few (hand-wavingly vague) commonalities with BP. Reading your post, I am more worried about whatever messed you up than about the BP... it sounded brutal. The BP will likely pass; the other thing could kill you.\n\nWatching your videos side-by-side, the biggest difference I can see is that you have adapted to having one side not do what you tell it to... in the day 2 video you appear to talk 'normal', in the day 5 video you do not do some of the actions that you know are not going to work anyway and the other side of your face is tired from taking up the slack. This was my experience too. Day 5 looks about like I would expect it to; the changes in hearing, breathing through your nose, eating, eye (lid, in particular) not operating correctly, these are all normal with BP and identical to my own experience that far into it. But I remember clearly how much the annoyance and (perfectly reasonable) depression made it *seem* like it had become worse, subjectively. Having progress photos helped me *see* that I was getting better before I could *feel* that I was getting better.\n\nThe one definite completely agreed-upon and understood thing about BP is that nobody knows exactly why it happens or what makes it go away. The antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs make good sense. Anything that reduces stress helps. (Which sucks, because BP is totally stressful, both emotionally and in terms of your other muscles having to do double duty.) I found that putting a warm wet cloth or heating pad on that side of my face helped. I spent hours each day trying 'find' the incommunicado nerves, prompted by something I would read about how (non-BP) people who cannot raise just one eyebrow can learn to do so if they practice at it for a while... I never had any success with that, but the practice of trying to isolate control of (or locate sensation from) a specific nerve came in handy when I got BP. A week into it some nebulous sensation came back, I focused on that area almost exclusively for a couple of days, and 90% of sensation and control returned. The only sign now that I ever had BP is that the eyelid on that side became lazy. (More like Thom Yorke than David Bowie. Dammit.)\n\nThere will never be a better excuse to wear an eye patch than you have right now. But I found it is better to do so when you are not moving around much... loss of stereo vision is profoundly annoying.\n\nThanks for sharing. Take care of yourself. Hey man, I know what you are going through. I have had BP for about a month now and I was wondering how people is dealing with this problem.\nI do not know if it is just me or what, but I have been recovering well by being relaxed, massaging my face twice a day and by smoking pot once or twice a week. I have has some progress: I am able to move my eyebrow, I can almost close my eye completely, and I am getting close to being able to smile once again!. Just be patient and be positive, you will recover eventually, try to google how to massage your face and I hope you do well man!\nPS: Excuse my bad English", "Just went to the doctor today and found out i have bells palsy I think i caught up early my face looks normal when i speak the only problem is my eye and how i smile i cant close my left eye fully and i cant smile hopefully i will get better in a couple of weeks Should i get ancupuncture as soon as possible  Hi! I was diagnosed 19 days ago, and I too caught it very early. I knew about Bell's palsy, and as soon as I realised I was using my hand to feel less discomfort in my eye, and that my ear ached, and that I had been extremely tired in the past few days, I put two and two together and went to the hospital. At that point my face was almost normal: my eyebrow worked fine, I could smile, and I could close my eye if I tried hard. The only visible symptoms were my eyelid - when I blinked only one eye would close, and the fact that if I tried to pull the biggest smile ever it was clearly not symmetrical.\n\nI was given prednisone, that I took right away, and was told it would probably go away in a month, but who knows. \n\nI woke up the next day to something I feared but did not expect: my eyebrow did not work at all, I could not close my eye even if I tried my hardest, and I had trouble saying some consonants like 'p' or 'b', and spilled water if I did not pay attention when drinking. Apparently it is normal, so if this happens to you do not freak out: it means we just caught it so early that the symptoms did not have time to manifest themselves, it does not mean it is getting worse. At that point it is a waiting game.\n\nI was lucky: even at my worse, the Bell was not that severe, as I could still talk basically fine, I could eat, I could drink without a straw (I did have to pay attention, but still), and my eyelid did move a little, and was never completely paralysed. That, combined to the fact that I took the prednisone as soon as possible, made my case a not terrible one.\n\nAs of today, I think it is around 85% cured, and I will hopefully fully recover soon. I do not think it is noticeable anymore. The only thing I did was rest and take my medicines. I think that acupuncture is premature at this point, as you do not know the severity of your palsy yet, and you do not know if it will fix itself or not. Plus, I think you need to let your nerves reconstruct (let them be for the first couple of weeks), and then you can consider acupuncture. I do not know if acupuncture works at all (there is no proof it does), and even by lurking within this sub I have read it is worked on people who did not notice any or any more progress with just medicine and time.\n\nI hope you recover soon! Apparently it is not proven effective. I did not and I have been healing fine. Thanks a lot im going to try it anyways hopefully it works thanks for the time i really appreciate it Fair enough, just maybe do not overwork your nerves, as it might induce synkinesis and synkinesis sucks. Good luck! Check out the website for the Facial Paralysis Institute. It is in California but has a lot of great information on it that you can use to start conversations with your doctor.  Will do thanks There is some evidence that it could actually worsen your prognosis for recovery.

I had gotten once before when I was five. I was taking B-vitamins after the 7-day string on the prescribed meds.

Message your neck, vitamins like mentioned before, then I came across an article where a guy used cbd/hemp oil. Also researched that it helps with nerves.\n\nIt was 4 months since the start of my BP, that I came across this. I had no real improvement, still could not close my left eye. Really did not have anything to lose. I feel like that was the only thing that had helped me. From middle of April to July 2019, I feel like I improved 100%. I could close my eye and could open my mouth most of the way.\n\nSo, even if some people think hemp/CBD oil is a fluke, I say if no other options are working give it a try.\n\nI was also having the trouble drinking and chewing on certain things during that time before I used hemp oil.\n\nComing on a year since, my eye does still tear a lot of the times when I am chewing/eating. I feel like I am mostly rid of it. I cannot do a full teeth smile, and that is the only time other people notice. Lots of people post about their success with CBD products here.  Personally, I do not think it did anything for me. I was taking drops of a tincture daily and I also have an ointment that I would occasionally rub on my face.  \n\nThat being said, I am also a daily THC user, so maybe the effects masked one another? Who knows. I wholeheartedly believe in the therapeutic powers of cannabinoids, it just did not seem to help me in this particular case. And some of it could depend on the brand/quality too.

Got worse throughout that day, ruled out stroke when called nurse line. I went to the doctor on Tuesday and he gave me steroids, pain reliever and anti-virals. Unknown reasons why got BP. I did get the Monderna 1st and 2nd vaccine shots. The 2nd shot was a couple months ago though. Makes me wonder if that could be part of it?  I also work in very stressful environment. So doctor recommended I take off work for rest and recovery. Also, since was having blurriness, dizziness and bad headaches. \n\nWent back to doctor in 10 days, no improvements. He made it sound like I was an unusual case, most of his patients usually had improvements by then. Sad to hear that, but glad I read more about BP and saw real life stories from here. More steroids and anti-virals he gave me. Also, taking extra vitamins, supplements, eating a healthy diet, drinking lots water, resting and trying to be patient. Doc recommended I start Physical therapy. Start PT next Monday. \n\nThis has been an emotional rollercoaster. Looking forward to getting back to normal life. Any help, encouragement, suggestions, exercises, massages links appreciated? Hi! First of all, i am very sorry that you got BP. I relate to a lot of points you mentioned and I thought it may help if i shared my story :)\n\nI got BP back in August. Similar to you, my Covid vaccine was already around 3 months prior (only the first shot). Doctors tested basically everything and ruled out any viral infection and vaccine as the reasons. I was very stressed at the time (moving, working, end of term, exams etc) and although stress directly is not assumed to be the reason for BP, i was told it was probably stress-related (when stressed, our immune systems weaken and that could have triggered something).\n\nI am in my early 20s so I was told I would recover completely within 3-4 weeks and not to worry about it. Three weeks had passed and there was Zero difference. My doctor's were a bit surprised as well to be honest. However, i stopped taking antivirals &amp; steroids after 3ish weeks and was told to just continue doing facial excerices and see a physiotherapist/language pathologist. I think around then (i guess around 3-4 weeks) i started seeing very tiny movement but it was so tiny it was almost unnoticable. My eye lid still did not close for weeks and movement was very little (i do not know why, but for some reason i expected my eyebrow to start moving normally overnight, lol.) After that very little movement, again, no improvements for some time. And then, the corner of my lip started to move a tinnnny bit. Again, almost unnoticable but I was taking pictures and videos every single day.\n\nIt is been around 100 days since I got BP now and I got to be honest, it is still not at 100%. I am still seeing a physiotherapist. However, my BP is healed around 95% and I am still seeing improvements (although again, very slow). My muscles are still a bit weaker on my left side and I am still feeling numbness on some areas. However, noone notices that my face is 'wonky', even my physio does not (apart from very small things).\n\nI was very hopeless and thought my face would look like that forever and had made peace with that fact. I am sharing this because I want to show that you can have a full recovery even if you have not had any improvements in the first few weeks!\n\nI am wishing you a very speedy recovery. Take care! And feel free to ask questions! Thank you for reply and your story. So glad you are doing much better. I may look into that kind of of therapist, if they are around here. Stress can do crazy things to us if let it or do not even realize it. I am learning to deal with stress differently than before foresure. Vaccine reaction probably would have happened much earlier if it were the cause, so I would assume it is not that.\n\nStress and other viruses (esp. herpes simplex) are usually what causes BP.\n\nSorry to hear about your lack of progress. It is not totally unusual. I had a slow recovery this time around (on my second go). My current case is unusually stubborn. Even after acupuncture, I cannot fully close my eye. I am starting rehab for it as an outpatient at a local hospital soon to figure out what is up. \n\nGet as much rest as you can, massage your face, stretch your mouth and eyes (see videos on youtube to get a good sense of what is safe to do).\n\nConsider acupuncture. It is helped a lot of us.\n\nHope it comes back soon. Try not to get too down. Know that you are not alone. We have been through it and it is hard, but you will recover. True. I have learnt so much during recovery (to appreciate everything that a body does to heal, how important it is to reduce stress etc.). I am wishing you all the best! I am 6 weeks in no improvement Thank you for your response and your experience. I blame my BP on stress. I will probably try acupuncture also. Maybe after a few physical therapy sessions. Do you recommend doing the acupuncture asap or wait a month or so? Good luck and hope they figure out what is going on and your recovery speeds up. Hi. Thank you for response. There is still Hope! I keep hearing everyone is BP experience is different in time. Are you working? What are you doing to help the process? acupuncturists will tell you to go right away. I would ask both of them for their opinions. Maybe worth another post on this subreddit to ask which you should pursue and which order. I personally think I should have stopped acupuncture earlier and headed to physio when I was not having any progress. I have been told mine is a particularly stubborn case, so hopefully any and all treatment will work well for you. I do think that acupuncture can very quickly give you some results. Within a day of many sessions (for the first month) I was getting new movement, so i do think it is worth it. Thank you for quick reply. I wish you the best &amp; quick recovery. I had it a year ago, at the end of June. Complete paralysis on the whole left side that developed over two days.\n\nMy check-up from late July (about 5 weeks after it started) notes that I had very significant facial paralysis. I was essentially unchanged, except that I could twitch the corner of my mouth and my eyelid twitched slightly when I blinked.\n\nAt the end of August, I was still taping my eye at night, but it would blink half-way and my mouth/cheek were almost normal.\n\nBy the end of October (4 months), it was like it never happened.\n\nSo there is hope! Sometimes recovery just takes a bit longer. The neurologist I saw suggested that if I still had symptoms after 6 months, that is when I should start to consider that they might be more permanent, though I am sure that is different depending on a number of factors. Thank you for your BP experience and your reply. Glad to know there is hope and some BP tunnels maybe longer than others. 6 months could possibly be more permanent. All these stories are similar to mine, 6 weeks after getting my first jab of the vaccine I got BP. After the first jab I started getting migraines which then resulted in BP. I am 3 weeks in and still no improvement. I have had BP four times already and my usual team that I work with ie acupuncturist, chiro etc all day this time my BP is very different. Not the usual paralysis. Hoping I recover soon usually by now I have 60% recovery but not a single improvement yet. Wishing everyone a swift recovery xx I did not recover at all for about 2 weeks then had very slow progress that took another 5 or so months. It is different for everyone. Hang in there! Talking to a therapist or trying meditation might help with relaxation Thank you for your story and encouragement! Thank you for your story and encouragement! Patience, rest, and recovery time. Everyone is is different. Are you doing self massage and self exercises also? Just curious. Interesting, I did have migraines and stomach pains a few weeks also after my 2nd vaccine shot too. What vaccine did you get? Thank you for the encouraging words! Hi shutterbuggok, I got the Pfizer. I am long due the second jab but waiting for recovery to attempt it. Not sure if I even want to get it. In my previous case of BP I went to a physio but this time I am doing YouTube video exercises. Well getting Covid could be worse, some healthy people have died from it. I have had family members die from not getting the vaccines. I have gotten Vaccine shots Moderna. Better than getting sick with Covid.", "Bells palsy not the worst but is the worst My fiance was diagnosed with bells palsy. \nI the (male) doing all the research, I do not want her to stress about it.

I am 100% healed from my Bells Palsy. It took about 6-7 weeks for full recovery. I took a steroid as prescribed from my doc. Otherwise, just tried to forget about it. Slowly everything came back. She will be fine. Maybe let the Palsy remind us all of our humanity, of the shortness of life, and of our health. For me it was temporary, albeit frustrating and annoying.", "I have got twitches after I have regained movement and I am freaking out Hey. I have had bell\u2019s palsy in the end of March. My palsy was pretty bad and I was barely able to moce anything. But I started to recover quickly, I have seen improvement before one week. I have regained full (apparently at least) movement three weeks ago, 6-7 weeks in and I was happy. \n\nBut a few days ago, I have started to feel a twitch on my eyelid. I have since had some at the corner at the mouth. And I am freaking out. To be honest, I have been really worried by this whole thing sonce the beginning. I have read about hemifacial spasm and that can be a lasting effect of Bell\u2019s Palsy and it usually starts with twitches around the eyelid. \n\nSo, my questions are the following : many sites seem to imply that quick recoveries mean no lasting effects : is it the rule ? Are twitches after you have recovered full movement normal ? I am so sorry you are going through this! I would guess that twitches are normal after recovery. I am almost 6 years out from my diagnosis and I still get twitches sometimes, mostly on my eyelid. They seem to happen when I am stressed, so I take it as a sign to relax and try to get more rest. I will usually take a B12 supplement as well. \nI know what you mean about MDs. I went to two different doctors and neither seemed to know much about it or care. I do not know if it is because BP is relatively rare or if they do not see it as serious because it only affects our faces.  Thx for your answer. Unfortunately, my neck\u2019s muscle have become tight since I wrote the message. My doctor thinks that is a sign of the palsy coming again. I guess I am not done with it yet.  Oh, that is terrible news! Good luck with your recovery.", "Just got diagnosed with BP 2 weeks before graduating Got back from the ER about 3 hours ago. First noticed symptoms yesterday morning but decided to wait until today to get it checked out as I was hoping it would go away overnight. Got prescribed 60mg of Prednison per day and 1G of Valacyclovir three times per day. I have some facial control but still pretty hard to move my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally hoping I recover fast because I just realized how much this is going to suck since I am graduating high school in less than 2 weeks and there are going to be numerous photos taken.. Great. Literally sounds just like my scenario. I wanted over night before going in, still had some movement (very little but some) and had the exact meds. 2 weeks out I could figure out how to do a decent face for a picture. It is been 3 weeks now and I would say I am 90% better, I am the only person who notices unless I drink alcohol, that seems to bother it. \n\nI also took a liquid vitamin B complex 3-4 times a day (bought on amazon) and a high grade full spectrum CBD oil daily (from my pharmacy). Also took 1000mg of L-lysine a day (also amazon) And I tried to eat foods that did not cause inflammation, sugar and carbs being big ones, but you can look that up on google. \n\nKeep your head up! Sounds like yours is exactly like mine and honestly, best case scenario...we caught it and treated it early, and still had a little movement. I am thinking you will recover fully. Yeah, I am confident that I will make a full recovery. It just sucks that this happened so close to graduation. For sure that sucks I had mine during prom. I am smirking in every picture haha Take your meds and do your facial exercises as prescribed and recommend it. Good luck! Do not mess with your face. Try moving your face but stay away from massages and or any accupunctures ect. The nerve is healing itself. Good to know. I have been massaging my fact every couple hours for the past day and half now. Thanks for letting me know.", "First moment of weakness Not going to lie i had my first breakdown earlier tonight during dinner when I tried eating a hamburger, I am a 27 male and I can say that it is okay to feel weak and cry. It was almost therapeutic because up to that point I guess you could say I was in denial and angry asking what I did to deserve this... I have lost more function in my face since this morning and hopefully I can still close my eye tomorrow after I wake. I know that symptoms are likely to get worse before getting better but its okay and understandable to feel scared. I have noticed that when I take my meds its like I can almost feel it attacking and trying to heal the left side of my face. I thought the best thing to do was lock myself in my room and just hide from the world, but when I came out of my room to eat and saw my puppy for the first time today..... he was so happy to see me. He does not care and he does not even notice, so from here on out I will do all the things that make me happy every day. This is not a pitty party just feel its best to vent here and not to my family as they are worried enough. I have decided to add a few things to my daily routine, meditation 2x a day for 20 mins and might even start doing yoga... I am truly blessed in many aspects of life and as they say.

About a month and a half ago, i had been diagnosed with bell's palsy. Here is my story on how it went. \n\nSo, one evening i started to feel pain in my right ear. I cleaned them, nothing. I took anti-pain pills but the pain came back a few hours later. The next day i could not move the right portion of my face. So me and my mom went to a clinic to see what kind of nasty thing is that. I got moved to the hospital immediatly. Due to this being my first visit in the hospital i was scared shitless. Later that day i have arrived in the hospital, and i got my blood sampled after i got placed in a room. The next day in the morning the doctors have told us that i luckily do not have boleriose. (which the doctors thought i have.) Then i got assigned to rehab. I went to rehab everyday in the morning. i had Sollux (lights on ya face) and Electro stimulation (electricity on ya face) On friday i finally could go back home (i went to the hospital on monday, the same week) I still had to go to rehab for 10 days, and i got finally cured. :-) Thanks for sharing your story. BP can be pretty scary, especially when you do not know what it is! I am glad you are in remission now. Thanks, yeah that part of my life was pretty scary :D I have had this for about two weeks, shit is frustrating as hell. I just got off prednisone I do acupuncture and wear an eyepatch shit is taking forever.", "Bells Palsy, stress related? and Dr suggesting antidepressant Hi there, so my Bells Palsy is mild and have had it for about 6 months but only diagnosed just over a month ago due to pain. When I first had symptoms I went to a walk in clinic and Dr did not feel I had Bells Palsy as we could not see a droop, but my left side left like anaesthetic wearing off after being to the dentist. The sensation went away and carried on with life but occasionally my face felt a little weird. \n\nBecause of lockdown I rarely go out which has been great for focusing on getting my face better but I am finding each time I go out to the supermarket my face tingling increases. My only thought is that it is stress related. When I went to the Dr he suggested a mild anti depressant, is there  anyone here who manages their Bells Palsy with anti depressants? I am not depressed or sad or anything like that but going out does stress me a bit and when work goes back in customer service it is going to extremely busy. The only real recommended treatment for bell\u2019s palsy is anti-virals and steroids at on set. Other than that, at 4 years out with still having issues, I get prescriptions of muscle relaxers for it too. I find I tend to use (or try to) my face muscles more when I am out. This causes pain or tingles for me. It can be from trying to squint in sunlight, or talking more with people, etc. I have never heard of anti depressants being used. Prednisone and anti vitals are what I have always had. \n\nI even have PTSD and my doctors have never linked the two together. BP can definitely be stress related, I had it from June 2018 - September 2018 and today my face tingles when I am in stressful situations or my lips will twitch slightly or I will get the pain behind my ear. I do not think more medication is going to help you, just try to stay calm all the time (impossible I know LOL) My BP was definitely stress related due to my job. I was given anti-vitals and steroids but all it did was make me sleep and cry all day. I would do facial massages and warm compresses but once I did acupuncture i was instantly able to move again. Small changes at first but with each session it got better and better until I was totally normal. There are times I will feel a twitch in my eye or lip and that is my sign to relax and decompress so it does not come back. My BP was stress related from school. I had not have antidepressants reccomended to me but I had alot of anti-viral meds. But yes stress is a factor to BP but i dont know if antidepressants help Thank you, I was sure there would be no medicine that could help due to the onset being months ago. Appears no one else has had the suggestion of antidepressants by their Dr. The only reason I could think would be the Palsy possibly triggered by the herpes virus which is often triggered by stress so maybe the Dr though it could help reduce the trigger. I do not think it is a path I will go down due to other issues the medicine could cause. Thank you for your input, really wanted to see if anyone else had had antidepressants suggested by their Dr as I though it was odd. Hope you are coping well with your PTSD. Have had a lot of tingling this last week and not even back at work yet, just have to take lots of deep breaths and push through. Also keep up with face exercises. Thank you for your thoughts on the situation. Have to listen to our bodies hey. I forgot about acupuncture, I will look I to that at some stage. I used it for arthritis in my hands and it was amazing and I would often fall asleep when I was having it done once I got through my fear of needles haha. Will be interesting to see how my face behaves when I get back to work which will hopefully be in a couple of weeks, will have to be practising lots of self care to keep on top of it.", "Reoccurrence Hello, I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy in May and after 6 weeks I had about 95% return and it really did not bother me day to day. Around thanksgiving I had a reoccurrence. It was not near as bad as the initial episode, but I got antivirals/steroids right away. This time I am about 90% better, but I have frequent days (when I am tired or stressed) that it bothers me. It feels\nLike those muscles are tired or weaker and it is really irritating. Does anyone else experience symptoms flaring up like this? And each time do you notice less return of the affected side? Definitely when I am tired. Bearing in mind I had it about 10 years ago and it lasted 9 months. I am still dealing with the consequences (synkinesis etc).", "OMG, I CAN MOVE MY LEFT EYEBROW!! I just wanted to share this, since I have been seeing a number of posts exclaiming disappointment with the progress (or lack thereof) of their BP symptoms.\n\nI was looking in the mirror yesterday, and just on a whim I tried to get any part of the left side of my face to move. And I was pleasantly surprised to see that I could now move both my left eyebrow and my left ear, if only slightly.\n\nIt is been 3 weeks and 3 days since I first developed BP symptoms. My smile still has not come back, and when speaking I still sound like a talking whoopee cushion, but right now I am optimistic that this BP thing can be overcome with enough time, proper medication, exercise, and rest. Awesome news! Thanks! I honestly hope we can all have awesome news to share eventually. This is really good news. Thank you for sharing it gives me hope. Thank you as well! I am glad it helps. Yay!! Exciting! I am at 3 weeks and 5 days and I am seeing improvement as well! Celebrate the wins Yes, exactly! Even the little wins count, as they soon snowball into a bigger win! I just got diagnosed yesterday, so my life is a bit of a wild ride. Got some eye patches, still dealing With the infection that caused this whole thing. This is exciting to know a realistic time line. Did you guys lose taste in your effected side? How long did that last? For me, initially lthe left half of my tongue felt part numb, part tingly. I could still taste but it seemed muted compared to my right. Though now it feels almost normal, except I still cannot roll my tongue or whistle.\n\nI can now move the part of my left cheek below my eye. But I still talk funny and cannot smile. And the vision in my left eye is often cloudy. But I am optimistic that these, too, will pass. I have had symptoms since november. It is gotten much better but still not 100%. It is improving but not at the pace I thought. You guys are progressing nicely.\n\nOne weird thing I notice is when I chew my left eye wants to close and sometimes tears. Hoping for a better 2022. I hate the tearing. My left eye tears randomly. And the constant blurry vision in one eye is both inconvenient and a hinderance.\n\nHowever, my inability to smile or laugh normally is the worst. When the spouse want to take pics with me in them, I must always find some creative way to hide the drooping side of my face. \n\nBut pics I can still sort of handle; video calls are a whole other story. I look like an idiot in all the virtual meetings I have had to attend this past month.\n\nI just hope that we all continue to experience improved movement function, and that we all eventually \"graduate\" from BP, preferably sooner rather than later. Bright side of Covid is masks helped with social situations. Video calls were tough but it became a conversation piece and it helped my sanity discussing it. I joked often and said I was Quasimodo... I read a study that b-12 methylcobalamin shots taken every other day helped in recovery. Of course, these were on patients that were in the initial stages of the symptoms. I am almost 9 months in so not expecting miracles. From what I understand the b-12 helps in healing the myelin sheath around the nerves. I found a local clinic that I visit and have started taken 1000 mcg shots over the past 3 weeks and have noticed improvement. My left side does not feel as tense. The nurse who administers it also noticed my eye is not as closed. Hopeful.\n\n(\n\n(", "possible bells palsy? difficulty with pronunciation and nerve pain please be nice.

My mom got it in 2014, and she made a full recovery.\n\nBut every once in a while she complains of a bad headache and earache. \n\nGot her bloods done and no infections, but could it be some sort of Damage done before which causes pain.\n\nShe says putting a warm compress and taking muscle relaxants helped. But the doctor will not give it for long. The pains gone but she worries sometimes.\n\nThanks in advance. And I hope all your problems will go away to. Thirteen years later I still get pain in that ear sometimes. I find that gently massaging around the area can be helpful (even though it hurts to do it). Usually when this pain flares up I also get muscle twitches in my eye and face on that side also. It typically happens when I am starting to come down with a cold, or if I do not get enough sleep, or I have overexerted myself somehow. Plenty of rest, fluids, proper electrolytes, and general palliative care are about all that you can really do. If she find heat helpful, then she should keep doing that. As for muscle relaxants, they probably just help her to rest generally. She should be able to get the same benefits from relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, mindfulness and other cognitive behavioral techniques.  I have had BP twice, once in 2016 and once in 2018. Left side first, then the right side. On the left side I still get occasional jaw pain which in the moment is unbearable but passes within 10-15 minutes. Not too often, maybe every few months or so. On the right side still get occasional pain behind my ear which feels like a super bad, stabby type headache. The last time knocked me on my ass for about 12 hours. Massage helps for sure even though (as someone else said) it does hurt too. I do meditate and deep breathing. Also motrin. Luckily it is not frequent. Best of luck in her recovery. I will take the occasional pain over droopy eyes, unable to brush my teeth without a mess, etc. \n\nAlso, as someone mentioned this seems to be linked to stress, at least in my case. Both times happened when I was working way too many hours and stress was through the roof. Second time also tested positive for shingles but had no other shingles symptoms. Self care helps, or at least it did for me. Thanks, she worried all the time whether she had a tumor.  Thanks, hope you get better", "Diagnosed 5 days ago and grumpy AF.

Do not worry, if you are anything like the me, or the majority of sufferers, this will all be gone in a month or two and you will just be left with an interesting story to tell. My clinic is very thorough typically, but no one has mentioned me doing anything like exercises. I have been seen by my primary, the eye clinic and the ED and not a mention of physical therapy by any of them. They recommended I wait for 2 weeks to go by and if I am not seeing improvement to seeing neurology then. I think the plan is that if I do not recover quickly then maybe PT and Neurology.... *shrugs*\n\nThis all started from an ear infection. :(\n\nThank you for the positive words.  I honestly think that based off of the statistics I have been told, most people recover fairly quickly, and they would therefore think it (EG: PT, neurology, et cetera) would all be unnecessary. \n\nI had similar experiences; my ER visit was treated with a slap in the back, good natured utterings that most people quickly recover, and prescriptions. I had to seek out a neurologist myself, who then recommended me to physical therapy. I am 14 weeks out now from my initial diagnosis, and I am sort of feeling like I will not be much better than maybe 25% recovered. I sympathize. It is not a great drug long term but neurontin saved my sanity as far as pain relief. That plus Cannabis but smoking was a pain with palsy. I hope you find something that works, I went from a grade 9 to a grade 1 in about 10 months so hang in there.  Hey there! I am sorry that this happened. It may not seem like it but from most accounts, including my own, this will get better:)\nThe pain will pass and most of what you have lost will return:)\nFrom my experience physiotherapy helped and most of all having people who listened and were always positive helped even more\nIt may take time but just try to be focus on what you enjoy:)\nIf you need to talk, feel free to pm me.

Healing is different for everyone tho but do what you can! Ice preventing inflammation or speeding up healing or recovery is a myth. Even Dr. Gabe Mirkin the physician who created and popularized the RICE protocol (Rest. Ice. Compression.

However it was on a Saturday and I just told myself on Monday, I will go to dentist for a check. \n\n24 hours later, on Sunday, my face on left dropped, and I had like no improvements for over 3+ months (which is why I have residuals). \n\n**For me, stress was my trigger.** \n\n**First time,** I was overly stressed about jobs/interviewing. It was something that was going on for months.\n\n**Second time,** it was during a move and leaving a job. \n\n**Third time,** was when I was getting ready to move again. \n\nRoughly about once a year. \n\n**I feel I was able to prevent the 2nd and 3rd recurrences** because **as soon as I got the same feeling in jaw,** that \"tooth-ache pain\" or \"chewing on foil\" pain, I did tele-doc type visits, explained I previously had BP and that I am getting the same pain in lower jaw, and if they can **prescribe a round of prednisone to possibly help stop swelling of nerve.** \n\nThey prescribed me 50 mg prednisone, 1x per day for 7 days. The feeling/pain subsides often the same day I start the prednisone. \n\nThe 3rd time I felt the pain, I had a nurse prac on tele-doc, and she did not feel comfortable \"prescribing medication with no visible symptoms yet,\" I said that was fine, and immediately went to another doc who did. \n\n**So best advice: KNOW YOUR TRIGGER, and if you feel that similar pain, get some prednisone ASAP! My third time, the pain started late evening, so I picked up my prescription at midnight!**\n\nIf one doc, does not feel comfortable, that is cool, they are free to do that, get to another one who will. Hey, I have some residuals. \n\nI did a handful of visits to acupuncturist early on, like a couple months when I got no improvement. \n\nI do think it helped, wish I did it sooner. \n\nHow long after your initial BP, did YOU start acupuncture? \n\nI feel my smile is back at 90%, movement when I am speaking is probably 80% She told me yesterday I am back at about 95 percent.  \n\nI was diagnosed 5/4; my first acupuncture appt was on 5/12.", "Where to go to get therapy for synkinesis? Hi all, I suddenly developed synkinesis out of nowhere about a week ago (or at least, it is what the neurologist I saw a few days ago thinks it is). Mines not from Bell\u2019s palsy, but it is the only starting point I have - I have shoulder movements triggering my back right lower leg to twitch. The neurologist is getting an MRI just in case, but they are only other suggestions are muscle relaxants (afraid too general, had them before and was hazy) and Botox if that fails. I have been reading that facial synkinesis has some treatments/therapies. If any of you have done that, how did it work out? I am afraid I will not be offered any sort of therapy by my current doctor since my synkinesis is so unusual.", "The worst month I thought everything was perfect. I was in a happy relationship, I was expecting my first child and I could not be happier. I had just started a new job, I was in the process of packing to move town, and then it all started. \n\nWhat I assumed was a mild allergic reaction to a food I had just eaten turned out to be something far far worse. The numbness slowly crept up to cover the entire right side of my face over the course of the next two days.\n\nYou would think this would cause me to visit my gp right? No. I was terrified of doctors, and still just assumed it would pass. I was planning on going the next week if it did not go away. But the world was not done with me yet. Not even close. \n\n\nAt work the following Monday, 4 days after the onset of the numbness, I started bleeding. I was 12 weeks pregnant at the time. I went to hospital and they diagnosed a missed miscarriage. My baby had died a few weeks earlier and I now had to deal with that too. It took two weeks for my body to return to normal. Atleast, my new normal. When I finally went to my gp about my numbness I was diagnosed with bells palsy. Bells did not cause my miscarriage, but it is still unclear whether my miscarriage contributed to the damage. \n\nIts been now two weeks since the diognosis, 4 weeks since the first onset, and 5 days ago my right side started looking different to my left. My cheek has pulled upwards and my right eye is about half the size of my left. \n\n\nI feel like one of the lucky ones to have not had to deal with the paralysis. To not deal with the drooping. But I still feel like I have been handed such a raw deal. \n\n\nIm sorry, I guess I just wanted to come here to vent and let it all out. \nI wish you all the most love and progress with dealing with it, and I am sorry you have to. \n\n\nBut seriously. \nFuck July. I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nBell's Palsy is more common in pregnancy for some reason.\n\nI hope August brings you relief and happiness. Wow, that sucks. There is nothing else to say. I am really sorry. I have suffered multiple miscarriages, and now currently dealing with bells. It is a lot. And to deal with it all at the same time, i can not imagine your pain and frustration. Hang in there. Love to you. I am so very sorry. All of the things you have experienced can be very isolating, and I am so proud of you for being brave and reaching out. Vent away, I have found this to be a very supportive community. \n\nI am two weeks since the diagnosis and while I can now blink my eye a little, I am not seeing any other change. It is hard. It is a lot. \n\nTo have a miscarriage too\u2026 \n\nTime to be completely self aware. If you need a nap, take a nap. If you need to cry and scream, do it. If you need to eat the whole container of potato salad\u2026 bon appetite! \n\n\u2764\ufe0f"]
