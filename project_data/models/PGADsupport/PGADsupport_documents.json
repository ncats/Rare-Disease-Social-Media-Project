["Scared of PGAD I have been suffering from POCD for a few months but around a week ago I had a really strong groinal response and intrusive thought. I thought it would go away so I tried to ignore it for the first day or two but when I read an article about PGAD it made everything so much worse. I cried every single day and felt like shit, I am scared I have it, I am scared it will not go away, it sucks so much. But recently its gotten a little better if im doing something or completely ignoring it i will not really feel it and when I wake up In the morning i do not feel it either I have the same thing as u, it sucks but you are not alone :)", "Constant? For people with Pgad (I am not sure if I have this or not)\nAre symptoms constant and unrelenting or do they come and go like flare ups? Its both (at least for me), its always there but some days I feel like I cam function in society and there are times where I lock all my doors, have my therapist on dial and just want to cry Both. It is constant and gets much worse sometimes Same here, it is constant but sometimes it is barely noticeable other times it is unbearable. It makes me incredibly anxious. I cannot believe I have this awful condition. It makes me feel less of a woman, it is taken so much from me, I barely recognise myself any more. Can I ask is there a cause for your PGAD? I am not sure if I have it or if it is just my anxiety making my symptoms physical Can I ask what caused your PGAD, if you know? Im not sure if I have this, I am terrified to be honest but I am a very anxious person as it is and I cannot think of anything that could cause this for me other than anxiety, so maybe it is just all anxiety, who knows :/ v frustrating I know that feeling all too well :/ Your best bet and I say this to anyone afflicted with this curse is to consult your doctor, there is a good chance that it is all just anxiety but letting it fester in your mind only makes it worse Ive been to four doctors that cannot seem to tell me what is wrong, a few suggestions of anxiety but it just feel so real you know? Thanks so much for your comment and stay strong \u2764\ufe0f Yea its true ALOT of doctors are woefully in the dark about this condition for...some reason idk but thank you too, hopefully you overcome this hurdle but do come back if you ever need to talk and stuff Thank you so much! When I was describing symptoms the doctors looked at me like I am crazy! I cannot stand this feeling My guess is that because I had developed it so young they took me more seriously but now that im older, only the doctors whove known me a while really understand, idk why some doctors are so dismissive of this Have you tried any treatment options? My doctor told me it sounds like I am having some nerve hypersensitivity since I have symptoms of itching in the bottoms of my feet and tingling in my body etc along with the arousal. I was given some epilepsy meds which work for nerve pain, not sure if they will do much since I am not exactly in pain but anyways I have tried a number of things with little to no affect and surgeries that have been brought up may not even fix the issue so I dont really want to risk that and have since learned to sort of live with it No idea, some kind of neuropathy near as I can tell I do a good job controlling the feelings during the day but when I go to bed the feelings are strong enough to awaken me. I see, have you tired any medicines? Yes, I take Zolpidem to help with sleep whenever I feel the sensations building before bedtime. Atleast something to help", "24 Year Old Male I have been suffering from this condition what seems like forever. I have been struggling with masturbation since I was about 4. Lately things have gotten better, however I can only go about 1-2 weeks before spontaneous spasm like orgasms start. I have never been one to post on the internet. However, I feel that whoever come across this post will see men suffer from this too. \n\nMasturbating goes against my upbringing but urges feel overwhelming at times. I have found a combination of Brolemain and 120,000spu serrapaptase takes the edge off but eventually I get very overwhelmed. For me triggers are everywhere from bumpy car rides, to someone touching me without being prepared for it. \n\nAny tips you guys have for dealing with this condition will be appreciated. Try looking for a doctor that specializes in sexual dysfunctions and knows about PGAD and has treated other patients successfully, they are the only ones that would be able to diagnose and treat you because PGAD can be caused by so many things.", "is this pgad? Okay hello everyone! around 2 days ago i masturbated, and afterwards i have had a feeling that i cannot describe down there. I cannot cross my legs or close my legs without feeling this sensation of pleasure? if that makes any sense. It is so uncomfortable when these little episodes happen. but i have been very anxious due to some personal issues happening right now and was off birth control around 1 month ago. I am new to this thing, i am not very sure if it is this but i need help on this because it is so uncomfortable and i feel so guilty.  hoping some of you can give me tips or insight on what is happening :) i also forgot to mention i have ocd if that has to do with this ! If my wife and I have a lengthy amount of sex (&gt;1 hour) her labia gets very puffy and walking or even sometimes just closing her legs rubs it enough to turn her on all over again. Could it be that? Do you syntribate any? i used to, but i had stopped. I was thinking the same\nthing, bc it is only when i close my legs! Use a cold compress to ease the swelling and that might help. hi, im new to this as well. i started having symptoms at the beginning of last month they went away as quickly as they came once i stopped researching symtoms. i have hypochondria so i tend to over think a lot, my symptoms returned a few days ago and it is driving me crazy! i definitely think it is anxiety because it went away completely until i started thinking about it again sometimes i have relapses with hypochondria if im not completely reassured i dont have an illness. it will go away eventually im pretty sure you are probably just experiencing anxiety but if not it could be the birth control i would try to get in touch with a doctor if you can! best of luck to you!! if you would like to message me or need reassurance feel free to! Yesss, only when i think about it! It is so annoying", "Do You Moan or Scream often or All The Time? For those of you who are aroused or are in pain, do you find that you are moaning and/or screaming a lot?  If so, does it get to a point where other people around you get annoyed? Um this is a question that has nothing to do with the basis setup of the support group. I am sure pretty much everyone with this syndrome does their best to suppress vocal expression in public. Pertaining to those in their lives for long term an understanding has often been reached to just ignore this reaction if it does escape into vocal range inappropriately.", "My minor PGAD-like symptom and an inquiry about psychological triggers that might relate to PGAD  First of all, hi. I (Male) just found this subreddit, and after skimming through some posts which described the tingling sensation, i realised i must have felt something similar too. I dont suffer from PGAD, but i remember since childhood that if i were to do something that was a bad idea and knew i shouldnt, i would get tingling sensation on my glans. Usually it was wasting time and pushing deadlines, or being curious and nosey with other peoples belongings(but i wasnt doing that very often), so things that were bad for myself mostly or that would get me yelled at.   \n I thought it would be interesting to see if this happened to other people. I was thinking that maybe, a sensation like this, either during situations similar to mine or other, could be a sort of predictor for future development of PGAD(general tendency or openness to this particular sensation ), or an indication for the psychological status that might enable or intensify it.  \n \n\nSo, were there in the past situations unrelated to sexual activity that caused this arousal-like tingling sensation? If yes, do you think a similar situation to those, could have triggered or reinforced your current streak of PGAD symptoms? IDK, but in my case, I get the pseudo-arousal sensations specifically when my prostate is inflamed, which is a recurring issue for me. Not sure if that is your thing, though.", "Does vibrators make pgad worse? I have a hard time achieving orgasm with just my fingering my clit. My pgad is not as bad as others, but it is dehabilitating . \nI have a theory that vibrators  make pgad worse because it is it overestimulating the clit, ( i have not tried  a vibrator yet.. maybe it will not make my pgad worse, so Iwas thinking of buying one)....\n and plus  my clit feels numb, so what if using a vibrator makes that problem worse?? That has always been my worry.\nIf anyone here can relate please pm me... I am seeing a gynecologist for the first time soon, I am waiting on my referral. \n( i have been dealing with pgad since I was 12, some days I forget I have it, some days my pgad makes me extremely depressed) Please message me. I have similar theories but never meant someone else with this i would say yes it could be bad. as  a male with a unique pgad cause that brings me closer to a female response than a male one, any kind of continuous stimulation is just pelvic pressure torture. for the few people that have an easier time reaching finish and/or have a significant delay in return of symptoms it would be prolly ok though. it all depends on how your pgad issues respond really and every person is different.\n\njust keep in mind the more you ramp it up the longer the fall on the other side. some places like walmart sell a very cheap vibrator toy and i would def try that first before investing in a good toy just in case you find its an utter catastrophe. you never know until you try is the bad thing. Thanks I messaged you. Hope you are safe. I messaged you.  I too have not met anyone with this. Only talked to people online about it.", "It is a punishment from god!!!

However, PGAD is a dysfunction that does not include the trigger that sets off MY \u2018waves.\u2019 When my bladder fills up, there is a point where my pudendal nerve is either extremely compressed or innervated. Sometimes I will be in a deep sleep and be violently awoken by my shaking body and surge of hormones, or I will be at school at my desk... or at work talking to my boss. I have learned to hide these waves, because it happens to me dozens upon dozens of times per day. Each time this happens to me... it feels like my body is being involuntarily raped.\nAfter every day, I am exhausted, angry, and scared. After every day, I sob the words: \u201cit is not my fault,\u201d ...but sometimes it feels like it is... because I am so misunderstood.\nWhat will my married life be like? What will happen if I ever get pregnant? What will dating different people be like?\nI have done everything alone, because people do not understand.\nI have seen doctors about my case, and each doctor does not know what to do because there are not cases like mine that they or other doctors have ever seen. Not to mention, I have been invalidated time and time again from doctors who do not believe me. I have done so much research... yet have found no answers; just a further hole to dig.\nHowever, After 5 years of this torture, I still have not put down the torch. Even though I cannot confide in friends much, even after it feels like I am being raped time and time again by my own body, even after I am sapped of my energy, have trauma, depersonalization, anxiety, and fear from my pelvic floor dysfunction... I am still fighting.\nEven though I have not found a person out there who is like me at all.... I am still fighting.\nEven though I am terribly alone with a problem which has done so much damage in my life, I am still looking for reconciliation.\nI yearn for light to be shed on those who are silently suffering who I wish were not judged. People with seizures would not be judged like I would be... even though people with seizures have episodes just as involuntary.\nTo the women and men out there who may be silently suffering as I have been... come forth. Whether anonymously or in-person, do so purposefully. People around you who YOU think are amazing and strong people... could be struggling with demons beyond your comprehension, and many times its all the same: nobody\u2019s fault. It is a mere fact of life that can best be helped through acceptance, humility, education, validation, and love. \n\nOverall... know there are those perhaps within your own family... who cannot get help and are stuck. Do not let the predispositions of men prevent YOU from enveloping humility. Love \u2014notwithstanding the things you do not understand. Embrace everyone, as we all have beating hearts... though many times faint.\n\nI wish that I had found a person much like me before I had dug a hole this deep. Hopefully, however, I put this shovel to rest in light of my greatest goal: Peace and unwavering Reconciliation.\n\nI have found that the best remedy for some people with PGAD is to talk it out. Feel free to message me to vent, ask questions, or anything really. I feel compassion for all of you. \n\nLet us keep fighting.\u2665\ufe0f Welcome to our little corner, we all know what it is like to go through this rubbish and have the world look on us with whatever contempt they have for us\n\nLet us keep fighting together and in time overcome it all \u2764 Hope you manage to find a way to get this to go away \ud83d\ude0c This literally made me cry. I have been struggling with this for 7 years now, and have also felt so much anger, shame, and loneliness because of it. I hope as more people come out with this, we can gain more knowledge to fight it. Thank you for sharing your story. \u2665\ufe0f", "Help is this what is actually happening to me I need advice because I cannot tell if I have hypersexuality or PGAD. I spoke with a gynecologist today and after telling her that I have a issue chronically materbating and I could have hypersexuality she asked me a few questions I did not know how to answer. She asked \nDid I do it to escape my feelings \nDo I do it as an outlet \nDo I do it for pleasure \nAll I answered no to. I will fill you in on why I told her this. I had some pap smears and ultrasounds done when I started getting pains in my pelvic area. Everything come back perfectly fine and I told her I may have stretched a muscle materbating. I told her that I do this on a daily basis because I need to release tension and pressure and it is not for pleasure. She told me to talk to my psychiatrist I am seeing in November and my last psychiatrist was not sure if I had bipolar or not therefore I could have hypersexuality but here is what I thought I should have told her while on the phone with her but never mentioned \nIt is a physical sensations that happens all the time I do not think about sexual things when it occurring\nI feel physical swelling and contractions most of the time \nEven when I orgasm multiple times the sensation does not go away \nShe asked if I had ever seen sexually abused and I told her I never was and she said the sytoms I described she is seen in victims of abuse yet I never was \nI never told her any physical sytoms only I feel horny all the time \"It is a physical sensations that happens all the time I do not think about sexual things when it occurring I feel physical swelling and contractions most of the time Even when I orgasm multiple times the sensation does not go away\". This definitely sounds like PGAD. And PGAD could be related to past abuse but it is NOT always related to that. It is really hard to find doctors who know and understand this condition but do not give up. This is exactly what I am experiencing thanks \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI can feel my \ud83d\ude38 swelling and contracting 24/7 and no matter how much I have sex or masterbating I am horny. I will get turned on for no reason and after each orgasms I will get horny again right away. I will get off multiple times a day orgasming but never get rid of the  sensation of being arroused\n\nI always feel like I am on the verge of orgasming even though I am not sexually stimulation and I am just sitting around doing nothing to turn myself on", "it started Hello, I am female 24. Sorry for my English, I am not native speaker.\nSo it started 4 days ago after masturbation, I felt some tingling down there and could not unfocus on it . So I could not sleep at all, had panic attack cause of it. Next day I was still scared and could not unfocus, was thinking about it whole day, never had that before. Also I felt very awkward because I could not say about that to anyone, felt very lonely with this problem. I started to Google and found PGAD. I am even more scared it will not dissappear anymore. Ofc orgasm did not help to this. Sometimes it gets better when I am not thinking about it, but i feel it again especially when I am laying down. So it is difficult to fall asleep. Is there anyone who had the similar story to mine? I found that it can be treated with some medicines, is there some way to heal it without medicines? It feels like tingling / something like itchy (?), very annoying. Visually nothing wrong.\nThanks a lot. Hey,\nI know a lot about pgad so maybe I can help :)\nDoes it feel more like constant arousal or is it just a weird feeling in general? and is it only when you are laying down or also when you are sitting? Yes.  Sometimes a tingling, sometimes a throbbing.  Relief is temporary, perhaps twenty minutes or so, then back to building arousal with no sustained relief within my grasp...  (sighs)  :( Hello thank you! I noticed it happens when I am moving. Even when laying. Just like if clitoris were super sensitive... Okay hm that could be a lot of things \ud83d\ude05 but based on what you described before it actually does sound a lot like pgad or RGS especially because it is less when you do not focus on it.\nThe problem with pgad is that it is very rare and still pretty unknown so it might be hard to find the right kind of doctor but you should definitely try to find someone. \nAnother problem is that there is no cure for it yet because the cause is still unclear but it often has something to do with damaged nerves.\n(It is also a side effect of antidepressants)\nIf a part of the nervous system is damaged it cannot work the way it should and it might send wrong signals to your brain. That is what could cause that weird feeling you are having (I am not a doctor though). What might help is homeopathic tablets or pills with lavender or something similar to sort of stop the vicious circle in your brain. Because what often happens is that pgad is combined with a lot of fear and anxiety which only makes sense and is completely natural but fear affects your nerves and therefore increases the uncomfortable sensation. So what is going on is you have this feeling, you get anxious, it gets worse..\nMeditation might also help or therapy if needed :) Anything to get rid of the fear first before you can start with the actual treatment. What you should probably do before you start taking any kind of medicine is see a gynecologist to check if it is not just an infection, see an orthopedist because it could also have something to do with your bone structur, if possible do an MRT, see a neurologist to get your brain waves checked and go to your usual doctor to do a blood test. If you have a vitamin (D or B12) or folic acid deficiancy this could be the cause for damaged nerves. I know it is a lot :( but it is really important to find and fight the cause and not just the symptomes. While you are trying to find out what it is these are a few things that usually help ease the feeling:\n-taking warm baths (maybe with lavender extract)\n-no sex or masturbation because it could irritate it further \n-try a numbing creme, it might make the feeling go away for a few hours and it does not need to be prescripted\n-avoid sitting for longer periods because the affected nerves are in your lower back \n-taking long walks \n-distract yourself with anything you can think of\n-wear comfortable underwear like boxer shorts \nAnd most importantly try not to worry too much. Irritated nerves can heal. Just because there is not a cure yet does not mean it will not go away. Some people have reported that it went away as sudden as it came without any treatment. So you might wake up tomorrow and it is gone. It might not even be that rare but it is very likely that a lot of people are too embarrassed to go to a doctor. It is also not something you would mention to everyone so you never know who might struggle with it. Try to relax and tell yourself that there is nothing wrong with you and that it will go away. \nSorry for the long text I was trying to make it short but it did not really work. I hope it was a little helpful \u263a Omg thank you I am crying, it is so well written, a lot of info and u gave me hope. I was totally hopeless after reading another stories of people who are suffering from this by years and still could not find a treatment. Thank you so much Virtual hug for you! Aw I am glad :)\nI know it is so scary and all those negative reports are not helping at all but I am pretty sure it will go away. If it came without a warning it can leave just like that. Just give your body some time to heal. Some people say it helps to see it as nothing but TMS (too much stress) so that the feeling is just a reminder too take things slow and to solve whatever might be stressig you out. Like some people get headaches when they are stressed, some people feel nauseous etc. and maybe this is just your symptome of being unconsciously stressed.. I also forgot to add that if you have trouble falling asleep because it is so annoying and uncomfortable it might help to put a hot water bottle on your lower back and sleeping on your stomach. Or try to irritate your nerves with hot and cold that might numb them for a while so you could fall asleep peacefully ^^. Laying like a baby would can also help because babys automatically lay in a position where everything is in the right place (in case the cause is something wrong with the bone structure) I also have this yt link for pelvic floor exercises that have helped some people for it to go away completely after a few months. (  ) Okay that is it sorry I just really cannot keep it short :c What is RGS?  (curious) It stands for Restless Genital Syndrom and is often used as a synonym Thank you. Hi! I was wondering if it got any better for you at all since it is been a few weeks? I\u2018m just now suffering from the same symptoms and feeling very lost. Thank you", "My story and how I got better... I hope I posted this in an other group (for RLS), but I see many posts here asking for advice, so let me repost my story here. I added some details and updated with recent developments \n\nPlease note: PGAD is also known as RGS, which is the term I used here\n\nMy story:\n- I was on Sertraline (antidepressants) for a few months then we increased the dosage from 100mg to 150mg\n- A few days later, I started having my first RLS symptoms\n- We had to increase Sertraline again to 200mg\n- Then came RGS (Restless genital syndrom), which is even worse than RLS\n- My doctor prescribed Quetiapine to help me sleep and said it would help with the symptoms \n- Then I stopped sleeping, mostly. Always falling asleep only when extremely exhausted. I was feeling so bad and that was actually the worst time of my d\u00e9pression\n- I called my doctor crying telling her to do something or i will just stop my meds altogether or worse... I felt very bad\n- I was finally able to convince her to decrease my Sertraline dosage to 150mg, then to 100mg a week later\n- My RLS + RGS got a little better and I got a lot better. I was doing so good with my depression that I went back to work\n- RLS was mostly gone but RGS still annoyed me\n- Doctor prescribed pramipexole 0.25mg and it helped a lot\n- We increased pramipexole to 0.50mg and I had a whole 3 weeks without symptoms\n- I just started having mild symptoms of RGS again a few days ago. It is still manageable, but I hope it does not get worse Thanks for sharing! I had heard pramipexole can help with PGAD but have not tried it myself. Glad you got relief! Wow, that is awesome you found something that worked. Do not worry, 'mild symptoms' could just be normal arousal perhaps?", "Do i have PGAD??? (21F) a couple days ago i felt a slight stinging in my left pelvic area it did not hurt really just something i noticed. After that i have noticed that my vagina has been pulsing almost as if I am aroused? The last few days I have felt aroused even though I am not actually aroused. I had not masturbated awhile prior to this but i did last night for the first time thinking maybe that is what i needed to do but still have the same feeling on and off today. Will masturbating make it worse? Idk if this is pgad please help :( also I am not in any pain or anything and have not orgasmed unintentionally.", "scared I might have PGAD? so I have heard of this condition before, and was worried about it in the past, but chalked it up to being a teen. \n\nI am 18, FTM . I had a UTI recently and the back pain that lead me to go to patient first has dissolved, and I took my whole course of antibiotics as prescribed (amoxicillin). \n\nThe past couple days, I have been having a really annoying and frustrating sensation. I cannot tell if it is my urethra or vagina- it is a sort of tingling, or something like an itch inside somewhere that needs to be scratched, and my brain seems to be registering it as arousal. I will just be sitting downstairs in the chair near my dad, on my phone and it randomly comes on in the evening. \n\nIt might be because I am PMSing, but it is making me incredibly frustrated to the point I want to cry and hit something. I cannot tell for sure what the feeling is. I have orgasmed repeatedly with no relief . \n\nI am scared and will try to get it looked into as soon as possible, but I could use some advice or guidance? I desperately do not want to deal with this You might have a yeast infection, pretty common after antibiotics. You can treat that with over the counter medications, but much better would be to contact your doctor, to be sure. I absolutely understand what your feeling I had this devilish disease 2 years ago and it drove me crazy took anti depressants and gone unfortunately it is back now when it  came at first I have checked and i also had ult took antibiotics and nothing really change the sensation did not go a way and am still waiting till this day although it been almost 3 weeks and nothing change I do not know what tell you But some people say they took xanax for instant relief I have not tried it yet though!!!!! This sounds possible. I am really hoping it is that. that, or the UTI did not disappear completely maybe\u2026 hoping desperately it is just not PGAD", "Social life as a pervert As most of you know, pgad is more likely to occur to those of whom have had their early years of life being exposed to sexual environments.\n\nAs an 18 year old female, I have probably had this condition since 11, but only became completely aware of it after a few naughty mishaps with drugs, especially ecstasy. Only imagine the terror that filled me when I realised that it is not anxiety that is making my whole body shake in front of a group of friends...\n\nThe best way for me to explain how I constantly feel would be to compare this uncomfortable sensation to edging.. as if you are about to reach orgasm but you stop... and your body yearns for that great and joyous relief but alas, it never cums, and you are stuck in blue ball hell.\n\nIt is quite  difficult to reach orgasm as I am mostly tensed up most of the time and really uncomfortable.. the only time I manage to relax is when my mind is completely worry free, and that is usually around friends or out and about in public.. yet it is quite unsettling to almost let out a full moan or to roll your eyes backwards whilst speaking to your friend about current events or whilst standing in queue at your local supermarket.\n\nWhat has helped me through these very 'hard' times is humor honestly.. nothing funnier than being a walking human vibrator in public.\n\nDo you guys also panic whenever people tell you \"come here!\"... as if I am not cumming everywhere already.\n\nUnfortunately, no amount of masterbation or sex has satisfied me. It has, however, made me physically exhausted but still wanting to keep ringing the doorbell, and it has also put me in a constant state of proper orgasms for quite a few hours... which might sound like a day well spent,but honestly I just want to be able to relax and ride the bus without feeling like I am having a massive orgy with everyone I look at.\n\nHow have you been tackling your tickling pickle sotuation ?", "Please help me im not sure why i cant see posts from my other acc so im going to post from this one too. \n\nHELP! i am an 18 year old female lesbian and 4 months ago i began getting feelings that after researching i believed to be PGAD. after just 3 days of these feelings i had a strong urge to kill myself i was embarrassed and ashamed and felt completely alone. i am not sure what the trigger was but i had never masturbated to completion until one day i did after watching straight sex which made me feel gross and ashamed bc i am a lesbian. the PGAD feelings did not begin immediately after orgasm, they started about 2 days later out of nowhere. i do not know what to do i am seriously considering suicide please does anybody know any cure. i often find myself losing sleep and becoming quite an insomniac. i really cannot do this much longer. please help me. i have tried icing and pelvic stretches but nothing really helps. does anybody know if there is possibly a way to mutilate my clit in someway to stop the feelings i am seriously consider cutting my clit or something to maybe cut a nerve to make my clit completely numb. PLEASE HELP ME IM BEGGING I NEED A CURE. Hi! I am sorry you are going through this. I know how you feel, I was desperate too a few weeks ago. I called my doctor crying and begging her to do something. My symptoms first appeared when I was taking Sertraline for my depression and were causing more distress than the depression itself. My Dr finally prescribed pramipexole 0.25mg for my PGAD. It was not effective at first, bur when we increased to 0.5mg and decreased Sertraline to 200mg the symptoms disappeared. It is been something around 3 weeks now and I am starting to feel it again, but not as intense as before. I really hope it does not get worse again. If it does, I might stop my antidepressants against my doctor's advice\n\nI do not have any advice, but I wanted to share my story so you maybe have hope. I hope you find a cure soon and do not mutilate yourself\n\nEdit: I just posted my whole story on this sub if you are interested I do not know if you are feeling better or not but I myself am looking into dorsal nerve neurolysis which is not quite cutting the clitoris, but dampening the sensitivity of the nerves.\n\n", "Unfortunate circumstance So this is an issue I have not seen on here yet but I imagine im not the only one who has to deal with this but suffering from spontaneous orgasms with an uncircumcised penis, unfortunately combined with an extremely abnormal amount of semen produced leads to having my foreskin filled with semen alot of the time\n\nAs you could imagine its a very irritating process to deal with and I just wondered if anyone else is in my position here  Yup happens alot but I take lots of showers to deal with it", "I think my girlfriend just had her onset of this yesterday. Any advice? I am 18 and she is 19, and randomly when she was venting to me after having some anxiety last night, she said she had a weird feeling she is never felt before and said it was like she almost had an orgasm but it went went away for a bit. She told me then today that she is still having this feeling, and that she just ignored it then cause she was tired. She says it is really frustrating and uncomfortable and I am really worried about her. She has been doing good with coping with it/ignoring it though. Does anyone have any info/advice? She is going to talk to her mom about seeing a gynecologist tomorrow btw And also to add a bit more info, she says she is not in pain at all, she does not feel horny or have the urge to have sex, and has not ever had a full orgasm, but that the feeling is a \"5\" on a scale of hitting your funny bone to stepping on a lego. I will stay by her side no matter what happens or develops though. The only thing that works for me is sitting in an ice bath for 20 minutes. It numbs the area and reduces blood flow. Have her try it!", "I am scared Hi! I am a 22 year old female, and for the past two weeks or so I have gotten PGAD symptoms. I have had the disorder since I was 15. I had symptoms for months back then and I remember wanting to die, finding no release and being too embarassed to talk to anyone about it. Then it just stopped, I do not remember doing anything specific but suddenly I did not get the symptoms anymore. \n\nAnyways, about two weeks ago I started feeling it again. I am hopeful this will go away like it did last time, but I have doubt. What if it is here to stay this time? These last days have been hell. I am growing more and more anxious day by day. I cannot sleep. It takes hours to fall asleep and I wake up multiple times a night to a burning sensation in my genitals. That is mainly what it is for me, this horrible burning and throbbing sensation that does not go away no matter what I do. I cannot be intimate with my boyfriend. He is been wonderful though, I told him and thank god he took it seriously and has been trying his best to make me feel better.\n\nStill I feel like there is no cure, I cannot distract myself with anything. Hanging out with friends has become almost impossible, and public places give me major anxiety. I cannot begin to describe how debilitating this disorder is and what it does to my mental health. I feel a constant mix of anxiety, fear and frustration. Yesterday I was thinking about ending my life. I am just in a very dark place right now. I booked an appointment with my gyno but I am scared there is nothing doctors can do since I live in a relatively small country and I cannot even find any information on PGAD in my language.\n\nI just wanted to share my story.

Hello everyone, I am sorry you all have to go through something so horrible like this. This condition sounds terrible and I could never wish it on anyone, I hope everyone is doing ok now. I am not proofreading or fixing errors in this or anything since I currently find it hard to focus on any tasks. So, I just turned 16 and around 2 weeks ago I woke up to an extremely uncomfortable tingling/burning sensation around my vagina that wont go away. It seems to be worse when i lay down or close my eyes. I am unable to go to sleep and focus on my school work. I feel fatigued and unable to ignore it, no matter what I am doing. I have tried to look things up that is similar and all i get is uti results. It has similar symptoms to a uti but my pee is not cloudy or doesnt feel exactly to a uti (I have had them in the past). It goes away for a few hours then comes back and its driving me crazy. The closest thing I found to my symptoms is PGAD, which is why I am asking for your opinion here. Its genuinely so uncomfortable and I have tried to masturbate to relieve my symptoms but it doesnt work. I have a constant urge to pee however nothing comes put or feels relieving. I am genuinely distraught and scared. Im sorry if this isnt the right sub to put this in but I am out of options. My parents dont seem to take me very seriously and I have nowhere else to turn to. Thank you in advance. sounds more like some sort of infection to me than PGAD if u have to pee it is mostly arousal but also having to pee, I am hoping it is just an infection though. I am a 14 year old female. I have been feeling the same thing. I went to the dr to see if it was a uti. She did a little test there, and she said it came back normal. Waiting for the other results from a better lab at the moment. I have been doing research and it could be anxiety, or just hormones. It is normal for teenagers to feel this way, from what I heard. Did you get your period? Online it says that 2 weeks before your period, you could feel extremely aroused/horny(due to hormones).\n\nWhat helped me was just to get my mind off of it. Stop thinking about it. Does walking/running/being active make your symptoms better (less noticeable)? Could be RLS; restless leg syndrome. Sorry but I dont think its possible to \"stop thinking about it\" trust me, I wish I could. Running nor walking makes it seem better so I dont think its RLS. I 100% believe that its tied to my anxiety since I panic about it a lot or by accident I make it worse. I do not know if my period is coming on yet but it is a possibility that it may have something to do with it. Currently waiting for results on a pee test, but I dont think it is a UTI anymore. Do you by now what it is? I hope it is gone. Im having a constant urge to pee, cant ignore it. Sometimes I think it is arousal but feeling the need to pee is also almost the same as arousal. Hard to tell. The feeling is around urethra, but then from the inside so I guess the bladder... but it is hard to localize. Urine tests all came back negative for bacteria so it is very frustrating. I Will have contact with my urologist on the 6th January for further investigation. The only thing that helps me (especially to sleep) in the meantime is Flu Alprazolam (light dosis of Xanax)... that calms it down a bit... painkillers doesnt do anything. It went away within 2 weeks, hopefully doesnt come back any time soon. It could possibly be from upcoming period or body reaction/allergy. Im also sort of a hypochondriac so that possibly made my syptoms a bit worse, but I am not sure since it may not be the same for you. Wishing you the best of luck, hoping itll turn out okay! So I just today found out what PGAD is after so many years of suffering from it (20F). And I have memories of being around 7 and having to get up to pee 10-20 times in a night and that happening a lot in my childhood where I felt like I really needed to pee but did not have a uti. I am now wondering if my PGAD has something to do with that even though I did not start getting the REALLY REALLY painful PGAD until around a year ago when I was 18. Before that I had mild PGAD when I was 11 and it led me to discovering masturbation and did not know what it was other than that I felt like I had to do it daily sometimes. Another way I would describe PGAD is like restless leg syndrome if it was happening in *other* parts of your body.", "Supplements to avoid? Will things like THC/CBD make things worse?  I take magnesium glycinate for sleep RLS, but what about l theanine or Inositol? \n\nI got some CBD:THC 1:1 gummies today but afraid to try them. THC definitely yes for me. THC can make anxiety worse but CBD has a calming effect. Does anxiety trigger yours ? If yes, it should help.", "Growing up with pgad Growing up with this abomination of a condition is tough, real tough and even after that it is just a difficult ride throughout life with this although that is probably already been said to death around here, everyday can be a struggle and that is not even mentioning the scorn and stigma people throw around because of it, im sick of embarrassing myself to no end for even the sortest trips to the shop or at work (on days that I can work that is), its nothing short of being life threateningly humiliating but too little can be done about it\n\nTo anyone else who suffers or is worried about symptoms, talking to somone, even faceless Internet people can help at least dispel some worries you might have, there is a fair few of us here and we all know what it is like first hand so do not hesitate to send a message if your feeling low I obviously cant say much of the matter since ive never experienced it but I hope that something will happen that can change your situation for the better \ud83d\udc9e Thank you", "I did not know what was happening to me Hi all, I am a male. A few months ago I started getting this tingling sensation in my penis, I was not hard or anything like that but I had this overwhelming urge to cum. Luckily I was home alone so I was able to, this curbed the feeling for a day or 2 but then it came back and it just keeps coming back. Sometimes I will be busy with stuff and I just get this feeling like I need to orgasm, or even sometimes feel like I am about to without being hard. I just found this sub after trying to figure out what was wrong with me. Does anyone else get this as well? It is not constant like I have read some people have but it is still distracting and very random. PGAD is usually constant so I do not know if that is what you have. Probably not. I used to get that feeling constantly out of nowhere, and it was really torturous. But actually For some reason I am getting this strange relief from my symptoms right now. So that is kind of odd, it might come back tho. Maybe your just feeling aroused more often? which is normal or maybe you have on and off pgad? But I honestly do not know if that is a thing? It might be. Pgad feels like you are constantly on impending orgasm, or you may get spontaneous orgasms without sexual stimuli. Do you experience this? If not, than you might just be horny. Not pgad. Hope you doing good!!! For guys, it might be something prostate-related, like prostatitis. Could not hurt to see a doctor over it and maybe look for lifestyle changes you could make.", "Awkward Question This is sort of embarrassing but... has anyone had PGAD lead into any unusual experimentation sexually? I am going through some things right now and I guess I have a lot of questions. For me PGAD is like an itch I have to scratch and sometimes that \"itch\" is difficult to reach. So yeah, I have felt and done unusual things What questions do you have?", "Living with PGAD It is been almost a year since my PGAD started and about a year since I posted anything about it. At the time this sub did not exist and I really did not know where to post what was happening to me. I never post on Reddit, but after spending the past year going through hell and now finding a new normal that is manageable, I want to share my experience and what has worked for me as it may help others.\n\n(\n\nI am not a doctor so this is not a professional opinion or insight. I am a veteran and I got to the VA and the doctors there have been less than helpful. I have had more \u201cspecialist\u201d look at my junk in the past year than I can count. Ive done multiple sleep tests, tons of blood/lab work, and even had 2 prostate exams. So far there is no clear diagnosis except for hyper-sexual disorder. They are afraid to call it PGAD.\n\nThe number of unprovoked orgasms increased to about 4-6 per day in the weeks following the first one (some dry and some wet) This is the one of the worst parts. It got to the point that I would not leave the house unless I was wearing a condom. \n\nMy erection never went away, even following an orgasm and I had no refractory period. My sexual desires and sexual ideology went through the roof and I developed a porn addiction. I went from watching porn about once a every week or two to watching it whenever I could. The first 6 or so months after this all started became a downward spiral. \n\nI had a warm fuzzy feeling at the base of my penis and in my balls that would turn into pain if I did not have an orgasm, and I rubbed my penis raw a lot. \n\nI was put back on different ssri\u2019s, other non ssri ADs and even tried Tramadol but they did not help. I started taking CBD and it helped with the migraines and some of the head fog. About 6 months ago my wife went to Colorado and brought back some 2.5 mg THC 5mg CBD edible and for the first time I actually had positive results.\n\nThe edibles did not fix all my symptoms but they made it more manageable. I now take them everyday, 2.5-5 mg 2-3x per day (I tried 10mg once and that actually made things worse and got me too messed up). I can still function normally at that dose and I only have about 1 unprovoked orgasm per week now. I still have a constant erection and no refractory period but sometimes my erection will soften a little, almost like being 80% hard, which is a huge improvement. It has not decreased my sexual appetite but it makes it easier to manage. I do not get a lot of pain at the base of my penis anymore but that fuzzy warm feeling is always there. I am still experiencing vivid wet dreams about 3 times per week give or take. \n\nI have had to make some changes in my life. Going out in public is still an issue but it is doable. If I am 90% sure I am not going to have an orgasm. The weirdest thing is walking around with a noticeable erection all the time. I wear clothes that help hide it but it is still noticeable. \n\nWe told another couple that we are friends with about my situation and how the edibles have helped. I regret doing that because things feel awkward now. My wife does not think so but I catch both of them looking at my junk a lot when we are around and the woman has become overly friendly. I am pretty sure they have told others too. Certain dynamics have changed with certain friends in our group, with some people being more friendly, with some of the women coming in for big hugs when we see them which they did not do in the past. The edibles help with anxiety and make me more sociable so it could just be the result of me being more friendly. On the flip side, some of our friends have stopped coming around and have stopped inviting us to parties or get togethers.\n\nThis is my new normal. It is not what it was before this all stared but it is 100% better than what it was 8 months ago. Sorry for the long post, I have got more things to say and could type a book on my past years experiences but I am going to end it here. I am going to try and post about this more often going forward. Thank you for sharing with us!", "Please talk to your doctor if you think you have PGAD I was originally diagnosed with PGAD thought to be caused by a previous brain injury.\nHowever, through more thorough investigation and testing this past week, I have been rediagnosed by my GP with idiopathic focal seizures/convulsive episodes and spontaneous orgasms of psychosomatic origin. I absolutely feel that this is the correct diagnosis because now that I have spoken with my therapist about this and have begun using coping techniques during the episodes, the episodes have already reduced in severity and frequency.\n\nIf you believe you have PGAD but are undiagnosed, please talk to a medical professional if you have access!! Because if you do have PGAD, the possible cause of it is important to investigate and your doctor might be able to provide you with some treatment of some kind, or at the very least, give you the confirmation that you do have PGAD and that it is not something else. And if you do not have PGAD, there may also be treatment options and the cause is also so important to find out.\nI know it might feel like an awkward conversation and you might feel afraid you will not be believed or taken seriously, or you might just be shy about it, but you have to try to get answers because a lot of things can mimic PGAD. You are worthy of good health.\n\nI will no longer need this subreddit, but I appreciated the support and knowledge it gave me. Best of luck to all of you in your health journey. :) Could you please share the coping techniques you use? Hi! ( back when I thought I had PGAD about coping techniques that were helping me, and many still do now that I know they are psychosomatic seizures. Nowadays, if someone is with me when it happens, a cool towel on the forehead, helping me lie on my side, or simply just holding my hand and talking to me calmly really helps. If I am alone, I try to lie on my side when I feel it about to happen and brace my abdomen with a pillow, because that is what muscle group convulses the most (and therefore, ends up fatiguing and hurting the most). I have heard of people using smelling salts, ice, or similar concepts (any sudden intense sensory experience) to snap people out of psychosomatic seizures, but that sounds like absolute hell to me and like it would make my anxiety worse. Mine are luckily, typically no longer than 5 minutes, so it is never come to that.\n\n\nThe main thing I have to stress is to go to a doctor and get testing if you have not already, to verify what it is (if its PGAD, an epileptic vs idiopathic seizure, etc). Get an EEG if you have not already if you are suspecting seizure activity/convulsions to find out the origin of the convulsions.", "Sudden PGAD I am 25(f), and have had all the symptoms for about a week now. I am seeing the dr in a few weeks but I just need to talk about this somewhere that has no judgement. The only person I have told so far is my hubby, and he is being as understanding as someone can be. Fortunately for me, I seem to have a mild case, or it at least has not gotten horribly bad. I do wake up in the middle of the night with intense feelings but after some time I am able to go back to sleep. I have no idea what my trigger initially was but driving seems to make it worse for me. It is very upsetting to read that there is not much in terms of cure/treatment, and that this could last my whole life. I am hoping since it is so new for me, after some time I will get so used to it that I will not be thinking about it as much as I am now. Any advice or help or even kind words would be much appreciated. I have some things that seem to relieve some of the symptoms, but nothing that seems to work so far. Thank you! I am so sorry you are experiencing this! I had it for over a year and now it is gone so please do not lose hope. For me I started pelvic pt and after 6ish months I realized when she would press on certain points on my lower left back the feeling would intensify times a million. It was weird but I could get the same satisfaction from that as having sex with my husband. We started doing dry needling and intense massage on the 1 million trigger points right there and it lessoned and eventually left. Now every few months I will start to get it back and what do you know right there is a bunch of knots again. We have now bought a good theragun that takes away the knots in a few days and the arousal goes away. It was so bizarre but just know that you can find what is triggering/irritating your nerves and I so so so hope you do. Please reach out to me if you need to talk. I have had a lot of pelvic issues but NONE compared to how hard it was to deal with this. I wanted to die. Sending you so much love. Thank you for responding. It is definitely causing me to lose my mind at some moments. Thankfully we are at a place that if I need to take off work, my husband is completely fine with it. I hope to one day find the cause/trigger but I am not going to put too much hope in that. I hoping when I see the dr they will have some things for me to try. I am happy to see that you were able to figure it out (: this is really something I would never wish on anyone!! Hi, my PGAD started literally overnight. I have theories but rather too personal to make public. Suffice to say it is been with me for exactly 9 months and 30 days. I am not young either at 62 so I was so confused. I have had consultations with my GP( useless) my psychiatrist who was very sympathetic but not knowledgable. BTW I have ADHD which does come into the theory. I have had acupuncture which does appear to have helped but at the same time I have changed ADHD meds so not sure if it is that. It is a very distressing condition and reading about it can make you very scared. Have you tried numbing cream? It can help especially when driving. If you need to message privately please do. I am confidential and happy to share my strange PGAD onset story. F/ I am pretty much the same as you for the past year with an improvement in some areas while others have worsened.  Nights have become hard when I am awaken by intense feelings, contractions and  a rush pleasure for what seems to be a long time.   I might wake up 4-5 times later in my sleep cycle toward mornings by what feels like powerful coregasms.  Sometimes it is just pressure and contractions without the orgasm, but regardless it tends to be times when I am in REM sleep according to my Fitbit.  I still am triggered driving in my car, usually when alone.  It must be the vibrations, IDK.  When I am with others in the car the feelings are more controllable.  Same if I am eating or drinking while driving.  But, if I am alone it mAkes for an interesting ride with the sensations beginning quickly in my ride.  I have found other areas during the day where the sensations are better.  Sitting on the couch watching tv or being outdoors where certain sounds act as a trigger are all improved.  I take a small dose of Zolpidem to help sleep, especially if I feel tingling in my abdomen or lower back at bed time.  While it is not foolproof 100% of the time it does allow me to sleep better with fewer wake ups. Hey I experienced something similar last week for the first time. It drove me crazy and caused a lot of anxiety. I managed to see a pelvic therapist who assured me that it can be fixed. My pelvic muscles were tight so I think I pulled a muscle While spinning/stretching that was irritating that branch of the pudendal nerve. She suggested a few exercises to loosen the pelvic floor muscles and also suggested that I apply heat in the area. I felt instant relief after using the heat pad there. I am still a little sensitive there probably because there is now blood flow and the nerve is still healing. This is so hopeful for me to read bc i am experiencing the same feelings and just had my first appointment with a pelvic physiologist last week. I see her again next week. Thank you for your words, mine has been going on for over a month now and it makes me want to die. I hate it. I just had my first appointment with a pelvic physiologist last week and it gives me hope to see that other people did pelvic pt and found relief from it. Did she say your condition is treatable? I think my nerve is still healing but I do not think it is pinched anymore - So I am still a little sensitive there but i will def share an update. If you catch it early you can def find a treatment that resolves the issue. I have been reading a lot about peripheral nerves and how they have tremendous power to heal on their own even if it takes a little time. I just want to add that when you are anxious the symptoms are exaggerated (nerves are just overexcited) and we tend to think this is permanent based on what we read online and how we are feeling in the moment but I really do not think this is permanent in any way for many people. People just do not write about their recovery online. When my anxiety took over I just take like 10 or more diaphragmatic breaths (deep, pelvic rising) and immediately start to feel the nerve calming down. \nMy therapist recommended frozen peas on crotch area (over underwear) when symptoms are bad. She also recommended heat in the pelvic area to relax muscles. Thanks for this \u2764 Hi, I am 29 and had a recent leep procedure two months ago. I now suffer from what I think is PGAD and I am terrified. I have suicidal thoughts because I cannot deal with the sensation. It is deep in my vagina but not on my clitoris. It is affecting my life so much. It comes and goes but sometimes will stay for as long as a week. The most I felt relief was five days and I was popping sleeping pills everyday and seeing a chiro three times a week.. Doctors keep telling me I am crazy and there is no way the procedure caused this. I have been to the ER five times and actually just came back today. All pain meds do not work, because this is a nerve issue. I do not know if my nerves are acting up and it is going to heal or if this my life from now on. And if it is I do not know how I am going to cope. I sometimes wake myself up from orgasming. I started seeing a Pelvic PT once a week which I feel I want to see her more than that because I was this gone and solved. She seems to think it is muscle related and I may have hypertonic pelvic floor due to the pain from my leep procedure since I experienced pain during the procedure when I was not supposed to. She thinks my muscles just locked up and it is clenching around nerves. Anyone else had this and then just have it go away? How long did it last? What helped? I am on gabapentin without relief. It makes me so loopy and disconnected and slow. But the sensation is still there. Please help. Has anyone heard or been to San Diego Sexual Medicine? Dr. Goldstein and his team including the neurosurgeon Dr. Choll Kim, urology fellow, NPs, physical therapists and sex therapists are very skilled and take a very systematic, multidisciplinary and compassionate approach in treating patients with PGAD and many other sexual disorder. They offer a free consultation triage call. Check it out ( Yes, I had a consult and he said I deff have Pgad without seeing me, learning my medical history, and looking at previous doctors info and test. Seems kind of like a money trap. I am going to run all my options dry and then I will see him. He said he can \u201cfix\u201d me but yet everything I read online says it is not curable or fixable. Hey everyone (: I just wanted to update and give a huge thank you for talking with me! So as it turns out, it was a strange case of bacterial vaginosis that was cause all of my nerves down there to go crazy. The only symptom I had was arousal and a need to orgasm. I am actually still having to take medications to try and solve that. So while it was not PGAD, it felt very very similar. I am so sorry for people who do experience this without an initial cause. Thanks again for all of the kind words and reaching out to me while I was trying to figure this out! Oh that is awesome, glad you got answers Hey. Could you please let me know what bacteria it was if possible? Was it needed a special test for it? Since I have had history with bacterias and I too have only arousal and peeing (but I pee a lot when stressed and since I keep on reading it got worse..). I have booked urologist and ginecologyst appointments but I cannot help myself not read until then \ud83d\ude00 I do not know the specific bacteria! But they did a few tests. They tested for yeast, UTI, and bacterial vaginosis. The only one who came back positive was bacterial vaginosis. I had to go on a few rounds of antibiotics for it to go away completely. I would suggest to not read anything online cause that caused me more stress and made my symptoms worse! Mine described to me that there are so many nerves down there and when too much bacteria becomes present it can cause all kinds of symptoms, such as arousal. I wish you luck and hope all is well for you!! Thank you very much for your answer! :)", "i think i may have pgad, help!! sorry if i do not go into enough detail.  as a minor it makes me super uncomfortable to talk about but i am really worried rn so here goes\n\ni am a 14 year old girl. \n3 days ago i was in my bed and i felt like touching myself so i did. when i finished, i tried going to bed but i kept having the feeling between my legs as if i was still touching myself, but i was just laying there in bed. it was kind of different tho, like a mix of that feeling and when u have to pee\n\nthe next day i had that feeling and it lasted the entire day, getting worse if i sat down for too long.  it felt better for like 10 minutes after i used the restroom so it could just be a weird bladder or urinary tract infection honestly.  i did touch myself that morning again\n\ntoday i still have that feeling all the same. this morning, though, soon after i woke up, i randomly started shaking and convulsing, similar to how i react to an orgasm but like it did not feel good.  i was terrified, i thought i was dying, and it lasted so long i thought i would never be able to get up out of bed.  it was probably just from fear but i felt very very nauseous the couple hours after that.  i had some trouble in school today because of this feeling, and i have lost a ton of sleep over it as well. it is gotten slightly better as the day went on\n\ndo you think i have pgad?  how should i tell my mom so that she can take me to the doctor, and how can i tell my doctor? will it ever stop?\n\npls be nice, im so scared :(\n\nthanks for reading", "scared i have pgad So i have a slightly hypertonic pelvic floor and ever since i learned how to \u201crelax\u201d it and do breathing exercises i feel aroused all the time and i do not know why. I am really scared that this feeling will never go away. Has anyone else experience pgad while going through PT? PT? i do believe they mean physical therapy. i unfortunately have PT as part of my care plan for my PGAD. my PGAD is a nerve/muscle hybrid so my pelvic floor is a part of my treatment focus. so yes in a way i have. my physical therapy takes the tension my pelvis is dumping into my hip flexors, abdomen, legs, and pours it back into my my main pelvic floor. (relaxed of course).\n\nso after it is done my nerve feeling is flared up for a while on therapy day and slowly resets back to normal then cycles back to tension that needs to be released. so yes if you have a high sensitivity to your pelvic nerves, physical therapy can perk up sensations/touch. i wouldnt be concerned too much unless it starts to intensify greatly. \n\nwork with your physical therapist as well let them know what is going on. there may be some extra pressure points they need to work on as well. make sure to do inner thigh exercises as that will help draw some of the extra tension out of your pelvis and slowly strengthen your pelvic floor as well (just dont go gung-ho overboard). I had a similar feeling after doing myofascial release of pelvic floor for vulvodynia. As the tension left and muscles felt more relaxed I felt more aroused.  In my case I had found that the vulvodynia was caused by the habit of actively tensing my muscles during masturbation - about 5% of women use this technique according to Kinsey\u2019s research.  Over many years this had caused my muscles to retain too much tension.  I had to retrain myself to the more usual technique and avoid all together if possible.  It was not much fun at the time, but I would not worry.  I think your reaction is quite a normal one to your muscles being changed.  Maybe your muscles are so used to being in a hypertonic state that they want to get back to their tense state. But that would not be good.  They will be better off relaxed.  I think your therapy will take time to work.", "I thought I was a freak, and living with a partner who does not have a sex drive. I (35F) thought I was a freak, a pervert, and a nympho. I thought my testosterone was too high for a female. I thought I had something wrong with me. I never knew that I had a disorder, I did not know others felt like me. I did not know there was a name for this. Now that I do? It has changed my world. To know that I am not alone? It is a huge sigh of relief.  \n    They say that it is rare, I do not think it is. I think that there are so many of us out there, feeling just as I did. How many doctors looked at you like you had a second head? Probably as many I have. Why is not this disorder more common? \n\n  When I have a full bladder, it is at its worst. Driving to work is a nightmare. I am constantly feeling like I am on the verge of an orgasm, only I am never able to get there. Masturbation, with orgasms does nothing. Sex can help, but my husband has absolutely no sex drive. We might have sex a few times a year. I did not even bother telling him about this. He did not care when he thought it was just a really high sex drive, why would he care now? If you are in a relationship with someone who does not know, care or want sex how do you deal with it? What do any of you do to deal with this? I know one of my medications makes it worse, but I can not stop taking it. I was also wondering if any numbing sprays, or lubes have helped? Any suggestions? Thank you for letting someone like me know, that I am not alone. &gt;  I did not know there was a name for this. Now that I do? It has changed my world. To know that I am not alone? It is a huge sigh of relief.\n\nFor now, relax and take more sighs of relief. Most of the anguish I went through could have gone so much better had I known I was not so alone. At least now there is some clarity in the road ahead. That is got to count for something.\n\n&gt; If you are in a relationship with someone who does not know, care or want sex how do you deal with it? What do any of you do to deal with this?\n\nMy first wife did not care, she thought I was a sex addict and wanted me to seek help. I tried, but never got any answers. That marriage, and a few other relationships, ended badly. My current wife (&amp; hopefully my last!) understands me completely and supports me every way she can. I got lucky with her, but it takes a lot of work and your partner has to be part of that work. It is all a matter of how much risk you are willing to tolerate moving ahead. Does the good outweigh the bad or is the bad enough for you to risk everything and start over? Thank you.  Our relationship is a mess. We have a lot more issues than just sex. I will not be leaving any time soon. I am tired of fighting this on my own, and we will have to figure a solution out. Go read my post about acupuncture I doubt you have PGAD. If your partner almost never has sex then of course you are sexually unsatisfied and always horny. Check out deadbedrooms. Do not let a disordered man make you feel abnormal for being a woman with a sex drive.", "Could this be pgad? Hello could this be pgad? For about a week and a half now. I have had this urgency to have an orgasm. At first I thought I was just really really turned on. But after about 3 orgasms the feeling did not go away. But I just ignored it. And the then about Thursday I had sex. And it was good but later that night I had the urge even more but now I had pelvic cramping and and I had the urge to keep peeing. Every time I would have an orgasm I would get this sharp little twinge or cramp in the middle of my pelvic area that hurt yet was a feeling of temporary relieve but then I would need to keep going back to back. This past 5 days I have probably had over 150 orgasms. And. It is getting to the point where I am starting to have a little bit of spotting. I am assuming that because when you orgasm your uterus contracts and I have gone overboard. The only reason I stop is I am exhausted. This has happened before. A few times. And lasted a couple days but never this severe. And I always thought it was just a high sex drive but I am not getting any relieve. Now I am just having pelvic pain and I am uncomfortable. I do not know if stress can cause this. But lately. I have been very depressed. And struggling with anxiety. I want to go to my dr but I feel really strange explaining this to him. \ud83d\ude30 It could be. For me I feel aroused physically but not mentally. It gets really intense at times. I find that playing with myself makes it worse and orgasms are almost painful. Riding in the car aggravates it as do vibrating toys. I went to a specialist gynocologist and she put me on a high dose of gabapentin which zonked me out. If you go to a doctor, go to a gynocologist, preferably a specialist. When it gets really intense, I do not touch myself at all and I lay down with an ice pack which helps calm it down. I also use distraction like talking on the phone or taking a walk. I had no idea what was happening to me until I googled my symptoms. Do not let anyone tell you it is in your head or that it has something to do with sex. You might have to doctor shop until you find one that is familiar with PGAD. Good luck!", "Do I have / am I developing PGAD??? I am a 17 year old female. And I have been masturbating for as long as I can remember, have been doing sexual acts since I was 14, and lost my virginity (and am still with the same boy) at 16. Overall, I would say I am a pretty sexual person. But recently I have been noticing a few instances (maybe 3 in the past few months) where I cannot get sexually satisfied. Although this happens more when I am solo. I had one night in particular where I was in bed and allotted myself some normal masturbation (simple clitoral, since whenever I try pleasuring myself vaginally I become frustrated and feel I need to pee, and I cannot orgasm that way) after I was done, however, I had the internal intense urge of \"I need deep vaginal stimulation\" (vaginal swelling, lubrication, and what I call phantom pleasure) but, as I stated before, the only one who can satisfy that is my boyfriend, but he was not with me. I tried to let it pass and to to sleep but it just would NOT go away!! I lost track of how many times I rapidly made myself orgasm clitorally, and even tried to stimulate internally to no avail. It ended up with me being stuck awake until 5 am crying and practically having a panic attack. Although flareups are few and far between, and nothing compared to the other stories I have seen, they are still miserable. And I can recall these happening way back when I was a super young child with no idea why I felt I needed to keep pleasuring myself. It is awful. What do you think this is? Is it a mild form of PGAD? Or something else? Hello, thank you for sharing.\nAs our community grows, Im hopeful you will find a strong support network.\nI wish I had more to say.  Best wishes. It definitely sounds like PGAD. Hang in there. Oh geez. Thank you haha. Super grateful it is a mostly rare occurence. But I still refrain from self pleasure out of fear another flareup will occur. Luckily that is the only thing know to cause it for me So more or less, when you masturbate it sets off an endless cycle of wanting more and more orgasm? Not every time, but some of the time, yes. Although after becoming sexually active I more or less stopped masturbating for my own enjoyment and relaxation like I used to. Nowadays I only ever really do it if  I manage to get the mood to or if my body randomly gets turned on (which is pretty rare, since now I have this very real possibility it could end up being horrible for me hours afterward)", " I have PGAD, would using a butt plug in tense times be more effective in place of masturbation? It is gotten very extreme. Today a friend invited me to her workplace and there were so many handsome men that I was struggling the whole time to keep my attention on anything, despite masturbating this very morning and spending two nights having sex with a guy! \\.\n\nMy question is, would using a buttplug be effective in moments of privacy where I feel at edge, instead of looking up porn and masturbating? Yeah anything that gets it down would work.", "Help Any little tips and tricks to make living with pgad a bit easier?\nPlus any particular numbing creams or medications that have dimmed arousal please anyone? I have found what works best for me is pelvic floor relaxation exercises (you can find a lot of those on YouTube) a heating pad, warm epsom salt baths, CBD tincture (water soluble preferred since your body absorbs it better. I like American Shaman) and avoiding highly acidic foods! \nI avoid medications at all costs because at the end of the day, it is not fixing the problem. Aspercream with Lidocaine worked ok for me, but apparently it is easy to overdose on that, you can only use it a couple times a day &amp; you have to avoid certain medications while using it. \n\nAlso practice meditation and lowering stress levels. When I am stressed or anxious, my PGAD is a million times worse. Thank u soo much how long would u recommend doing pelvic exercises for? I was in Pelvic PT for about 6 months and my therapist recommended doing them for about an hour per day. I started to notice results immediately, but as soon as I stopped doing them, my PGAD would return about 2 weeks later, so you might need to continue to do them if you want your symptoms to be less noticeable. Also, my PGAD is caused by pudendal neuralgia &amp; PGAD can have multiple causes, so try out the pelvic exercises &amp; if that does not work, I recommend going to see a Uro/Gynecologist to see what they would recommend for you! Are there any particular ones u you would recommend? This video has all of the exercises I do regularly to help with my PGAD! When my symptoms are really bad I try to do these stretches 2 times a day, then once my pelvic floor is loosened up a bit I do them once a day for maintenance. Also practicing proper kegel\u2019s (where you are not flexing your abdomen muscles AT ALL) helps to strengthen what needs to be strengthened, but I would start with pelvic floor relaxation stretches first! \n\n Your an actual life saver thank u soo much \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 Honestly I have realized mine has a lot to do with blood flow and pressure. When I am sitting for long periods of time, the blood \u201cpools\u201d there, cause swelling and arousal. Just getting up and walking around when I feel it start to happen has helped a lot!\nI have also noticed that when my bladder is full it pushes on that area and causes more stimulation. 99% of the time simply using the bathroom gets rid of the pressure and I am good to go!\nI hope some of this is helpful to you!

I had an absolutely nightmarish experience with pgad (including feeling suicidal) in October-December 2019 and it went away completely after a psychiatrist put me on paroxetine (I never have taken antidepressants before). I know that SSRI discontinuation can trigger it, but in my case this worked the other way around. So even tho paroxetine was shitty for you, after discontinuing it helped the PGAD symptoms? I had never taken it before pgad, the doctor started me on paroxetine when I showed up with symptoms. And it helped both pgad, but also my general quality of life. I recently stopped taking Paxil. Maybe that is why I am experiencing these symptoms. I could not handle Paxil because it made me have horrible tremors and did not help my depression.", "Cannot do anything today Having a very bad flair up, cannot even move without being pushed over the edge several times over, I need a holiday So sorry :(( I know what you mean about moving, any form of movement can suck the vast majority of the time :/ I know the feeling, DM me, I want to talk more to someone with the same condition Lying scum I feel ya", "I need someone to talk to I am a young female, I turned eighteen yesterday. I think it is time I address my issue, but I need to speak to someone who knows they have it to make sure I have it. Hi! I am a girl &amp; I have had it for years (although it is better now) and am 20. It can be very very uncomfortable, so I am sorry for you if you do have it. It started when I was 12, it started, I believe as a weird reaction to antidepressants, I also have OCD. What it feels like for me is basically I physically crave sexual stimulation essentially 24/7 &amp; am not satisfied if I relieve it through masturbation but there are no sexual thoughts/fantasies/mental arousal associated with it. None.  It improved for me with exercise. I do not remember when it started, but I have been masturbating and orgasming since I was nine years old. I started puberty pretty early, and now at 18 I have a feeling of arousal almost all the time even when I am not thinking about it. Just yesterday, for example, I had three orgasms and still has a feeling of needing more but I did not think it would help so I just went for a run and then took a cold shower. Afterward I dried off and sat down, and it had gotten worse! So I had another four and felt better for half an hour and then was ready for more again. It is getting frustrating. Hey there feel free to chat anytime. Does it sometimes come back from time to time?\nMine has been constant since I began taking wellbutrin Mine is mostly better now, so there is hope! :) Although I have stopped taking the medication that caused it for me. If wellbutrin is the reason you have it, I would reccomend talking to your doctor about it &amp; maybe reducing the dose or coming off of it all together. I was embarrassed about it so I hid it for years, but there is no need for you to feel embarrassed, it is just like any other medical condition. I feel your pain. This sucks &amp; the experience can be quite exhausting &amp; isolating. Just remember you are not alone in this, I am here for you. :) If you are not/have never been on any meds (because they can trigger this) I would still reccomend talking to your doctor about it. It can come from many different varied causes, like tarlov cysts etc. Your doctor may not have heard of it but it is also possible they will be able to help with a diagnosis &amp; either way they could help refer you to someone who could help. All the best, P Hey I sent a pm. Do you mind if we chat?", "surgical solution !!!!!!! I know this  is going to sound extreme but will surgically removing the Clitoris fix this problem!!!! I have thought about it and I am really consider it since the only option I have !!!!! It will not.  Pgad does not seem to come from the clitoris. There are guys posting here with the same disease, and they do not have such equipment.\n\nYou need to be careful. \n\nDepending on where you live, and how religious a culture you have, doctors will be all too eager to encourage you to try this clitoris amputation as a first option. They do not have your best interests in mind. I would cut anything off just so the pain go away !!!!!! Im going crazy I do not even want a vagina anymore I cannot function like a normal person!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Still, cutting things off is probably not the solution, since people with amputated legs still get RLS on their missing limbs. But the problem started down there my brain did not cause this I did  cause it to my self unfortunately!!!!!! So what is the solution in your opinion?? With nerve disorders, where you feel the pain is not necessarily where the problem is. \n\nYou are hurting a lot, and it is hell. You are desperate and willing to try anything.\n\nIf you wake up from surgery without a clitoris, and still have PGAD--you will be in a worse hell. I did an mri for the brain the doctor said everything was normal so there no nerve damage in the Brain the damage is downstairs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Did the doctor suggest amputation? Did the doctor suggest amputation? My opinion is worthless.\n\nBut I would not accept amputation as an option until multiple doctors, with experience in PGAD, looked over every centimeter of your spine, tailbone area, and pelvic floor. \n\nYou deserve at least that much care and consideration before a life-altering surgery. No my brain suggested that!!!!!!!!!! Problem is doctors  here do not know shit about pgad all they think your just horny !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If the doctors do not know anything about PGAD, the surgeons will not know anything either. You will just be getting a cosmetic amputation without any special consideration for your disease.\n\nIt is not going to work. Please do not do anything drastic till you get help from a doctor who does know about PGAD. Seems impossible to believe!!!I will see that doctor in my dreams probably!!!come on be realistic you know there is no cure to this nightmare !!!i know I will probably suffer until I die or kill my self one day!!!!!! I am being realistic. A lot of information about this disease is slowly percolating out into the world. Things are just getting started. It is definitely not hopeless already, it is unrealistic to say that before any major efforts have been made to find the causes of this disease.\n\nIn the meantime, please keep seeking help for your chronic pain. Please do everything you can to manage the symptoms and hang in there. The cause is known it is masturbation for sure and do not tell me it has absolutely nothing to do with it!!!!!the pgad symptoms hit me after it !!!!!!!!!!!!that is what destroyed me !!!!!!!i was absolutely normal and healthy before the stupid thing that I did!!!!!! It is definitely not masturbation. Out of all the people who masturbate in the world, why do only a few people get this disease?\n\nIs it possible that guilt from this first sexual experience is coloring and biasing your thoughts about PGAD? I guess I am not that lucky maybe I am cursed!!!!!!!!!!!!!its the first time and this happened !!!I am absolutely guilty about it  I wish I died that day !!!is it is really in my head why do I feel the pain all the time even if I am not thinking about it!!!!!! It is not in your head, the pain is definitely real. \n\nBut it is not good to think of this physical disease as a curse that resulted from masturbating. Because then you might start thinking of irrational things, like cutting your own clitoris off.  That idea comes from your guilt over touching it, and it is not rooted in any medical knowledge at all.\n\nYou are already suffering enough. You do not need to punish yourself with voluntary genital mutilation. \n\nWhy do you feel so guilty? Who is condemning you and cursing you? Because I come from a religious background  and it is considered a sin and I feel god is punishing me for that sin Idk what causes your symptoms but my PGAD is caused by Pudendal Neuralgia.  I was seen by at least six doctors, had blood work done at least five times, had a cystoscopy, and several pelvic exams. The thing is, because doctors are not educated on this symptom, they will typically just think it is imaginary, but it is in fact a SYMPTOM with an underlying cause, much like a sore throat is a symptom of a cold. \n\nWhat I found best to work for me, was to be extremely proactive and demanding about telling my doctors what kind of care I needed in order to have these symptoms go away. If you have good insurance, you should go to your Gynecologist and explain your symptoms, and if they say they do not know what could be the cause, ask them to refer you to someone who may have more information. \n\nThrough my personal research, these are the possible causes of PGAD, there may be more but these seem to come up as being more common causes:\n\n- Tarlov Cyst found to be cause in 66% of those experiencing PGAD \n\n- Pundendal neuralgia: long-term pelvic pain that originates from damage or irritation of the pudendal nerve \u2013 a main nerve in the pelvis. The pudendal nerve supplies areas including the: lower buttocks. area between the buttocks and genitals (perineum)\n\n- Restless Leg Syndrome \n\n- Hypertonic Pelvic Floor: occurs when the muscles in the pelvic floor become too tense and are unable to relax. Many people with a tense and non-relaxing pelvic floor experience pelvic health concerns such as constipation, painful sex, urgency and pelvic pain.\n\n- Vaginismus: Term used to describe the condition where the pelvic floor muscles spasm involuntarily with the threat of vaginal penetration which can prevent sexual intercourse, insertion of tampons and gynaecological examination. Sexual problems that result from overactive pelvic floor muscles can cause considerable emotional difficulty with stress, anxiety and relationship difficulties.\n\n- Interstitial Cystitis: A chronic bladder issue that causes urinary tract infection symptoms. Aside from pelvis pain, people with bladder disorders like interstitial cystitis (also called bladder pain syndrome) may also experience bladder pain that gets worse when the bladder fills, lower back and abdomen pain, frequent urination and a constant urge to urinate.\n\nI ended up getting my diagnosis from a Urogynecologist who was referred to me from my regular gynecologist, who surprisingly had heard of PGAD before and almost immediately knew what was causing my symptoms. Get to your gyno ASAP, tell them this is effecting your every aspect of your life, and your mental health, and you need to be seen by someone who can give you answers. \n\nIn the mean time, some things that helped me was laying on a heating pad positioned on my coccyx, drinking ginger and turmeric tea, hot bath\u2019s, when going to sleep laying on my side with knees bent (kind of in the fetal position, but with my torso facing upwards). If you have any muscle relaxers that you are prescribed, that may help also. I was taking 10mg of Baclofen 1-3x daily. Also try to do yoga. Happy baby pose and any other pelvic loosening stretches may help. \n\nBelieve me, I have been where you are at, I told several doctors i was ok never having another orgasm for the rest of my life if this feeling would just go away. But it can get better if you find the right doctor to talk to. Keep strong my friend, it will get better if you put in the effort to take control \u2764\ufe0f \u0647\u0647\u0647\u0647\u0647\u0647\u0647\u0647\u0647", "Can the pgad go away!!!!!!!

Mine seems to ease when distracted!  Yes me too, when I try not to think about it. It reduces a lot almost to the point where it is gone. It makes me wonder if my brain is causing this tbh. I do not think that you can will your PGAD to onset, but it does get worse the more you focus on it. Just like a panic attack, you could just have a sore in your chest or heavier breathing and the more you focus on it the more worried you get and all the sudden anxiety has turned into a full blown panic attack. Distractions always help. Getting up moving around while distracting yourself is best.

Talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to a specialist. It is not your psyche, it is a physical issue. I go into remission, I am in one now. I do not know if it would help a man, but ice packs really help me. Your instinct to distract yourself is good. Sometimes it does not work for me and I use techniques to deal with the anxiety I get from it. Check out EFT or tapping on YouTube. I thought it was crazy at first, but it really helps. Good luck, please tell your doctor.", "Hi I am 30 closeted trans women and for the past 6 months I think I have PGAD. I am not very sure that I have it because the description of this describes constant arousal which I do not actually have but my symptoms also sound like I have it. So here is basically what happened 6 months ago shortly before the quarantine hit in my area I was just simply doing dishes I felt an odd feeling kind of like I had to go pee so I ran to the bathroom and just before urine came semen a lot of semen it weirded me out and kind of terrified me and at the same time as I was flaccid when I urinated and orgasmed at the same time by then got an erection. \n\nIt was weird and disturbing and kind of traumatizing for a trans woman but I moved on then about 5 hours later I am making food and I double over and orgasm. again I am flaccid when it happens and after it happens I get an erection there was no warning just kind of weird feeling at the bottom of my genitals. It happens again a third time that day but a lot less came out. And from then on once a week I have a spontaneous sudden crippling orgasm it does not actually hurt unless I hold it in. And now I am noticing instead of once a week it is now every 5 days and I have also noticed there is a building feeling of arousal but no erection.\n\nI am really kind of worried about this and because of covid-19 I do not have the resources to go to the doctor or in this case a urologist to find out what the heck is going on and the only thing that I can find on the internet about spontaneous orgasms is PGAD. Please be kind this is very hard for someone like me to talk about and this is starting to really mess with me mentally. \n\nThanks for reading I hope some advice can help me. As a person with a penis I know what you are going through.  I definitely think you have PGAD.  I experience a lot of throbbing and contracting in my PC muscles, as well as prolonged erections.  I have to manage it through masturbating a lot.  I typically have between 5 and 7 orgasms a day.  I have been going through this for about 2 years now.  If you have any questions please feel free to PM me.  I know this can be a really scary and nervous time. Thank you for responding. It does not happen for me anywhere near as often as you describe however I am wondering when you say throbbing and Contracting of your PC muscles what do you mean by PC muscles. Also since you have been going through this for 2 years did it start the same way for you as it did with me and got more frequent until your constantly either masturbating or orgasming? This is really disconcerting and frustrating. For the PC muscles, I mean the area around my prostate that contract during orgasm.  It started with prolonged erections, and leaking a lot of precum, and feeling on a constant edge of orgasm.  None of which were charged by anything sexual, it would start right when I woke up and would not stop unless I orgasmed.  The contractions get extremely distracting, and it leads to a lot of precum.  So, I masturbate first thing in the morning, 3-5 times after work, and once before bed.  It is either that or experience nonstop contracting and feeling on the edge of orgasm.  It has gotten to the point where my wife reminds me to do it before we leave the house so I do not have issues in public.  There are drugs you can take, but most are of the anti-depressant type, which does not mesh well with my job.", "Antidepressants? My pgad was triggered by a period of high anxiety.has any women here had luck with antidepressants as I am thinking of giving them a go. My pgad is also triggered by anxiety and antidepressants have been very helpful for me! I got PGAD from coming off SSRI's so taking them has really had a very negative impact on my life and relationships. I have had really bad anxiety in the past and it is really shit...but not as bad as PGAD. I would say avoid all drugs. There are so many ways to treat anxiety that can help instead. CBT, exercise, talking therapys, CBD, lifestyle changes. It is so easy to say but worth trying first. But if you are PGAD existed before anti-depressantsmaybe it will do the opposite and cure you!?", "Any trans people or detransitioners develop PGAD from hormone replacement therapy? I am an FtMtF detransitioner and when I went on testosterone, I developed PGAD. My clitoris was constantly aroused and it always felt like that moment like you are at the peak and right about to orgasm. Plus lots of pressure/tight feelings and pins and needles. I felt like that 24/7 and got no relief from it. It was the worst time of my life and I became suicidal. Thankfully it went away when I stopped HRT.\n\nI am curious if any trans men, non-binary people, detrans women, or anyone else who went on testosterone HRT developed PGAD from it? Just an idea, but serotonin plays a big role throughout the nervous system and for many with PGAD. Testosterone and estrogen both have an influence on serotonin levels, so it is possible that the shift in hormones could be responsible. Yes! I think I have always had PGAD to some extent, but now that I am on T it is sooo much more noticable. Yes, I am currently going through this. And actually ended up at the doctor this afternoon bc the feeling was unbearable.  It began about a month and a half ago, at that time I had upped my T to the max dose I could go - to 10 mg. I also finished weaning off of Effexor 4 days before this feeling started, and its the same thing you described - constantly feeling aroused in my clit and inside my vagina where my g spot is. Constant throbbing, buzzing. It is swollen. The feeling like I have been stimulated to almost orgasm and that feeling will not go away. And same as you, it makes me feel suicidal. And terrified that it is never going to stop. I was sexually abused as a child and this feeling is exactly how I felt after those times - this terrible feeling of arousal that will not go away. \n\nI stopped taking my T bc of it. My last injection was almost a month ago, and this feeling went away for a few weeks, but it started happening again late last week and has been ramping up again. Today has been by far the worst. Ibuprofen usually helps some, but i took 800 mg and it did nothing. I broke down and went in. \n\nIt is so frustrating bc I do not understand what is causing it and I feel like the T should be out of my system by now but I dont know how long it can still affect your body after stopping. \n\n I had my first appointments with a urologist and a pelvic physiologist last week. Today they referred me to a pain management clinic to find out if this is being caused by my pudendal nerve. \n\nThey also said that going off my Effexor may have had something to do with it bc Effexor affects the nerves.  \n\nI am so afraid this feeling will not stop. I am afraid I will kill myself if it does not.  I am so sorry you experience it too. How long after you stopped taking your HRT did the symptoms stop? Is there anything that helped in the meantime? How do you deal with it? It is unbearable for me \ud83d\udc94 Dammit sorry you have to go through that :( It depends on the testosterone and administration (injections, gel, pills, etc.) how long it takes to leave the system. I was on .5ml testosterone cypionate every 2 weeks, and it took a little over three months for my levels to return to normal. My testosterone was around 400-500 (cannot remember exact number) and last time I got my testosterone tested it was at 28 after a few months without injecting it. Testosterone cypionate in particular has a half life of 16 days. I have heard gel stays in the system far shorter, but I am not sure about length.\n\nAlso sorry if this is a personal question, but are you currently menstruating? Testosterone become highest before the period starts, so that could fuel your PGAD if it went away and suddenly came back. Took until my testosterone levels were back to normal (about 3 months) for it to the PGAD to stop. But after the 1-2 month mark is when the PGAD began getting noticably mild. But it depends on what dose you are on. I was on testosterone cypionate injections, .5ml, every 2 weeks. Testosterone cypionate has a half life of 16 days. I was on .4ml Testosterone Cypionate injections once a week. I had accelerated to that dose pretty rapidly and was on .4ml for approximately a month before the PGAD began. \n\nCoinciding with this upped dose, 4 days before I had a first real flare up, I had taken my last dose of Effexor, Which I had been weaning off of for the last two years. I was on it for a total of 4 years. \n\nI have seen several reports of PGAD developing after an anti-depressant was stopped. When I googled Effexor to read up, I was surprised to see it listed as an anti-depressant and a nerve pain medication. I had no idea it was a nerve-related medication. \n\nMaybe it was the perfect storm - upping to high dose of T while coming off of the Effexor. *sigh* No longer menstruating.  I have endometriosis (which I am also reading can cause PGAD) so Ive been using some form of birth control - first had an IUD placed in 2017, removed in 2019 due to constant cramping and spotting. I then began Lupron injections in 2019, I get them every 3 months. Interestingly, I had my injection on 8/13 and noticed the symptoms were back on 8/16. I have not had an actual period since 2017. I just masturbate like.. a ton \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af not that it helps. \nI have a very laid-back mindset regarding sexuality so apart from the sensation being distracting and sometimes painful I do not experience any mental anguish I guess... I am sorry I do not have any actual advice.", "Terrified I am 20F and have never had issues with this before but am absolutely terrified this will never go away. Last Friday I had surgery and the night before started experiencing intense tingling and throbbing in my clitoris. Granted I removed some build up from under the hood which may have irritated the area. Following surgery Friday these sensations came back and were almost unbearable Friday and Saturday. Yesterday and today the stinging and tingling and itching has been going away slowly and is not as intense, but it is still bothersome. I am hoping it will get better every day and this might just be due to anxiety, hormones, irritation, increased blood flow in the area and my period. Is this how it started for anyone else?", "Pgad emotional advice please Hello guys. Im a female and I have pgad. I am only 19 but Ive realized that I can never be with anyone romantically. Im a virgin but even the thought of sex can cause massive anxiety and offset my symptoms. The thought that Im going to be alone forever haunts me so much.

Have you posted this on the PGAD Facebook group? There is a cure. If it is spine related then you can see dr Goldstein who can treat you and some people get cured there too. I know it is a pain in the ass to get to San Diego but it is possible. Everyone is different. PGAD symptoms are different for every single person. I took the time to take the survey because I think it is very important for this topic to be researched more thoroughly so that others do not suffer in silence. My PGAD for  instance is caused by \u201c painful syndrome\u201d and pudendal neuralgia, which does not have to do with my spine at all. Yes I know that not all pgad is caused by spine,\nBut for the cases that are caused by spine or Tarlov cysts than there is hope after surgery.  But yeah not all cases have good treatment methods since the cause is different for everyone, but some cases can be treated if there related to spine usually. Some people\u2019s pgad can be treated as well if it is psychosomatic response. Also pgad treatment usually focuses on managing symptoms and the Internet says there is no cure. But there have been people that have been cured, so I believe that so called \u201cfact\u201d is false. Also of more people participate in studies like these, it can help encourage more doctors to educate themselves about PGAD which can help a lot of people find what treatment works best for them, which does not always include surgery which also has the potential to fail.", "Do i have PGAD?

At my job I sit on a saddle chair leaning forward for many hours a day, so I am wondering if this is PGAD or I have just severely irritated my clit (hoping this is the case) my anxiety about this is making it unbearable as it is all i can think about.

I want to try Prozac but some people say it caused an out brake to their symptoms!!!i might try xanax or lyrica some says it helped them Do you think that your pgad may be psychosomatic, since antidepressants helped so much. I mean I gave anxiety management without antidepressants a try and mine goes away for most of the day if not the whole day. I was always pretty afraid of antidepressants since this disorder unfortunately gets affected very much from antidepressants. Good or bad. Idk my advice is be cautious before starting new meds.

It is like a stone in my heart, which I have all my life. All I managed is to start writing to people here. \n\nBut I definitely cannot. There is no bigger secret than this addiction. You realize PGAD is not an \u201caddiction\u201d right? It is a neurological issue. Nothing to do with desire. Is not it kind of? I cannot stop it or really hardly. Same with an addiction. Oh I have to add also that indeed it has nothing to do with desire. It is more the need to stop a tension. \nIt is an addiction too as much as it has many other reasons behind as you said neurological (for example lack of serotonin and too much dopamine).\n\nDefinition of an addiction:  pgad is alot closer to an OCD than an addiction. the mental focus on something like pgad can be an ocd factor because it is something highly disruptive and hard to deny your mind paying attention to it. which the focus increases stress. which increases PGAD symptoms. which leads to more focus.\n\naddiction is used for a habit or substance that you can quit but choose not to for various reasons. you cant willingly force yourself to quit PGAD so it cannot be an addiction.\n\ndoesnt mean it is an OCD. just that PGAD can trigger OCD. I am forcing myself atm. It is hard but with God's help, magic seems to happen.\n\nAnd yes I called it \"OCD-behaviour\" too and still think it is pretty connected.

First i must ask why you desire this outcome? Unless i truely hate soeone i would never wish this on anyone.

That is why this particular pain disorder is so hard to treat, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough this pain disorder is a lot of chuckles to those without it NO ONE should ever desire it as an outcome. It is pure misery. It is pure discomfort. This pain condition is not anything to laugh at as it takes a thing that should be pleasure and fun thus turning it into a pain nightmare. Often people with this issue tend to avoid sex as it has become misery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can get PGAD from nerve disorders, muscle disorders, spine anomalies, tarlov cysts, falling damage to the pelvis, falling damage to the spine, nerve and muscle miscommunications, and various other random things.

The wording of the post was a bit weirdly put together. \n\nYeah there are tons of ways to get this disorder. In general they all involve some kind of miscommunication that prevents the groin from sending proper signals. Each case of this disorder is different making Pgad one of the hardest disorders to treat sadly.\n\nThe best way to start treatment for is to visit a urologist that is open the the idea of Pgad just in case it the main case for your discomfort. The reason for the urologist is because they can run tests and maybe find that it is not pgad but some easier to treat problem.\n\nPgad for my case is caused by a nerve+muscle miscommunication. my nerves pulse and send pain that causes my muscles to move and churn. this causes a feedback into the nerve causing more nerve pain. This goes back and forth endlessly if left to itself. So my treatment plan focuses on controlling the muscle side.

Like SIGNIFICANTLY less. Then literally the day I returned to where I normally live, I noticed both my PGAD (and my allergies) get a LOT worse. My PGAD was so extreme that it was concerning and even having an orgasm was actually almost painful (I HAD to immediately masturbate it out...not that it got rid of it) and my allergies were also worse with my nose plugged up and swollen. This made me wonder if PGAD can be part of an allergic reaction to something or at least an environmental reaction, or a response to inflammation (or a type of inflammation). \" PGAD can be part of an allergic reaction to something or at least an environmental reaction, or a response to inflammation (or a type of inflammation).\"\n\nThis is a really interesting idea, a bit jaw-dropping for me. \n\nLet me tell you my story:\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am pro-vaxx, spreading scary stories is not my intention.\n\nI was vaccinated with Pfizer back in May/June. I got pretty severe neurological side effects, like feeling numb pins and needles and really strange sensations multiple parts of my body. I saw 3 neurologists and none of them saw anything concerning, one of them said it is an inflammatory reaction to the vaccine but most likely harmless. The symptoms are lingering, sometimes they are gone but they can come back from time to time (when I am stressed or I am on my period). My PGAD came as a part of this (I guess it is some kind of neuropathy too). I even had a lumber spine MRI to know it is not a herniated disc or a Tarlov cyst, and yes, it was all clear.\n\nI had a really short episode of PGAD 5 years ago, but it went away easily and only came back with my other vaccine side effect symptoms - I think I am prone to have symptoms like this, and I have anxiety too.\n\nSo yes, your idea about inflammation seems to be somethin worth considering. Well in all honesty PGAD is literally inflammation of the nerves Yes, I think it could be related to inflammation and even histamine, but for me, it is also related to stress and anxiety (is it possible that travelling and being with your parents made you less stressed and anxious for a while?). It could also be food-related. I always eat better and less inflammatory food when I am at my parents' house. It def made me less stressed so yeah maybe ALL the time! If I am with friends or on vacation, it is like it switches off. Needless to say, I go on a lot of vacations.

I do not do anything to provoke it or masturbate. It just happens randomly. \n\nIf you are a male with this, you have probably read stories of possible pinched nerves in the lower back or seen women doing pelvic floor stretches. The pinched nerve scenario is likely but men do not have the same pelvic issues as women and the stretching is not the same for men. \n\nI constantly feel a \u201cpulse\u201d or throbbing that has a rhythm to it.

I have always had anxiety but it is been more severe and persistent lately than ever before. 6 nights ago I was trying to fall asleep and suddenly felt really turned on for no reason. I tried masturbating and then had one of the worst anxiety attacks i have ever had and was literally up shaking in bed the entire night and into the next day. Ever since this night I keep feeling aroused all day and night for no reason and no matter what I do. The feeling is strange too because it is almost like a tingly feeling in my bladder area and lower back and sensitivity. I have noticed that i have been tensing my shoulders up unconsciously from the anxiety and I wondered if potentially i am tensing something in my lower back that could be causing these sensations? It is really embarrassing obviously so I have not told anyone about what i am experiencing but now almost a week in i am getting really scared this is not going to go away. What kinds of things can I do to get rid of this? I have had this on and off my whole life when I have really bad anxiety and did not realize what it was until recently. The best thing to do is try and distract yourself when it flares up. i have the same thing and the doctor today said it might be anxiety related since i also had a very stressed out month and struggle with anxiety. ive had these symptoms for about 4 days and he prescribed me some anxiety medication and said that was going to stop the pgad.he said the medication will take 5 days before it starts helping me ill keep u updated. i also asked him if he had any tips to help the flares and the only thing he came up with was cold showers (u can try it out but it did not work for me). what i do when it really gets difficult is i start lifting weights in my room and i feel a bit better. Many times, your anxiety shows in your body. Visually Think of biting a lemon. Your mouth waters a little bit right? Similarly, when our body is experiencing odd sensations that we are not used to, it can react in many ways. It is a common saying that people store their emotions in their \u2018hips,\u2019 which is also why PGAD is a pelvic floor dysfunction. Anxiety can manifest itself by tensed muscles, specifically in the pelvic floor. I urge you to try breathing techniques and pelvic floor contractions so you are aware of how tight your pelvic floor really is. Always be wary of this, because oftentimes prolonged tense muscles can ultimately fit in the \u2018irreversible\u2019 sense. You are strong, and keep fighting. I know you will get through this. Message me if you need someone to talk to \u2665\ufe0f My PGAD symptoms always get worse with anxiety. It is really hard to make it go away when such a big flare-up happens.

There is someone in my life that have similar condition and I understand the stress, pain, and overwhelm. Just letting you know that I understand what you are going through and how strong you are. It will get better and try to think things that will relax u, like someone you love, you favorite TV shows or do something that will distract you. Everything will be fine, u will feel normal and u are loved. :) Heating pad, hot bath, CBD, and pelvic floor exercises like these \n\n\n\nDistraction techniques. Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor, and try your best to manage stress levels which may be making your symptoms worse Try working out! My PGAD gets awful when I spend WEEKS not going to the gym.", "One frustrating week I did not even know about this condition until I researched it out of frustration. This is the second time I have had this constant feeling of physical arousal, but with no sexual arousal and being unable to find relief. I gave myself a bruise on my pelvis the other day, just trying to make it stop!\n\nLast weekend, there was an event that stressed me out, and when it was all over, I was pretty burnt out. I think by Monday, my clitoris started feeling sensitive and engorged, but I was not aroused. I went grocery shopping and being an introvert with ADHD, sociability requires a little extra energy and causes a low level of anxiety. It got even worse and all I wanted was to go home. I am not currently working, but I am trying to write and this is killing my focus. I have been cloistered at home for most of the week mainly because going out and running errands makes it worse.\n\nThe last time this happened was around last year when I was in university and getting overwhelmed by my finals. Eventually it just went away but it lasted about a week.\n\nI have called my doctor and have an appointment next week, but I worry that she will not know what to do about this. Does anyone have any suggestions for things that could get my clitoris to calm tf down and give me a break in the meantime? ADHD only makes it worse because I am so distracted by stimuli. Rather than be irritated with the distraction, and seeing as you are a writer, can you channel this pent up frustration into your writing? When it gets bad for me, I go full obsessive compulsive with my urges and just say fuck it and get the obsession out of my system. It does not work, it really never does, but it helps me to reframe the distraction into some source of motivation if that makes sense I was able to get through it earlier this week, but today I cannot seem to work around it. \ud83d\ude29 I know this feeling too well, it is irritating at best and I found out yesterday can  be life threatening (I made the mistake of masturbating while driving). Just keep yourself safe and try a cold compress or ice pack Thanks, I will see if cold helps! Also, if it is legal, see if you can get a hold of cannabis infused message oil. It might make a difference CBD oil! This has been happening to me from a young age. I have never talked to a doctor about it even though I probably should. It typically comes and goes and it definitely comes with stress. Masturbation ALWAYS makes it worse. I get sometimes a couple of hours relief but most times it comes back stronger. Containing myself from masturbation helps. Honestly, a couple of glasses of wine helps me too. Marijuana helps it completely go away but I recently quit smoking all together and it is no longer an option. I have heard some antidepressants help but I do not want to take any and still have not worked up the courage to talk to my doctor. I have read that this can get much more intense during menopause. Even though I am far from menopause this has been happening to me since I was about 7 years old and has only gotten worse. I am terrified. Good luck. Cannabis has the opposite affect with me.  It causes me to relax and makes my body much more sensitive to any feelings that might be building.  Physical exercise, getting out for a walk helps tremendously as does being around people and engaging socially in person with others. I talked to my mom about it and she said she is experienced the same thing off and on. Edible cannabis is an option too! But only if you can take some time to kick back and enjoy it. I am already on antidepressants which have been working for me for awhile, so I do not want to risk changing them for an occasional problem. I think that if I at least know that it is triggered by major anxiety episodes, I can find ways to cope. \n\nI think it is finally starting to calm down this weekend. I do not know if it is run it is course, or if it has anything to do with my partner being home with me all day while he is off work, but either way, this flare up seems to be coming to an end.\n\nDo you have a male or female doctor? Maybe talking to another woman about it will make it easier. I am going to talk to my doctor next week and maybe see about getting an anti-anxiety medication to take in emergencies. I am glad your episode has run it is course. Mine just passed Monday but I had an awful time Thursday- Monday afternoon. I am not sure what helped me either. I think it just ran its course for me. I am nervous because this was the first time it lasted so long. When I was younger it would only happen for a few hours and I thought it was something that just happens. As I got older and it continued to happen and for longer I started to realize it is not normal. Just last weekend when it had been two days I started googling and then found this group. I am glad to know I am not alone but I am still too nervous to talk to anyone about it, I do not know why. I actually saw my doctor Thursday and wanted to say something ( she is a female ) however I could not work up the courage. I have not even told my husband. I sat and cried for days last flare up and I think he just think I am depressed. It is getting hard for me to deal and I am scared this will continue and persist especially since I quit smoking marijuana and my crutch is completely gone. I do have a bladder condition I was recently diagnosed with and was told that I was born with it. I am wondering if it has anything to do with this. From what I have read the cause of these symptoms could be many things. I see my urologist (also female) next week and I am trying to work up the courage to tell her about it. Wish me luck. You can do it! It is their job to know how the body works and you can be sure they have seen and heard way worse than errant clitori that seem to have a mind of their own. \ud83d\ude09 Just checking in on how things went. Did the cold compress work? It helped a little. The episode ended on Saturday, so I am free... for now. Good, hopefully things get much better from here I think I will keep some CBD and/or edibles on hand the next time my anxiety gets too high and hopefully that will keep my PGAD from flaring up. Good idea. Try taking a half dose before bed, it might make a difference the next day What dose do you take?", "Unsure what to do I seriously do not know what to do if I actually have this disorder. It started about a week ago and is really strange, also I am about to go into some weird detail. Basically last week on Monday I had some very painful trapped gas. Before that though I had tried to masturbate (I had not in a while) and remember not being able to finish or feeling anything. After the gas situation passed I went about my day just like normal. Fast forward two days I think I started having PGAD symptoms. I would wake up, go to class, feel like I had to orgasm so badly but it eventually passed after an hour or so since I would be distracted. One day I came home and noticed I could not successfully finish and it kind of felt like I was burning myself down there. So that happened for about 3 days, which I also had my period. Anyways last night I was with my boyfriend and he accidentally woke me up around 5 am and I noticed I was super aroused down there for no reason. I ended up leaving the room to try and finish or do something, but nothing helped and I ended up making him leave. I spent the whole day basically feeling aroused and the feeling never went away. I tried stretching, ice, limiting touching myself but it never went away.  I just woke up super early and it basically feels like I am super aroused again and also is burning?? I seriously do not know you are I am supposed to live like this, and am super scared. It also is scary Bc I feel like he triggered it but I do not want to not see him :( I would always consider going to your doctor first, it might be hella embarrassing (anyone here who has it can tell you including me) but ultimately that is your best place to go, I know it is not easy to not worry about it so if you need somone to talk to I and others are here so do not hesitate to reach out Thank you! I probably will \ud83d\ude2a Dms are always open \ud83d\ude0a", "any home remedies? does anyone know any other ways to help numb down there other than ice ? No numbing but yoga for pelvic floor seems to help me Yoga, whole body stretches, massaging my foot, and putting ice on OTHER parts of my body (specially legs) greatly reduce it.", "Pgad worsened from meds. Hey everyone I am 17 yr old male, and I believe my symptoms got worse after being on and off of Prozac. My question is what is there to do about this disorder if meds are involved. Like is pgad going to be horrible forever from now on because of the meds? You may have to try other SSRIs, I do not think Prozac is particularly good for PGAD in what I have read. For most of these medications there are some people who respond better to them than others, so if it is not working for you, try a different medication before you give up. I gave up Prozac and the feeling is now permanently there. I do not want to risk any other ssri\u2019s. I have heard like almost all ssri\u2019s trigger pgad. Only one I can think of is maybe Paroxetine. I just do not know how to get better from now on. Did you stop it cold turkey? Dropping an SSRI can lead to serotonin withdrawals that can cause PGAD to flare. I mean my pgad was flaring before I stopped it. I think my problem is as that I switched from the 40mg to 20mg. I stopped the 40mg because of a buzzing sensation. And once I stopped it, it went away. So then I decided to try the 20 mg instead, and now I feel worse impending orgasm feeling. Should this happen? I have been on Zoloft for years and had a few flares after extreme stress, but I tried to wean off earlier this year and my whole nervous system went haywire, including my PGAD. Zoloft is one of the hardest to get off though, I do not think Prozac is as bad with withdrawals.\n\nSerotonin plays a large role not only in mood but throughout our nervous system. Without the protection from serotonin re-uptake that my medicine provided, I had nerve pain throughout my body like the symptoms of fibromyalgia.\n\nThere may be other factors in why it is flaring up than just the medication. What you really need is to talk to a doctor. I do not know if you have talked to your doctor about PGAD but now would be the time. If you are worried about being dismissed, print out some research on it to bring to your appointment and be sure to focus more on the nervous system aspects, like the \"buzzing\" and how the medication affected it. Maybe, if nothing else, you could get a referral to a neurologist or other specialist who could help.\n\nUnfortunately doctors are not often informed of PGAD, and maybe less so about it in men. My doctor had not heard of it but she researched it for me before my appointment and was understanding (she is great though). Hopefully yours will listen or refer you to someone who can offer more specialized care. That is what I mean, I do not think doctors understand how meds affect pgad. I just do not know if trying a new med would make it worse. But technically I am still not sure if that Prozac caused this feeing. But it is my best bet. You should still try to talk to your doctor, they might have options for you. And if they blow you off, then you know they suck and you can look for different options. I just do not know how this could be cured or even managed honestly. Like is THERE ANY HOPE!!! Anyways today I cannot even move my legs quickly because it feels like I am going to orgasm by doing that. I just can tlive like this. My parents do not even take me to doctors anyways, so fuck it I will just have to find a way to live with it or just end my life You can get through this. It sounds like yours is more neurological like mine, so it is tied to levels of serotonin and other neurotransmitters and that can be treated medically.\n\nThe best advice I can give you to get through this is to rest and find things to distract you and reduce stress. Binge TV shows or movies you like, or play video games. I know it is hard not to feel your focus drawn to it, but the more you can get your mind elsewhere, the easier it will be to recover from this flare. \n\nUnfortunately exercise is off the table but try to keep your body relaxed and mind occupied. This will pass. How can it be treated medically? Thanks for the advice. I do try to distract myself, but it is still unbearable. My question is if the pgad is mental \n(Which I believe mine is partially mental) why would medications make it worse. Are not antidepressants suppose to make it better if there is a mental component? All the antidepressants are different combinations of chemicals and they do not effect everyone the same way. A medication that works for me might not work for you. That is why I suggested trying different antidepressants. Prozac is an old one that is proven to work for a lot of people, but not for everyone.\n\nAnd, medically, the brain is still largely a mystery. Different people have different neurochemistry, but there is no easy way to determine what each individual needs, so they have to throw all the pills they have at the problem until something works. Prozac did not give me problems before when I used to take it, and that is why it is confusing to me. Also I thought that the side effects were supposed to stop when you withdrawal from it. There is side effects, and then there are withdrawal symptoms. Also, it could also be stress or depression making the PGAD flare up. I am not sure how long it takes for Prozac to detox out of your system but I am pretty sure it is not as long as Zoloft. \n\nAlso, I had flares despite my medication when I was under a lot of stress. Are withdrawal symptoms different from side effects? Yeah, withdrawal is when your body is accustomed to functioning with a certain chemical. Take that chemical away and your body has to figure out how to work without it again. It can be rough. I took the 20mg for like only 4 days How long were you on 40? For like 2 or 3 days. Not very long for both So that is probably not withdrawals. It could be that it just is not a medication that is good for you, especially at the higher dosage. Hopefully you body will balance back out but when you do see your doctor again, definitely bring this up as a possible reaction to the high dose of Prozac. Withdrawaling from the 40mg got rid of the buzzing sensation, but withdrawaling from the 20mg did not get rid of this arousal sensation. Thanks tbh I do not know what doctors would do about this, but it is whatever. They would at least know not to put you on Prozac again. Yeah well I do not need a doctor to know that Prozac ruined my life. you are right I will just have to find a way to live with this. Distractions Also people have said that they have had success taking Prozac, but not me I guess. It just does not meet your needs, but another medication might. I mean it did in the past. The truth is I do not want it to get any worse with another medication. The last thing i need is getting to the point to having 200 orgasms a day. I already experience a lot of what I call \u201cmini orgasms\u201d these are not technically orgasms since technically they are considered orgasmic muscle contractions. But either way they are very annoying. Maybe one day I can get a mri of my pelvis. Because that is where I think it is coming from. Sorry I sound a little self obsorbed You do not sound self-absorbed! You have a medical condition that is overwhelming your senses and you came here looking for advice. I hope things calm down for you soon so you can get on with your life. It is co fusing cause I am also like perfectly healthy, and doctors even said I was too healthy when I got checked. Like how tf could this happen. Thanks I hope  it calms down too There is a lot of stuff going on in our bodies. Even in the best of physical health, my brain would still be a neurochemical disaster.", "I think I have PGAD. Not a high sex drive I have severe episodes of it where I can go for a week without the feeling. Then when the episodes come along, it is severely painful and uncomfortable. I never get turned on with an attack, instead it hurts to orgasm sometimes and it gives me a headache afterwards. If I leave it, it continues and gets so bad to the point where I have to do something.\n\nI am too shy to speak to a doctor or my mother. I hate this so much. I am 18 and I am confused, I have experienced this for a long time and I am sick of it. You will probably hear this alot but dont put off consulting somone about it, anxiety and worry can only exacerbate it I am just scared of being shamed. Also everything is phone call related right now which makes me more anxious sadly I cant say you will not be, after 13 years of it myself ive been called every horrible thing you can think of but waiting and hoping it passes is very much a bad idea That is true. Is there a cure for it? If I can ask Of course you can, its basically the answer were all looking for but unfortunately there is not atm and even worse is the lack of information about it, the minor amount of information out there is irritating to say the least But what is the point of asking for help if there is not a cure. You see what I mean. There is no hope for this disorder. Sad truth Lots of things do not have cures, this sub certainly dosent need that negativity here so take it elsewhere Hey there is no need to be ashamed about it! It is your body and your body is never something to be ashamed about :( A lot of people are saying that there is no cure but that is not true. There are a lot of things you can do that have helped people to get permanent relief. I am 19 and I am struggeling with the same thing. What is true is that there is no one cure that you take and it goes away and never comes back..you have to see and try what works for you. PGAD or RGS is often caused by damaged or irritated nerves. They can heal but it takes time. You definitely need to try to avoid sitting for long periods.. If you can try to avoid sitting at all. Taking walks is very helpful for me and moving is always good. If you lay down try to avoid putting pressure on your pelvic area (lower body). Maybe try laying on your stomach or something.. If you need to sit for school or work use a pillow or something to make it more comfortable. What has helped me a lot is stretching. Look up pelvic floor exercises on yt and try to do them everyday. Hot baths are also very helpful for me :) The most important thing is to not be scared. Stress and anxiety often make the symptomes worse. It is nothing dangerous it is just really really uncomfortable. PGAD is a very rare disease but probably only because most people are just too afraid to talk about it. The problem is that not many doctors know what to do. I am very careful with anything medical but there are a few things that I have heard might help. For example you could take something to ease the pain and something to relax your nerves. Some people take anti anxiety medications because the best way for your nerves to heal is through relaxation. You could try tea tree oil or a numbing creme but those have not worked for me. Before you try anything though I would talk to a doctor. It could also be caused by muscle issues or something else. It is really not something to be ashamed about. If you are lucky it might go away on it is own but give your body time to heal \u2764 Oh and try to avoid anything sexual. No sex, no masturbating and try not to get sexually aroused by anything else it confused this one particular nerve even more. I have heard that some people get temporary relief from it but it often makes the symptomes worse afterwards. Sorry for my english btw I am not a native speaker :/ This is really helpful. Thank you! I am sorry for the late response. Been ill and did not see your response. I am sorry if I offended you, I was just wondering if there is because it is better to be educated. And when I do ask something, one of the things that turn me off from even asking and educating myself is being told to take my negativity somewhere else. I never implied that there is no point in getting help if there is no cure for it at all because that is completely opposite to what I would personally recommend people to do because even if you cannot 100% cure something, you can still find ways to manage the disorder. Please do not answer if you are going to respond like I should not even be on the subreddit for asking a question. Thank you for answering my questions Sorry, my other comment was directed at the other guy who just said to give up, not you, I would never say that to somone who is just looking for help im sorry if it came off like that\n\nWere all in here because were all looking for the same thing, help to manage this thing I am really sorry for lashing out. I did not know that you were responding to someone else. I feel so bad. I am so sorry Its ok lol just a little mix up we all have from time to time Can u please tell more how you are overcoming it?

I had to quit my job a few months ago because of how bad it had gotten. There are days it is not as bad, and days it feels like I am on the verge of orgasm all day. I cannot remember the last time i did not feel this uncomfortable and horrible feeling. IT does not matter how many times i masturbate, it never gets better. Not masturbating makes it even worse.  I have gone to 3 gynecologists, and 2 different doctors. No one knows what it is, or how to help. I also tried 2 different birth controls, neither helped and made me very depressed. I feel very frustrated and overwhelmed, and have no clue what to do. If anyone has tips or anything, I would love any help i can get. i can relate. i am 20 and have been suffering from pgad for almost a year, and i cannot imagine how it must feel to have been through this for eight years. i am so sorry and i hope it gets better for you and you find the right treatment. i have been to so many doctors but please just be persistent and do not give up. there has to be a way somehow to make it better. i want to be hopeful for the both of us and for anyone else who has to live this way\n\ni have been to a lot of doctors and done as much research as i could possibly find on the subject. i am sure there is plenty more but i really have tried my best to learn about it\n\none route you can go is to see if you have any tarlov cysts on your spine through mri imaging. if you do, they can inject the cyst with anesthetic to see if it is causing nerve irritation. if the nerve injection lessens the pain, you can have surgery to drain and shrink the cyst. some studies have shown a lot of women get relief from their PGAD by going down this route even though it is invasive. \n\ncurrently, i take 75 mg of lyrica a day to manage the pain which really helps and lessens the swelling and other symptoms.  i am surprised they have not looked into your PGAD being a nerve issue. they will prescribe nerve blocking drugs for this type of pain frequently which may help you\n\ni am starting pelvic floor therapy soon. the doctor thinks i may have an entrapped pudendal nerve, therapy can help target and relive the pressure on the nerve. although it takes a long time / consistency i have heard it can help \n\ni am posting a lot of what i have heard / read just because i have had a really tough struggle myself. i had to drop out of college because the symptoms, particularly in the morning made it so difficult to concentrate and do normal daily activities. even today that holds true for me /: i am trying to find hope but it is so hard and there are so few people who know what it is like. if you ever want to talk ab anything message me whenever", "Please help to grow the PGADsupport community Please, if you believe that you can help someone by sharing our support group, do so.  \nPGADsupport is still a very unknown resource.  \nMany users post about their PGAD but do not know that they can come here to find peers.  \n\nWith your help, we can grow our support system and bring attention to PGAD.  \n\nYours truly,\nSirZoidberg \ud83e\udd80 Man I am starting to lose hope I think there no cure to this curse and things will not be normal again there is no point of trying !!!!!

I just do not why all of a sudden after months it would come back after the clonazepam worked so well. I am trying to up the dose but I also saw it could be dangerous because it is in a class of medicines that are similar to zanax and can be very addictive over time.", "Is this pgad? I am male, 18. When I am doing something interesting, chatting with friends, playing, walking, I do not feel any symptoms. But if I just think a little about the symptoms of pgad, they immediately begin to appear (gradually increase). Moreover, I do not think that this is some kind of illusion. I can feel them quite physically. Maybe this is something else, not pgad? I think it has something to do with my psyche. Give advice please im a male with the same problem as you. i think it has something to do with anxiety? im thinking of taking anxiety meds but idk if its worth it cus my symptoms arent even that bad. I tried a sedative, but it did not help much. Rather, I had a small placebo effect. And I could possibly cope with it if I did not have trouble sleeping. In the lying (and sometimes sitting) positions, the tension in the genital area increases significantly. Therefore, at night I cannot fall asleep without masturbation, which temporarily hides the symptoms and relaxes. All my attempts to resist this ended in failure and stress. It could be OCD. It could be OCD. If you think so, then it is quite possible. I tried to find something on the Internet that would completely fit my symptoms. But only PGAD could partially coincide with them. Do you accidentally know what medications or methodology can help with OCD? Or with which doctor can I consult on this issue (albeit ashamed)?  going through this exact thing myself, i have ocd and I think it might be some sort of groinal response to the thoughts (thinking about the symptoms) as you are focusing on that area", "A MUST-READ for all with PGAD Here is a cutting edge study, the best and most comprehensive study since this condition was identified in the early 2000\u2019s. It is written by Dr. Goldstein in LA, the number one in the field in the US, and his team. \n\nIt is fascinating and gave me so, so much hope. We have managed to narrow the issue down to a specific disc in my spine \n\nKeep the faith, please read and please do the very best you can to contact a specialist. \n\nPGAD has been physically debilitating and emotionally devastated. There have been some very, very dark moments and days. But these brilliant and phenomenal doctors and researchers have taken so much data and made it easy to understand and drawn amazing conclusions. I, a very complex case (read: my very experienced PGAD and pelvic specialist told me there were no more medications, steroid injections or therapies she could continue to do. I am in the worst 3 percent. So she referred my to Dr. Goldstein. I am on the east coast. I have been working with Dr. Rachel Rubin in DC, who trained right under him, and has a wealth of knowledge and expertise. She is exceptional. \n\nPlease reach out to either of them. I do not want you all to be suffering like I have been. There is hope, and there IS a road to recovery. Even for the worst of cases, like mine, though what I have read is so many of you might be looking at a much shorter road, using pudendal nerve blocks, meds like lyrica and amitryptaline, physical therapy and more. \n\nBest of luck to you all. \n( Hi there,so glad you have found great doctors.my doctor has been recommending amitriptyline and other antidepressants I am really not keen on taking medications and I have a feeling the the route cause to my pgad was my anxiety so I am really not sure what to do. I understand. You have all my compassion. I know how hard this road is. But when it comes to a quality of life issue...you may want to reconsider. Lyrica is a nerve pain medication. Tizadine is a muscle relaxant.  Neither are psychotropic medications Amitryptiline is a nerve medication. All have helped me immensely. There is NO SHAME in taking medications. If it was diabetes, would you shun insulin? \nI just think saying that you do not want to take medications is just accepting the suffering. You deserve to live a pain free life. \nYou believe it ties into anxiety- entirely possible- see the 5 region origins of PGAD. With such an unorthodox snd rare condition, we have to be our own advocates. \nI wish you well. I would like you to know that Dr. Goldstein in LA does 10 minute consultations at no charge. I will give what you said a think and come back if I can offer any information. An amazingly helpful resource. Thank you so much for sharing! You are very welcome! I was so excited to share it. Thankyou so much I would like to know what medications would be most helpful if the route cause of pgad is anxiety.I just dont want any adverse effect of medications that is why I have not touched antidepressants till date. Hi there! \n\nI have also seen dr rubin and she wants me to go to see dr Irwin Goldstein.   She is  calling mine gentopelvic dysesthesia, which she sent me this study.  \nI had no luck with amitriptyline and I am currently on gabapentin and titrating up, no relief currently.\n\nNot sure where you live but I would like to chat with you more about your experience with irwin. Acupuncture. I am in LA and found someone to almost completely fix me rather than going to Goldstein. His first recommendation was back surgery before I even met him! His first meeting is 4.5 hours long and $2,500. He recommended back surgery right off the bat! \n\nIf you are in LA I have a acupuncturist that mainly focuses on Pelvic Dysfunction/PGAD I am in Mississippi! \u2639\ufe0f.   I might travel there in the future.   Did you have MRI that they reviewed? No MRI\u2026 I had back surgery previously and had mris and no doctors ever saw anything other than my injury (had PGAD way before that)\n\nIf you are going to fly out to CA you really should see my acupuncturist. After 1 treatment my lifeline PGAD pain was gone. Still have a lot of symptoms but the tight squeezing was gone and never came back\u2026. \n\n$100 per treatment vs $2,500 minimum for Goldstein just to get started\u2026 The interesting part here is, I do not have clitoral pain/symptoms.\n\nIt seems to be the area right below my clitoris and around my urethra.\nNever stops, does get better at times.  I need to start journaling my symptoms but I think they are worse before my period but nobody sees anything that could be hormonally wrong.  I have also tried the estrogen/testosterone gel.   Send me her info,please.\n\nI am in very limited in my area with any types of doctors or treatments. I had no pain on my penis either it was all perineum pain. Once I started his treatment and the pressure came off the nerves you know that feeling when your legs falls asleep but then comes back to life? That is what I have now but it gets better after the very treatment. Of course I have flareups here and there but my situation was almost worst case. \n\nHe primarily deals with PGAD which is clearly extremely rare. He has fixed people in as little as a few sessions so I would def consider flying out to LAX for a few days and get two or three treatments and see how you feel. \n\nI was referred to him by one of the top pelvic PT places in LA I was really skeptical but after 1 treatment and my lifelong pain was GONE and never came back was enough for me to dig in.\n\nYou can call him he is very happy to answer any questions. \n\nGood luck!\n\n Which one helped the most?  I have pretty serious hesitation to take Lyrica because, regardless of what the doctors say, it certainly can be addictive and there is tolerance and withdrawal I agree with the above.  I was a patient of Dr. Goldstein himself, and I have encountered no one more interested in PGAD and actively pursuing treatments for it.  If you have PGAD, you should be in contact with him, period.", "Did anyone have this since childhood too? Just wondering cause I have it since I am 4, since then it never stopped. My first member something was up was when I was around 7 or 8 I was squeezing my legs together and I would get a tingling sensation. When I hit puberty it really took off to the point I was masturbating having full on orgasms. It has not stopped scene if anything it is getting stronger. Mine developed when I was around 10 years old and I got diagnosed when I was 11, it can start very young as fsr as I am aware", "cannot take it anymore!!!!!!!

You are not alone.  You are not a freak. Hi! Ok, take a deep breath. I got pgad and it has gone away 99.9%. The first thing is to figure out what  caused it and then go from there. Contrary to what others online say, there is help. It is alright, I know it is really scary and you feel like it is never going to go away. Mine did, almost fully, so I think it could be possible for you too. Mine was caused by a change in birth control. I know I caused it!!!!!!! Do you know how? Stress and anxiety caused mine. I mean masturbation no stress can cause this I have  been stressed all my life nothing happened to me!!!!! I was stressed all my life too until I hit a tipping point and that caused it. There is help. Have you heard if Dr. Irwin Goldstein? No since I am not from the United state Look him up on goggle. He offers a 10 minute free phone consultation and can guide you and refer you to someone in your country. Late reply. But I am really intrigued by your answer since I think severe stress and anxiety are also my triggers. Could you tell me what you did to overcome it all? When I first got it, it was like 2ish months of intense pgad. I was given a muscle relaxant for another issue and realized that it helped the pgad go away. So I took the muscle relaxant for like a month and that calmed a lot of it down. I was also going to physical therapy but that wasnt helpful at all because the therapists were terrible and would cause me to tense up more. \n\nI began doing a lot of deep belly breathing and walking. Slowly, it went away. It still flares if I have a lot of stress or my body has been really tense but I just feel a slight tingling sensation and it is nothing like in the beginning. Glad you are doing better! Thanks for the advice", "does this sound like PGAD? first lemme start off my saying i am experiencing bad anxiety right now about my health. i keep getting lots of different symptoms that go away usually but this has lasted a couple days now. i feel super sensitive in my clit area all the time. i am able to orgasm after abt like 10 mins when i have been masturbating but i still have this weird feeling. there is no pain or throbbing or anything. it just feels weird down there. i am so so scared i am a minor and i cannot tell my mom. my clit also is not sensitive to touch and there is no physical change. it just feels weird. does this sound like PGAD or just anxiety? i have also been getting some UTI like symptoms, i feel like i have to pee a lot. my anxiety is terrible right now and i cannot relax or focus at all and i keep getting panic attacks, convinced i have PGAD. anyone please help Hi, please do not panic. I have PGAD but your symptoms seem very mild. This could be one of many things. Try speaking g with your doctor first. There are a number of things you can try. As you suffer with anxiety this will make it worse so relax, yoga is good as it relaxes the pelvic floor muscles. You need a strong pelvic floor but when it gets tight it can iterate the nerves. Are you on any meds for your anxiety? Xx thank you and no i am not on any meds. I had this but I am recovering now. Please see a pelvic therapist. I went through the worst anxiety when I read everywhere about how this is permanent psychological etc but I had just pulled a muscle down there while stretching. The irritated nerve was no longer pinched after I applied some heat to the pelvic area. Now the nerve is a little sensitive as it heals and takes some time but it is totally healing. wow this is exactly like what i have. I am sorry it went away :) all anxiety when did it go away? because mine wont went away after a couple days / week", "My girlfriend suffers from PGAD She tells me about how the feeling is in her lower back area around the spine.\nAnyone out there with similar \"spasm\" on lower spine?\nAny tips for surviving every day office life regarding said lower back \"spasm?\"\nWhat helps *other* than sex? Cannot offer much help as my issue is more in the \"pelvic pain\" realm, but what are the problems it gives her in office life? Pain, distraction, that sort of thing? I am a male, I broke my tailbone at a young age and the arousal feeling a lot of the times starts off in my lower back also. Sometimes it is like a twitchy feeling back there. My low back is very sensitive it is touched back there even sitting back to chair is sometimes stressful. \nA good Chiropractor did spine decompression on me which has helped a ton. But be careful not all Chiropractors are good.\n\nI notice that (not to be gross) but if I have to have a bowel movement the arousal back there is pretty bad. After using restroom though the arousal abates some. See if it is the same with your girlfriend, one doctor told me my stool was possibly pressing against my pudendal nerve. He also recommended me to keep my stool loose so that it would not irritate my nerve when using restroom.\n\nIt is probably best she see her Doctor for guidance on what to do next.\n\nA possible remedy to help her cope in the short term which has helped normalize my symptoms a bit are: \nApple Cider Vinegar with Mother about 20ml mixed with a cup full of water as soon as I wake up. \n\nI got this remedy from a Restless Leg Syndrome forum. Restless Leg and Restless Genital (Pgad) have a lot in common. This remedy has helped restore a bit of my mental focus\n\n\nSorry if this post was no help. Thank you for such a thoughtful and helpful comment! Yes I suffer from the lower back pain it is really horrible and painful", "My long story, male, 17 yo (I use google translate, so sorry if something is unreadable)\n\n**Story**  \nHello, I am a teenager and I suppose I have PGAD. I did not tell anyone about this out of shame, so I hope to get support here.It all started a long time ago. When I was 9-10 years old, I started masturbating without realizing it. However, I did it in an unusual way. I pressed tightly to the bed (floor), raised my legs a little and \"rolled\" on the foreskin. At the age of 14, I first tried the usual masturbation for everyone and it was good. I began to alternate the ways of masturbation, until I completely ruled out the old one. Moreover, this activity helped me so much to relieve stress, so at the age of 15-16 I did it almost every day before going to bed. In addition, to get more pleasure, sometimes I deliberately waited 30-60 minutes and continued. But one day I wondered, do I really need it? I have read many articles on the benefits of not masturbating. I firmly decided that I would not masturbate that night. However, an unexpected disappointment awaited me, which haunts me to this day. Every time I try to sleep, I have a strong urge to touch myself. And thinking about it makes the \"pain\" even stronger. I went online hoping to find a solution. Everywhere they wrote that it was all in the head, there was no need to think about it. But all my attempts only proved that I feel physically uncomfortable. After some time, I began to notice that the need for masturbation appeared not only at night, but also during the day. I could sit at school, with a tutor, at a visit and feel a strong burning sensation in the genital area. The more I endured, the longer the discomfort remained after the procedure. At night, there are situations when 1 time cannot fully alleviate the symptoms. It is terrible to do this 3 times a night. This has haunted me all these years! And it manifested itself when I sit or lie.  \n**What is it at the moment?**  \nMasturbation has become both my pain pill and my most hated enemy. 1-3 times a day is normal for me. I thought I had problems with the prostate and bladder (when I really want to go to the toilet, the burning sensation intensifies). But the examination showed that I am healthy in this regard. I rummaged through everything about PGAD and realized the whole misfortune of my situation. My record for abstinence so far is 4-5 days when I was constipated. I have no idea how this is connected. Perhaps one pain was hiding another.  \n**My attempts to fight PGAD:**  \n1) I have found that being in a good mood can relieve symptoms noticeably. Therefore, I tried to talk with friends as often as possible, play games, eat delicious food and relax. But the negative moments of life will not go away on their own just like that. Only one bad obsession could make me want to masturbate. I try to control it, but it is very difficult.  \n2) I also noticed that the stronger the orgasm from masturbation, the longer I will not be bothered by the symptoms. I have several ways to do this, but I am not entirely sure of them, so I will not say anything.  \n3) In a stuffy room, sitting in sweat, the symptoms go away by 75-90%. It is summer now, so sometimes I try not to turn on the air conditioner to get at least a little breath from the PGAD. I also read that training helps. they cause sweat. But since I am mostly a homebody, I do not have to choose.  \n4) Saw one person comment on reddit. He was helped by stretching the pelvic floor and a daily walk. I admired his success tried to repeat after him. Perhaps I would have been doing this even now, if not for the third day. I tried to do each exercise correctly and walked a lot that day. I did not masturbate all day, although he felt the need. Before going to bed, I even went in for some sports. So much I believed in the correctness of my actions. But when I went to bed, I realized that I was already on the brink. Therefore, I decided that nothing bad would happen. After I finished, the feeling was disgusting. I went to the toilet 5-6 times in an hour. After that, for 2-3 days, everything below the belt was in tension. I have never felt such terrible discomfort. After this experience, I gave up.  \n**Soon:**  \nI plan to go to a neurologist and a psychiatrist. They might be able to do something to me, because I am really scared. Now I live at home, so I can relieve my symptoms in a proven way at any time. But what happens next? I will go to university, they will give me accommodation. And what am I going to do there? How will I sleep? How will I study? And how will I sit in class? I do not know what to do. Lately, I have not been able to concentrate on anything at all. Thanks for reading this. It was very important for me to speak.", "Please help!!!!!!  I cannot take it I am tired I do not what to do \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dthis arsouel feeling will not go away what should I do it is really distracting!!!!!!i cannot do anything please help any medication you know that might help??? Death is probably the only solution!!!!!!!!!! How many times a day do you masturbate? I only did it once in my life since that day I become aoused 24/7 none stop for no reason !!!!!!!! I do not want to sound patronizing, but masturbating relieves the pent up arousal in normal people but for people with pgad it does not. If you can hold off masturbating, you do not have PGAD I do not understand your saying I do not have pgad  or I have!!!and I do not intend to masturbate  ever again it is was one horrible mistake that I regret till this day Human beings masturbate because it acts as a relief valve. If you choose not to relieve yourself that is your decision, but it is by no means a disorder. \n\nYou do not have PGAD. You choose to refrain from relieving yourself, of course it will build up I think it will make it worse it was absolutely painful and horrible feeling !!!!! Stupid me I thought if I do it it will kill my sexual desires I did not know what I was getting my self into I was adding fuel to the fire!!!! Let us say it is not the pgad and it is probably my sex drive changed !!!!will the anti depressants help in this case and things will go to normal if I started taking them??

Started off in my last years of high school when I was masturbating late at night, decided to go for round 2, and ended up having a really intense clitoral orgasm that just lingered and came in waves for the night keeping me up till early morning. I was shaking and nauseous and almost feeling panicky. \nEvery so often since I have had flare up. Right now I am experiencing the same situation as that time two years ago.

Help :( do I go to the doctors? Is there short term relief, or even some way I can comfort myself? I think mine might be psychological. It is like a lingering euphoria I cannot wind down from.

Has it subsided? Hope you are ok!\n\nI have had these episodes since I was 13. I know exactly how you feel. Lowering anxiety has helped heaps. went to sexual health clinic and they say it is tied into hyperarousal and anxiety. That my orgasms leave me overstimulated and switch on a hyperaroused state. Along with this is the inability to release the blood flow as I do not finish, so pelvic stretches and exercise will release the blood flow and get things moving and released again. So that is pelvic stretching and calming my mind/anxiety that fixes it for me :) Went to a sexual health clinic and they say it is tied into hyperarousal and anxiety.

Could you guys please recommend anything that like helps you go about your day to day routine cos im really struggling Not sure where you are located but I would start by looking for a pelvic pain specialist. There are professionals who know what PGAD is and will not make you feel crazy. I do a combo of pelvic floor physical therapy and medication. I am not symptom free but have significantly more days of being symptom free than not. From what I have learned from others, as well as through my own experience, people respond differently to different interventions.

I never talked about this publicly before but I just found out that there is a support thread on this subject, i dealt with pgad for 4 years and it was crippling me to the point where i went out if state to see a specialist who cured me back in 2017. ive since been 3 years completely pain free. this man is a fucking saint, it was expensive bc insurance didnt cover it but there is a cure, there are ways to make it go away. there are a lot if different causes of pgad, and mine was because the protective layer on my bladder wall was deteriorating, i have internal cysitis. it was causing the pgad. he perscribed me elmiron, its a pill that helps rebuild your bladder wall. it could be different for you but it worked for me and he sure knows what hes talking about. hes a pgad pelvic specialist in pennsylvania. look into him. best thing i ever did for myself. message me if you want his name and such Does anyone have this from psych meds like me that got any relief?

I have sex around 3 hours a day and that only relieves my symptoms for those 3 hours I have found that abstaining from sex and masturbation makes it worse. But also planning and limiting sexual behavior to a manageable level is important.  For me a limit of 4 organsms a day helps me manage.  If I lose control of that planning and management of the \u201citch\u201d then I will cum at least 20 times a day and throughout the night.  Which is a nightmare of course as everyone on here knows.", "Hysterectomy with PGAD Hey you all, \n\nMy insurance will no longer cover the injections I have been getting that stop my periods and treat my Endometriosis.  \n\nI developed PGAD in July of this year. \n\nSo I have hesitantly decided to have a laparoscopic hysterectomy done on December 30th. - what a fuckin way to the dumpster fire that is 2020 - \n\nI am wondering if someone similar has done this. What was your recovery like? Did it make your PGAD  symptoms worse/better? \n\nThanks in advance There is a couple of PGAD Facebook groups I am a member of that have a lot of women who have had hysterectomies. Let me know if you want a link Yes, ill take it, thanks! Check your PM", "Finally got closure. I have had this happening since 2015 &amp; I always thought other people were touching me while I was laying down or molesting me but when I would look there would be no evidence of someone there. I finally found out about PGAD &amp; RGS &amp; actually feel relieved. I understand it is an inconvenience but it is nice to have closure on my condition. I thought it was tactical hallucinations but this seems more like what I go thru on a daily basis.", "Was has been helping me Hi everyone,\n\nI decided to post this because maybe it can help other people suffering from this terrible condition. I have been suffering from PGAD for about 3 years now and I think it was probably SSRIs that caused it. I always had good weeks and bad ones, but there was never a whole month in which I did not feel the symptoms.\n\nIn the last 4 months, however, I am doing very well, I almost did not have bad days. The one thing that I think has helped me the most was starting homeopathic treatment. I started it without any faith in it, but it has actually helped with a lot of things: depression, anxiety, PGAD and skin issues. But I have also been making changes to my diet for about 5 months now. Nothing big, just trying to eat less sugar, gluten and dairy.\n\nI also started to exercise more often last year. High-intensity trainings were helping SO MUCH. But then I injured my knee and started following low-intensity programs. I do everything at home, with YouTube videos.\n\nSo I guess that is what has been helping me A LOT, and hopefully this can help someone else as well.", "Male PGAD is a thing. It is rare but here I am. I am a 33 year old male with what my doctor believes is PGAD. I can only assume my struggles are very different than a woman\u2019s, but struggle nonetheless. Many people chalk it up to \u201cactive sex drive\u201d or overly horny. But it is not a walk in the park. Any other males out there have experience with this? Seems only female on here from what I have seen. There are males on the Facebook support groups. I first learned about it because of a man. Yes me too.

I know that is hard to do when you are actively trying to not think about it but I promise if you avoid it for even 24 hours it WILL get easier until you barely feel it. So that is means it is a mental illness not physical??!!right 100% mental. \nI kept telling myself \u201cif my mind caused this, it can also fix this\u201d Because when I asked a psychiatrist why I have numbing feeling in my body he told that the brain sends wrong signals !!!!

Are you on any medications currently ? \n\nI was the same way until I lowered the dose on my meds ( a antidepressant and a stimulant) and focused a lot on positive thinking and stopped googling and making myself think about it.. it just sort of faded(until I get stressed) \nIt is just your body showing stress in a different way. Once tou distract(working out helps A LOT) then you slowly start forgetting and that is positive reinforcement until it is gone for good. I have never been on medication in my life but after what happened to me I was in complete shock I started crying everyday and trying to hurt my self and blame it for what I have done the psychiatrist prescribed some anti depressants but when I took one pill I threw up immediately after taking it I guess medication not for me Mindfulness techniques help.

I was sitting and laying in my bed when this feeling suddenly appeared. I didnt think much of it and just fell asleep. The next morning it was still there and is scared me a little. I went to work and the feeling died down but comes back strong when I am sitting or more focused on the feeling. My clit is also VERY sensitive. I am around the time of ovulation so that might have something to do with it? I am not on any meds but I do have some anxiety and a little bit of ocd. It is almost like my clit is swollen and wont go back down...I sleep ok but it is still constantly there. Anybody else experience something similar and any ideas on relief? It sounds stray but try not to think about it.  My mind and down there are definitely connected in a weird way.  I think about tingling and pulsing and then next thing you know it is exactly what I am feeling.  \n\nI have gotten used to feeling this way over the past few months, except when I sleep.  My body relaxes and I have no control whatsoever and I am awakened from a sound sleep by tingling and pleasurable feelings.

I started taking wellbutrin and all of sudden i noticed great compulsion to mastrubate only finding to get unwanted sensation downstairs after i finished . Like i had no refractory period and felt very uncomfortable . Anyway its gone now , srsly its probally ocd . Maby you are used to mastrubating when having anxiety , it becomes ocd. \nI am a male btw . that is what i think too i am a hypochondriac as well and will convince myself im ill when im really not me focusing on it too much probably is causing the symptoms im glad you are feeling better now though hopefully i will soon as well I am sure you will be allright, i am also hypochrondriac to the max. Every one is on reddit \ud83d\ude44 I am so glad I am seeing this. I am a 20yo f and I have been dealing with this for 4 years do not let this scare you because it has not been 4 years straight just 4 years in general . I remember the first time this happened to me was before school and then it would not go away the whole day, I was going away to a hotel for a weekend for sports and that is when I started researching of course, pgad is what came up and the whole summer that was the only thing that was on my mind. I had terrible anxiety from it and the only relief was from masturbating. I have never felt so awful and depressed in my life and I considered suicide. Once school started again it went away completely. I have had spurts of it here and there, currently going through it again but I am almost fully convinced(at least for me) it is OCD and or hypochondria. Your brain is such a powerful organ if you believe your pregnant your body will start to produce symptoms even if you are not. Do not worry my friend, worst case scenario you do have it but remember if you do you are not alone and there are options out there for relief and support as well as CBT therapy and other things. Try to keep your mind off of things and try to keep stress levels down because that is what makes it worse. Hang in there! thank you very much for the reassurance and im sorry you have been dealing with this i have felt a bit better today and was able to get some sleep last night without waking up due to stress and anxiety so hopefully it is going away like it has before hypochondria makes me feel crazy once i research something i start feeling symptoms that i didnt have prior to research it may all be in my head but for some people that is not the case and its terrible i really hope you get better soon it helps to just distract yourself if it is anxiety i try to keep myself busy i hung out with friends yesterday and did not feel it at all really so i feel hopeful for the future! I can almost definitely assure you that it is most likely just OCD - a form of anxiety. I suffer from this and my theme changes from time to time and currently it is PGAD. You can definitely convince yourself you have the symptoms and 100% feel it. Thank you also for your kind words!  It does get better, reading and researching about it will only make it worse. But definitely find friends and people you can talk to without judgement and distraction helps so much. I promise you are not alone there are plenty of people who have this that are able to live very fulfilling normal lives What did u do to stop feel the PGAD symptoms?? I think I have the same thing and I am freaking out I am literally exactly the same! I believe dr google straight away and start believing i have a billion illnesses when really its all just in my head. Recently ive been feeling the exact same thing you have :( i can relate. i started googling and even saw that pgad video too then i started feeling the symptoms. i freak out but when im not focusing about it, im alright. how did you cope? advice?", "Causes. Previous medical conditions. Symptoms. Treatments. Hi. I would like to know what caused your pgad, what your symptoms and treatments are, and if you have any other diseases / disorders / conditions. \n\nI have depression with hypomania, (a lot) of anxiety, and I had a pain in my face for about a year, so I think I may have some problem with my nerves. I started with pgad symptoms when I took lithium and aripiprazole, so I do not know which one was the cause, but I am pretty sure it was from this and I want to cry a lot, it is like I did it to myself. I immediately stopped taking them but the symptoms continued and two years have passed.\nI do not know if a can live with this.\nThank you for this community. As far as I know or rather what the doctors have told me, mine was due to a hormone issue, as for other issues I also suffer depression and anxiety, hypersexuality and albeit non diagnosed, hyperspermia.\n\nFor it all i take anti depressants which seem to work just not as well as I would like thanks for answering it. i do not know if this can help you but i have read the antidepressant duloxetine has been successful in two patients who have tried it. maybe i will try that one. I will have a look but I tend to have reactions to certain drugs so I am at a bit stuck point ADHD, depression. It got worse when I tried to wean off antidepressants, my entire nervous system went haywire.  Gets worse with severe stress too, even when I am medicated. thanks for answering it. what antidepressants did you wean off? and wich ones do you take now? did the doctors examine you to find the cause? I am not on any medications, but find that caffeine makes mine worse. I think mine was triggered psychologically but became a physical issue. I grew up in a really religious household where sex was something to be scared of and never talked about, but as soon as I became active in college I developed PGAD immediately. Now it comes and goes but has a lot to do with physical factors like sitting for long periods of time, drinking caffeine, etc. \n\nI feel your pain - it is so complicated to address because it is such a cocktail of physical, psychological, and emotional issues. \n\nJust know you have people here to commiserate with and support you! It is so strange how the causes are different for everyone... Yes it is so complicated, I do not want to think about sex anymore, I even hate thoughts associations like movements or sounds similar to sex because they make me nerveous. And we are so alone because its embarrasing to talk about this with anyone. I hope this passes quickly and becomes just a bizarre memory, but I do not know. If you go to a doctor and you know anything else let me know.\n Thank you &lt;3 I always experience it if I forget to take my antidepressant medication for more than a day (Duloxetine, 120mg), but I think I have also experienced it more randomly I know, it is really frustrating. I am sure more people suffer from it than we realize, but like you said no one brings it up because it is taboo. Do you have it every day, or just certain flare-ups? I feel like it looks so different for everyone. Can I ask what kind of anti depressants you take that are helping?

Idk honestly I really appreciate this community cause I have been panicking about this cause it just will not stop and I am scared to go to a professional cause what if I am just crazy and it is all in my head. I just do not even know how to react when I am going through a bad episode idk what to call it. I feel like my whole life has been a freaking arousal episode but I just want it to stop. What is it even like orgasming\u2026I feel like since I always feel like this all the orgasms I have felt are not special and sex just is not worth it. This was a shit show of a post but whatever These words will not be as Comforting as I would like them to be. What you are going through as I am also going through is not pretty.  Doctors are pretty open to possibilities, and they do also have knowledge of the human body that they studied and got their degree in. When I brought it to the attention of my gynecologist she thought that I should start taking antidepressants. The fact of the matter is I am not depressed. I have friends that have been diagnosed with depression and I do not fit the bill So I am not trying to put a Band-Aid on it please speak to your doctor To see what they come up with. And as far as telling your family it took me years to do so but my first episode I ended up in a coma.  It Took a backseat because my family and friends thought it was something far more worse, meaning they thought I was on some horrific drugs.  I was not! I was so shocked horrified by what was happening to me. And at the time I was celibate. Four all intents and purposes for some thing to feel as if your most personal intimate body parts That GOD gave you, are a novelty  to play with it is pretty intense. Especially that it was not warranted. As you read other peoples experiences I hope that you find the words to share with your family and the people that you want to know. And in these cases there are more and more people experiencing this women more than men and a lot of people are keeping it private. But please remember this is something that is happening to you, it does not have to define who you are. You are definitely not crazy, we here understand what your going through and its a pain bigger than what we could imagine\n\nAlways here for you", "Flair up I am having an intense flair of my symptoms. It has not been this bad in over a year. I went to a specialist gynocologist and she did not have any ideas other than raising my gabapentin dosage. I am going to use an ice pack to see if that helps. I could not take the dosage of gabapentin because I was like a zombie. Any suggestions for\"home remedies\" will be helpful. I am not going to be able to sleep like this. I am trying very hard not to touch myself because that only makes it worse. see if you can get your Dr to prescribe a benzocaine or lidocaine cream for you. In the mean time you can try Vagisil extra strength. Try not to use these too often as they are not good for the vulva.\n\nThe thing that has helped me a bit more than others (although I do not know if this is vulva safe long term either) is topically applying St Johns Wort from a dropper either into a bath, directly onto the vulva (stings like crazy but I would rather feel that) or mixed with coconut oil onto the vulva. This seems to help me at least for a small while. \n\nYou could also try pelvic trigger point massage, which honestly is pretty simple. Google how to do it and there is lots of articles. I also do meditation and yoga. Getting the parasympathetic nervous system to calm down will always help PGAD, even if only slightly. \n\nsome people use SSRIS for PGAD, although that did not help me, and there is a lot of mixed info. Have you ever tried using cannabis infused oil? If its legal where you are at, most dispensaries carry some kind of massage oil with THC or high THC:CBD strain. I would avoid pure CBD oils though, but if its not legal where you are at it may be good enough Yes. I have my mmj card in my state. My DIL is a chemist at a marijuana grow company and has me try different strains and levels of terpenes. It usually helps, but last night was awful. I fell asleep with the ice pack. Much better today. Thanks for the support! Oh wow, ok you got this alternative down then. That is interesting that she is working on terpenes, takes the full spectrum effect one step further. Good luck, this sounds promising!", "My story + PGAD improvement Tw: mention of suicidal thoughts\n\nHi there. I am over the moon to find that this support group was created because I feel PGAD is extremely under represented and talked about in the medical community, despite it happening to a surprising amount of women out there. \n\nAnyway, I developed PGAD-like symptoms earlier this year after starting a new birth control. I basically lost my mind and started becoming super horny all the time. The night it all started, I had a massive panic attack because I remembered hearing about PGAD and I was terrified I would be stuck like that for the rest of my life. I did not sleep until 6am that night. It was like I was about to sneeze all the time, and I was in a constant state of panic. I would have bouts of extreme rage and depression and multiple times where I wanted to end my life. \n\nI stopped taking the birth control and I immediately saw improvement. Every five days,  I would get an episode. It was weird, but it literally happened every five days. I still do not know why. I saw three different doctors in hopes to find a reason to why this happened and two of them basically said it was in my head and not real and PGAD is fake and made up by pharmaceutical companies to get money out of people \ud83d\ude44 my GP was the only person who actually confirmed my hunch that the birth control did this to me. She was very concerned for me and believed me that what I was going through was not normal. She was hopeful, though, that it would go away. \n\nNow, four months later, I rarely experience any symptoms at all and I feel soooooo much better. My hormones are still figuring themselves out, but for the most part, I feel back to normal. I do not feel crazy anymore and I am basically myself again. \n\nAnybody who is going through something like this, I would love to talk to you. I have kind of made it a mission to help other women who are going through something like this because I would not wish this on my worst enemy. Stay strong everyone, it will be ok. It is cliche, but it will. Thank you so much for posting.  Welcome to the subreddit and thanks for taking part in bringing attention to PGAD. I am 65 years old and got this after being on and coming off of an antidepresent Remeron . My doctor wants me to go on a ton of hormone pills is that a cure for PGAD is it hormones?I am obviously post menopausal has this gone away for anyone on increased hormone therapy? PGAD can be caused by a number of things. In my case, the catalyst was the birth control. I would be careful with hormone therapy, but it could possibly relieve your symptoms. I would try it, but tread lightly. Messing with my hormones is what got me into that mess in the first place. I wish you luck!", "New Member seeking advice (38M) I am a 38 year old guy based in the UK trying to find more information about PGAD in men. I would never heard of pgad before and always put the sensations and urges I experience down to my ADHD and tourettes. Now I am starting to wonder if there could be more to it.\n\nThe problem is that there is so little information out there (especially for men) plus I am not sure that my experience matches up properly to PGAD symptoms - I experience sensations in the head of my penis and I get sudden urges where I feel the need to ejaculate. I have also at times experienced spontaneous ejaculations although I would not describe this as regular. However, it is not constant and it seems to be more sporadic than others experiences?! Also - while it can be uncomfortable / awkward / embarrassing when it does happen, I would not say that my experience of it is debilitating in the way many people on here describe.\n\nWould appreciate if anyone could point me in the direction of where I could get more information etc. It seems like such a rare thing so the chances of me having it are small and I do not want to have to go through all the hassle and awkwardness of doctors / psychiatrists / uroligists etc for no reason.\n\nWould also be great to connect with other guys who may be in a similar situation.\n\nThanks I am a man with the same condition as you! a few things that helped distract me with it are exersise (working out or running specifically) music (I play the violin, listening to music also helps too.) Cold showers and cold water in general actually help alot. Basicly you want to use your hobbies to distract yourself from the PGAD. Some of these things may also help you with your tourettes. My Pgad is probably not as bad as yours so these things might work better for me, but I hope you find this usefull. Hey thanks for the advice - I definitely notice a difference for the better when I am distracted, and I dont even think it matters what the distraction is. I notice that lots of people on here seem to associate it with work stress and pressures but I find that any distraction seems to help in a way.\n\nOddly enough I am more aware of things when I am trying to relax / meant to be relaxing and it feels like my brain is trying to sabotage things. It is so annoying and frustrating because sometimes it feels like I 'think' it into existence and if I just did not think about it then it would not happen!", "I am really scared and I do not know what to do Hi I am 18F and I think I may have PGAD. I was masturbating one day (I think it was 3 days ago)  just like every single other day of my life but I had this feeling that I was not satisfied so I went again. Ever since then, I have had this like pressure on my clit. I do not get wet or anything it is sort of like mild butterflies in my stomach and like someone is touching it. I have lost so much sleep and I have had so many break downs I do not know what to do because it is quarantine. Can someone push me into a direction? I really really am scared. Someone please help? Hey hang in there. Do you find orgasms relieve any of the \"pressure\"? Or do you feel you need to keep going for them? They make things worse for me because the pressure remains there afterwards but I just read in another sub that it may be over sensitive nerves? I am very scared because if it is something like PGAD I am afraid I will not be able to be a doctor one day as at the pace it is going I really cannot see a way to concentrate at all Hi. So sorry you are going through this. It is definitely overwhelming and scary but there is hope and help available. Not sure where you are located but I would look into an OBGYN who is also a pelvic floor pain specialist (and even pelvic floor PT). I currently use a combination of birth control, Nortriptyline (an antidepressant that is also used for nerve pain), and valium (used vaginally) for breakthrough pain, as well as pelvic floor exercises. It took some time working with my doctor to find a combination that helped, but I am generally symptom free (some breakthrough symptoms the week before my period so my doctor currently has me skipping the sugar pill week and taking the birth control straight through). Anxiety and stress definitely contribute to an increase in symptoms for me, but PT has helped immensely with relaxation exercises. Hi I am glad youve found something to help you! From my symptoms are they similar to those of PGAD? What do you think? Hi, I am a male, but hopefully I can help a little. IMO, the best thing from what you have described would be to look into pelvic floor therapy. What you mentioned about feeling unnatural pressure makes me guess there is something musculo-skeletal about this. Maybe try r/PelvicFloor or r/PelvicPain? Thank you thank you so so much! No problem! You are not alone. I am not a doctor and can only speak about my experience so not sure how helpful this will be. From my understanding of PGAD, the primary symptom is the feeling of unrelenting, persistent, and unwanted arousal. There are definitely other symptoms, like pressure, throbbing, etc but if you are not experiencing what feels like arousal, it is possible it is something else. I think there are probably other symptoms related to other pelvic floor-related injuries/dysfunctions.  Best of luck! Thank you so so much! I just read up on UTI and internal thrush issues and I have contacted my doctor! I hope to update and have some sort of idea of what is happening. Hope you get answers soon! Hi friend. Your experience sounds almost identical to mine. It just appeared out of the blue. Do you have history of taking SSRI's and/or birth control? Do you have any hormonal conditions like PCOS or endometritis that you know of? My PGAD came on because my doctor put me on ortho tri-cyclen, a birth control that completely messed me up. When I stopped it, my PGAD disappeared within 6 months. Hey I had taken some sort of anxiety med and sleep med last year but I have a feeling that is not really the cause. I do not think I have any hormone issues and I am not on birth control. Hey! Just found this post! \n\n\nI honestly would not worry too much! \n\nIdk if you use a vibrator, or any other electrical device near the clit- but alot of times the plastics/ rubber, etc allows the outside of the vibrator to get warm. This causes a bit of stress on the clit- leading to that constant pressure feeling you are describing.\n\n\nI used to masturbate up to 7 times a day- and know that going multiple rounds of stimulation can lead to that feeling for a few days after*\n\nSchedule a virtual Dr visit if you can- may be a minor UTI (be sure to always wash your hands/ toys before and after use- as well as to pee after masturbation and thoroughly wipe between the inner labia).\n\nThis is most likely the exact minor problem I had/ and it will heal on its own soon without any issues* Wishing you the best! Hi im a 17 years old male and i have the same problem it happend to me yesterday it is like i feel a little bit of orgasms all the time\nIt just happend to me yesterday when i was trying to sleep \nI only slept 4 hours because i was scared and that feeling was driving me crazy i even had suciadle toughts \nI did the same thing i masturbate but the feeling did not go away \nI am scared too and i do not know what to do\nPlease can someone help I just sent a test in for UTI hopefully it is! Took the first 3 days course but it only stopped the feeling a little. Feeling hopeful though I think going to the doctor is best because I also scared myself with thoughts of PGAD and you never know for sure until all tests are done. With the lockdown I think you should probs just call them up or I had an online appointment then sent a urine sample. Sometimes it is the irritation of the urinary tract or just a UTI. Get it checked out but do not worry that much or it will just get worse with stress. If you need someone to talk to I am here if you feel uncomfortable talking about it with your mates Cus it is a hard thing to go through alone. Im 17 years old so i am too ashamed to tell my parents i do not have the money to see a doctor i will try to ignore it until i see if it is over\nPlease get me updated about your situation\nSorry for my english and thanks for the help If you feel the onset of another UTI, consider taking D-Mannose! It is a natural method to helping UTIs! Really hope you feel fully better soon! Im 17 years old and going through the same thing, it is like constant tingles in my genitals and a constant urge to pee along with heaviness/tingles in the legs. The idea of it being PGAD is frightening me so much, please see if you can update your situation, and good luck! Update: I did not have a UTI I need to contact the doctors again. I am sorry for not having more information.

It was really frustrating because i would have to pause everything to try to masterbaute (to get rid of the sexual build up)\nBut so far, I feel like it is gotten some what worse. But it is not constant, I probably should not self diagnose myself with anything but i cannot see a medical professional because i have no idea of how to explain it to my parents so i have come to reddit for help and advice. What should i do?.. How often does it happen? Thank you for sharing your experience.  Hopefully as the community grows, we will have a strong support network available for you. Often,it is difficult to caculate exactly but every time i try to do something", "Research Urologist or Gynecologist out of a University. I am making this post for both men and women. It is very obvious that PGAD is a very under researched and very unreported phenomenon, but I feel like in the right hands doctors would be willing to find a solution. I have been to a few doctors for this and for the most part I have either been blown off or told to go to San Diego to meet Dr. Goldstein, who I am sure a few of you are aware of. I have been wondering though if visiting a college medical research center would have a benefit. These peoples jobs are to find new treatments and expand knowledge everyday. If they had a real person with PGAD come in, it would be like striking gold for then, and they would probably try everything in their power to create a breakthrough in thy medical field. I am going to try it myself, but I was also curious if anyone here has tried this route yet? Thank you for reading the long post. I have always been told to just deal with it. Mine is pretty okay for the most part though.", "Success  ( To bad I am not from the us", "Really do not know what to do I have been experiencing the intense urge to masturbate for the past few months now. At first I thought it was an addiction to masturbation (which I do a lot) but it jjst feels so abnormal... If i submit to the urges I orgasm and then just instantly feel like i need to go again. I have never spontaneously orgasmed and it always takes a while of masturbation to finish, but I feel like that area is constantly aroused and pulsing without any stimulation I am not turned on mentally, just physically down there..\n\nI have tried abstaining from masturbation but honestly either way it feels uncomfortable. It is gotten to a point where I am just crying every day and wishing I could just numb it or even remove it. I literally do not know how to fix it and do not see how i can move on with it.\n\nDoes this sound like PGAD? Any advice? I am having the same problem right now. How did yours start? Mine started after masturbating before going to bed at night. It is a sensation in my urethra. Not painful, but super annoying. I am a male btw.  ", "I need help/opinions I have been having for the past 2 days symptoms of PGAD. I have not been able to sleep and I have tried urination every second to try and get the feeling to go away. At first I thought it was anxiety, but today it is been constant and will not go away unless I take my mind off it. Sex has not helped and masturbation has not either. I am scared because Idk how to think about this, maybe it is just a phase or my anxiety or if this is actually something to be afraid of. Also I dont know how to start this conversation with my mom to get help since I am still only 17. Should I wait untill I am 18 and make an appointment for the doctor and wait. or should I get it checked out now if it lasts for a week. It has ruined my day and I could not sleep without melatonin because it keeps feeling stimulated. I am just scared and I need advice please!!! If you have any questions I will answer it. \n\n\nALSO -I used to get this feeling when I had bad test anxiety, or when my pants were too tight and i had what i thought were panic attacks and i have to masturabte it off ( it would usually go away after i did that then peed)  now it is back and hasnt  gone away. HELPP PLS Hey hope you are not too anxious right now.\n\nDo you find masturbating to orgasm still gives relief?\n\nI am 22F and have been dealing with this for a few years. If you want my honesty I dont think I have ever orgasmed before. I feel like I do but then I still feel unsatisfied so I feel like I have not. Not to TMI but I cant handle much it becomes so sensitive so fast. There are times I have to push my bf off or I have to stop myself because it becomes too much. Masturbation regularly or sex hasnt helped. Maybe if I try hard to orgasm it will help but I have such trouble reaching a climax idk why. I dont know if that is a symptom but I tried running to stop it or take my mind off it but it is almost impossible to run without feeling like I have to pee or yeah. I feel exactly the same thing. Cannot sleep at all until very very late. What helps me eventually at like 3 am is to put Headspace\u2019s night meditations where they tell you the story in a very calming voice. That is a good idea I mean it is already too late since it is already 8am where I am but I might use that tonight. So thank you", "Should I just let it out? (male 14) For the past 4 days its been getting worse and worse, I havn't masterbated yet, should I just let it out because this is unbearable its almost constantly there im in tears right now. Hey, man. Sorry you are having this problem. If you are a guy, you might just be experiencing prostatitis. That is how it was for me, at any rate. I only ever seemed to have symptoms after abstaining from masturbation for longer than normal. Being on a regular schedule of relieving myself, so to speak, keeps those symptoms from happening for me. That might help for you?\n\nThere is also a subreddit devoted specifically to this, r/Prostatitis. Maybe go see what they have to say? Hey, thanks for responding not many people do, but might I ask what does abstaining mean? Also i will go check out the reddit. Abstaining, as in, not masturbating. Oh ok, I am kind of worried tho because this disorder is also linked with restless leg syndrome and I tend to shift my legs ALOT because for some reasons if gives a bit of relief for a few seconds. Also not thinking about it also helps like being distracted but it is hard with ADHD. Yeah, I hear you on ADHD, it is pretty annoying. Meds help me with that.\n\nI went to a pain doctor for a while when I was dealing with this and she actually prescribed Cymbalta, which is the medicine for restless leg syndrome. So, you got cured? You feel normal now? For the most part, yeah. It is more like a thing where, if I do not practice good habits, it can flare up for a bit, then goes back down. But effectively, yeah. My life is normal and I rarely ever have any symptoms. Is it cured now? I am having the same issue same age and also male i am very worried i will have this for the rest of my life. Hey, sorry for the situation your in, I woudnt say that what I have is cured but I have gotten way way better than before. The only times I do have it is when Im thinking about which shows that this thing really just happens in the head. I talked about it with my parents, and we went to a doctor and currently right now the doctor hasnt figured out what it is. She is thinking on giving steroids because apparently she had another case like this ( burning, uncomfortable sensation around the genitals). So, talking about it really helps, and please, do not stress out as it will make the sensations way worse trust me. But i would advise that you should see a doctor, because you never know, it could be something entirely different. But, for now find out what decreases symptoms, video games helped me ALOT as well as talking with people and meditation maybe? So yeah, sorry for the long ass text, also, thanks for commenting. Thanks so much for the reply! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd just like for you video games and sports have helped me with the situation but as soon as i try to sleep this comes back and tonight i just started googling stuff and it made me so anxious and scared. No problem dude. I would actually advise against  googling too much because it just gives more unnecessary stress. Good luck you will get through this. Please make sure you take Magnesium for restless legs. There is also Magnesium spray that you can spray on your legs (I have not tried it, but have heard it is helpful)", "new to this, need some help (19m) hey everyone, im a 19 y o male who just yesterday starting having pgad symptoms. it started when i could not sleep because i kept having wild thoughts and the next morning the intense sensation of tingling pursued without me thinking abt sex.

What did the doctor say? so! the doctor told me it was stress related and gave me 10mg paroxetine (anti anxiety meds) with .5 mg klonopin. basically the 10mg takes effect after 5days and the .5 is when i need to sleep. after like 3 days i noticed a difference in my pgad. im 5 days in right now and i feel so much better. i do not even notice it anymore unless im really stressed and i still can up my dose if i need to. but overall i would really recommend trying meds because i went from staying in all day in pain crying to going outside and living life again in a matter of days.", "I think I have developed it... please help! 23 F here\n\nLast night as I was falling to sleep, my clit starting throbbing..

Cannabis infused oil might help Pelvic floor therapy/physical therapy might help. There might be a therapist in your area.

God let me die in my peace this soul cannot take the pain anymore!!!!!", "The nightmare is back again!!! ", "Does anybody have worse PGAD because of quarantine / or in certain situations (like depression, anxiety) ? Hi everyone. I am a female, 25 yrs old and going crazy this week because I am constantly masturbating and I am constantly aroused without a reason. I have had this thing all my life, basically. Arousal without a reason, and I just try to make it go with masturbation. But these episodes just come and go for me.\n\nFor example I have more of these when I am anxious or depressed. For example if I have a very bad week at work, I am constantly aroused that week. I masturbated at work before. I masturbated while I was in university, when my class had a break because I was extremely aroused at class for no reason. \n\n I never thought of it as a disorder, I always thought I was a very sexual person, that is why (I do not have much experience with having actual sex though). But during this quarantine, it god so bad that I went crazy today. I was almost going to cry. for the past week I was trying to find someone to relate, I searched everything about masturbation in google and reddit to see if other people has the same experience as me during the quarantine.\n\nToday I did not write \u2018constantly masturbating\u2019 but \u2018constantly aroused\u2019 and I saw this disorder! When I read it I was almost going to cry. It seems almost the same as what I have been going through all my life.\n\nMy question is do I really have PGAD you think? Because I do not always have it but I have week-long or month-long episodes from time to time, depending on my psychological situation. Does anybody have this? Hi :-) I do have it worse some days. And in very stressful situations I have spontaneous orgasms. \n\nI feel better after sex with my partner, I feel more satisfied, so maybe down the road that will work for you, too? Also, being penetrated (piv or toys) keeps me satisfied longer. \n\nHave you tried to resist the urge to masturbate? I never make it long without, but I noticed masturbation makes it worse for me - I just bounce back quickly to feel aroused again. Waiting a while calms it down. I have never tried it because I always thought like \u201cI want to masturbate\u201d when I have these arousals. I thought everybody has these arousals like me and it is a way for my body to say \u201cgo masturbate\u201d. But I learned now that it may not be like this at all. I am pretty sure masturbating makes it worse for me because at the beginning of the quarantine I was not masturbating because I was aroused, I started masturbating out of boredom. But now I am aroused all the time. I am going to try not masturbating for a while. Yes. For me, the more I do it, the more I want to masturbate.\n\nDoes it feel for you like you are just feeding the tiger? My orgasms come really quick as well. Over and over. It is so hard to stop when it is so easy, if you know what I mean. Yes! I never want to stop after having one orgasm. Having the first one does not relieve me. And having the next one is harder, because I feel tired, and I do not have as good orgasm as I did for the first time, so I just move onto a third one. And it is just painful at this point. Mine gets much worse during stressful times too. It is a vicious cycle because sexual stimulation becomes a disorder, a crutch *and* the solution. It does not help that the current situation also exacerbates the stress from isolation. Do you have any distractions that can keep you occupied and soak up some of your time? Pot helps me calm down. Is it legal where you are at? It is illegal but most of the young people smoke here in Turkey, but it is kind of hard to find right now because of the quarantine/lockdowns. I am at my parents\u2019 house and I usually smoked tobacco, but they do not like it so I stopped smoking. I do not actually crave cigarettes but I guess that also may trigger the symptoms.\n\nI am trying to keep myself busy most of the time, the bad thing is I like watching videos on YouTube, or TV shows, movies, and I really like reading books as well. And I cannot do any of these because these are activities that does not completely block your body. Everytime I try to read a book, I start to get aroused 10 minutes in. Even when I am totally engaged with the book and the book contains nothing sexual whatsoever.\n\nThe things that I observed that slow down / stop the arousal are usually playing video games, playing an instrument, exercising or drawing. So I try to do these. That is unfortunate that pot's illegal there. But, is not Turkey well known for their world famous hashish? At any rate, that was a suggestion that may make it better, so it is not a sure thing anyway. I hear you about watching or reading something to keep yourself busy. I like doing those too, but with one hand on my genitals to keep me from going crazy. Yes! My hands should be busy. That is why I usually choose to play games. Yeah we use hashish seeds and they are very popular but only the seeds which do not have any opiate properties lol. Seeds, huh? How interesting!!\n\nYeah, the idle hands is what gets me the most, but a low level of stimulation is part of my \"dysfunction\" to begin with. I really cannot stop myself Anxiety does make it worse.", "Feeling Hopeless - female F/29. I have finally accepted after 20 years that I have this. It started when I was around 7 or 8 and grew into really excessive masturbating and a bad porn habit. My religious family shamed me in general for touching myself at all, so it grew into anxiety and self-hate. I stopped masturbating for a few years almost entirely because of the shame I felt and was super depressed. Then I started dating and turned it into more fulfilling physical relations with men and that seemed to help. I even got married and had kids and felt normal for a while. I was too exhausted from parenting to focus on anything else. I got divorced and started seeing someone new recently and our sex is SO amazing it is like the PGAD was reawoken. We are long distance so there is constant yearning which does not help. But has anyone had this happen? Like I felt virtually no symptoms for years until now and it is seriously AWFUL. I feel like a 13 year old boy. I feel aroused constantly. Sitting, standing, no matter what. It is starting to interfere with my life. I can orgasm 20 times in a day and hate myself and still feel insatiable. I just want to be normal again and not feel this way. It is not fun, it is ruining my life and is becoming painful because of the constant touching. I have not changed any medications, I am super tired and do not have an excess of energy. I eat pretty well although am often dehydrated. But nothing has changed in my life physically. How do you handle this?! I do not feel like I can tell anyone especially as a woman. It is so awkward and is taking over my life. I feel like an embarrassed kid again. I am not a sex addict and never have been. It is just a constant sensation that will not go away for more than an hour at a time. Please help. I do not need another stressor in my life, I have SO many right now :( I feel you almost EXACTLY. It is normal for there to be off and on periods of PGAD. Perhaps your pudendal nerve is being irritated from a difference in your body\u2019s usual dealings. \nMine started when I was 13 and although it is a little different... it is one of the toughest things to handle, especially alone. It sounds like you need to see a pelvic floor physical therapist or a physiologist to talk out your problems \u2014 they will listen. Your pain should be validated, because what you go through is the hardest thing ever. \u2665\ufe0f I have had this for 30 years as a male. When I realized it was an actual condition my mind was blown. Acupuncture has helped tremendously but maybe a PT can help you Ah thank you! What do you tell the acupuncturist exactly haha Appreciate you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffchopefully an off period will resume soon I actually got refered to him from my Pelvic Floor PT so his focus is pelvic floor for both women and males and he says PGAD is basically the cause of all pelvic floor dysfunction/sexual dysfunction. I have had this so long that he has helped me tremendously but I still have a long way to go. Recently I have been looking into PRP injections to help heal the pudendal nerve. \n\nWe are in Los Angeles not sure where you are but if you have a good PT or find one they may have a acupuncturist they could refer you to especially if you are in a city", "Sudden onset of pgad 25 Male.\nI have been experiencing really weird symptoms of i  dont know what. It feels like i am moments away from orgasming the pressure is felt in the lower stomach,head of my penis.But i never ejaculate. And it is constantly there for hours. When i think about sex or anything that arouses me then the pressure gets more intense.\nAny idea what this may be? That sounds similar to what I go through but those can also be symptoms of infection as well so your best to see a doctor first It sounds like pgad, but it could be treated if it is a result of something else like prostatitis. Check with your doctor.", "\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude2d What processes and procedures did u guys have to go through  to find out what was causing your pgad I had 3 different blood tests, had a cystoscopy, CT scan, X-rays, then I got a referral to an amazing Uro/Gyno who immediately knew that my PGAD was caused by pudendal neuralgia and painful bladder syndrome, she referred me to a pelvic physical therapist who helped significantly, and now I only deal with mild symptoms around my period due to inflammation. In total it took seeing 4 different doctors, and about 4 months to get a diagnosis. \n\nHonestly the best advice I can give anyone is BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE. Do research on possible causes, if your regular dr has no idea what the cause could be, ask them to refer you out to a specialist. If that specialist does not know, ask them to refer you to someone who can help. You will find a dr who will take the time to really help if you make it evident to them that this is impacting your life in a significant way, and you only want to get rid of your symptoms. Do not go in requesting medications either. Meds are a bandaid, and PGAD is a symptom of an underlying cause, keep that in mind. Thank u my regular doctor brushed it off as hormones and anxiety and \ud83d\ude1f They typically will do that. They are general practitioner\u2019s, you go to them for colds or flu\u2019s or some infections, but PGAD is beyond their medical book training &amp; actually requires some critical thinking. They are on the same level as ER doctors, unless something is obviously wrong &amp; can be seen on blood tests/X-rays/ct scans they will throw their hands up and collect their check. \n\nI am assuming you are a female? If so, call your OB, they should be able to help you more or at least point you in the direction of someone who might be able to help. \nWhat state do you live in if you do not mind me asking? I live in Las Vegas NV and my Uro/Gyno is AMAZING UK Birmingham, maybe one day in the future I can save up for a flight and a consultation In the mean time, see if you can get a referral to a Gynecologist that can refer you to a pelvic physical therapist! If your Gyno says they have never heard of PGAD, ask them to research it and/or ask the other gyno\u2019s in their office for suggestions. \nPs the name of my OBGYN is Yarini Quezada in Las Vegas Nevada. Thanks alot for the advice my gynae sis not have a clue lol mine is a bit of an extreme case as  i have 2-3 pelvic systems included in my pgad.\n\n1 i did self exploration so i knew the triggers and where the issues were focusing on\n\n2 i called my general doctor and neurologist and set up visits and was reffered to a urologist since mine is pressure and muscle based with nerve path extras instead of fully nerve.\n\n3 urologist sent me to a physical therapist that worked with me till it was more maintaining balance rather than progress. (about a year for me).\n\n4 i went back to urologist as i was still not fully under control.\n\n5 was send to a spine specialist and had mri of lower spine to check for anomalies. none were found.\n\n6 spine specialist sent me to a pain specialist who got me on a better short term muscle relaxer and nerve blocks. between the physical therapist, muscle relaxer, and nerve blocks i have made headway towards far more time between pgad symptoms onset times. this has given my pelvic region time to recover and slowly is making my pgad much much calmer when i do have to deal with it.\n\noverall you need to figure out what direction you want to take treatments. base ground you 100% need to research pelvic floor exercises to help the pelvic pressure this horrible condition causes. also work on lowering anxiety as its a huge pgad trigger. you may want to mention RGS (restless genital syndrome) a close cousin to pgad. Also mention PSAS (persistant sexual arousal syndrome. its original name) this is the term places outside the USA are more familiar with. sadly you may need to shop around till you find a specialist that is familiar with this disorder...... not all practitioners stay caught up to new rare disease information. i hope you find something that helps though. Thank u soo much I will definitely take the advice on board:) keeping anxiety and stress levels at bay is the hardest for me since I am student I am constantly stressed and panicky:( Thank u soo much I am still on the lookout for someone around me since my gynae is extremely inconsiderate and rude.", "Ugh Nothing new to add, im just having a bad day\n\nIf you are also having a bad day say hi Hi! I just drove for 5 hours and I am suffering. I dont even remember the last time I rode in any transport", "Possible PGAD I have been having symptoms similar to when I stimulate the clitoris in my vaginal canal and down my left leg. Doctors are so dismissive about it telling me to just relax and that it is just in my head. I am so miserable bc I am only 25 and cannot imagine living anymore like this. It is ruining my days and I cannot sleep sometimes. Help plzzz \ud83d\ude2d Dm me", "Weird feeling after pooping This started for me yesterday as I was pooping, when I was done I felt a weird feeling around my rectum and penis, now whenever I touch my penis there is like a sexual sensation, am I able to do anything? It literally happened right after I pooped is there anything I can do?", "Prozac Has Any female had any luck wid prozac/fluoxetine? Or any similar SSRI I have been hammered time and time again for recommending the Facebbok forums, but have you ever been to any of the Facebook PGAD forums?", "SNRI So I am aware that there is some proof that some SSRIs can cause or worsen PGAD, but is it the same for SNRIs? I have been prescribed a painkiller called IXPRIM which contains tramadol which is supposed to have SNRI effects, will this worsen my symptoms? What proof is out there that they worsen pgad? How does that make sense I did some research, abruptly stopping use of SSRIs has seen to cause this in some people Do you know if it is possible for meds to make it worse if they did not make it worse in the past? Also can it get worse after taking it for only one day. I honestly have no idea everyone is different :/ I have been prescribed them for pain so idk whether to take them or not I get scared whenever I take meds just because of\n the stories I have heard Me too, but they help me feel better so I am quite torn, trying to only use when necessary maybe once a day I doubt taking a few on a low dose will do anything to us honestly! I would say it is more if you have been on a high does for a long long time and stop them abruptly without weaning off then it may cause problems but taking them here and there will not do harm I doubt SSRI\u2019s and SNRIS can sometimes cause it \u2014 I think it is in relation to affect on Serotonin and Dopamine and actually blood flow/vascular stuff. I am on an SNRI, and I think my is related to neuropathy/muscular tension which my SNRI is off label used for nerve pain. I think it helps downregulate those signals. Ok I see, do you have PGAD and use the snri to help? I feel like my symptoms got worse after I took it for only three day.  But I do not know if that is possible. Anyways I wish you the best.", "Sleep Does anyone have advice for sleeping during a flare? It is hard to lay down and relax when all I can concentrate on is that horrible sensation. If anyone has any helpful tips, I would very much appreciate it. i try to watch a show to distract myself while falling asleep also sometimes i put a washcloth with some ice on it in my underwear to numb while i sleep. idk how healthy that is tho Um I have some really bad advice, I just stay up super late and pass out whenever I am exhausted :/ But when I am in a more mentally healthy mood I use the Sleepcasts (basically like bedtime stories for adults, sort of ASMR ish) on Headspace app. Definitely helps distract. I listen to subliminals sometimes too, I do not know if they 'really work' but if not then there is still the placebo effect Ice pack in cloth helps me. No matter what, I do not touch it. I put something mindless on TV and use EFT tapping to deal with anxiety. That helps me get some sleep.", "Has PGAD Affected Your Ability to Live A Normal Life? I am curious to know how the PGAD whether you have been officially diagnosed or not with it has affected the way you live your life?  Feel free to share any information you so desire. I have been \"officially\" diagnosed as being a sex addict because of it, but it does not fit all the usual symptoms. With the exception of my current wife, none of my past partners truly understood what was going on. I could have sex for hours and a few minutes after we are done still be hungry for more. I have been officially diagnosed with hypertensive pelvic floor syndrome. It causes tight muscles and muscle spasms along all areas of my pudendal nerve. I had only recognized symptoms last November but previous to that has a pretty bad drinking problem so who knows. I am starting to learn more about what triggers it and when. Mine flares up for an unknown amount of time and then goes away. My urogynecoligst prescribed a low dose of muscle relaxers that help a little and orgasming helps for a while, I tell the Dr. It is kind of like a tums for heart burn. I am logging my trifecta of urinary, rectocele, and pgad and I am starting to find the PGAD is correlating with when I would be on my period. I have an IUD so I do not always bleed but I get cramping. The cramping causes muscle spasms that I think are pushing on that part of the nerve; however after the cramping is gone the PHAD persists. Things I have found that help include:\n\n1. Do not put yourself in a mental battle. The more you think about it the worse it gets, kind of like anxiety and panic attacks. Find something else to think about.\n2. I have read so much about how this can impact people's sex drive and mental being. Do not let that happen! Their are shots, suppositories, creams, and muscle relaxers put there that will help. I know this sounds really odd and maybe TMI but me and my boyfriend have tried to make a little fun out of it. It is the only time I can have multiple orgasms - they are not as strong, but yeah.\n3. Sitting for long periods of time can cause a flare up on its own. Walk around, sit on an exercise ball, stand or sit on a pillow. I have found that bouncing around helps and gets me some exercise.\n4. If you do have panic attacks and are prescribed medication, that medication helps a little too. \n5. Suspension - sitting on the toilet and just letting it relax, not holding any pee back not using any muscles just sitting there\n6. Massaging - I have yet to get a PT appointment but it will be coming soon and there will be a lot they are doing with my pelvic wall. It is that time of the month right now and so mine has flared with vengeance. Again, maybe TMI but my vagina has never felt better - last night I told my boyfriend to just play around down there. Not for arousal but just to see how it felt. He started gently rubbing the inner parts of my inner labia and I told him to just keep doing what he was doing and I almost fell asleep!!!! It was like an immediate relief and so relaxing. I would assume one could figure a way to do this on their own or with a partner \ud83d\ude1c. \n7. Oh my gosh I almost forgot! The answer to should I put on looser pants or underwear is ALWAYS yes, yes you should. \n8. When that feeling of frustration comes on (that one you have where it feels like someone is holding you down and you want so badly to get up) get up and run or do jumping jacks. That is a mental feeling in reaction to the PGAD so releasing some of that frustration will help. \n\nAnyway, new at it too but that is what I have found so far. There is also a really good Facebook group with a lot of followers that give all kinds of advice. PGAD is a symptom of a lot of different things so maybe someone on there has the same problem as you that is causing your PGAD and lead to more answers. \n5. This is awful! I had a doctor tell me I need to see a therapist for sexual disorder - turns out I already had a psychiatrist so I called him. He happened to have a patient that suffered from PGAD and referred me to her urogynecoligist. He is so excited because he gets all the reports back and you know doctors, it is intriguing him to learn more. This urogynecologist is a man but he is amazing and knows what it is like. I did not even know urogynecoligsts exist! If you did not either I would try searching in your area for one - they should be able to put you on the right path. And come join the PGAD Facebook support group! So much more information you will love to have! So many others that completely understand - even some who have rid themselves of it. &gt; This is awful! I had a doctor tell me I need to see a therapist for sexual disorder - turns out I already had a psychiatrist so I called him.\n\nThe verification from a professional is validating, but does not help much in fixing. My ex-wife's therapist diagnosed me and referred me to another therapist who specialized in it and she too diagnosed the same thing. Did not do a thing, physically, but emotionally it was a bit helpful.\n\n&gt; I did not even know urogynecoligsts exist! If you did not either I would try searching in your area for one - they should be able to put you on the right path.\n\nSorry, I was not specific, but I am male (54) and doubt a gyno would see me :)  FWIW, my endocrinologist knows my condition but when I asked him, his only reply was \"Lucky\". That was not helpful at all\n\n&gt; And come join the PGAD Facebook support group! \n\nI belong to two in Facebook, which one are you on? PGAD Support- yes that is a frustrating response when you hear it from someone in the medical industry. Of course, I get - that is so hot, you have to sneak off and go do that? &gt; that is so hot, you have to sneak off and go do that?\n\nYou mean masturbate? I actually do it the entire day. Back before the Q I would hide it by seeming to adjust myself (&amp; other clandestine self stimulating techniques). Now that I work from home, I am just stroking myself continuously Mine is just an urge the feeling of needing to like an electrical wave going through my clit. Masturbating helps some, but most often I have to work around it. Yes, similar. Mine is a buzzing around my penis and radiating to my toes. Have you tried cannabis oil? I have great luck with that.\n\nAlso, would you mind if I messaged you the Facebook groups I belong to in case it is different from yours? This is an amazing post!\n\n&gt; Suspension - sitting on the toilet and just letting it relax, not holding any pee back not using any muscles just sitting there\n\nI have noticed this too. Using a bidet helps here too. I aim the cold stream right behind my testicles (at my perineum? prostate?) and it calms everything down there for me.\n\nAs far as massaging is concerned, look up \"yoni massage\" and have your boyfriend study it. I am not sure if it will help, but it is worth a shot.\n\nAlso, the cannabis oil I wrote about earlier can help with the cramps you mentioned. Externally and internally Not at all! Love all the help and advice. I am a regular cannabis user but I have not tried oil. Check your inbox, I sent you the links.\n\nIf you live in a legal state, your dispensary should have cannabis lube or cannabis massage oil you can use as lube. Just be aware that some massage oils might have additional arnica that may not be so vag friendly. Even if it had arnica, apply it externally where your cramps are and it should help Thanks a lot! You are welcome. Were those the groups you belong to as well? No. Do they get a lot of trolls? I cannot figure out how to get the link, it might be because of how private they are. There are a lot of questions and you have an interview with a moderator before being let in. They do this because well, you know. Anyway you can find it by searching PGAD Support. Today is the last day to participate in the Olive Study, trying to learn more about pgad and ways to cure/calm it if you wanted to do that too. You get amazon gift cards. It is a great group probably 200 some people all over the world. They are pretty good about banning trolls, so I think you are safe. These two groups are also by invite only, so that too is another safety feature\n\nI tried doing that search and only come up with those 2 groups I sent you. That is ok, I will probably come across them eventually being a person that suffers from nerve and muscle components to my Pgad i can totally sympathize with what you said. not many people are able to separate sources of what is causing the discomfort. i hope your experiments for relief work \\^\\_\\^\n\nAnd yeah i do agree that a muscle relaxer is exactly like using a tums LOL since it just delays the reaction but never fully stops it. Unlike many others i got diagnosed with pgad from the start so that has helped my treatment plan greatly. For me it has very much limited my desire to have any sexual partner. It has also made me feel guilty when i am experiencing symptoms in public as i am not very good at hiding discomfort. Thankfully i had a more open minded urologist diagnosing me when i explained what was going on. Which was a major relief since male sufferers are not generally diagnosed well. It has been a rather rough last year and a half but we finally got my discomfort as low as we can get it. My pgad still sucks but is at upper low strength now versus when it started and it was a maximum strength. &gt;maybe TMI but me and my boyfriend have tried to make a little fun out of it. It is the only time I can have multiple orgasms -\n\nHope you do not mind me asking, but is it like suddenly you can have dozens of orgasms easily? Or just a few more than normal? Well, he can only go so long so I suppose 3 in maybe 45 min is all I have hit \ud83d\ude02. Hope that helps? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I can say though, this does not work if you flare up is really bad and effecting other areas of the pudendal nerve. PGAD is caused by so many different things and I do not know anything about yours. Obviously if sex is going to be painful I would not opt for this method. Haha thanks for answering! Makes total sense! Mines a bit different. Mine was triggered by taking Wellbutrin. And it is more of a sky high libido thing, suddenly feeling ready 24/7. Cannot ever seem to feel like ive had enough. That plus lockdown has not been a healthy combo....\ud83d\ude2c Ahhhhh...No, mine is not being aroused, I can turn it into that if I want/have to but it is like a constant urge or feeling you are on the brink of orgasm with absolutely no arousal at all. It started before COVID and I would have to sneak to my car at work just to try and get it to go away. I thought it was my wellbutrin too. That has been ruled out thankfully because I am not sure I could cope without it. It comes and goes when it wants, along with other symptoms. Sometimes it can be quite maddening. I have been living with it for about two years. It is daily, and almost constant. It has absolutely affected my daily life. Mostly I find it sometimes hard to concentrate. I call it my body \u201cbeing loud\u201d\u2014sometimes it drowns out everything else and I cannot sit still? I cannot concentrate, and before COVID sometimes working in an office got unbearable at times. But over time I have learned to suppress/ignore it, mostly with distraction. I find it is worse when there is nothing to take my mind off it, so interacting with others, listening to music, watching films, anything to keep a constant buzz of stimulation in my other senses helps drown it out. But not always, and some days are worse than others. I mostly resent how much time it steals from me. \n\nIt does seem to increase with stress and anxiety, which can be a vicious feedback loop. \n\nI come here from time to time also looking for answers. I tried a few drugs from my doctor early on, and there was no effect. I did not want to keep pushing on the medical issues, I would rather just live with it than be a guinea pig when I know there is no cure. \n\nSome days I despair that this might be my life forever. Some days I am actually glad that it made me deal with my sexuality\u2014before, I was not very interested. I had times where I wondered if I would be fine if I just never had sex again, since my drive felt low. Now I feel more alive? But I cannot stand the lack of control. \n\nI see so much worry and fear here, and I share that, at the same time after two years I feel if the rest of my life were not super stressful, I could manage. I do wonder what I would do if I were not older and have been in a committed relationship, as sometimes the pgad drives me out of my mind, and I could see how a young person might be driven to make risky choices. \n\nThis is an awful condition but it is survivable. Please keep posting strategies for how to deal with it. Every so often I see a glimmer of hope here. Keep going. Has anyone heard or been to San Diego Sexual Medicine? Dr. Goldstein and his team including the neurosurgeon Dr. Choll Kim, urology fellow, NPs, physical therapists and sex therapists are very skilled and take a very systematic, multidisciplinary and compassionate approach in treating patients with PGAD and many other sexual disorder.

I am 15. I cannot do this if I have it. I might be overreacting.

PGAD gets worse with anxiety - stay calm, seek distractions and find help from a doctor who specializes in PGAD. Please please call the suicide hotline if you are feeling suicidal. You are going to be ok! Hey, okay, breathe. It is okay I promise. The more you panic and overthink it, the more your brain will amplify the physical sensations. It could be a thousand different things... and there is nothing to be ashamed about. The most important thing is that you know your life is worth living and to not do anything dangerous right now that you will end up regretting. Like I said, it could be many different things: sex drive kicking in (for me it started happening when I was 17, I never masturbated or did anything sexual before that and then when I started I had a few months where I felt like I could not stop), hormonal imbalance, nerve damage that can be fixed... you will not know unless you see a doctor if you are concerned. And there is no shame in seeing a doctor, they visit all kinds of patient with FAR FAR worst things than this EVERY DAY. Monitor your health, it is your life and it is incredibly important to take care of yourself. And even for PGAD, there are treatments and solutions if you seek help and ended up finding out that is what it happening. Some people have no symptoms at all once they start treatment and others live a practically normal life with minor symptoms showing up on rare occasions.  \nIt sounds like you are having different kinds of health issues (eating disorders...) so I think your state of mind could be eased if you seek psychological help as well as physical health. I know from experience (I have had eating disorders for 5 years, but I have now fully recovered--it is possible, and SO SO WORTH IT, and have been healthy for 3 years) that EDs drag you down into depression and suicidal thoughts making you think you are not worth it. LIES!!! please do not believe it, it is a mean little voice feeding you lies for self destruction, but you have the power to take care of yourself and deal with whatever underlying issue is causing your anorexia, and to get out healthily of whatever situation is bothering you right now.

First of all, you came to this website to speak to like-minded beings, congrats on that important step! I know how hard it can be, searching for answers on the web because you feel nervous to describe your symptoms to anyone else. I have totally been there. It actually took me until this past December to bring up my own struggles with PGAD. I am a 27 year old female and I have suffered the symptoms of PGAD since I was 19. It is a very odd thing to struggle with but I do not believe you are overreacting.\r  \n\r  \nI suggest beginning a journal and recording when the symptoms happen for you. And then bringing it up with a doctor whom you trust. I find myself flustered when discussing my clitoris and masturbation habits with a doctor, I believe that is just a natural feeling. But there is nobody more on your side than your doctor. I know you are 15 and do not need this added stress but just think how AMAZING you will feel once you validate for your body and seek answers to your questions! I know my mind set has changed ever since I opened up to my doctor about my PGAD. I believe in you so much! Do it scared, make that doctors appointment, you got this! And hell, I got this too!!! \r  \n\r  \n\\~K Not true at all. PGAD is like tinnitus. Sometimes it is really quiet, and you can only hear it in a VERY quiet space. And sometimes when it flares, it is very overwhelming. There is also an in-between. You can take your mind off of it when your up and doing things, but it gets worse at night when trying to be still. There can also be physical reasons for this, such as blood flow when your up vrs laying down. If it is an arousal sensation, but is unwanted and unpleasant, it is PGAD.", "Test Test", "Do I have PGAD? I have had this weird itch in and around my vagina and it got worse with stress. It went away after I took some antibiotics and antifungals. It happened again and this time I took antibiotics for UTI and antifungals and got a vaginal swab which came back negative. I feel the itch worsen when I have a full bladder and when I stretch my foot I can feel a vibration in my vagina (left side mostly), my whole left leg feels \u201citchy\u201d too...is this PGAD or anxiety or nerve issues what exactly is happening? Sounds like it is probably a nerve issue, but not really PGAD. See your doctor, but stretching exercises focusing on the lower back and pelvic floor might help you alleviate it. My doctor just dismissed it and told me I am just stressing myself too much and need to chill lol but maybe I will do some pelvic floor exercises Got To love it when doctors apply absolutely none of their education to treating their patients. Ugh totally agree lol", "Some of you got PGAD since they are a child? (sorry in advance for the English mistakes, French is my mother tongue)\n\nHello,\n\nI discovered the PGAD appellation quite recently. I never made researches about it, since I got this vagina stimulations (mostly pulsations and intense lubrification and small unwanted orgasms) litteraly all my life and almost continuously. I would not say it is unbearable but I always had problem to concentrate because of it and when I have some crisis it is very intense and I feel the urge to masturbate to calm the feeling (which does not work). But almost every fucking second my mind is down there cause my vagina never leave me in peace... \n\nFrom what I read, most of you developed it at one point of their life? Did some of you got PGAD for all their life?\n\nI never got diagnosed so maybe I am wrong and what I have is something else but I read a lot about it since I discovered this appellation and everything fit with what I feel. And it actually feel strange and nice to see that I am not alone. I have had it all my life and did not realize it was not normal until high school Ho okay thanks for your answer! How do you live with it, is it a major problem in your life or more a kind of background problem? It is a background problem when I am single. I am constantly \"adjusting\" myself and fidgeting so I can relieve the tingling. It is a major issue when I am in a relationship Same.

Interesting read.  I was previously prescribed Zolpidem for insomnia and to see it listed as a possible PGAD treatment gives me hope, especially since I am most susceptible at night or drowsy. I tried 2.5 Mg of Zolpidem last night, unfortunately, it was after I was already awakened by particularly intense physical feelings.  The Zolpidem allowed me to sleep quietly for the rest of the night without awaking up to my body feeling like an earthquake.  It felt really good.  Tonight I will take a pill an hour before bedtime and keep my fingers crossed Zolpidem is helpful in not having sleep orgasms.", "HELP PLEASEE How do I start up a conversation with my mom about getting help.

I am having another flare up because of life stressors so I am debating Lyrica. I do not know if it would help however it is all around a bad drug. Had a family member on it for years for fibromyalgia and it comes with serious side effects Serious side effects like did it cause him pgad or what because there nothing worst in the world than  this side effect!!! I doubt physical therapy would work for me because I do not have an injury or back problems!!!! I do not think your head twitching, seizures and weight gain is as bad as PGAD \nI would rather not being able to sit comfortably masturbating daily then a seizure. I had one when I was a child and I still have flash backs about it to this day I do not have an injury or back problems either. the physical therapy is for your pelvic floor, which can tense up for any number of reasons, including trauma and psychological reasons. The nerves involved in PGAD are in the pelvic through and up through the back of your sacrum- so sometimes it is lower back stuff and sometimes it is the pelvic floor.", "How do I sleep with this?

The throbbing sensation will not stop and Ive tried multiple times to relive this feeling. FWIW, I have the throbbing and tingling 24/7 (but no priapism). If yours started from getting high, give it dinner time and ot should go away on its own. I have gotten used to mine, but it is still irritating How much?  I need to be careful combining  any THC with my PGAD.  It is a total body orgasmic high that lasts a really long time;) My hormones and being horny comes and goes, but my PGAD has a mind of its own.\n\nBtw, I usually find my internal clock resets after a good nights sleep and then wondering if today I will be more in control, which seems to be the trend.  Yay me! FWIW, when I take a 30mg pot edible, I get a very slight case of priapism for around 3 to 4 hours. The erection actually kills my biggest PGAD symptom which is a constant buzzing around my penis/testicles. It is substituting a frustrating nightmare with much more pleasant nightmare.", "I think I have PGAD I have ADHD and RLS (the later correlates in a fairly robust way with PGAD) and masturbate several times per day on average. It is not that I am constantly aroused, let alone having an erection, but more of me sensing a peculiar setension, restlessness, need for discharge, which briefly vanishes or loses power in the aftermath or me orgasming. It is been like that for more than a decade and I literally hate it. Is this PGAD or merely masturbation addiction? go see a doctor but it could be pgad honestly i had the same sensations I will do so ASAP. Have you managed to treat your symptoms? yea well my doctor told me my anxiety was the cause of my pgad and i started taking anti anxiety meds and 2 days after i noticed a difference. im now 7-8 days in and have 0 pgad. Great! I hope I will achieve the same!  this is so interesting because I was literally JUST thinking about how I wonder if it is correlated with my ADHD in some way. I also think I have RLS but the RLS community said I do not because I experience it during the day too. Like not just at night. Idk, I still think I have it. It is all the symptoms of RLS but just all the time, not just at night. I think it might be the ADHD partially because I do feel like that constant feeling of tension and need for release is caused by ADHD. I always thought ADHD is probably the reason I feel the need to crack my knuckles constantly and bounce my legs too.", "Anyone else have L5 S1 or and disc problem too? I have symptoms of arousal and I have had them for over a year. Physical therapy and medication has helped me, but I am prepared to do more for my issue. Had anyone on here very tried surgery on a potential issue or nerve blocks? If so what were your results? I am going to have a nerve block done here in December and I will post my results. Also please comment if you have some sort of spinal issue, I am very curious. My ex-girlfriend has suffered for years with what were initially bladder pain issues including bladder pressure and pain during urination. She was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, however, more recently those symptoms morphed into PGAD-like symptoms and she was given an MRI which showed an annular tear at L5-S1. She had surgery on this tear which did not end her symptoms, but she recently learned through another MRI that the tear had reopened, likely from an event that came only a week after the initial surgery. All this to say, it is unclear whether or not the surgery would have successfully ended her symptoms, and she is going in to have it repaired again. There is a significant lack of certainty among her doctors that this tear could be the cause of her symptoms. She has had pudendal and caudal nerve blocks, with mixed results. That said, it is the only thing physically wrong with her spinal column according to the MRI, and there are a number of doctors that have specialized in connecting this specific injury with PGAD symptoms. She is in constant communication with these doctors, and of course it is their opinion that the reopened tear is the reason she has not improved.\n\nI know that is not very helpful, but I at least wanted to shed light on the fact that this is a connection that was made by doctors in her case (i.e. an annular tear at L5-S1 causing her symptoms). I would presume you have had an MRI to confirm you have an issue at L5-S1 and to rule out Tarlov cysts, which can result from such a tear. If not I would consider doing so. However, I say that without any real evidence that this is the cause of her issues. We will see when she has the tear repaired again and allows it to heal. Healing from these procedures can take upwards of a year, as the nerves that were irritated by the leaking fluid have to recover (at least this is how her doctors explained it). FWIW her nurse also had this exact same issue, and had the exact same repair done to L5-S1 and it resulted in complete elimination of her symptoms after a year. Again, I hope this was at least somewhat helpful, and I wish you the absolute best luck. Thank you for this comment. The fact that the nurse had PGAD and had a complete recovery of symptoms is actually really good news for your girlfriend, that nurse, and I. My symptoms are technically PGAD like (sexual sensation in my pelvic floor, penis, and anus, with back pain.) so I am a little more optimistic now. I have been told that the back fluid from L5 S1 injuries can flare up symptoms. I had an MRI to confirm I indeed have a tear. I also just got in a car wreck that increased my back pain which also increased my symptoms. Presumably I made the tear larger and there is possibly more fluid leaking. This is my guess. If you do not mind me asking because I am trying to help myself and I am actually working with a surgeon who has never heard of PGAD, could I know the doctor that you have been communicating with that has been the most helpful or informative about this issue? I am a male by the way. Haha, I gathered that when you mentioned \"penis.\" They are Dr. Goldstein and Dr. Kim at San Diego Sexual Medicine. I really feel bad getting your hopes up, that was always a major issue for my ex whenever a new doctor would come along claiming to know what was wrong. Again, we unfortunately have no evidence that this is her issue, but like I said, those doctors believe so and have published peer reviewed articles on this connection. Again, my best to you man, I do not know first hand, but certainly do know second hand how disruptive and awful these symptoms can be. Yeah I appreciate it. In your personal opinion then do you think that nurse was being honest or trying to sell something to you and your partner? I 100% believe she was being honest, but I am not a doctor, and I do not know if her recovery might have been related to something else that was conflated with the procedure, or if it actually helped. It concerns me greatly that this field is not more thoroughly understood (and therefore more thoroughly scrutinized) among medical professionals. It feels to me very much like the wild west or something, where you really have to be careful since the ordinary safeguards that would accompany well developed medical science/theory are not there. Well to be honest, I have talked with Dr. Goldstein before and I was a bit intimidated by him. That is actually how I found out about my disc tear. I honestly did not know if I should believe him or not or if I was going to become a puppet of medical experimentation from him. I am not sure whether or not he has actually healed someone with this surgically, so I was cautious. If this surgery does not heal your partner do you see yourself having any further steps? Nothing beyond medication and pelvic floor pt. I would be curious if you can find a doctor outside of goldstein that would make this connection. There is a non-MD professor at Rutgers who discovered Tarlov cysts that she is also in communication with, Dr. Komisaruk, who also believes in this connection, but unsurprisingly, he is also associated with Dr. Goldstein. I honestly have no clue what is going on, I hope they are correct. I do not at all get the sense that any of these doctors are unscrupulous, but what the hell do I know. Of course, she has outside doctors, specifically neurologists that are by necessity included in all of this, and they are the ones that are skeptical but do not out of hand dismiss that this is what is causing her issues. Hmmm interesting to hear that. I think your girlfriend should remain optimistic, if she has encountered someone with the same issue and had it fixed. Maybe it is just the slow heal and making sure her back is okay is what it takes. Maybe the surgery will partially heal it and then PT could manage her symptoms really well\u2026 Yes, I really really hope so. I will provide you an update in the coming months following her procedure, which is not yet scheduled, to see if anything has changed. Again, could take a while to heal, but I will let you know if anything happens.  Sounds good to me! And just to let you know I am getting a hypo gastric nerve block in L5, by a surgeon who wants to calm down my sympathetic nervous system. I will let you know if that works at all Actually one last thing I wanted to ask. Did they inject anything into her disc, like an anesthetic or something? No, I do not think she ever had anything injected into the disc itself. She has had nerve blocks for diagnostic purposes. Okay that is interesting. This is also a thought I had too. I was thinking of getting the nerve block but on top of that getting prp and stem cell done for the disc to help with nerve repair. A doctor had recommended that. That combination may be powerful. Ask around and see if that could be a viable option too. I will voice anything that helps me Thank you, I would really appreciate if we could stay in touch on any developments in yours or her cases since they seem very similar. Good luck man. For sure. Good luck to you and your girlfriend! No way my wife has an annular tear at L5-S1 and has recently developed PGAD as well. She has a genetic degenerative spine condition. Anyway, she has a consultation with Dr. Goldstein in a few weeks. I am hoping we do not have to blow all of our savings to get treatment\u2026 I am sorry to hear that. It seems like there is fluid leaking from our backs that can cause these symptoms. I highly recommend doing pelvic floor therapy first cause that really helped me for like a year, until I got into this car wreck\u2026 Also do you know if anything triggered the PGAD? Like I had an annular tear already, but I masturbated and the feelings of pleasure did not leave after that\u2026 it was kind of an abrupt start. We have no idea what triggered it. It started with some sexual dysfunction that slowly got worse over time. Let us keep in touch though if we find anything that works Interesting, so did you already have back issues before the wreck? Like what came first, PGAD or back issues? Yeah man. I think there is some real possible solutions. From what I understand this is basically sciatica of the genitals for people with PGAD of this nature and not causes by SSRI\u2019s. If you are unaware of sciatica is comes from the back and causes shooting pain to the knee or even the foot and it is super painful. Sciatica can be put into full remission with treatment, meaning it can be helped immensely tot he point it is unnoticed. PGAD just is not recognized enough to be treated effectively, but if we communicate and talk about what helps or what heals, we can seriously kick this things ass. I will keep you updated about the various routes I will be taking. We will beat this shit. So I played a lot of sports, did a lot of lifting, so I had general lower back pain from likely lifting too heavy. I just thought lower back pain was normal tho. During covid season I was at he one time and decided to masturbate. For some reason tho when I finished those feeling of pleasure kind of lingered and did not go away. So the back issues did come first, but they did not really have an effect on my life.", "my story as a male with pgad, just cant take it anymore  \n\nHi,\n\n23 male. it has interfered with all aspects of my life. during corona it got worse and made me drop out of uni. i was studying abroad in UK and was in the last year of my course. the reason for it being worse during corona is that i lost my social life. if im out there being with friends and living a normal and fun life it goes away but ones im alone for too long it comes back and haunts me. i couldnt live alone so i had to go back to my country to seek help. almost no doctor has heard of it. they dont know how to treat it. nothing works. i can only manage to control the symptoms. triggers for me is stress or feeling bad or feeling lonley. for example if i have a bad day for what ever reason, i might get pgad activated for the next day. but here is the catch now cus of the pgad on the second day i feel horrible and that itself triggers the pgad for the next day. and it fuckin goes on. like a small fire in a massive dry jungle. it might stop at some point. ones it isnt there i have to do my best not to think about it and be scared about it otherwise the same cycle initiates ones again. i have to avoid anything that stresses me. i have to stay super active during the day and do anything that convinces me that i made a good use of my time or day today or els the pgad starts the same day or next day. i was thinking about finishing my course but cus i had to suddenly come back to my country i am now above the age of 18 and in my country if you are above the age of 18 you cant leave the country unless you attend the military for 2 years. which is a lot of stress. i cant convince the doctors in the militery that i have this condition and i cant do my duty cus there isnt a way of me proving that i have this and not faking it. for past days i have had really bad episodes of pgad. no one has a cure for it. im alone. i can only think about ending my life. that is the only relief i can think of. no one should ever live like me. the prolonged orgasm feeling makes me feel dizzy all the time. im miserable. even my parents who happen to be surgeons dont understand me and are busy doing their work. i have no one to turn to. im stuck in my country. and i know no one can actually help me. i guess millions of people die every year and im sure they didnt want to. i have to be one of them. thanks for reading this much. \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

I am so sorry you are dealing with this. If you are feeling suicidal and need someone to talk to, feel free to message me. I am a mental health worker and while I do not have all the answers I am definitely here if you need support. Hi! I am sorry you are going through this. Covid made the situation worse for a lot of people, but if you know social life helps you, hang in there, because this will get better. I understand it is so frustrating that doctors do not understand this condition, but do not give up trying to find a solution. You may not find a cure (or maybe you will), but you will find strategies to make it better. And there will be better times. I feel like it is a wave, sometimes things come back all of a sudden and get really bad, but I try to remember the moments when things are better. Also, work on not judging yourself. It is ok if you did not do anything yesterday because you had a flare-up, it can happen, it is not your fault. If you can, find a therapist, they can help you through the difficult times. Hello, I would like to be your friend and have a personal conversation with you about this. I am 24 with PGAD symptoms. Dm me. No suicide Hotline can help with this type of situation well it wont fix it but if you are at the point \"suicide is a great option\" you really need to talk to someone. this disorder is highly emotionally disruptive. it is listed as a pain disorder as it is badly misfiring nerves. it is just the how that is different from person to person and too much pleasure can equal pain eventually even if it feels good. unfortunately treatments for this issue varies from person to person.\n\nhere is a list of what most people have to sort through.\n\nstep 1. find your triggers. stress is a high trigger for most people with this disorder. so you have to find what can break your stress cycle reliably. cortisol tends to piss off pain disorders and PGAD is a pain disorder.\n\nstep 2. find a good therapist that is willing to learn about PGAD. they can help you process the highly emotional state that it continuously presses onto you.\n\nstep 3. i can list what are common methods from easiest budget to most expensive (i know this will vary from country to country since health care is different everywhere).\n\nMedication. this can be medication to help regulate stress on down to managing depression. always be aware of your body. if a medication is making it worse after a reasonable amount of time on it, let your doctor know as you may need to try several things. you also may need anti inflammatory medication as a treatment.\n\nPhysical Therapy. a lot of sufferers end up in this option. getting your pelvic floor strengthened and pelvic pressure released can do a lot to bring down symptoms. find a physical therapist that specializes on pelvic floor therapy. this will also include ideally working on the abdomen muscles (especially where your stomach joins your pelvis) and your inner/outer thigh muscles. these will help prevent abdomen/leg stress leaking into your pelvis.\n\nSpine Scan and Pain Management. you may eventually have to get a spine scan to see if damage or cysts are the cause. also you may need to have nerve blocks done a few times a year as an extreme option if not much else works.\n\nUrologist. unfortunately you will probably have to find an open minded urologist. men have 2 separate nerve nexus points that PGAD can affect. 1 being the penis itself (pain/pleasure. hard/soft) and prostate (high sensitivity to your perineum between your penis and your anus). as well as discomfort around your bladder (your prostate connects to this nerve network). they will probably run tests to check for prostatitis as that can be a cause for genital nerve misfiring. that is the reason you need a open minded urologist because you will need someone willing to to explore pgad being a cause and not just an undetectable infection if prostatitis isnt the cause. your urologist will have to refer you to other areas like physical therapy, pain management, or spine checks.\n\nabove all dont give up. this is unfortunately uncurable BUT it is treatable. you will find that this condition has no easy way to explain or talk about so be prepared to blush an absolute ton. be aware that for some masturbation  relieves symptoms while in others it can further aggravate them. so you will need to do a bit of self discovery to know your physical limits.\n\ni have to go through pain shots and PT to keep my PGAD in check. mine is a muscle and nerve combination so its on the harder side to treat. it is prostate focused with secondary sensations in penis, pretty extreme pelvic tension, and my muscles feed into my nerve sensations which loop back to my muscles tightening them leading to more nerve when it is uncontrolled by treatment. thankfully i dont have constant ejaculation/ hardness issues but many men do so dont feel bad if you need to constantly keep tissues in your undies to prevent fluid leakage. Yes I understand it is important to talk to someone but in reality the hotline people cannot relate and also do not show compassion. They just try to get you to think rationally when it might not be possible for you in that moment. Talking to someone who is important to you is a better option. Mine is almost exclusively nerve related (saw an excellent pelvic floor therapist, did a thorough 10 week treatment routine, did not help - was told my muscles are not even hypertonic).  If I wanted to go for neuromodulation/nerve blocks, specifically, which nerves do you think I ought to target? it all depends on where your nerves are causing the issues. the most common is the pudendal nerve block as that hits the the genitals and the perineum area between genitals and anus.i have an uncommon one which is due to a nerve on my front that feeds into my pelvis that feels like a firecracker went off on my left side and extends on down into my genitals. so for me i have 2 nerve block locations. the left front nerve block and the pudendal right nerve block. everyone is different though.\n\nyou will probably want to see a neurologist/urologist to get referred to get a mri to see if there is a more tangible spine/sacrum issue that is causing the pgad symptoms.\n\nwhen you go to your pain specialist they will work out with you what nerves are causing the issue. you might have a couple of wonky first injections while they find the specifics of what nerve bundles are causing the issues. be honest and open with them so they can quickly work out what ones to target. patience is needed as it can take a couple of injection terms to fully work it out. it took 2 sessions for half fulfillment and on the 3rd one we found the second site that (as much as it can) calms down my PGAD for example.\n\nedits for clean up sorry &gt;\\_&lt; Great, thanks for the detailed response.  I really appreciate it.\n\nDo you have any experience with or have you ever considered an implantable neurostimulator?  That looks appealing to me, as I want to retain sensation and sexual function of course, I just want to \u201cdial down\u201d the nervous input down there.  My issue basically seems like my pelvic region is always hyperactive/\u201con\u201d, which causes sexual dysfunction and some urinary urgency/pain/frequency.  It is not classic PGAD per se, but it certainly has overlapping characteristics. the pelvic being congested and always on is a pgad symptom. as well as the urinary pain/urgency. those are sadly nerve misfires causing it. the sexual dysfunction is also a symptom. as a male you end up in one of 2 groups. 1st is the oh god i keep getting tons of erections (and possibly frequent ejaculate discharge). 2nd is erectile dysfunction and sensation loss (there is just too much nerve response so proper signals are getting suppressed). men generally end up in the first one but having gone through it myself option 2 is probable when there is just way too much going on.\n\nfor me the implant wont work as it is a nerve and muscle disorder that causes my pgad. i have however heard of the simulator being a treatment for various nerve disorders, pgad included when it is pure nerve. so that could be a very valid way to go. as for the sexual dysfunction -\\_- yeah i got hit extremely by that until i got my pgad under control. so that will probably improve once you get on a beneficial treatment.  bladder discomfort will go down as well once you get a working treatment.\n\nno issues go fully away, they just become very very much more predictable and functionality returns. though it sucks sexually, it will get better once you get treated. one thing to be aware of is you might not be able to reach sex completion in mornings even when on a good treatment. the nerves are just more numb right after sleeping (this is what i experience it may go different for you). Yeah\u2026it sucks.  No amount of stretching and strengthening , postural work, abstinence, diet changes, etc makes ANY difference whatsoever.  When I take phenibut (similar pharmacology to Lyrica and Gabapentin) my issues nearly IMMEDIATELY abate.  Likewise, when I take\nAdderall, my issues ALWAYS worsen.  It seems like constant excessive sympathetic nerve input is my issue, which is why phenibut helps so\nMuch and why adderall makes it so bad.\n\nAny ideas at all about how I could go about this?  If I cannot treat this or at least see improvement\u2026I truly do not know how I will be able to live the rest of my life.  This is utter hell. well for one you need to get a substitute for your adderall. other than that getting on a treatment plan would be your best bet. i greatly understand depression and when something keeps pushing the mood dropper button it can be really really hard to cope.\n\nconsidering the amount of relief your phenibut give it is 100% a nerve central issue. to a very very minor degree doing some massage tension relief along the belt line and slightly below (above your bladder) would probably be the most helpful as far as physical can go. especially since you dont have pelvic floor tension as an issue. that way you can get the small surface muscle discomfort to ease. which is very likely spiking sensation.\n\nyeah diet changes will do pretty much zero..... this isnt a digestive problem and most wonder trends are absolute quackers when it come to \"miracle food\". pretty much the only thing you can do diet wise is fish oil/avacado since healthy fat helps nerves to a degree. postural work is for your back and does zip for your pelvis since it is a set structure. not a hot spot joint network like the spine. your sacrem (the part your tail bone is part of) is pretty damn solid to boot.\n\nyou have to approach this as a disorder. you are kind of in it for the long haul. try seeing if you need more padding or a more solid surface to sit on. unpleasant pressure on the perineum is a nerve catastrophe as that causes the sensation to pass to your prostate + bladder and your actual genital network. ladies have a much more up front nerve presentation while males are more interwoven into the pelvis as our pelvises are narrower and do not allow for as much space. being in a sit down job makes this much harder since you kind of have no way to achieve certain relaxable methods. they make various pillows designed for pelvic comfort so after you determine what feels most comfortable look into that for on the go or at home.\n\non rare occasions feel free to use a topical lotion like Lidocaine to help numb when sensations are continually peaking. just dont over use it as it has some rather nasty side effects. i dont need an answer to the next part, but you need to figure out if you get more relief going for a natural release or if trying to get a release just pisses it off. better to be a chronic masturbater than uncomfortable, or reasonably abstinent with moments of need.\n\nnow onto clothing. what clothing causes less nerve sensation? for me i have days where i need tight undies and loose clothing. other days i need to ditch undies alltogether. and  some days keep undies and ditch clothes. work on figuring out clothing patterns that you can adapt to your life and workstyle. unfortunately you will need to consider things like shirts as well since any erogenous tissues like nipples/personal sensitive zones can cause micro reactions in your pelvis starting a spark that causes a pgad wave.\n\nyes it sucks since seeing anything sexy can also cause a pgad wave.......... and the male mind is prone to being a horn dog unfortunately &gt;\\_&lt; so practice breathing and distraction when watching tv or out in public and you see that hot someone walking by. romantic intentded movies or shows are off limits until you get on a treatment plan NO EXCEPTIONS (porn for natural release is of course ok). sadly my unsexy place involved dead kittens. it was a very rough first year...........  i have a drastically vivid imagination and my brain only responds to strong influences. since i have attention disorders like you, trying not to focus on something was tough as hell. sometimes i just had to let the pgad do its thing and cry afterward. nothing like being in no control of something that should be pleasant but now it feels like an attack causing despair. T\\_T\n\npgad is finding ABSOLUTE comfort. you may have difficulty maintaining it but personal comfort is key for any pain disorder. you need to eliminate stress factors as pgad responds to cortisol rather badly. cortisol inflames the nerve networks in a pain disorder making it more out of control. it inflames the tissue and makes it more nerve responsive (the exact opposite that you want in PGAD). you will need more self down time to allow for time to decompress. i looked it up and yes Adderall is one of the medications that increases cortisol. so while it is good for your attention disorder it is absolutely wrecking havoc on your pgad pain disorder. kind of like continuously revving an engine but never going anywhere.\n\nsadly alot of mental adjustment medications can react badly to PGAD as it kind of defies serotonin re-uptake logic, as well anything that ups any kind of stress hormones. for me my catalyst that finally tipped me over from having a collection of odd symptoms to full pgad was a medication called minipress. it was awful, 3 days after starting the medication my various pelvic/lower abdomen discomforts decided to have a marriage ceremony and i was left with pgad after it. my urologist confirmed that i was probably eventually going to end up with pgad. it just sucked that it came true. weirdly enough i got on its cousin paxil and it helped my mental/stress issues like we needed without any affect on my pgad like minipress did.\n\nso when trying new meds to replace Adderall ask for short trials so that if it 100% pisses off your pgad you arent stuck with a whole bottle of medication that you cant use. trust me you will know VERY quickly if a brain altering medication is heading towards nopeville when pgad is on your team. everyone is body chemistry is different so trial and error when it comes to treatments and medication is par for the course.\n\nsorry for the extremely large letter but i am a wordy kind of individual &gt;\\_&lt; and for me i cant convey emotion/information without being wordy \\^\\_\\^\n\nedits of course since im silly and have to do edits or add things Again, thanks so much for the detailed response.\n\nRegarding your situation\u2026are/were you having PGAD symptoms so severe you were uncontrollably ejaculating throughout the day?  Because for me, as horrible as it is, I am very lucky not to be on that level.  Hell, I do not even know if what I have really is PGAD or pudendal neuralgia, or just some sort of chronic pain syndrome that happens to be in the genitourinary region.  Diagnoses aside, I guess it would not make much of a difference because treatment would probably be the same\u2026 no. sometimes i had a tiny bit of precum but i was so lost in sensation overload that i couldnt ejaculate to save my life. i also was dealing with a major limp noodle issue.\n\nyeah like i said males get 2 forms. first is classic with lots and lots of erections with possible uncontrolled ejaculation frequency. and form 2 is prostate based lots of pelvic and lower penis (not the head) orgasms with limp noodle (and maybe non ejaculate leaks) from the overwhelming pelvic sensations. granted there is a slider scale in both types for severity.\n\nplus a pain disorder can cause erectile issues as can pudendal neuralgia, so until you get more in depth help it is difficult to sort it out.\n\ntreatments vary depending on the final diagnosis and the options open to you from that diagnosis. you are on first major one being a gabapentine similar nerve relief medication. See, the issue is although phenibut/lyrica/gabapentin help symptoms\u2026it is not a sustainable treatment at all.  It has considerable psychoactive effects (impaired cognition, mood problems, tolerance and eventual dependence), and taking it most days just would end disastrously in the long run.  \n\nWhat, exactly, have you done to improve your symptoms aside from pelvic therapy/muscular based stuff? i ended up for nerves getting a nerve block. i didnt start nerve blocks till i was starting year 2 of pgad. i didnt get max relief from nerve blocks till year 1 and 3/4ths. i have a general muscle relaxer and physical therapy for muscles. i found sitting positions to help not put pressure on my groin. im on permanent gabapentin. since im always fatigued normally i just had to adjust to the sedating effect of gabapentin. it took me over a year of several things to nail down what works for me. \n\nlastly i had to get a bit extreme and go for a prince albert piercing to silence the final nerve bundle (mostly). it was the most agonizing month ever  T\\_T Hey do you think botox could be of any help with PGAD? unless you are experiencing major pelvic muscle spasms botox wont do much. but im not a doctor so it might be worth asking about it and learning the risks as well from a licensed professional. due to the chemical in botox being technically poisonous doctors have to be super careful with botox injections.\n\nin the long run though getting nerve blockers would probably be a better solution since you have very little to no muscle issues with your PGAD. so outside of doing some massage techniques directly over your painful bladder there isnt much muscle spasm for botox to really work on since they use it on the pelvic floor and paralyzing your bladder would not be a good idea", "I might have PGAD I am constantly physically aroused - no hyperbole. It does not get painful, as I have seen a lot of people say, but it is extremely frustrating. Orgasms feel good but they do not relieve the arousal. My hips are constantly wiggling unless I put mental effort to make them stop, and even then my uterus flutters and I cannot control it. \n\nI am hypersexual and I am not sure if that and PGAD can be co-morbid. I think it is both because, while I am often mentally aroused, the physical arousal is constant and totally separate from the mental arousal.\n\nDoes this seem like PGAD? Or am I mistaken? I am not sure how hypersexuality interacts with PGAD, but the rest sounds consistent with PGAD. As shitty as it sounds, if you go ahead with any medical course of treatment, try and minimize or avoid mentioning your hypersexuality as much as possible. It will be attributed to that and you will have doctors dismissing you as \"just some nymphomaniac\"\n\nGood luck friend. Thank you for the quick response! I have seen that PGAD is often paired with Tarlov cysts. Should I get tested for that first and reference the stimulation as a symptom, or ask about PGAD first then suggest testing for cysts? I am kind of in the sane boat in that I am constantly craving stimulation *and* hypersexual but with zero pain. I know for a fact it is PGAD because if it hots insinuated for a few minutes I get an overwhelming tingle emanating from my penis and reaches my toes. \n\nI think getting a diagnosis (albeit a self diagnosis) is more than enough for me. I do not really want a cure even with how severe it is because I really know no other \"reality\". I mean if the feeling goes away, what then? Will I get into a massive depression? Will I be bored? Will my life now lack meaning? Nah, I would much rather deal with it than not have it \n\nNot sure if that made any sense Ask about PGAD first, absolutely. Try and make sure you also scan back to see if you have had any medication changes or injuries in or around your pelvic region lately. Those things can be catalysts for an underlying condition whether caused by Tarlov cysts or just as a neuropathic condition, as my doc suspects mine is. If your doctor seems not to have too big an ego, try asking about some medications used to treat neuropathic conditions like gabapentin, which is what I am trialling right now. Not sure where you are geographically speaking but if you are anywhere near Chicago I have a doctor recommendation. Who is the doctor near Chicago that you would recommend? I am looking for someone in that area. Sorry for late reply. Take a look at Northwestern's Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause. I saw Dr. Traci Kurtzer and I really felt like she took my concerns very seriously. She told me she is worked with cases of PGAD before and put me on a trial of a nerve pain medication called Gabapentin. She wanted to see if the PGAD was possibly a result of some misconnected neural pathways in my pudendal nerve. I ended up discontinuing the medication as I found my symptoms eased off it, which may be an effect of returning to my original anti-depressants, but Dr. Kurtzer is definitely experienced with PGAD and has treatment options in place for cases of it. I see Dr. Sangeeta Senapati at Northshore in Skokie, who specializes in pelvic pain and PGAD symptoms. It is been life changing. I have felt so incredibly seen and understood. After 20 years of being told I am making it up, crazy, etc, it has been such a relief. I have done pelvic floor physical therapy and am currently taking a daily medication, as well as valium as needed when the symptoms get too intense. The doctor I was originally seeing moved to California so I just started seeing Dr. Senapati about a year ago. She has been awesome.", "I started a new forum on telegram! Please join! Hey gang!

I am so desperate that I have asked my doctor to be put back on it and I am going to start it again at 20mg. I have not mentioned the pgad to her as I feel very ashamed I only said I could not cope with my skin picking on my own. Wondering if anyone has gotten any better going back on or using antidepressants. I swear I rather not be able to orgasm or feel aroused ever again than continue like this. It is debilitating and it makes me hate my life. I just need some support and hope. Thanks I really hope going back on a low dose takes care of it for you, or you could mention the PGAD symptoms to the doctor and try a different medicine? I know how it is to be embarrassed talking to a doctor but it is their job to help you. I have had some doctors look at me funny and others that were very compassionate. This is your health so I really encourage you to be persistent. Maybe it is possible to lay out the issue to a nurse at the practice and they can relay the info to the doctor - I have done that before as well.\nI can tell you that I did find some relief from a low dose of amitriptyline, where it helped lessen the discomfort but I could still orgasm, and it still worked stopping and then going back on. Just recently I have found quite a bit of relief from Abilify, which is an atypical antipsychotic that is also used for depression. I am on a super-low dose and have already found some relief by about 50% or better. But I am think medicines will affect everyone differently so you may have to just try and see what works for you. Thank you. I rather try prozac first as it will also help me with my skin picking as it did in the past and if I can avoid mentioning the PGAD to my doctor I rather do  that. I am also not keen on taking medicines that can make you gain weight and prozac is one of the safest options in that sense but I will definitely check with my doctor and talk about my symptoms of prozac does not manage it. I am restarting it today so fingers crossed. Thanks for your input I am a practice nurse myself btw ;) Bless you! I have often found nurses to be a lot more understanding and compassionate about this issue than doctors. I really hope you find relief soon! You should tell her about the pgad. She is a doctor and will understand and she needs to know what is going on. Yes, there are many coping mechanisms out there. It depends who you ask. Some like to use ice packs. Some are on medications for it. For me, I just masturbate as much as I can.", "how do i get help for this ?? i see a lot of people saying that medication typically for depression or other mental illnesses has helped the pgad stop. how would i go about get prescriptions and stuff. i know a psychiatrist would have to prescribe it. but would not i be going to a gyno first since the issue is with my vagina \u2026. would the gyno recommend a psychiatrist or can any doctor prescribe that. i have suffered from anxiety and depression from years but have never been medicated or been allowed to go to therapy so i do not already have a therapist/psychiatrist. please help Hi, I just wanted to encourage you to first see a regular doctor if you can. I went to a OBGYN and they gave me hormones at first, which only helped minimally, and then ended up referring me to a psychiatrist. I have had some success with psych drugs, but many regular doctors will prescribe these, or refer you to a psychiatrist if needed. I have been prescribed antidepressants/antianxiety meds by a regular doctor. Are you able to see a doctor or nurse? so you think it would be better to see a general doctor before a gyno ? Yes, that is my opinion, just because I have visited specialists as well and none seemed to be particularly knowledgeable about this type of problem. I think you just describe to them what is going on and try different things to see what works. I hope you find relief soon!", "Medication and treatments? I was wondering what kind of things you can do and use to feel better? Sleeping has been very hard and I just want something that will numb the feeling. I take a small dose of Zolpidem before bed if I feel like my sleep might be interpreted.  Lately, I have been taking it more being awakened in the middle of the night by intense sensations that seem to go for a long period.", "Is this part of PGAD? I am not sure how graphic I can get. This is not meant to be sexual in any way. Over the past few months my cliterol hood has been getting more and more painful. My partner says it is completely covering my clit. I have not been able to orgasm for two weeks. Now I am having sharp pains in my clit. I bit the bullet and saw the gynocologist today. Unfortunately, my previous gynocologist retired and the new one was not familiar with PGAD. She ruled out adhesions and infection. She got her colleague to check. At this point PGAD was fired up from driving and her poking around. They both commented that my clit does not pop out when good pulled back. He gave me estrogen cream to apply before bed. He also wants me to use cold washcloth directly on the area twice a day. He is not familiar with PGAD either, he originally diagnosed me with Burning Vulva Syndrome. I went to a \"specialist\" but I did not like her and she put me on high doses of gabapentin. I could not function and I did not go back. There is a real specialist an hour away and I think I am going to make an appointment. Is this PGAD? Has anyone else had this experience? I try to stay informed and I am not having any luck finding info on this. Any suggestions, insight or links to info would be greatly appreciated. Your partner \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude22I am stopping chemo so you will be happy I will not be around anymore you know cause I am so toxic and everything else  glad you so easily moved on again well i would say probably not. pgad is one of those things that are just left on the table for last im afraid. the main factor being the area of swelling or inability to orgasm doesnt fit the bill for PGAD.\n\nPGAD's main feature is constant arousal that doesnt just go away once you orgasm (up to and often past the point of pain)  and a constant unwanted orgasm sensation during flare ups (which again can eventually turn painful). there are other factors and things that can shape PGAD but these 2 things are the main diagnosis points.\n\nim not a doctor so take this with a grain of salt. but most likely the pain in your clit is being transferred from the state your hood is in. erectile tissue in both females and males just isnt designed to be engorged for super long periods of time.\n\ni however would say definitely get an appointment with the specialist and if things worsen consider the ER as they may need to drain blood from the tissue to force it relax. i do hope that it is an easy fix though. pain sucks and genital pain is 10x worse due to the 10x denser nerve tissue &gt;\\_&lt; I have no idea who you are. This is a case of mistaken identity. Okay well I am back in the hospital after collapsed do not got much time left", "Success stories ? Are there any ? Yes! Mine was directly caused by being on birth control and hormonal imbalances. I went off birth control and within six months, I was back to normal. My symptoms are not gone completely but I definitely have more days than not without any symptoms. I have done pelvic floor physical therapy, which has helped with relaxation, deceasing tension in the pelvic floor muscles, etc. I take Nortriptyline daily and have valium that I insert vaginally for break through symptoms, which typically only occur the week before my cycle should start. I have also started taking birth control and skipping the sugar pill week, which has helped. Sometimes car rides will cause break through symptoms but that is easily managed with the valium. It took a long time to figure out what the heck was happening in my body. I had symptoms for 20 years before finding a pelvic pain specialist that knew what I was talking about. But I now have an amazing doctor and although I obviously hope it goes away completely one day, I am doing SO MUCH BETTER than I was three years ago. Hope this gives you some hope! yes. i struggled with these symptoms for four years. All the doctors told me I was crazy and I finally snapped and found a specialist that has a lot of experience with pgad. he figured our what was wrong with me in a matter of minutes, wheras normal doctors had no clue what was wrong with me... i have internal cysitis, the protective layering of my bladder was deteriorating and it was causing the symptoms of pgad. he perscribed me elmiron, which rebuilds ones bladder wall. ive since been 3 years pain free. if anyone wants his information let me know. i feel horrible knowing that people dont know that there are people out there who know all about this Hi,\n\nHow long were you on birth control before this symptom started? I was on birth control in general for about a year, then switched to a new one because the other was not working anymore. I was on the new one for about a month or so, which was what caused the symptoms. &gt;problematicpasnetti\n\nI got PGAD after stopping birth and then starting a new one, too.  \n\nI have read other people's stories of getting PGAD after birth control and fortunately, most stories report eventually recovering.  It does not seem to be the most persistent 'form' of PGAD, if that makes sense.  \n\nI am interested in finding any stories of people who got this form of PGAD and then went on to become pregnant.  Since birth control changes hormones, it seems to me to be a hormonal problem and that it could get worse if I became pregnant.  If anyone knows of any such stories, let me know! Hi, not sure what started mine I was on a mini pill after trying various things to find what worked best for me. I missed one and then it seemed to start. I was nervous about getting pregnant, but actually it completely stopped when I was pregnant, twice! It has now returned 6 months after birth of my second, so now investigating it again. Good luck Thanks...that is quite helpful.\n\nMine started one time when I went on birth control after a year of not taking it; but the second time, it got worse when I went *off* birth control.  So it makes sense that yours may have started on the mini-pill and may have returned as your hormone levels went back to normal after pregnancy. I hope you recover!", "Is it normal??? Is it normal to be arsoued after first time masturbating in your life or it is has to be definitely  pgad???", "do i have pgad? Hey so i have been having a lot of burning in my vagina for the past couple of days and a huge urge to pee. like i pee constantly. and sometimes i pee and then i need to pee again in 5 mins. i do not really feel any arousal, just a burning urgent sensation to pee constantly. also, wearing jeans/thongs does not really do anything and sitting actually helps the feeling lessen. although, sometimes jeans do make me feel kind of trapped down there. i really really hope this is not pgad to be honest. oh and i also have kind of a weird feeling near my clit area its kind of like pressure but like acute pressure and of course the intense need to pee every minute From your symptoms this sounds more like a UTI, tight pelvic floor, or other urinary issue. The urethra is close to the clit, so the pressure you feel near your clit is probably related to that. An OBGYN can help with urinary issues as well, so I would go see one and she will be better able to see what the issue is.\nI have suffered from these symptoms too, and I think mine are actually due a lot of tension in my pelvic floor muscles. Dilation has helped me a lot, so I cannot stress how beneficial it is to go see your OBGYN! thanks so much :) Of course!! I am also hoping you do not have PGAD, but if you do come back with that diagnosis we are waiting to welcome you into the club! Sounds more like a UTI my infection test came back normal. i dont have an infection", "I decided to end my life!!!!!!

With your OCD and anxiety, your problem may be more neurochemical, so an SSRI may be helpful for you. For non-prescription supplements, HTP-5 might help boost your serotonin production. St. John's Wort is supposed to help with depression, but I am not sure how well it works with PGAD and the entire nervous system. Lots of people find help with anxiety with CBD oil too, so taking that might help reduce your stress. I am not sure if that is available in Germany, but it is expensive here in the US. &gt; after the orgasm the feeling of orgasm did not go away\n  \nI get that too. I was wondering if I really had PGAD, or something.\n  \nI always thought stress was the reason?\n  \nAre you currently in a relationship? Because I havent had sex in a whille and I thought it was sexual frustration. The irony is that the moment I realized this phenomena *in* women, is when I started having it!\n  \nRegardless, my last flare up was 6 months ago. And I had a couple more shortly before it. \n  \nSo, its been at least 6 months from the last flare up! Which is great. I tried my best to create a stress-free daily routine. I tried everything to fight against stress. Read or listen to some audiobooks on stress. \n  \nStress-proof by Mithu Storoni is great. I started taking supplements that did subtle releif. Magnesium and Ashwangandha when it got bad, although I might not recommend regular use of Ashwagandha.\n  \nWhat really helped were daily walks after having lunch. And making sure my days didnt start with stress. I would do yoga first thing I wake up. Shower first thing in the morning, If I had to. Participated in stress-free activities: hiking, videogames, socializing, etc. And made sure I ate something pleasant to start the day.\n  \nFind your sources of stress and if you can, get rid of it! For example, I realized I was doing a lot of more chores than my housemates, and I told them my conditions and that I had to let loose. Since they knew my conditions were real, they complied.\n  \nBut is PGAD linked to stress? Would my flare ups go away, even if I did not have this routine? I am not sure. Dm me, I have also had a similar experience after shaving my pubic hair. I have also had sensorimotor ocd before that, so I think it is connected. I hope it can go I think I am going through the same thing. Hello, how are you now? Hey are you having trouble with premature ejaculation? Have you found ways to cope with that if that is what you have?  I do but only while im having symptoms, if i have a phase with no symptoms i dont have this problem.", "What time of day is it worst for you? I feel like the only one where MORNING is absolute torture! When I first wake up, the PGAD is just out of control and I almost cry! It is hard to get out of bed, which is ironic because once I actually start moving around and doing things the distraction or I do not even know what it is helps a lot. But literally when I first open my eyes it is the absolute worst it is all day. Ugh, so awful! What about you guys? I hear many more people say night is worse. Definitely morning, because the tension has built up all night even if I get a spontaneous orgasm in my sleep.\n\nNormally I will force myself to have a dozen orgasms just as I wake, which normally calms me down long enough to get up and get moving. In the morning I feel fine before I get out of bed. At this point, I come to my senses and the symptoms are slowly returning. Something abnormal is happening at night. When lying down, the symptoms intensify and it becomes damn hard to fall asleep. Out of curiosity though, are the orgasms you have to \"calm it down\" still pleasurable at all? Mine are still enjoyable at least early in the day. By the end it is simply a means to an end though. Night time for me. Once the distractions of the day are gone. If I had to drive at all, it makes it worse. I cannot get off. It is torture. I have learned to leave it alone. When I first starting having symptoms orgasm helped. I got toys and got off a lot. Now the thought of anything vibrating near my vulva makes me sick. Fortunately, I do go into remission and I have good sex. Yes, they are still pleasurable while they are happening. The non pleasurable part is before and after. Yeah I am hearing ya. Like when you are climaxing but it never feels finished? I can never ever reach that point where it progresses from the climax to the part where you feel that wave of satisfaction. It keeps repeating the peak and gets like 99.999999% of getting to the \"aaah done\" part but never seems to make it over. Then it aches more more attention and it feels like it is had *a lot* of attention but without the relief part. Just the need. For me I do climax and get that wave for a second and it does feel good and release the dopamine or whatever obviously but even the next moment I can still feel my genitals tingling,throbbing, and my nerves going off, and yes the need still there. Yeah I think I know what you are saying.\n\nIt still feels insanely pleasurable when it is happening. Like I find that it is kind of neat that I can literally just keep orgasming over and over as long as I choose, because the sensation of reaching the peak and all that comes with it is so nice. it is a bit of an escape to get lost in it for a while. But I just wish that it would reach a conclusion and not ache before and after. The problem is I am like never mentally in the mood now due to being physically exhausted from being physically in the mood 24/7. Like I never even fantasize anymore. It is just a chore at this point That is pretty depressing. I would have to say I am not at that point yet. But it is only been an issue for me for a year or so. How long have you been struggling with this? At night as the pressure has built up though out the day. I will get a moment to myself then have to relief myself For me, when I am trying to sleep is the worst, regardless of the time of day (regardless of sleep schedule, napping, etc.). Morning are bad, too, though. I have found that the trigger is the position more than the time of the day; lying down is the problem for me. \n\nI have POTS, and I have found that PGAD is highly related to my blood pressure. Lying down with my feet above my heart has helped both my POTS and PGAD (however, make sure to talk to your doc before trying this one... sleeping with feet high up is not for everyone and can be taxing on some people's cardiovascular and neurological health depending on their conditions).", "do i have PGAD? i am 17F and ive been feeling this constant arousal feeling for about 3 days and i am freaking out. i did a bit of searching on google and it led me to this. right now i am sort of having leg pain in my left leg so i am not sure if that has anything to do w it?? \nalso sometimes i get hairs trapped under my clitoral hood, (sorry if that is tmi lol) but im thinking maybe that is what is causing this? Any opinions would be greatly appreciated! I am sorry you are going through this, I have been having similar feeling in clitoral area that goes away when I stand or walk but gets worse when I sit.

Could be a lot of reasons, try and see if it goes away within a few days but if not have it checked out by the Dr. .

I know you should be vulnerable about all health problems to all people: doctors, your family, etc. But the last thing I want is to be looked at differently because of this.\n\nEvery time I have told people in the past about an unexplained health malady I have had, they look at my like I am crazy or tell me it is all in my head. Including doctors. It just hurts when something in your life is impacting you so significantly but you cannot tell anyone. Can only come here cause you guys are the only ones who know what it is like.\n\nJust want to say I am happy that this community exists, even if it is not a cure- Helps me feel less alone. Cannot say that I have told anyone about it and not really sure what I would say if I did. I have great friends / family etc but I am not sure there would be any benefit in them knowing about it and it would probably just make us all feel awkward at the same time.\n\nI have never spoken to a doctor about it either - thought about it but then decided against it as my symptoms are for the most part manageable. When they are less manageable I retreat from the world, and then when people ask where I have been I just say I needed some alone time. I figure that is probably the easier option rather than discussing things in more detail.

It is horrible when you have plans and cannot manage to follow them.", "Found Some Success Just wanted to share my experience in case it is helpful for someone. I have been having PGAD symptoms for about 3 years, and have not been able to pinpoint the cause. It did seem to start oddly enough when I was trying to get healthier - cut back on drinking, eating healthier, exercising more, trying allergy shots instead of constantly taking medicine. It started where I would feel really agitated every few days and need a \"release,\" but later these feelings got closer and closer together where they were almost every day. I will say that for me the feelings are relieved by orgasm, but usually only for a day at most, and the feelings would often linger after. After a while it got to the point where I felt so disgusting and had an aversion to sex. Could not even look at people making out on TV.\n\nI have been to regular doctors on this issue, a couple of which said, \"usually women have the opposite problem.\" I then tried an OB/GYN who gave me complete workup including ultrasound, neurologist, physiatrist, and now psychiatrist. I have tried varying my exercises, stretches, mindfulness and breathing, which somewhat helped but certainly did not solve the issues. I have tried various medicines - hormones (progesterone), which helped marginally but causes other issues; amitriptyline, which helped in that it numbed things somewhat so lessened the intensity; Cymbalta, which made the feelings actually painful so only took it a few days.\n\nSo coming to the point. The only real relief I have found is through psychiatric medicine. The psychiatrist I consulted about not only PGAD but also mood issues diagnosed me with bipolar and OCD, and prescribed medication to treat those issues. By far the one that has helped me the most has been Abilify (aripiprazole). My doctor thinks the root cause of my PGAD is anxiety/OCD. I was very skeptical of this since I actually experience strong physical sensations rather than thoughts/fantasies, but I could not rule out that it was psychosomatic. She said Abilify can help with bipolar stability as well as anxiety/OCD. \n\nWell, cut to a few weeks later and not only did Abilify help stabilize/lift my mood, but the sensations have not been nearly as bad and I have actually felt attraction and desire for sex again. Truly a miracle for me because I was to the point where I wanted to just cut sex completely from my life and never wanted arousal again. I can enjoy thinking about and experiencing sex again. The PGAD still has flared a bit, but I would say half or less what it was. I am thinking that if it continues to flare I can always try upping the dose a bit. The effectiveness already has been amazing for me because I am only on a starter/child's dose and it started helping within a few days!\n\nI am not advocating everyone go out and take Abilify but just wanted to share my experience to give others hope. I know what it is to lay there sobbing and wanting to die because it is such torture. Now I feel I may be able to have a normal life again. From what I have read of PGAD, it can have different root causes and therefore different treatments, but trying medication can be worthwhile. I never would have guessed that this particular medicine, an atypical antipsychotic, would help, but it did. I am glad I was willing to try something my doctor suggested even though I did not imagine it would help with this issue. Do not give up! Very interesting.  I am a guy, but I also have anxiety+OCD and not full on PGAD but many symptoms similar to it.  Sorta like diet PGAD.  What is your abilify dose? At standard doses used for schizophrenia it can produce depression and anhedonia which sucks ass, but at low doses it can actually do the complete opposite and alleviate depression by enhancing dopaminergic transmission Thanks, that makes sense! I am on 2mg per day in the morning. Any bad side effects so far?  I am already considering it for anhedonia: The weight gain is what really scares me. So far it is been OK. The only real side effects I have experienced are feeling a bit woozy after I took it, but just for the first few days, and waking up early in the morning. I seem to still be able to get about 6 hours of sleep at least though. It is hard to tell with weight yet because I have only been on it about a month. But, I have not gained any weight so far. In fact, I have lost a pound this past week. I had gained 5 lbs. for the short time I was on lithium and hope with Abilify it will not be an issue. And I tend to have anhedonia without medication. Abilify has really helped with that. It has made me actually enjoy eating again, food tastes really good, but I am just trying to eat healthy for the most part. Lithium made food taste bad and I still gained weight. I also suffer from OCD and potentially bipolar disorder. I am really thankful that you posted this! Something to look into.

The doctor said it is not an anal fissure or hemmorhoids. Any idea what it could be? Could simply be chronic tension in the muscles caused by whatever original symptoms you had. Since the symptoms would obviously be causing your body a lot of stress, the muscles in that part of your body will tend to clench unconsciously. It may help to get some physical therapy to help you learn to relax your pelvic floor.", "Pgad? Can a tingling/numb feeling in my vagina (without arousal present) still be pgad?", "Part 2 of this nightmare!!! I am now mentally and physically damaged I cant sleep at night because of this!!!my day is crying screaming and slapping my self I am absolutely out of my mind right now on the edge of suicide!!!i feel like I want to throw my self under a bridge to end my agony!! I went to the hospital to check tying to fool my self it is not that!!!so I got urine test turns out I had a urinary infection and e coli in urine culture test!!!! The give me anti antibiotic for a week I only took 2 pills and not planning to take an more cause I know this is the pgad Trying to fool me again because that is not what an infection feels like!!!i hope I get sick and this infection goes to my blood and die in peace!!at least that an honorable way to die way to die !!!not dieing horny!!!!!!!!!! I rarely comment anymore, but this is important for you to hear. TAKE THOSE ANTIBIOTICS. Do NOT stop in the middle of your course. You were literally diagnosed with a test that showed you had an infection. I am not saying that invalidates your PGAD or promising it will fix it, but PGAD tends to flare up when other things are amiss in the body as well.\nAlso, stopping antibiotics in the middle of the course can result in even stronger infections. \n\nSecondly, I took a quick look at your post history. I think it might be worth it for you to look into TMS theory and Dr.John Sarno's books \"the mindbody Connection/prescription) since you mentioned back pain as well (although lots of that information can pertain to PGAD as well). \n\nThirdly, can you reach out to a therapist? I speak to one (specializes in sex therapy but any would do)  who is PGAD informed over the phone. Much easier than talking face to face. You can find one online.  You need help with perspective. It took me a long time to mentally get to where I am now, and it is not always easy but at least I am not always panicky and suicidal anymore. \n\nAnd lastly, if you can afford it, there is a PGAD specialist who also links back pain with PGAD. His name is Dr. Goldstein in San Diego. He could be of use to you, and offers free 10 minute consultations by phone. \n\nBest of luck to you, I am so sorry for all you are going through. There is light ahead. Try everything before giving up. You owe it to yourself. I do not understand how can a urine infection cause arousal!!!i do not have the back pain anymore it is gone!! I went back and took a pill of my anti depressants it flared me like hell!!! Sadly I am in a country where we do not discuss cause this I do not what to do or where to go I do not want to be classified as horny!!!! Every single thing in the body is connected, but especially in the pelvic region. Something wrong  in your bladder area (which is in super close proximity to your genitals) absolutely has the potential to affect others things in that region (or even far away from that region). Same with back pain. Maybe it is gone, but that does not mean it could not be linked or caused something originally. The body is mysterious that way. \n\nVery interesting that your anti depressant flared you. It is pretty common to hear that PGAD and anti depressants have a link to each other. Like I said, setting up a consultation with Dr Goldstein is free and you do not have to be in the same country to do it. He can also treat you over zoom calls and provide you the requisitions for tests you may need without having to deal with explaining it to doctors near you. My cause of pgad in the beginning was not anti depressants it actually when helped me in the past two years to overcome pgad but I started to noticed they turned up on me there not like what they used to be!!!!!!!!!im going crazy I do not know what went wrong I did not do anything!!! I echo that you should treat the infection because my PGAD was triggered by something similar. There are specialists around the country that treat PGAD. If you are feeling desperate, book an appointment with Dr. Goldstein in San Diego. The full evaluation costs' around $2000 but he will be able to isolate where along the nerve path is triggering the PGAD and trouble shoot some solutions. He sent me to physical therapy and the p-therapist was able to find the exact pelvic muscle that was squeezing on my nerves. Certain stretches and massages help the PGAD become super manageable, and I am going to try pelvic floor botox next. Do not give up! Not everyone is is the same, so the \"cure\" for you might be different than others. There is still a bunch of stuff out there to try.", "Medication Induced - Does It Go Away? Can pgad be something that starting up a medication causes, but then goes away as your body gets used to the new medication? I have just started on moclobemide, which I started specifically for help with srri-induced sexual dysfunction. Could this just be a reversal of that and the new sensations get less intense as I keep on with the medication, or does this sound like a risk that I will develop pgad from this kind of medication?", "NEED HELP TO MY GIRLFRIEND Hello everyone I have a very very big request.

Help please You have not orgasmed ?", "Can hemorrhoids cause PGAD? Ever since I got an anal fissure and hemorrhoids, I got the constant irritated \"itchy\" vein feeling in my perineum area that leadsto arousal in the vagina area.\n\nIt gets worse when I sit down and after bowel movements. I do not know what is going on but it seems like the symptoms start in the rectum and kind of lead into the vaginal arousal feeling.\n\nDoes anyone know if hemorrhoids and fissures can cause pgad? It is driving me crazy and making me depressed... Well considering a hemorrhoid can include some of the perineum nerves (the space between the genitals and the anal opening) in the sore and injured tissues. plus a fissure can go deep enough to mess up perineum nerves as well. So it could certainly mimic pgad whenever you are experiencing these issues. Plus it is possible for pgad to only be present when unique issues are going on since each person is a bit different.\n\nIm not a doctor though so this is just my opinion. I think what your going through though is whenever your damaged tissue is trying to heal it is sending the itch signal to your perineum nerve network that also includes your genitals. So when you itch adjust or force pressure on your perineum you are essentially providing stimulation to your genital network at the same time of trying to adjust yourself to more comfort as it heals.\n\nI would very much recommend looking possibly using a donut pillow to take pressure off of the injured area and your perineum. Also looking into an anal safe medicine for the itching so that the injuries dont send as many messages along your nerve line. Hopefully you can clear the issues up as it takes a lot of time to heal a hemorrhoid or an anal fissure and its totally awful while healing. \n\nI hope this helps with the issue and that you dont have any form of pgad at all once its all fixed. Other than that if you do end up with a pdag diagnosis there are many wonderful ladies in supports groups on reddit and on facebook that probably have more ideas than I do on how to cope with it. Thank you for your reply. I have been using a compounded cream and donut pillow and while the cream is helping the anal spasms I dont think it is doing much in terms of the \"itchy\" nerve feeling. I have not noticed much comfort with a donut pillow either. What seems to help is trying to get consistently solid poops because If eel like mushy poops irritate the anal canal and the nerves even more. It is such a weird situation :/ i can sympathyze those acidic loose poops can burn and make body tissues super easy to split", "OCD/anxiety or SSRI? Okay so I wanted to share my story to hopefully get some insightful opinions since no one knows the extent of PGAD like the sufferers of it do. So basically last October I was put on Lexapro 10mg for depression and I actually thought it was beginning to help(maybe it was) but then like a month after starting I got a strange rash from my hips up. My physician was positive it was not lexapro causing this so she kept me on it. Eventually it went away BUT then like another month later I started feeling like the inner thigh of my left leg/ left side of vagina started feeling numb like when you fall asleep on your arm. It is numb but also hurts. Well that persisted and stayed for like 3 days and kept getting worse. Then when I was laying in bed I started getting waves of what I assumed were orgasms but they were different than the regular ones. Not pleasurable at all and my clit was like icy hot and I began getting cold sweats. I mean I was full on freaking out and having panic attacks so that did not help. The day after I went to the hospital and they found a ovarian cysts and reassured me that is what it was and sent me on my way. I think me having that idea in my head helped me push through it and eventually the feelings would kind of dissipate because I would not give them the time of day. It ultimately lasted a month and went away. I would still feel that numbness if I sat on a hard surface for too long though (always on my left side) well I pretty much thought I was passed it but then I randomly started having what I guess would be mini orgasms again out of nowhere. Meanwhile I am still on the lexapro. It is gotten worse and worse and I am often sore down there or have the icy hot feeling. I know I am definitely OCD and make everything worse by over-focusing on it and raising my anxiety. I am still dealing with it today and it is been close to 2 ish months but I am in a darker place mentally, especially since my specialist wants me to get fully off lexapro. Does this sound like a nerve problem? Antidepressant induced? Or my anxiety/ ocd causing this? Because I remember once I decided to not let the feeling overpower my day it eventually just went away. But I also had college keeping me busy all week. Now with all of this going on I am often inside, and alone and it is so hard not to dwell on my symptoms. Also a crazy thing to note is even when my PGAD pretty much disappeared for the 4 months whenever I would have a panic attack I would have like a mini orgasm or two and feel icy hot down there. So maybe I am just stuck in the anxious depressive state and that is what is keeping it around too. My specialist thinks endometriosis can be causing this too but I have not seen where that was the cause for someone yet. I would just love some insightful opinions. I saw one girl say she is so ocd she would focus on swallowing and the spit filling in her mouth and felt she was choking ( I actually went through that period too haha) I also have depersonalization which I think comes on when you hyper-fixate on reality. I just know how it started was so odd, with the numbness and I still get it on the left side if I sit for too long. Too long being like 20-30 min Also forgot to say I have had interstitial cystitis since 2018 and idk if it was me getting on elmiron or just me not stressing over the symptoms that made them go away but I have barely had any problems with it now. And I am not even on elmiron anymore. Maybe it is transgressed into PGAD? It is may be due to your anxiety and low mood. I recently found out I have BPD and I have PGAD as well. My psychologist explained that when we are in a state of high stress and/or depression our bodies will do anything to make us feel \u201cbetter\u201d - hence the persistent arousal and spontaneous orgasms. Knowing that actually helped me a lot and gave me some relief from my symptoms. Hey, it is been a while. Any update?", "Which antidepressants are known to STOP PGAD? I want to try that route. I dont care about taking them for as long as they work. That is all that matters to me. Thank you.  I heard cipralex since they decrease the sex drive  but I am not sure have not tried I tried one anti depressant pill that the doctor prescribed and they messed up my stomach I threw up immediately after takeing them It depends what is causing your pgad. But antidepressants that reduce sex drive could possibly work. Paxil (paroxetine) has the strongest numbing of the SSRIs, it is used off label for premature ejaculation in men.   I took it twice for anxiety/depression and withdrawal is bad.  \n\nI do not think my body will tolerate it a third time otherwise I would go back in it.

I have had lots of things going on in my life right now, things that were traumatizing to me. they have been causing me a lot of distress. and then one morning I woke up with a pulsing feeling down stairs. I do not know exactly where it is at, because I do not know much about human anatomy. I know that I feel like there is this heavy weight on my vagina and it is very annoying. sometimes the nerves in my thighs twitch and they also twitch in my lower stomach. I have been having spontaneous orgasms. I had a dream one night, one that was sexual but that I did not want to happen and I woke up to an orgasm. but there was also this one time where I was just doing my homework and I had one. it is very annoying. I went to the doctor and they basically looked at me like I was crazy. they said that they had never heard of pgad before. I do not know what to do. it is driving me crazy. someone tell me if I do have it or if I do not have it. That definitely sounds like PGAD. Hormonal changes or stress could be affecting it to cause it to flare up. I would also like to take the opportunity to tell you some things I wish I knew at your age because god knows no one else tells us.\n\nFirst of all, your clitoris is the main organ for sexual stimulation. What you can see of it is a little nub near the top of your vulva, just before your urethra. Internally, the clitoris goes deeper, one part wraps around the vagina. And there are two wing-like extrusions called cura that move during arousal. That might be the \"weight\" you felt on your vagina. Here is an article that should explain the internal clitoris more: \n\nSecondly, advocating for yourself with doctors is a skill you should learn early, sadly. As a woman, you face hurdles with accurate diagnosis, especially of anything related to your reproductive organs and mental health. I recommend searching out some reputable sources that you can read to inform yourself and print out for your doctor. When you can better understand your condition, you can better stand your ground against doctors who do not feel like applying the bare minimum of their eight years of education to you. Tap into your inner Karen.\n\nSince you are still a teenager, I would want your doctor to look at your hormone levels and make sure you do not have any imbalances. Unfortunately there is not much to treat PGAD other than pelvic floor exercises, relaxation techniques, etc. Hopefully it will not be so severe when you are older, but it can be more intense while you are growing and maturing. At your age it might be rising hormone levels. Sadly, I have bad experiences with doctors about rare conditions, too. If it is PGAD, it might come and go. Stress caused me episodes in the worst moments. Learn about yourself without shame! I do not think it is hormones because I am on birth control. I am not having sex, just a very heavy period and severe cramps. I am in therapy right now for everything going on in my life and I also have a meditation app. I am working on controlling it. yeah, I noticed when I am more stressed it goes on. but it is normal for it to be continuous. the pulsing feeling has been going on since about March. Hey I experienced pgad last week for the first time. It drove me crazy and caused a lot of anxiety. I managed to see a pelvic therapist who assured me that it can be fixed. My pelvic muscles were tight so I think I pulled a muscle While spinning/stretching that was irritating that branch of the pudendal nerve. She suggested a few exercises to loosen the pelvic floor muscles and also suggested that I apply heat in the area. I felt instant relief after using the heat pad there. I am still a little sensitive there probably because there is now blood flow and the nerve is still healing. Please see a pelvic physical therapist as soon as you can. It can change your life.", "Lack of awareness of PGAD is malpractice waiting to happen. I was hospitalized almost two months ago, and during my stay the psychiatrist assigned to me decided it would be appropriate to switch me from fluoxetine to duloxetine over the course of two days. Two DAYS. If you do not have much experience with antidepressants and SSRIs, typically you can expect to spend several WEEKS gradually tapering your dose off. \n\nI was a little wary of this when he suggested such a quick change, but hey he is the psych and I did not want to get marked down as noncompliant. The first few days after the switch seemed perfectly normal so I assumed everything had gone okay. Little did I know that the average half life of fluoxetine is about a week, meaning that it takes about a month for your body to flush it out if you have been taking it for years like I had.\n\nCut to me in my outpatient therapy almost a month later to the day. I suddenly experience physical arousal that lasts all day. I think it might have something to do with entering trauma therapy and write it off for the first day. When it persisted the next day I started researching and discovered PGAD.\n\nAt this point I have been dealing with my PGAD symptoms for three weeks with no more than about two days at a time of 3/10 or lower. I managed one day to have about 8 orgasms with no more than temporary relief. My personal psychiatrist has been tapering me (properly) back to fluoxetine, but I am almost fully switched over now and had one of my worst days of symptoms yesterday. \n\nI am furious. Furious with the negligent psychiatrist who thought it was acceptable to essentially take a patient cold turkey off a medication they would been taking for years. At my own psychiatrist who was almost willing to send me home with a dismissal that this is a trauma symptom that will pass eventually. At the medical institution as a whole for not bothering with any significant research into this in the decades it is been noted. At the fact that a symptom flare up means being treated to intrusive thoughts of mutilating my own genitals just to make the maddening sensation stop. At the fact that it seems more and more likely each day that I will be the sort of endless medical struggle I read about so many others facing with this diagnosis.\n\nPeople who are suffering with this have hardly anywhere to turn, and no sure answers. We have horror stories of misprescribed psychotropic medications, electro-convulsive therapy, and clitoridectomies done in desperation. We have doctors making light of our situation with inappropriate comments about our sex lives and a miserable handful of half-hearted medical journals.\n\nI am sure most of you reading this know this intimately, but I guess I am just hoping for some small amount of catharsis from writing all this down. If anyone at all has stories of treatment for or effective ways to deal with this condition I am all ears. I think all of us could use a little positivity.\n\nI love you all and hope our struggle ends soon. Thank you for taking the time to write and reach out.  It is really good to know what is triggering PGAD.  \nI hope you are able to transition back to normality soon. You summed it up pretty much.\nI have PGAD for 2,5 weeks, visited urologist few days ago after basic urological tests he did came back negative despite the fact that I was telling him that problem might be also in pudendal nerve and therefore be should do MRI+serology+hormone tests.\nHe did just basic ones for std,took urine and took swabs from urethra -_-.\n\nYou know what he said after results came back negative?\n\" You are ok. I will give you referral to sexuologist (not urosexologist but psychiatric sexologist). I cannot help you anymore. Do you know where orgasms come from? Your brain. That is what you need to sort out.\"\n\nThere we go. He did not do further tests and did only basic ones and gave up right away. Ended it with sentence that many clueless doctors say - its in your head.\n\nWell, im not saying that because I focus on it that im not making symptoms worse. \nBut problem is not in my head, it is hormonal, or physical. That is how it started. I feel you here. My symptoms started in a group about the neurobiology of trauma. not exactly sexy. if I am having symptoms at the grocery store, on the train, and sitting around scrolling through social media while having all kinds of thoughts that are completely non-sexual, something is not wrong in my brain, it is wrong in my body.\n\nI hope you manage to get in to see a different pelvic floor specialist. How do you keep sane?\nI have more (major) and some minor health problems.\nI consider this one to be the worst.\n\nI mean, its much worse than having eczema or anything else. I do not know that I am keeping sane. my self harm urges have never been higher or more graphic. \n\nI describe it to people sometimes as being a bit like Chinese water torture. not inherently painful, but absolutely maddening in the continuous distracting, uncomfortable nature. Hello all\nI am of the belief that after having PGAD for the best part of a decade that it is a neurological disorder. So yes it is in the head but it is in the neurons. Many doctors act this way because they  do not know how to manage something that they either have no knowledge about or they are embarrassed to treat or they illustrate sheer misogyny and ambivalent sexism in their treatment. \nI am not an advocate of medicine for this disorder. I think that doctors are very subjective in their care of us. They view PGAD patients as genitals instead of humans. I do not take medications and will reject anything that tries to cut or saturate me with chemicals that my body may metabolize incorrectly. Also cannabinol does not work for me. \nI have found that my flares have lessened over the years. \nMedicine does need to know more about this disorder and I would invite anyone who wishes to help to try to become\nPart of the Olive Study at the university in Canada with Dr Pukall\u2019s crew. It is a five year study but it is a move in the right direction.\n\nKindest Regards\n\nKim S Ramsey. \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 wow you really should just give up on life. Any updates?  Has it subsided at all since switching back?", "The pgad is a devil!!!! I believe the pgad is possession by the devil !!believe it or not I have done a research about this and I found there is a devil that is lives in the private areas makes the person aroused all the time!!!!!!that is  the only explanation about this since doctors do not know shit !!its something supernatural Mine was caused by a doctor prescribing me a birth control that was completely inappropriate for my body\u2019s tolerance to hormones, which she knew full well. Mine has thankfully gone away, mostly, but it certainly was not a manifestation of the devil. \n\nI can see how you would think that though; that only something so terrible could be caused by something as equally terrible, the devil. What research did you do?\n\nI would caution you to be extremely skeptical about spiritual causes for physical ailments. That kind of thinking will just get in the way of proper treatment.", "Men of PGAD Group, your problem is possibly a prostatitis Mine is. I have bacterial prostatitis.\nPGAD goes away each time I take antibiotic and bacteria in prostate goes away, and each time bacteria returns, do does PGAD.\nI found out that I have bacterial prostatitis by having a semen culture done by urologist.\nI recommend taking a swab test done in urethra to found out if there is any presence of bacteria.\n\nSo, get that checked out.\nIf no bacteria is found, then you may have non bacterial prostatitis. Get your prostate checked out by urologist either way.\n\nNot saying that in your case it cannot be a different cause, but this is certainly a possibility. Yea that certainly could be a cause for some but unfortunately for me it was not Not for me I am perfectly healthy and have this I am wondering how prosthitis can cause PGAD", "Hormones For anyone whose PGAD was a result of hormones, did leveling them out help reduce/stop symptoms? I had my IUD removed in late May and this issue started for me early June. I went from having no period for three years to having five in the last ten weeks. The pelvic pain specialist I went to said my body is in a constant cycle right now and is cramping 24/7 without a break which is why I could be having pain/tightness/nerve sensations everywhere. I also have PCOS.", "I injured myself again I hate my medication. I really hate when it is interfering with relief from my sytoms.I will be at it for ours due to premature orgasms. Yes it is a listed side effect of the medication. As you can imagine this makes the problem worse cycling even longer. Last night I had a 4 our battle only for my hip to be thrown out of it is socket. I could not walk proply last night. When I went to go to sleep it was a struggle to lift my legs into the bed. I have had it with this crap if all I am doing is hurting myself more and more getting no where because the medication I am on then fuck it. I am not going to hold anything back from my doctor on my appointment at the end of the week. Hey I understand what you are going through and it will be okay Wow that is horrible ya let it all out and if they do not do something immediately fuck them and I hope you figure it out", "SNRI induced PGAD (update) previously: noticed some pgad symptoms on a high dose of meds, lowered the meds for a week and then just stopped taking them.\n\nstopped the meds three days ago and i do not feel any better. horrified of this staying. what do i do?

I just think about suicide", "The pgad is different now !! most of you know my story from 2 years ago!!i notice this pgad is different than the one before it not constant I do not have spontaneous orgasms sometimes I feel I am on the edge but nothing really happens!!!!is it the pgad back or the sex drive back after I am off ssri drugs!!!!and how would the sex drive would cause arousal!!!!!how sex drive prevent to you from sleep!!!!!im actually so confused  right know!!!i I do not know what to do if went on another anti depressants will it go away like the last time or make it worse!!!!!!!!", "Pgad... socially acceptable perversion? As most of you know, pgad is more likely to occur to those of whom have had their early years of life being exposed to sexual environments. It is an unwelcoming sensation, but here is how I try to cope~\n\nAs an 18 year old female, I have probably had this condition since 11, but only became completely aware of it after a few naughty mishaps with drugs, especially ecstasy. Only imagine the terror that filled me when I realised that it is not anxiety that is making my whole body shake in front of a group of friends...\n\nThe best way for me to explain how I constantly feel would be to compare this uncomfortable sensation to edging.. as if you are about to reach orgasm but you stop... and your body yearns for that great and joyous relief but alas, it never cums, and you are stuck in blue ball hell.\n\nIt is quite  difficult to reach orgasm as I am mostly tensed up most of the time and really uncomfortable.. the only time I manage to relax is when my mind is completely worry free, and that is usually around friends or out and about in public.. yet it is quite unsettling to almost let out a full moan or to roll your eyes backwards whilst speaking to your friend about current events or whilst standing in queue at your local supermarket.\n\nWhat has helped me through these very 'hard' times is humor honestly.. nothing funnier than being a walking human vibrator in public.\n\nDo you guys also panic whenever people tell you \"come here!\"... as if I am not cumming everywhere already.\n\nUnfortunately, no amount of masterbation or sex has satisfied me. It has, however, made me physically exhausted but still wanting to keep ringing the doorbell, and it has also put me in a constant state of proper orgasms for quite a few hours... which might sound like a day well spent,but honestly I just want to be able to relax and ride the bus without feeling like I am having a massive orgy with everyone I look at.\n\nHow have you been tackling your tickling pickle situation ? &gt;constant state of proper orgasms for quite a few hours...\n\nNot necessarily the worst thing. Ive had a lot of fun with situations like that lol Oh a fellow sex deviant ahaha, I do not mind them either sometimes, but it does get depressing when I am unable to maintain proper platonic friendships. \nIt is almost impossible to look at people in the eye when going through that state... or to speak to a family member whilst in the car ,-,awkward,-, Yes I get it, totally.\n\nBut it is more fun when you have got your favourite feeling just throbbing away intensely. And you know the person your talking too has no idea what your feeling, and physically cannot ever experience it. It is literally a fantasy for them, but for you it is just another fun day Oh wow, never saw it like that.. must take some confidence to not show it at all. How do you control your leg from not bouncing? Or your feet from not constantly moving, or the tensed up lower half of the stomach?\nMaybe I have got some skills to acquire.. Is yours 24-7 or do you get periods of relief? When god and pgad are on my side.. I am able to get maybe a day of relief.\nAfter a proper peak climax (usually after hours of suffering) I am able to get relief for about an hour or 2.. as long as I can keep my mind off it and be distracted the better honestly.\nI dont like being way too distracted from the pain because then I am surprised with a nice climax and well.. I like to be in control of any unsuspecting moans or pelvic movements :v They say misery loves company, that applies to us as well, but it is more \"insatiable loves company\". Not necessarily to have sex with, but more for validation that we are not alone and we are not freaks. I visit several PGAD forums and just reading all the shared familiar experiences gives me some stability and helps to diffuse the intense itch I have to several outlets and not just 100% focused on just my wife, if that makes sense. My big issue with this coping mechanism is the fact that as a man (54... had it all my life) I have to understandably rachet back my involvement so as to not seem mencaing. Just having a penis in these parts is plenty menacing enough and that is without me saying anything. That is been on my mind for a while, being a male in this society is still pretty stigmatised, have people taken you seriously when you were not able to hide it or have they just assumed the worst in you? And if I may ask, does pgad in males differ from females? Do you get boners or leaks? The only medical professional I have told about this issue smiled and said, \"Lucky!\" That made me stop complaining altogether. The symptoms are just as varied for men as it is for women, mine is a constant buzz from my penis to my toes and the only way to stop the buzz ids by getting an erection. Basically, I am inducing an erection all day long to diminish the tingling That sounds incredibly tiring.. really wish this condition was taken more seriously. Maybe more awareness can be spread by trying different doctors? Surely some tests can be done.. As frustrating as it is, my condition is very mild compared to what is more commonly reported. I am lucky that there is almost no pain involved.\n\nIs cannabis legal where you are at? It is helped me immensely Hi, as I am not a man I do not know what arousal feels like for the male of the species. My PGAD started 10 months ago. \nWomen do not get boners  (Americanism there we brits tend to say \u2018hard on\u2019) as such but I suppose the blood rush does swell the clitoris a lot. My PGAD  makes me extremely anxious as the feeling is all around the genital area it is hard to explain. Although sometimes it is more in one area than another. I am sure you are well aversed in the female sexual anatomy so I do not need to detail anymore. And yes some women get \u2018wet\u2019 like normal sexual arousal. Most women with PGAD find it hard to orgasm. ( that is really not good \ud83d\ude22). Some days I cannot function and all I want to do is cry. I am lucky that mine is mild. I cannot begin to imagine what it must be like living with a severe case. Some women end their own lives as they find it too hard to bear. It is very sad. My ADHD consultant said this may be worth trying but it is really expensive to get it prescribed. It is still illegal here in the uk. About $300 for a months supply. I will find the money tho. Just a quick comment re the bit about being exposed to sexual environments in early years. I am so not in that bag. My upbringing was so not sexual in the slightest, I was a virgin when I met husband at 17 we have been together for 45 years and remained faithful all this time. In this case I hate to be different. There seems to be a link between pgad and other conditions such as ocd, adhd or anxiety... could one of these be effecting you? I think so, however none of the healthcare professionals seem to see it and I cannot find any case studies regarding the link. I know it is been reported that it is often with people who have had or have got mental health issues like me. It started about 9 months after starting the ADHD meds. I had an extreme emotional evening and then there it was, ping! Just like that!  My counsellor thinks it fired off something in a neuro receptor in my wonderful ADHD brain. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Any female here who has snapchat I would like to discuss my issues privately with someone I need help Out of all communicating apps.. why snapchat? This is so relatable with me. When I was 14 I took ecstasy and that was about the time I started having these issues. I also get that euphoric feeling when I am super stressed... only problem is actually cum like squirt. It is not a lot but enough to be visible and make me embarrassed. I say I have bladder problems but at closer inspection you can tell it is cum. I do not know how to stop it. I have also had a spine injury and I was told that can play a huge factor in these kind of things...", "Trintellix and PGAD? I have been taking Trintellix (antidepressant) for about 6-7 months now and Vyvaanse (stimulant) for 3 months. \nTwo nights ago I noticed a big urge to masturbate, so I did, but then the feeling of arousal just would not go away. No matter how many times I tried, it would not disappear. Now for the last two days it is been constant arousal every time I sit down or stop moving momentarily. It is frustrating and I have read a lot of pages on PGAD and how it drives people to suicide. \nDoes anybody have any advice or information? \nI am going to try weening myself off of the antidepressant because I heard they have some time to PGAD.", "Do I have PGAD? I am a 14 year old female. For the past few months, I have felt a tingling sensation in my vagina. Sometimes it can be relieved with an orgasm, by walking, or using the restroom. Sometimes I feel a slight stabbing paint down there, and on my upper left thigh. It is not extremely painful, it is just uncomfortable. I does not last very long though. Also, I feel as if I cannot fully empty my bladder. Could this be PGAD? And if it is, can PGAD go away by its self, or is it permanently there? I am scared. Ever since I heard of PGAD, I have been experimenting my symptoms worse. Not sure if I am being a hypochondriac. I feel like the tingling sensation is caused by the not being able to fully empty my bladder.", "I had not got a proper night of good sleep in weeks It always starts when I am nearly asleep. In this moment when you are so nicely relaxed and your dreams slowly appear. And BAM. It comes the uncomfortable feeling and a need to press, scratch, correct something in there. And I am usually going nuts for about one or 2 hours with turning, trying to spread my legs, find position that does not press on my bladder too much, going to pee maybe 6 times. I have just finish my    water infection medications that I took for over a week but as I thought- it is not UTI or anything like this. I think it is in my head and the more I think about it the more it freaks me out. It always comes at night and I cannot sleep and I am so tired and I just want to sleep... please help This happens to me also, I am in bed relaxed and I feel everything tighten and then pulsing.  At first I thought it was bladder related and made sure to pee before bed, but that did not solve my issue.  I find sleeping on my back is the worst and when I switch positions it happens.  My only safe way to sleep is on my right side.  I wake up tired and with a sore back from arching.  Thankfully, some nights are better than others and I get by ok. This is going to sound totally counterintuitive, but I know a woman who suffers from PGAD who can only fall asleep with a vibrator inside her. Please stop. I am not using things like this. The way you comment on this thread is really dodgy It could be spine related if it is worse in certain positions. Maybe Tarlov cyst. Try maybe getting an mri to check if everything\u2019s ok.

I have been suffering from PGAD for about 3 years now and I think it was probably SSRIs that caused it. I always had good weeks and bad ones, but there was never a whole month in which I did not feel the symptoms.\n\nIn the last 4 months, however, I am doing very well, I almost did not have bad days. The one thing that I think has helped me the most was starting homeopathic treatment. I started it without any faith in it, but it has actually helped with a lot of things: depression, anxiety, PGAD and skin issues. But I have also been making changes to my diet for about 5 months now. Nothing big, just trying to eat less sugar, gluten and dairy.\n\nI also started to exercise more often last year. High-intensity trainings were helping SO MUCH. But then I injured my knee and started following low-intensity programs. I do everything at home, with YouTube videos.\n\nSo I guess that is what has been helping me A LOT, and hopefully this can help someone else as well. The only thing homeopathic that is worked for me is Hyland's leg cramps. Because it works so well, I do believe there is something to homeopathy. What specifically has worked in terms of PGAD?\n\nETA: oh, and Arnica ... that stuff's magic My PGAD symptoms are almost completely gone. It is unbelievable. After about 3 weeks of homeopathic treatment, I stopped having the burning sensations and the feeling of being on the brink of orgasm the whole day (which would not go away no matter how many orgasms I actually had). Before, that would happen for 3-4 days in a row at least twice a month, sometimes more. There are still days where I get the annoying feeling, but I feel I can control it better, it is not controlling me anymore. But again, I feel my mental health is much better in the last months, I am eating better and I am also on therapy, so it is hard to say if homeopathy is the only thing helping me. You say you got better with homeopathic treatment and I do not know anything about homeopathy. Could you tell us more about which treatment you are using. Is it only diet and exercise or you are using supplements, oils, etc...? If you are willing to, could you please give us names and dosage? Hi! I am sorry it took me so long to answer.\n\nWhen it comes to homeopathy, they do not offer treatment for a condition, but for a person. The homeopathic doctor will talk to you and prescribe something for you specifically. So I recommend looking for a good homeopathic doctor.\n\nI do use some supplements, but I do not take them every day. I cannot tell for sure if they are helping with PGAD. I take Vit. D3 (1000 iu) frequently, and sometimes Omega 3 (I like this one ( Also, sometimes I take turmeric and magnesium, but not very often.\n\nEdit: It is a good idea to take Vit. K2 with D3. I do that sometimes (100mcg of K2 with 1000 iu D3)", "Male, 62 y.o; prostate damage, pgad This is so strange and I have gotten used to it, but it is still so grange. I am glad I have found a group to talk about this to. I have had this for about 2 months. Every day I wake up and have a feeling of butterflies in my chest and an erection that never really goes away. Which Makes pissing very hard. Looking at a pretty girl makes my butterflies go too a completely crazy stage. If I get too excited I will either get pre cum or I will just explode in my pants. These orgasms create heavenly like euphoria. That can last for awhile. They are like super orgasms. The most I have gotten is like 10 of these a day. Most days I either get 1 or 2 of these, or none. But either way I get constant erection and a butterflies feeling like I have a crush on the prettiest girl ever. My doctor thinks my prostate is damaged or swelled up. My symptoms started a week after prostatis recovery. My doctor wants to see me. I have no idea how to explain this to him. Do you guys think that fixing the prostate is a way to cure pgad. I do not know because I still do not know what the fuck pgad really even is. But it has something to do with orgasms so that is why I think this may be what I have. Also I will get random urinary urges and piss 10 times a day. I am thinking prostatis damaged me for life. Hello, are you actually 62 years old? First of all I am very sorry for your symptoms. Secondly this condition and the urges you experience including urination urges, I believe are due to your nerves being inflamed in some way, they are probably being compressed somehow. Go to a physical therapist to check the tension levels in your pelvic floor muscles. Oh shit, sorry I meant to say 32. My bad lol. No I am not an old guy. Yea I believe  my prostatis affected my nerves badly which causes these urinary urges. I have noticed that my pgad takes a break when I get those urinary urges. Then it goes back to crazy excitement in my genitals. I notice if it gets real bad it will also put me in a confused state, kind of like I am in a acid trip. And my genitals will tingle with euphoria, and my chest. Are u male? And do you get similar symptoms? I would like to talk to someone about this and see if this seems familiar. Sometimes  the pleasure is  too much. Like these big O\u2019s are out of control. Unfortunately these are called flare ups when it gets too bad. A flare up for me includes the 1) arousal 2)spontaneous orgasms 3) a long orgasm feeling that puts me in a euphoric stage and fucks with my head and the. 4) a series of pissing and urges to piss. Then the cycle continues. What is it like for you? If you want to talk about it Dm me Man I am struggling also. Burgers to masturbate or deal with it in other ways like hookups. Spontaneous, cannot relax until I relase", "So much pain!!!! I cannot take it anymore I went to the supermarket to get some groceries thinking I was like any normal person!!that nothing would happened to me I had intense sharp pain unbearable I felt like I am going to pass out I ran crying to my car called my family to pick me up could not drive!!its taking over my entire body I cannot function like a normal person now!!!its getting worse and worse every day!!", "Do I have PGAD? Hello everyone. I am a 17 year old female. A couple of weeks ago I woke up one morning with a random tingling feeling in my genital area. I cannot explain the feeling but it feels like it is pulsing. I have read online that this may be the result of PGAD however it has improved within the last couple of days but it is very annoying. I do not have orgasms. I am just worried In case it is PGAD. When I wear jeans it tends to get worse. Does anyone know if this could be PGAD or something else. I have spoken to my mum about this and she thinks it may be a yeast infection. I was on birth control and that messed up my period completely so maybe it is related to that? Someone please help \ud83d\udc98 Have you ever had an orgasm before? PGAD is a disorder where you are constantly aroused, and this means that you will have a similar sensation to the ones you feel before the orgasm. If you ever masturbated, it feels like you are stuck at the point in the middle of where you started masturbating and you had orgasm (maybe even closer to an orgasm). And this usually means that your clitoris is kind of \u2018pulsating\u2019 or \u2018twitching\u2019 because the blood is rushing down there.\n\nIf you ever had an orgasm, try to relate this feeling to that, if they are similar you may have PGAD or you may basically just be horny and you may want to masturbate. If you never had an orgasm, just try to touch yourself maybe and see if it changes the situation (makes it better or worse?)\n\nI am saying all of these because it is hard to explain a sensation. If you are not aroused and you have yeast or infection, you would have an uncomfortable feeling, it is a similar sensation to a body rash or a scratch, but you have it in your vulva. \n\nI think if it is uncomfortable and you are geniunely suspicious of yeast infection or an UTI, you should see a doctor. But I think you should be sure about if it is just arousal or not, because doctors offices/hospitals are kind of dangerous right now Hi thanks for this. I am just so confused as to what this could be. I masturbated a couple nights before and woke up randomly with this feeling. I find it difficult to tell if it feels like I am aroused or not. However I know that I do not want it to feel like this and it is just very annoying and uncomfortable. I know I am not in the mood to touch myself and I am worried that if I do it might make this worse. I know the feeling is not in my vulva. I am pretty sure it is my clitoris. it may be because of the boredom and stress of this corona situation. Try to keep yourself busy, and see if it goes away when you keep busy. For me, it goes away when I am invested in some hobby, or playing video games. I have this sensation at different times in my life, I am 25 years old. But right now it is very harsh because of the quarantine. It makes me go crazy because no matter how many times you masturbate, it doesnt go away. So you are doing the good thing by not masturbating I think. It will tire you for no reason. Just try to keep yourself occupied. If it feels very severe, just go to the bathroom, peeing sometimes helps. Take deep breaths and try to calm yourself down, try to relax your muscles down there (because I realized if I clench my muscles it becomes worse). Good luck.\n\nAnd try to see a therapist maybe after the virus. I will try to do the same because I recently discovered that this is actually a disorder :D thank you so much! Hi! I am a 17 year old female too, and I 100% understand how frustrating this is because its been happening with me and continued non-stop for about a week. The constant tingles and feeling of pressure on my genitals and bladder, and it even felt like there was pressure on both my legs, almost making it hard to walk. Every second felt like being stuck in the midst of an orgasm. It really freaked me out, but I promise you that you will get through it. You may have PGAD, but do NOT panic. When I googled my symptoms for the first time and learned about PGAD, my gosh you would not believe how much I cried. The thought of having to endure that kind of discomfort for all eternity was NOT a pretty picture, but what I did not realize about PGAD is that there is no ONE cure because for every person there is almost always a different reason, a different thing that is CAUSING the symptoms. Whether its some sort of urinal infection, or maybe its enlarged blood vessels in the genital area, or interstitial cystitis; whatever it is that is causing you to feel pressure/tingling/arousal in your genitals, its SO SO likely that you can treat it once the cause is identified. Unfortunately this is not always the case for some, but please please do not lose hope! I found that when I shared my struggle with my mom and doctor, I felt a lot better mentally and was on the path to getting better, and I learned not to trust everything the internet tells me: namely that there was no way to \"cure\" this and that the people out there with PGAD are constantly suffering. \n\nFor me, it took an x-ray to find out that I was heavily constipated; so much so that my stool was putting pressure on my pudental nerve, which is the nerve responsible for feeling sensations/arousal in the genital area. Looks like I was paying for my lack of exercise and failure to ever drink enough fluids. After a few days of taking laxatives and running to the bathroom almost constantly to clean out my system, the tingling in my genitals went away as my bowels eventually cleared out and feces stopped pressing on my nerves. Nevertheless, I know your situation might be scary and frustrating, but know that you are not alone and that there is always hope. There is also an incredible Facebook support group with over 600 members, and it really helped me out; called \"PGAD Support Group - Entry Requests\". Very professional and can help refer you to specialists, plus the support and tips they have to offer is amazing. \n\nWishing you all the luck in the world :) Thank you so much for your reply it has really helped me :) I got PGAD after stopping and restarting birth control a year later.  It has never completely gone away, but it did get much better when I stayed off birth control.  It was almost completely gone 6 years after the last time I took birth control, but unfortunately, I started taking birth control again in 2014 and it came back after I went off.  \n\nMine is okay now but I still have bad flareups.  I have read other stories of this starting after people stop birth control.  If you are prone to this, the best thing you can do is stay away from birth control!", "Does this sound like PGAD? Hello everyone! I suppose you are annoyed by such a type of posts but I guess you can understand the worry that comes with symptoms similar to PGAD.\n\nA few days ago I got this bladder pressure and this weird sensation in my vagina, similar to arousal but not quite. You get the idea. Usually I have history with peeing often and a month ago I had a UTI, but this time the pressure on my bladder is unreal. Sometimes it feels like the feeling when you have sex and your bladder is full.... I am super scared, my mom told me not to panic but how can I not?!\nI am seeing my gynecologist next week but until then I am dying.\nOther than the often peeing and bladder pressure and the vagina feeling i do not have other symptoms. I do not have pain ( except my bladder when I try not to pee for a long time) and no clitoris tingling, it is just inside my V. Never experienced something like that. Oh, and also I am under great stress and anxiety now as i Am battling OCD ( and I read there is a correlation to PGAD). But can you tell me please does it sound like one?\n\nThanks in advance.", "Possible PGAD at 17 Ruining my Life Around 2 months ago I experienced my first ever symptoms of PGAD which lasted me around a week and a half. I was treated for a UTI but the only thing that made these symptoms go away was my period. They came back last week just after my period had ended. I was experiencing pressure around the clitoris, fluttering, and random sharp pains inside the vaginal wall. It was never as bad as it was today. Today I began to cry and have a panic attack in public with my family because walking was so uncomfortable on that area. My parents are extremely angry at me because I refuse to tell them what is going on. I know they will not believe me or they will tell me I am overreacting. I live an extremely small town with dumb doctors who I am 99% sure do not know what PGAD even is. I am stressed out of my mind right now. I cannot live this way and I refuse to. What am I supposed to do? I cannot open up to my parents. And I have no access to a gynecologist/woman\u2019s health doctor. Do you have a therapist? I had one but he was extremely unprofessional. He claimed I was feeling bad because I would not turn to Christianity. Obviously I stopped seeing him, but as for now, I do not have a therapist. Do you have access to a car? Maybe you can see a health department in a bigger city? I am dealing with the same thing. It is driving me NUTS! I cant sleep. People dont get it. I feel like I need to pee and have overstimulation. I need HELP I am going through the same thing :( Why do not you have access to a Womens dr??\nIn the mean time try to help your symptoms by taking warm baths &amp; use a heating pad. You can also try some pelvic floor relaxation exercises. A lot of the stretches they show in this video I learned in pelvic PT &amp; they helped a lot. Also I know that doing kegels is probably the last thing you want to do but it can help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Kegels in combination with pelvic floor stretches has helped me significantly. Wear loose fit bottoms, no jeans or anything that presses on your lower abdomen. And distract yourself at night with things like meditation videos on YouTube. That is how I have fallen asleep many nights. Best of luck my friend! \n\n I got it when I was 15 after coming off of an ssri. Try asking a doctor about perozin aka minipress  I am not sure. Why?  It is very rare to get it so do not worry unless it happens. If it does, taking minipress. Might help. ok thanks", "I wish there was more info The last few days have been horrible, no amount of anything has helped the symptoms and flair ups in the slightest, I just want to know why its being like this I want to be normal PGAD is tricky to research if you do not know what you are looking for. There is a very active Facebook group with access to literature, lists of medical professionals who know what is up, and some of the nicest people on the internet.\n\n\n\nHere is the link to request admission to the private group. I can relate. There is some information online but none of it is much help as far as what to do about it. When I describe what is happening to doctors a couple have even said, \"Most women have the opposite problem.\"", "Is this PGAD? It started Friday evening, shortly after an intense edging session where I ended the session before orgasm/ejaculation. I do not usually do this. Saturday I began getting feelings that I was \"close\" to orgasm even though I  was flaccid and then masturbated / had sex a couple times hoping to relieve this. The feeling of being close to orgasm is still there but only when I think about it (i.e. think about getting the feeling of the tip of my penis). I can sometimes feel my prostate spasming and if I think about it when I pee my pee stream slows / cuts out for that second. It is hard to fall asleep but once I am asleep there is no issue. Unfortunately when I wake up, the anxiety comes racing back, I start thinking about it, then I start getting the feelings in my penis. My testicles are also paining several times a day. Is this PGAD? I am absolutely terrified and I fear my anxiety is making it worse. I have never been treated for anxiety but fear I have some sort of mild OCD. Did I cause some sort of damage with edging? I am completely lost, terrified and am in the process of booking a doctors appointment.", "Feeling hopeless\u2026 Ever since my pudendal nerve block injection, my life has been hell. I used to get some sort of relief from masturbating multiple times (relief for a few days) but ever since the injection I have gotten none. Everything is swollen down there and the sensations are worse than ever. The doctor now told me over the phone that the steroid they injected can do this to some patients\u2026 wtf!!! And I have to wait 6 weeks to hope it wears off. Some nights I have not been able to sleep because of this and everyday has been hell. Sorry I keep posting and ranting I just do not know what to do\u2026", "If it are not broke...? Kia ora PGAD fam \u270c\ufe0f\ud83c\udffb \n\nSo I guess I am looking for advice here, as someone who suspects but has not sought diagnosis for PGAD. I am pretty sure I have PGAD because my whole life I have had spontaneous episodes of \"someone walking over my grave\" as an ex put it - but it was not just goosebumps,  there was also brief shaking, tingles up and down my spine and pulsing pelvic floor pressure. It was not until I was sexually active and intentionally achieved orgasm that I realized how similar the feelings are. I have also experienced persistent arousal and gential/nipple sensitivity for as long as I can remember understanding what those things feel like (age 11 maybe?)\n\nWhat I am wondering is if it is worth seeking out a diagnosis. I am already on SSRIs (paroxetine) for anxiety and OCD, I already take magnesium supplements for RLS and I get b12 injections every three months to make up for deficiency. I am not sure what else a doctor could do to help me and while I find the episodes and general discomfort sub optimal at times, I have thus far learned to live with it. When unmedicated I was masturbating at least twice (two 'sessions', usually multiple orgasms) per day which I assumed was due to what I perceived as high sex drive. I now know it is for relief and since starting my SSRIs (6 years ago) I would say it is more like one session per day with the occasional day off.\n\nAs long as my negative experiences do not worsen... is it worth trying to \"fix\" it by going through the motions? If it is causing you distress at all, then you should try to get it diagnosed. There are medicines that help. Also, there are therapies. Depending on what causes it, they could help you get rid of it.\n\nI am going to get diagnosed because it is a progressive disorder. It may get worse. Mine has started to burn and get very itchy (I was able to get relief with Amitriptyline).\n\nYou might want to join the Facebook groups for information.", "PGAD and me. I am pretty sure I have PGAD since having umbilical hernia surgery several months ago. I orgasm day and night, but not to the point of it ruining my life, tho it is becoming more consuming and pleasurable.  I have to be careful riding in the car or subway and listening to certain types music both which cause me to orgasm over and over, the car especially.  Leaf blowers and lawnmowers cause spontaneous orgasms.  Certain other noises and vibration like live music seems go right through me, which is nice when I am alone and unsettling when I am around others.  I seem to do a pretty good job covering it up and was wondering if there are others who found ways to deal with it or does it go away. Hey\n\nThat sounds kind of frustrating. I (22f) became highly orgasmic after going on a certain anti-depressant. Like you now I have to be careful of the clothes I wear incase I get too much friction.\n\nSo far do you kind of enjoy it? I honestly enjoy being like this - when it does not interrupt my day - but I feel like so many others have it so much worse and it is a nightmare! Yes, it is very pleasing.  I do not feel any pain other than the tightening in my stomach. Omg thought I lost you! PGAD can be a nightmare, but it can also be too much of a good thing. Mine is mild and constant and only becomes a nightmare when I do not have the privacy to deal with it. When put into perspective and you compare it to the ones who truly suffer I do have it lucky Would you be willing to share what medication it is? Also, how long were you taking it before this side effect began? As a mental health practitioner there is never enough info about the sexual side effects of meds. It is always helpful to be aware of the possibilities when someone starts a new med.", "Terrified I am 20F and have never had issues with this before but am absolutely terrified this will never go away. Last Friday I had surgery and the night before started experiencing intense tingling and throbbing in my clitoris. Granted I removed some build up from under the hood which may have irritated the area. Following surgery Friday these sensations came back and were almost unbearable Friday and Saturday. Yesterday and today the stinging and tingling and itching has been going away slowly and is not as intense, but it is still bothersome. I am hoping it will get better every day and this might just be due to anxiety, hormones, irritation, increased blood flow in the area and my period. Is this how it started for anyone else? I am a 28F, my PGAD started last year in March. I started pelvic PT in August of last year and my symptoms improved drastically, but in the last month they have returned so I need to get back on my routine of doing my exercises. \nI definitely had that fear that my symptoms would never go away. I spent about 2 1/2 weeks not getting any relief or a full nights sleep. Stress is definitely a contributor for me so I try my best to keep my stress levels low. \n\nTo help relieve symptoms, what has worked for me is using a heating pad, hot baths with Epsom salts, pelvic stretches and pelvic strengthening exercises (a lot of which you can find on YouTube, but I do not recommend doing any kind of squat). CBD and ginger tea has helped a bit as well!  \nBest of luck to you! Mine seems to have started after I stopped taking amitriptyline for chronic migraines. Do you know what triggered yours? Please check the support group on Facebook - pgad support. I am still trying to figure that out unfortunately:/ I am eliminating as much soy as possible out of my diet as well as highly acidic foods that could irritate my bladder. I think stress has been contributing to my symptoms also because my PGAD has not been this bad since last year when I was going through a lot of stress. Being cooped up in my house and not having errands or projects to do each day has had an impact on my depression, on top of that not being able to fly home to Oregon to see my family has me feeling pretty down :( \n\nHow long were you taking amitriptyline? Maybe you are having a stress response to getting off of the medication? I was on amitriptyline for almost a year but was on the lowest dose possible. I contacted my OBGYN about the symptoms and used the explicit phrase \u201cpersistent arousal\u201d and they said it was within the range of normal for healing from the hymenectomy I had. It is been getting better every week since I had the surgery so I am hoping it will go away soon enough. It is definitely worse on days I am more depressed or anxious. I am now just dealing with random warmth or tingles throughout the pelvic area, rather than clitoral swelling and throbbing. I am thinking it was the combination of surgery swelling, hormone changes from birth control and stopping amitriptyline. It is worse on my period but those have been all over the place right now. Hoping it continues to improve Ya those symptoms kind of mimic mine as well. When my PGAD comes back it starts out with unwanted arousal, then pressure in my bladder and I have to pee constantly, then I will get a tingling/numbness around my labia, with the occasional shooting pain in my clitoris. \nThat is great your symptoms are getting better as each day passes! I did not know you had a hysterectomy and I think that would definitely exacerbate PGAD symptoms since that is an invasive procedure. \nEven if your symptoms go away, it might be a good idea to tell your OBGYN that you want to go to Pelvic Physical Therapy and they should give you a referral. That way if your symptoms come back in the future, you will be prepared and will know some exercises that may help your symptoms go away faster!", "On and Off? Does anyone else have symptoms that seem to go away but then come back? Im 17 M and i had this a few weeks ago pretty bad for about 3 days but then it went away seemingly with a lot of masturbation. A couple weeks later and now its back. Its not as bad this time but im just curious if anyone has anything similar. Stretching seems to help temporarily for me and if im doing any sort of exercise i barely notice it, but is there anything else anyone has tried that has worked for them? Im also trying to not masturbate to see if that provides a more permanent solution. My symptoms are ever present but gets much worse in stressful times. Exercise and pot are probably the best fixes, albeit temporary", "Anti depressants !!!! Guys I am going to take seroxat  I read it reduces the sex drive !!have anyone tried it  before ??? Please someone answer!! doesnt reduce x drive but reduces depression and anxiety as well as gives an energy boost. It is your mind that caused this and the more you think about it the worse it is. I promise you. Sing a song in your head every time you feel t and after even the first hour you will feel better.  Your mind is MUCH more powerful than you think. You can make your body feel anything. \nThis is causing you stress and it is stress that is causing it. It is a vicious cycle.

I am not sexually active at all to be honest. But within the last year I am having urinary issues. As well as what seems like I am about to cum. Under stress, in pain... you name it. I was working for awhile and my bladder would shoot out drips of like water. Not urine but water. I am in constant pain and no doctor can help me. I am so unsure what to do.

I have not been able to get any medical help because none of my gynecologists had even heard of PGAD, so I am turning to trusty old Reddit! \n\nMy PGAD flares up certain times and then subsides, but has been really bad since working for home. All my triggers are here: sitting for long periods of time, lots of boredom, and being able to be on my phone (or masturbate heh) as much as I want.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for preventing flare ups or calming them down?\nThe only thing I have found helpful so far is just standing/walking around at least once an hour to keep the blood from pooling down there. \n\nAre there any sitting positions that you all find helpful? Have you used ice packs or anything like that? Mindfulness techniques?\n\nAnything would be appreciated, thank you all! Does masturbation help or does it just keep repeating itself or ...... does the feeling come back every so often or how often?? In my experience, masturbation provides relief for like 10 minutes and then it comes back worse than ever. =\\ Oh my goodness, so if you do not do anything at all, does the feeling keep repeating, or not.  or just if you relieve it then it repeats ?? And if so do you get pain, or contractions or both? No pain, just arousal/swelling/vaginal contractions (like on the brink of orgasm). And yeah, when I am having a flare-up it just keeps happening no matter what Hahaah. The only things that help are being distracted by talking to people, or by doing physical exercise. Oh  ok . Please tell me this does not wake you up at night or restless sleep. No, does not affect sleeping thankfully! What about you? Have you found things that help? I would get restless at night so now I take a low dose of Xanax, to help me sleep at night all the way through.  The day time if I am not busy or occupied I will get the feeling of being aroused and get hard for no reason, im just thankful it does not happen when I am out shopping,  haha ,or it would really be embarrassing. Oop, tell me why I thought this was a female-only group hahah. It must be way harder for guys bc the issue is more visible =\\ Yes it is ,trying to hide erections is horrible. Lol at least it does not show on women. Lol Trueeee :( Yep \ud83d\ude18 male with perineum (the highly nerve packed area between genitals and booty) focused pgad here. i do a half leg fold (one leg on ground other ankle tucked under resting leg), this helps lift my perineum and keep pressure off of the pudendal nerve. it helps delay pressure build up if you must stay sitting. i would use this as a starter position till leg gets tired then go regular sitting, and repeat opposite side when you resume sitting again. also maybe explore getting a donut pillow (used if you break your tail bone or for other pelvic issues) as this can possibly do the same thing without fancy leg positions. honest mistake really since women are more likely to bring the issue to a doctor and get a name for it &gt;\\_&lt; . im just glad that i get to skip the visible portion. but my trade off is pain instead so you cant escape something going wrong as a man Woah thank you! Do you know if this works for female PGAD as well? since you seem to have a perineum component to cause pressure build up it prolly will. it at least doesnt hurt to try the leg part and if its a noticeable improvement try the donut pillow, thankfully not having a tail bone issue will allow you to more firmly sit on the pillow and keep your nerve area free from stress. Ooo, thank you so much!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f np. pressure from sitting is the worst since it slowly creeps up on you. thankfully i have a huge comfy chair so i only need to do the leg positioning to release it but i did at one time look into if donut pillows help \\^\\_\\^. the only major difference between a male and female perineum is the prostate (ugh this hurts to always be set to on btw) and possible larger urethra passage. the nerves feed into your entire genital system and tush from your perineum and pudendal nerve. making it hell if this is the most active portion of your pgad issue.", "Advice for a male? First of all, is this condition linked to constant erections in males or does it also work without one? What are your experiences? \nSecondly, what advice would you give on how to deal with it? No, it does not have to include priapism. In fact, my symptoms go away with an erection which is exactly why I constantly stimulate myself. \n\nAdvice? Aside from constant stimulation, I am a big fan of high cbd with a bit of thc cannabis Thanks for your reply. Did you get diagnosed by a doctor? Not sure what kind of doctor is the right one for that problem. I tried, but all he (endocrinologist) just said, \"lucky!\"\n\nI would try an endocrinologist first just to check your hormone levels then a urologist next. Damn, what an idiot endocrinologist. Exactly. it depends on the man. constant prolonged erection needs to be seen at a hospital as it is called priapism. if it continues it can cause even more nerve and tissue damage so it needs to be seen ASAP. However i myself do not experience erection so it varies person to person. My issue is the nerves themselves go into such a frenzy that an erection or natural release becomes unable to happen. So here is what i recommend as a action plan.\n\nOne, a urologist will be needed. It is rare for a male to REPORT this issue but it is assumed that men just dont report it. Plus they also believe that just like 1% of women having the issue the same 1% of men have the issue. There are tests and they may refer you to a spine specialist to search for any spinal anomalies. They also may refer you to a pelvis specialized physical therapist to help relieve and move pelvic pressure.\n\nTwo some people rely on numbing creams. Be careful as constant use of these can cause medical issues.\n\nThree, depending on how invasive the issue is a therapist may be needed so that you have a place that you can relieve any mental stress it causes, and trust me it causes a tone of stress. there are some psych meds that do help.\n\nFour, A pain specialist may be needed as a last resort as there are various pelvic nerve branches that they can do blocks for and also various medications that can be recommended. You will be put on a pill management plan to monitor and make sure you dont abuse the medications.\n\nEdits sorry my brain works funny. Ouch honestly not taking you serious is such a huge misconduct for a medical professional. An endocrinologist doesnt have the right medical background to treat this issue is the problem. PGAD is considered a genital pain disorder so approach a urologist as they deal with genitals and will know how and where to refer you to in your lving area. \n\nand to be honest this particular medical issue is only considered lucky  by those with out it. It is a living hell that i would only wish upon someone i truly hated.\n\nEdits sorry my brain skips around alot Thanks for the encouraging words. No, I did not find it skipping around at all. Very well structured actually lol ty i end up editing longer posts tons of times to refine responses. so my usual edit note is that or something similar. It has been rough trying to find my personal best treatment plan. So i occasionally dip into here to help answer male oriented issues as most research and articles focus hard on the female aspect as it is way more commonly reported by women.", "Could this be a symptom of FND?

I am the same person lol just  a different account I havent tried cannabis , does it have any benefit? This is going to sound mystical I know, but I have found cannabis has a weird way of giving your body the \"medicine\" it needs. Try using some oil infused with high CBD/THC blend if you have access to a dispensary Blend the CBD oil with cannabis? High CBD/THC Cannabis oil (it is like hash oil) mixed with massage oil. Massaged on and in. My wife uses it occasionally and it makes it numb to pain but super sensitive as well. I use it too by massaging it on my penis, and it helps my PGAD tremendously Oh really thanks I will give it a go You are welcome and good luck! Interesting.. I use cannabis medically as it seems to compliment &amp;treat my complex set of issues pretty well ( autism/ADHD/joint problems caused by hypermobility, chronic nausea, sleeping trouble, menstrual cramps...), Without the paradoxical effects I get from a lot of medication,  but it does not seem to have much of an effect on pgad symptoms.. Ive had days where it has made it slightly easier to focus on sth else.though Cannabis is a weird plant. From my understanding, your body knows how to heal itself, but it uses the cannabinoids from pot to fuel the system. In and of itself marijuana fixes nothing, your body is the one that fixes things by the way the receptors convert the THC/CBD molecules. Not very scientific I know, but that is why it is unpredictable. In the end it is almost always your body fixing itself .. \n\nThere are definitely also people that do not react well to cannabis, and people that have some benefits and some side effect, but for me and for many others, it seems to be exactly what is missing to bring a lot of things back into balance.. \n\nThanks to this weird plant I am healthy enough to go to college, I started pharmacy school one year ago to learn more ( and one day do more research) on what exactly is going on with our endocannabinoid system).. never thought this dream would still become true.\n\nAnyway, I just found out about PGAD being an clinically known disorder after suffering from it on and off almost my entire life. \nIt has caused me so much trouble and embarrassment and distraction, and yet I have never even googled it nor mentioned it to a medical professional - my body is \"extra \" enough to piss my doctors off anyway, never behaving the way they would expect.. \n\nI always figured my different sensory processing due to autism/ADHD ( no filter, no way of ignoring unnecessary sensory information ), in combination with the Laxity of my collagen that effects pretty much my whole body ( lax joints, elastic, easy to bruise tissue) somehow contributed to this condition.. \n\n\nKk, sorry for the infodump, I am just excited about this discovery, lol. I should probably go make my own post^^ \nGood luck you all Oh, I am just as excited about this plant... We have been cultivating it for 6 years now and am so much better off for it Try CBD oil on it Does masturbation help it \ud83e\udd14", "Herbal remedies Has anyone tried any herbal remedies or visited a naturopath for this condition?", "Does sex fix PGAD? Super stressed from work, and taking LSD last night triggered it. The week prior I noticed my left eye was getting twitchy, and a very blissful state before I slept, after smoking weed.\n  \nI have been forcefully celibate for a couple of years, will sex fix this? It is kind of excruciating. sex will not fix it. been there, tried that ugh wtf do i do then?\n  \nDo I just try my best to absolutely reduce stress? there is not much you can do, PGAD is pretty rare. try taking baths, applying heat or cold to your genital area, reduce stress etc I would start by discussing your symptoms with your family doctor. Is this your first PGAD flare up? Yeah, I think so. I always kind of had this feeling, especially when I take psychedelics like weed or LSD. \n  \nBut this is the first time It kind of hurts and is a bit overwhelming. \n  \nI just dont want to end up on serious meds. I am omw to buy Ashgwanada, Magnesium and L-thenine supplements. Man I will try all of that. If your PGAD is caused by a vascular issue then taking drugs, alcohol, etc that alter your blood flow could be triggering it. As for winding up on serious meds you will have to ask yourself if it is worth dealing with the pain without them. Again, would totally recommend speaking to a trusted family doctor and being completely honest about what triggered the flare up. Well I also happen to be the most stressed I have ever been in my life. \n  \nThat Is a shame because I love taking LSD, even though I barely take it\u2014a few times a year! I guess I cannot take it when I am super stressed. If you give it the stimulation it wants, it seems to just make it want more. It seems like abstinence until it goes away and reducing stress are all you can do. A lot of people have recommended CBD. THC can worsen anxiety, and you said you just smoked weed and obviously that did not help, but maybe CBD alone could. I have not gotten around to getting any since it can be kind of spendy, so I cannot say it works from experience on PGAD. Others have said it helps though. It does, but only *while* you are having sex. Once your done, the craving comes back So if I reduce my stress, can it be gone forever in my case? I do not know enough about your situation to say. It certainly sounds ideal on paper, but that is definitely not the case with me for sure Along with a heating pad and or hot baths, I would also recommend trying to to pelvic stretches, like happy baby (3 sets, hold for 30 seconds) and others you can find videos of on YouTube by searching \u201cpelvic stretches\u201d. I have found that when my pelvic muscles are loose, there is less tension on my pudendal nerve (that is what causes my PGAD symptoms) hence less PGAD flares. Best of luck my friend! Stress will trigger PGAD symptoms. Try some relaxation methods, listen to calming music, do some yoga, read a book, whatever calms your mind.\n\nI also found that THC triggers my PGAD as well so I stopped smoking weed all together last March when my symptoms first started. Straight CBD did help me quite a bit though! really? stretches resolves this? I never knew that before. I have had this \"condition\" since I was probably a teenager, and just assumed it was hormonal. Mine, I am guessing is not as intense as other people, because I would hardly call it painful. Mildly annoying, more than anything else. Pre-menopause has reduced it slightly. I will have to look up the stretches you are talking about. I want to clarify that pelvic stretches helped me because I was diagnosed with pudendal neuralgia. Keeping the pelvic floor relaxed but also strengthened (with proper kegels) has eliminated my PGAD symptoms almost completely. Only time I experience this feeling is about a week and a half before starting my period because of inflammation. I do my stretches and it lessens the amount of time I experience my unwanted arousal and shooting pains! I still cannot wear jeans/jean shorts or really tight pants because the pressure that is put on my lower abdomen will trigger my symptoms. But I am not complaining, wearing loose comfy clothes all the time is fine with me lol It depends on person to person. Some may find short term relief before the feeling starts to build up again. In others it can do nothing or even piss it off some more making it even worse. As you go along and adjust you may find you get a feeling of when it will blow off some of the steam and reduce symptoms. Though this does not apply to everyone.", "Ridiculously uncomfortable It just gets really super old having this throbbing/aching/pressure/sensitivity/etc down there constantly. I wake up with it, it is there when I am attempting (and usually failing) to sleep. It is there when I am doing my grad school work, it is there always. I masturbate and it is still there. It is also really difficult to masturbate when I am literally not feeling in a sexual mood at all mentally. It is like just a physical glitch. I try not to masturbate and I eventually give in after 1 day because at least there is about an instant of tension relief that way. But it comes back...it is just so annoying, uncomfortable, etc. Sometimes I actually cannot even get out of bed because of it, it is just so strong, but then I cannot use that excuse with anyone because that sounds crazy... For me, it is much worse when I am stressed I totally understand the not getting out of bed part, and how others judge us for that.

Female and in my twenties (if that helps at all.)\n\nI posted this on another forum but I thought maybe someone might be able to help me here too. \n\nLately I feel a strange urge that I need to orgasm, or get a feeling like I am close to climaxing, it is a stirring sensation deep inside my pelvic region. Especially when I am doing certain movements. It is only acute and not all the time but when it comes around the feeling is definitely there and does not go away. \n\nThis is definitely new and never had it this frequent before, maybe once or twice a couple of years ago but nothing like this, where it is become so frequent in these past few weeks, I would say 2-3 maybe 4. \n\nI experience it when I am doing inchworms in my workouts, and if I am doing a sit up, it is usually the motion of 'coming back up' It seems to be when I use a certain group of muscles but recently I have been having it where I could just be sitting and doing nothing. Another trigger is when I get really hot, if I have been out hiking or just out walking in the hot sun. I know this sounds strange, I do not feel like it is as severe as PGAD but could it be? I am not sure if it is so serious that I would need to tell my GP, but it has gotten worse to the point where it is becoming quite frustrating. It might be.  PGAD, at least for me is progressive with both intense and not so intense periods.  It sounds like you might be having coregasms which are centered in the abdomen and lower back.  Think of orgasms in the area just below the belly button and extending to your solar plexus as being core centered, tho having them is not necessarily the same PGAD. Thank you so much!

PLEASE please help.", "Male with Pgad since childhood I figured I would share my story here- maybe it will be helpful for other male sufferers. So I am not sure how common this is, but I have had pgad since childhood. It feels like a persistent irritating feeling of pressure in my penis that will not go away. As a child I could only get a moments relief by applying pressure to my groin/penis and I would get a \u201cmini\u201d orgasm (not really sure if it even was an orgasm at that age) that would relieve the pressure for a few moments. Then the feeling of pressure would invariably return again- I would sometimes spend a long time before bed just trying to make the pressure go away by repeatedly having these \u201cmini\u201d orgasms- all this before puberty even! The \u201cmini\u201d orgasms were not satisfying at all, just a way to try and get relief like scratching an itch. After puberty the pressure would go away after a real orgasm/ejaculation but still only for a short time. I have noticed that the only time it completely goes away is when I am completely abstinent ie no sex, masturbation or orgasms whatsoever for a period of about a month- of course actually maintaining such a long bout of abstinence can be difficult. My penis is frequently half-erect (but not visibly so, unless Im in gym shorts, thankfully) for days at a time. I used to think this was normal and remember chatting with two of my friends one female and one male. I told the the female friend \u201cwell flaccid penis size varies like crazy- some days it is much larger even near the size of an erection for the entire day despite being flaccid and not being really aroused\u201d My male friend was like \u201cuh no, that is not normal-mine stays the same when flaccid always\u201d. (I dont remember why on earth we were discussing this though \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02) \n\nOverall my case is not as bad as some of the people\u2019s here- it does make me not too thrilled about sex in general though because having consistent orgasms makes the pressure and discomfort worse, and orgasm only feels satisfying for a minute or two until the pressure returns. Pretty much after every orgasm I have to fight the desire to orgasm again to get rid of the pressure after it returns- if I give in and orgasm a second or third time the pressure keeps intensifying. After the first orgasm it is like a mild itch, but after the second or third its like having ants crawling on you and having to resist the urge to get rid of them. \n\nHas anyone else had pgad before puberty? Not sure if my case is an outlier or not... I am a female and I started having pgad symptoms at the age of 12 which is quite early in puberty Mine developed right around when I started puberty which was still early at 11  but I know horribly what it is like trying to fight off the urge to keep them going although somtimes my body has other ideas I am sorry, this sounds truly awful. :(( This is the closest description I have ever read to what I feel - the constant \u201citch\u201d and the \u201cmini orgasms.\u201d I am not sure I can offer any advice since the causes and treatment of female PGAD are very different from male, but know that someone here feels your pain!! Does yours include erection? Do you have premature ejaculaton from this? I just made a post today but I have had PGAD since i was a child as well and I have also had lifelong PE which I believe is caused by this. I am assuming you had a traumatic childhood?", "Do I have Pgad? Im tired of living.  My own body is ruining my life.  Im a 17 yr old female, my clit becomes sensitive and my breasts engorge constantly. I have found that when i am anxious, my symptoms flare up. Going out in public is hell, as i am afraid of embarrassing myself due to these annoying symptoms.  My doctor told me that it was normal and prescribed antidepressants for my suicidal thoughts (which only caused me to gain weight). Can anyone please help? Is there any other doctor you can see? id recommend trying to see a specialist or something ASAP. pgad is pretty rare so not a lot of doctors will know about it. there are known cases for recovery among women so there is hope No :/ Thanks. What kind of doctor would have knowledge in PGAD? I was finally diagnosed around the age you are now, with my symptoms starting around age 12. I lived through years of people telling me I was faking, or trying to get attention, or not understanding what was actually wrong with me. I definitely feel for you! I am 35 now and have suffered with this horrid disorder for most of my life. However, you have a great tool at your disposal, the internet l, that I did not have available to me when I was younger in the 90s. \n\nStart doing searches on \"PGAD+doctor+your city\" and see what comes up. You can also research hypersexuality specialists in your area. For 3 years, I was diagnosed with a hypersexuality disorder, until I finally met with someone who knew what they were talking about and addressed the serious amounts of pain I was in daily. But it may be a place you can start, and likely someone who knows things about sexual or genital disorders would likely at least have heard about PGAD. \n\nBeing 17, you may have trouble going to see a doctor unless your parents are on board or you have the money to do so. But nothing is stopping you from reaching out in an email. There are compassionate people out there and if you find a doctor online who looks like someone you want to meet, write them an email. Explain your situation, ask for help or suggestions or recommendations of someone they may know who can help you. If you are desperate enough and want to find help, do not stop trying. \n\nIn the meantime, ice packs help me. Numb up the area when you are at home. Try to relax. If you have access to CBD creams, there are a few topicals that can help with outer inflammation, but you have to be careful with ingredients that can make flares worse. Loose fitting clothing is huge when at home. Give your nerves a chance to settle. There is a product on Amazon called Formula 303 that helps me relax. It has a few natural products in it, and while it does not help with the flare pain, it can help me sleep better and settles my muscles.\n\nI wish you nothing but the best, hun.

But for some reason the feeling I get while having to go pee is actually easier to deal with.\n\nBut yes, I get bladder pressure.  I actually really enjoy pressing down on certain areas of my abdomen while getting intimate with my spouse.  And if I have to pee, the sex and oral sex gives me a slightly different feel, and it feels really good in a weird way. ", "Mild PGAD? Hi all,\n\nWhenever I get aroused and orgasm, I always still feel aroused after. Like I can orgasm and it feels good, and I do again and again and again, but the aroused feeling does not go away through the orgasms (it just eventually goes away after some time). I luckily do not have regular symptoms, but this has always what sex has been like for me (and occasionally/rarely the feeling comes along randomly). It feels good but leaves a kind of unsatisfying feeling at the end. Does this sound like anyone else? I do not know if this is common because no one talks about stuff like this! I am the same - I have a really strong vibrator which kind of wears me out. Do you ever use toys to try chase the satisfying feeling? I am not sure if this is PGAD or not. Do you ever feel symptoms of arousal outside of times when you are masturbating or with a partner? How often does arousal happen for you? Because it could be that you are multi-orgasmic which would leave you with the \"vaguely unsatisfied\" feeling, but still having orgasms. One of the most listed diagnostic criteria I have seen for PGAD is that the symptoms are disruptive and appear in contexts completely divorced from sex. Like for me, I am 99% certain it is PGAD because I get suddenly horribly aroused (like i have been edging myself), just sitting at my desk doing absolutely nothing. If you are very worried maybe seek out opinions from a gynecologist and/or a sex therapist. I go through phases with this as well. Since I was in my late teens occasionally I would masterbate then immediately feel like I could go again, and this would happen like 4-5 times until I realized \u201cOk let us do something productive\u201d, but then the need to \u201cget off\u201d multiple times would go away for months, sometimes years. It kind of helped me to stop masterbating immediately after climaxing and distracting myself with cleaning or organizing or just something that got my body moving. \n\nI got hit with severe PGAD symptoms in May of this year and I could not sleep for about 2 weeks straight because the involuntary flexing \u201cdown there\u201d would wake me up every few hours. The unwanted arousal was so intense I could literally climax in less than 5 seconds. It got to the point where i was completely ok with never having another orgasm for the rest of my life. Luckily I was recently diagnosed with Pudendal Neuralgia by a Uro/Gynecologist by the name Dr. Quezada in Las Vegas where i live and I started Pelvic PT about a month and a half ago and my symptoms have improved so much to the point where I barely notice my symptoms unless I stop doing my exercises at least every other day. I sometimes do, yes (like when I am sitting at a desk, same as you), but not often. Sometimes at night though, too (usually when I have not had an orgasm in a while). Yeah I am multi-orgasmic, but even when I hear of other women being like that, usually they describe it as feeling satisfied after one, and then getting aroused all over again during the same sexual experience and then orgasm-ing/feeling satisfied again. But I am not 100% sure. I would not say I am very worried, but just never had any idea if this was normal. Would it be gyno territory? I am not quite sure (maybe I would be more comfortable with a sex therapist regarding this). Thanks for the comment. I have never really tried that, actually. So it wears you out and eventually satisfies you? Thanks for the comment, and I am really glad pelvic therapy is helping you. Is that your sole treatment for the neuralgia, if you do not mind my asking? For me I have been feeling lucky lately when I have one day with minimal symptoms. It is possible that you could have a mild form, so if that is the case maybe a sex therapist is a better option. I say gynecologist only because they can help you rule out some preliminary stuff and possibly refer you out to specialists if it is determined that you do have it. I do not mind at all! When this all started I began Taking 10mg of Baclofen 2x daily which helped a little but my symptoms were still bothering me in between doses. I upped the dose to 10mg 3x daily, but I just kicked an 8 year opiate addiction last year and I hate taking pills, so after about 6 months i decided to taper off. Fortunately the pelvic PT is working great so I am back down to 1 pill at night &amp; with my tapering schedule I should be off of it completely tomorrow :)", "Does anyone have a list of known PGAD causes?

Hi I am am a 13yo male and I think I might be confusing puberty with pgad. So about a month ago I started getting this feeling in my penis is was not painful, tingly, or anything really like that.

That feeling went a way and in about 2 weeks in came back and its the same feeling combined with needing masturbate really bad, is there a chance this could be puberty. Since everyone goes through puberty different this is highly likely. Best thing is to not focus on it too much and deal with it normally. Not all erections reach full size and it is extremely common since your nerves are growing more sensitive at this time to prepare for your adult body. Random erections can happen anytime even when your not thinking naughty thoughts. It will pretty much happen a lot in your teens.\n\nAlso dont let anyone shame you for masturbation. It is totally normal. Just dont do it in a setting you can be caught in as that can be extremely embarrassing.\n\nOnly time this should become a medical concern is if it becomes vastly abnormal and accompanied by pain.

If you look through my post history, you will notice I am very hypersexual, but I have definite boundaries to it, especially when it comes to PGAD. I do not joke about it, I try not sexualizing it, but it is like threading a needle. It is difficult being supportive and keeping it non-sexual, but being sincere about it is key to clarifying intent. This guy was not sincere and from the sound of it, was not even trying to be supportive.\n\nWe are not all pigs, and he was being an opportunistic bastard Thank you :) Thank you. I did feel bad earlier because I am rather sexual myself. I accidentally first contacted him from my porn account. I *profusely* apologised. I thought I was on *this* account. That might have sent the wrong message but if he replied for sexual reasons he should just be open about it and not pretend like I want to see his dick to bond over our shared condition. It is sleazy. Totally agree! You did not really mess up by using your porn account, he acted inappropriately regardless of how you present yourself. You did not \"ask for it\". I have had similar issues in the past with people passing judgement on me based on my post history and that is their problem, not mine. Yeah, it is not easy being openly horny \ud83d\ude04 people assume anything goes and that you have no boundaries. With PGAD your body thinks the same thing which is why this thing is so nefarious! Hm, I am not sure what you mean, but I am curious? From what I have read the experience can be very different for different people. My first 2 marriages fell apart because I could not reign in my urges. I was insatiable, miserable and angry. I am still insatiable (actually more now), but accepting who I am without shame is part of my road to preserving my sanity. Not sure if that makes sense Unfortunately some people will come across this sub and send messages here on Reddit fetishizing the illness. I have experienced it myself. I am sorry this happened to you; sending love &lt;3 It was a bit different, which is why I was doubting my instinct I guess. He made a post elsewhere about suffering from PGAD, I commented, we started talking. If he would messaged me out of nowhere I would not have been so surprised by his conduct.\n Thank you for the kind words! It really helps. Ah alright. For me, the sensations of my condition and my real sexual urges are mostly separate, so it did not sound familiar to me. They may intermingle sometimes, but if it is the pgad then the feeling is very bothersome. I am envious of that.

I first knew about sex in the second grade and I started to explore myself when I was 10. I remember the first time I got off it was like I could not get it out of my head. I wanted more and more of it until, one day the feeling never went away. I had to leave for my dads house because my parents were divorced. I tried to fix it by masturbating but nothing worked. it just felt like a pressure like you are about to have an orgasm but you just cant. Now I am grownish and have an understanding boyfriend, it happens a lot more and it to the point it happens at work school or just while I am driving. Its gotten crazy and in a way worse than it was in high school. I understand all too well. I was 16 (I am 20 now) when it began with me. It took a couple of years before my mom and me found a OB/GYN who actually knew what was going on with me. Right now, I am coping pretty well but I have those moments when I will orgasm in public and it is sooo embarrassing. This seems like a good place to help deal with this... I am sorry you are experiencing this. I can relate &amp; it sucks. :(", "Is this PGAD? Hi all. I thought I was feeling horny few days ago, but after trying to release it did not help much. In the evening I read about PGAD for the first time and got really scared. The next day the feeling down there did not go away, like some tension, sometimes like arousal, sometimes like I need to pee, I do not know how to explain it, it is a changing sensation. I also started feeling my bladder full most of the time and keep peeing, but sometimes there is almost nothing to pee - is this above the symptoms?  Not sure if this is the case or if something else and I am not sure which doctor to visit. I have hypochondria so this may have exacerbated my symptoms too. If you are worried enough you should consult a doctor first, it does sound similar to what others have posted but I would try not to focus too much on the negatives as these issues could always be somthing else\n\nSo in short, see your doctor and if you need to talk then your welcome to message me Talk to a doctor! Sounds like it could be urinary symptoms, like maybe a UTI? Urethral irritation and inflammation can be mistaken for genital arousal.  Thank you! I have booked an hour for urologist next week and will check that too. Thank you! No problem", "Question What symptoms make PGAD so different/noticeable compared to, for example a UTI, or other issues? My symptoms are tingling/numb sensation in vagina. Sometimes relieved by orgasm, just by walking, using the restroom, doing something to get my mind off of it. Feeling like I cannot fully empty my bladder. And a dull sharp stabbing pain in my vagina, that does not really last for long. None of these symptoms are painful, they are just extremely uncomfortable. I am having trouble determining if this is PGAD or some other issue. I am 14 (F). Any answers would be highly appreciated!!! I thought I should mention this as well- the discomfort is worse when I have anxiety/stressful/when I am thinking abt it. And the discomfort mainly occurs when I am standing still or sitting still (usually not when I am in motion). I feel like my bladder Is never empty.when I am sitting the area around the vulva and clitoris twitch which is very uncomfortable and my vagina contracts randomly similar to the contractions after an orgasm idk I think for me nerve signals down there are miss firing.that is why I have began to be more active as it does take my mind off it.i wish I could get away with not travelling in a vehicle as it exacerbates my symptoms", "So it is not just me then.. I am going to be honest, I am basically all consumed with this since I did an innocent little google search the other day along the lines of \u201cfeeling sexually aroused for no reason\u201d and now I feel like I am basically in constant pain. I have noticed it lately, overwhelming \u201cwarm\u201d feelings whilst watching TV (and doing nothing sexual or arousing) and having to stop watching to \u201ctake care\u201d of the situation so I could focus on what I am doing, only for it to return a few hours later. \n\nI found out about PGAD and now it is all I can think about. And it is painful. I have stopped \u201ctaking care\u201d of things now but several days it has not let up and it feels painful now. Does this go off?? \"taking care of things\" can lead to wanting to do it even more, which just keeps building.\n\nOne one hand it is Impossible to be satisfied and you get pain. On the other it means you can have some incredible orgasms. I am struggling with the same thing, it might just be a spike of hormones, I freaked myself out because of googling so I am more aware of it but distraction helps me, I am sure itll go down Two things to pay attention to that exacerbates the condition that is in your complete control are stress and shame. Minimize those as much as possible and you have got half the battle won. Be careful with Dr. Google. He likes to cause more anxiety when you just do random symptom or disease research. Take a step back and let the scare of the web search and the aftermath calm down for a bit. After that take a deep breath and ask if it was the anxiety from the search that caused the reaction, or was it a real reaction that needs to be looked into.\n\nUnfortunately knowledge and mental anxiety especially when it comes to medical researching can actually cause real body effects. I personally have to deal with a mild hypochondria issue and a fascination with researching medical things. So i always take a break if i feel anxiety building to prevent phantom symptoms that my brain might cause or blow out of proportion.\n\nAlso any medical professional probably in their learning process has also gone through hyper symptom anxiety due to the knowledge mixing with empathy on some level with their studies. So its scary but the mind is a terrible thing when it comes to issues that deal with pain disorders because it can just fabricate an issue out of anxiety.\n\nPGAD itself is just one of those things that in all honestly is a very mentally horrifying complication. This is because it very heavily casts a very very negative association with something that already has some taboo, and physically a strong neural network like the pelvis is one of the most terrible places to have a pain disorder.", "Update So I went to my psychiatric after 2 years of being normal! I did not mention pgad I rather die than do that!!he thinks I have anxiety and depression!! I lied like the last time I did so he gave me xanax saying half a pill for week only!!and another anti depressants called desvenlafaxine for a month!!!any thought and recommendations before I take them!!!will it make my condition worst!!!please answer I AM STILL NOT A DOCTOR. \nDesvenlafaxine triggered my PGAD. Not sure what it will do for you. Xanax should help some. \n\nIf you still refuse to tell the doctor you have PGAD, tell them you have RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME. Studies have shown it is similar to PGAD. Your doctor might prescribe some things to calm down your system. \n\nAlso like I told you before, changing your meds can cause or worsen PGAD. \n\nI am sorry but if you cannot or will not tell your doctors your real symptoms, it is very hard for them to help you.  I live in a closed society we do not talk about these things!!!even out doctors are closed minded!!!dont judge m!!!like I said I took ssri type anti depressants!!!this one is a type snri I searched that ssri cause pgad not snri!!!  I will PM you. Not judging you.", "Possible PGAD Male? I am really freaking out and I do not know where else to turn.\n\nI was watching porn and suddenly I noticed a weird burning sensation in my penis. I thought it was nothing so I slept through the night but ever since, I feel a weird, tingling sensation on the bottom of my penis throughout the day. At first, I do get a euphoric sensation that also tingles my left brain and right leg, but it has died down. However, I still get a weird burning feeling on the bottom of my penis and on occasion, a tingle that might feel orgasmic? (Although I do not feel like I want to ejaculate). It is been going on for about a week now. I am super afraid if this is PSAS/PSAD or something else (like an inflammation or a damaged nerve).\n\nIt does not really bother me if I have something to do (work/video games), but whenever I am idle, I notice it more. Is this what PSAS/PSAD feels like? I think PGAD symptoms feel different for everyone simply because the cause of PGAD can be different for each person. For instance, I was diagnosed with pudendal neuralgia and my symptoms include uncontrollable flexing of the genitals that wake me up from a dead sleep, shooting pains in my groin and around buttock area, pressure and swelling in my cliterous, and unwanted arousal. \n\nHave you tried remedies to try and relieve this feeling? Like taking a warm bath, using a heating pad on your coccyx or doing yoga? If this feeling persists, you could go to a urologist and explain your symptoms to them and get their opinion. \nIf this sensation bothers you enough, you can find relief by being completely honest with your doctor.  They have seen and heard it all before, and if they are not sure what could be causing your symptoms, ask them if there is someone else they could refer you to to get answers. Asking for help and not stopping until you get the information you need is the first step to feeling better my friend. Best of luck!", "Getting aroused when legs are closed? I have no idea if I actually have PGAD but for the past few months when my legs are closed or crossed I have the constant urge to pulsate my PC muscles which causes arousal.

Hi! I just wanted to make this post because someone is maybe going through what I was. For about a week I had all the PGAD symptoms and it was horrible. I could not sleep at all, I could barely eat, and I cried a ton. I have a history of hypochondria btw. There was intense tension throughout my body, and it felt like I was on the brink of an orgasm constantly. On the first day with these symptoms I searched them up and found out about PGAD. Everything online was terrible and it made me feel so hopeless. The more I researched and thought about it, the worse I felt. After 5 days, I found a post on here about a girl who is PGAD had been caused by blocked stool pressing on her nerves. I have a history of constipation so I became hopeful this was what had caused my PGAD. Once I had convinced myself it was the constipation causing this, in 2 days my PGAD was completely gone!! The relief from feeling like it was curable got rid of my symptoms. I am quite sure it was my anxiety and hypochondria causing the symptoms to manifest in my head the whole time. I know this is not the case with everybody, but I am sure there is someone out there like me, and i hope this gives you hope :) If you did not physical make any changes with your body then you did not truly have pgad Physically* I am going through the same thing, I think it is my anxiety but it is been a month now and it has not gone :/ hopefully it will soon! cmon i mean we all know pgad can also be psychological. it is very scary either way, whether its from anxiety, pelvic floor dysfunction, etc. we should be congratulating this person regardless No because it is impossible to have true PGAD for only one week. I am suffering everyday because my nerves are inflamed or trapped. My condition did manifest from psychological factors but this person could not begin to understand my pain. Also it is not true arousal it is dysthesia and it is unbearable at times. I am still on the road to recovery. u are diminishing someone elses journey and struggles by comparing them to your own. i wish u the best of health and to find a relief very soon, i am sorry u are in so much pain. Yes you are right I do not believe that i had PGAD! However it was still somewhere in the realm of it all and was a terrible experience. I do not wish to compare our struggles because they are not the same at all. I just hope that someone who is in a similar boat as I was can see this and maybe put their mind at ease a bit. Your struggle is miniscule compared to mine. You do not have the right to talk about PGAD.  Ah yes I forgot that you are the all powerful decider of who gets to speak about pgad. Thank you for reminding me good sir. I hope you find relief soon Everyone is struggle is there own, it is not a competition to compare struggles, no one is trying to win here. She is sharing her experience and that is what this place is for. She has every right to speak about it incase it helps someone else and I can easily say it made me feel better about my situation. Having it for going on 4 years I would think I am more able to understand it than someone or just overthinks If she did not have pgad then what was she feeling then? I do not know what real PGAD is supposed to mean.

Are you on any SSRI\u2019s, birth control, or anything that could disrupt your hormones? Hi, thank you! I am on birth control, but for PCOS. My hormones were already imbalanced and i have been on birth control for a few weeks to try to regulate them. Also, i was hoping it was just because of the birth control, but this (at least the swelling) started before i even started taking birth control. The last days it just suddenly got much worse. So i do not think it can be that..\n\nI honestly think that this has been caused by me holding my pee for too often. I have been doing that for years, and i think it finally caused permanent nerve damage! :(((. It is just pain. But i wake up from an orgasm like at least once a week. And orgasms are not pleasurable at all are not they? \ud83d\ude41 Perhaps, about the nerve damage thing. Have you been to a gyno yet about it? Mine was underwhelmingly unhelpful, but they might be able to see any physical abnormality there might be. Meanwhile, do not hold your pee, ice it if that feels good, and do some pelvic floor stretches if you can. Mine was caused directly by a birth control I was on, so once I stopped it, it took six months for me to get back to normal. I do not have PCOS tho (that I know of) and mine was purely just arousal, no pain. I am sorry friend, I wish there was more research and information on this stuff. Do you find that it gets worse when you are anxious? Or is it literally just all the time, no matter how calm you are? Have you tried cooling it down with a bidet?

My wife and I just celebrated our 16th anniversary together and through the years our sex life has gone through a somewhat synergistic metamorphosis thanks to PGAD. My previous 2 ex wives left me because they felt I was too demanding and never satisfied. Before my current (&amp; hopefully last) wife and i got together, I warned her repeatedly that I do not have a \"honeymoon phase\". The hunger I had for sexual contact will not diminish like regular folk, if anything it will increase as I get more comfortable expressing my emotions. \n\nWith that in mind, we both made a conscious decision to incorporate sex into a major party of our time together and practiced an amalgamation of Tantra, karezza, high sex (cannabis) and pompoir. Our current average PIV sex duration is roughly 2 to 3 hours a day (much more during the weekends) \n\nMy question is if anyone's had any success in managing their symptoms this way or if this is a recipe for disaster because honestly, the longer we spend time having sex, the more I want it and I am becoming less and less sure how I can function with less sex.", "Do I have PGAD? Please help, I am losing my mind.\n\nNaturally it is a very stressful time at the moment given the coronavirus situation and the UK, where I live, is on lockdown. Ive never felt like this before - constant arousal down there that is quite distracting. I think if it is PGAD is must be a mild case because I can still watch TV but I have to try really hard to focus on it. \n\nI am on the pill and had my pill break a few days ago which is when this began - I took the next pill today so am hoping that maybe it was caused by a combination of stress and the hormone change of my period? Initially I thought I was just missing my boyfriend as I have not seen him in 5 weeks, I tried to masturbate but my vibrator ran out of charge halfway through and I was too tired to use my hands so just had a cold shower and left it. But last night I masturbated again and it did not help at all - maybe for 5-10 minutes and then the feeling was back, so I thought I was just really sexually frustrated and went for round 2 but found I could not finish as towards the end everything was far too sensitive and it hurt.\n\nBut the feeling did not go away - I have never had arousal last this long after failing to finish before and it is driving me crazy. I can only sleep on my back, not on my side as this must place some pressure somewhere. I have even tried placing a pillow between my knees but I still can only sleep on my back.\n\nIf it continues I do not know what I will do. I feel like I am constantly on the verge of tears and I am terrified this will not go away after lockdown. If it does not stop in a few days time I will have to speak to my mum but how do I even bring that up?? I have uni work due in 2 days that I have barely started because I cannot focus\n\nAny advice would be massively appreciated xxx Hi. I am so sorry you are going through this. Life is incredibly stressful right now and I can totally empathize with how you are feeling. Your symptoms sound like PGAD but....it is such an unpredictable thing so it is also possible it is not. I have heard that people develop symptoms when they come off of birth control or SSRI\u2019s. Other people have an injury. Other people feel like it just comes on suddenly one day. Stress and tension definitely exacerbate my symptoms so some things I learned in pelvic floor physical therapy-try taking some deep breaths and focusing on relaxing to decrease tension-specifically in your pelvic floor. Lay on your back and put a few pillows underneath your butt/lower back. This tends to ease pressure on muscles connected to the pelvic floor. Hopefully, your symptoms will go away with your birth control. Try to not let your brain jump too far ahead-all the what-ifs can increase anxiety. There are treatments that work, including exercises, mediation/relaxation, and medication. Thank you so much for replying! I have been on and off birth control for the past 2 years without ever having a problem like this so am very confused as to what could have caused it - I have not had any of the things that forums online seem to suggest cause it.\n\nI have been trying not to let myself get too worried because when I do it feels like it almost instantly gets worse! Thank you for that tip on relaxing my pelvic floor, I will try it now and hopefully it will help me sleep better tonight. If this does not go away by Monday I think I will try and contact my GP in the hope that they can recommend some exercises or prescribe some medication. I am hoping that if I begin trying to solve this problem quickly it will not be too difficult to solve! I now see a gynecologist whose specializes in pelvic floor pain. I went through lots of doctors who had zero idea what I was talking about and treated me like it was \u201cin my head\u201d. Very frustrating. But there are definitely people who know what PGAD is and know how to treat itI now use a combination of birth control, a medication for nerve pain, and exercises. I also use valium that I use vaginally for break through pain. I am symptom free 95% of the time and when I am not, the valium helps immensely. Fingers crossed you will feel better in a few days without any need for any of that though. Best of luck to you! That is honestly so encouraging to hear and has eased a lot of my anxiety - I am glad that you have managed to control it. Most of what I read online was very disheartening saying there are no cures and people just have to live with it so I have been worried that I will be stuck like this forever and never be able to have sex with my boyfriend again! The doctors at my GP surgery are generally very good and have been helpful before although not with anything like this, but I hope if it comes to it they will be helpful with this. Thank you for your advice I really do appreciate it! :) I am here with you. It started in locked down. All of the sudden? I am wondering whether that might be related to the fact I am just before my period and being sensitive and more anxious now... Hi, I promise you that I am in the EXACT same position right now, and its been incredibly scary and frustrating over the past few days since my PGAD symptoms showed up and have not gone away at all. On top of everything else theres always the worry that we will not we able to focus on school/work when the time comes. I highly encourage you to tell your parents and call up your doctor soon, as I just told my parents my struggle today and I can tell you that telling someone eases the tension a lot. I am just as scared, but I promise you we will get through this. Hi! Since that post I have told my parents, my boyfriend and I have spoken with my doctor who has heard of PGAD! I am speaking to her today about going on a low dose of amitriptyline, which was recommended to me by a specialist in London that I have been emailing. I have also joined a support group on Facebook - if you search PGAD it should come up, it is really good to know I am not alone and the people on there offer some really good advice! Around your period is often a time where you will have a higher sex drive, and anxiety is a massive factor in PGAD, a lot of the time anxiety can make it worse. I would really recommend speaking to your parents or a friend about this so you do not feel like you are on your own, and if you can speak to your doctor who can try and help you x That Is super amazing to hear, I wish you the best of luck! It is definitely cliche, but you will get through this! I definitely say trust your doctor, but if you have not already my best advice to you would be to try to get to the root of the problem (but I imagine you have been). I have x-rays and other such appointments scheduled to try and figure out if theres pressure/irritation on my pudental nerve, which is responsible for feelings of arousal. Wishing both of us all the luck in the world :) As soon as i stopped working from coronavirus it started happening to me too, I have tried everything to stop it, it will be 2 full months on the 17th that I have been struggling with this. Im also terrified that its not going to stop once i go back to work.

I am a woman, but your experience sounds very similar to mine. However mine had a direct cause. Can you think of any medications, life events, trauma, or whatever that happened to you? Or was this completely random?

Or was this completely random?\n\nThe only thing that was different was that my orgasms had become more intense leading up to this. No medications, no trauma. Completely out of nowhere.\n\nI went to the doctor this morning. I did not ask her if I should orgasm. With absolute certainty she would not know.\n\nDo you still have Pgad? Did you have a lot of anxiety before this ? Yes. Not directly before, but I have been very anxious in general for about five years. That is one way to get it unfortunately. I am so sorry if this is PGAD. Try to stay calm and lower stress the symptoms will be less intense. This group is more active than this reddit one- Thank you for the info My last flare came like 2 days after a stressful event, so if there was something in particular that was more stressful than usual, it may be a delayed response. Masturbation/sex may make it worse, some of the materials I have read have suggested abstaining until the urge fades. In my last flare every time I masturbated, it just got more obnoxious. Has abstaining until the urge fades worked for you personally? How long do your flares last? It makes it a little more bearable and might make it fade faster. The days I did masturbate just made the sensation more intense and killed my ability to focus. My flares usually run their course in about a week. &gt; Should I release? I am scared if I do, it will only become even more intense, as previously I only ever had these sensations minutes after an orgasm.\n\nI tried for 30 days. You then start dealing with actual urges and PGAD which makes it a whole lot worst. Kind Of hard to get your mind off it when you are constantly reminded you have pgad. \n\n\nTLDR - It did not help. Rather the opposite. How often do you get them? Sorry I am confused, what did not help? Abstaining Not often, only in the aftermath of severe anxiety. I am scared if I masturbate I am going to go on a crazy run, like I will need multiple in a row, or I will become even more sensitive. 30 days? I am not sure I can do four It was certainly a challenge. I thought it might make it less sensitive, it did not. Maybe it might for you? I definitely do not think abstinence helps because I have gone over 3 months with a variation of this condition and it did not help and you might be right about making it worse. What do you mean by \"should I release\"? Also do you have a problem with your erections going away? Dm me Anxiety alone does not cause pgad. Have you gotten a mri of your spine? Do you have pelvic floor dysfunction? There is probably something  by affecting those nerves would be my guess. Anxiety alone does not cause pgad. It has to be a mix of another issue such as pelvic floor dysfunction. There could be a psychology cause but that is only if the anxiety is linked to sexual thoughts or fears.", "Pregnancy causing Pgad symptoms? Hello, I am 11 weeks pregnant.

Thanks for the help.\n\nEdit: Also wanted to mention that sometimes during the day the feeling will go away if I am not thinking about, so I am not sure if it is going away because I am not thinking about it or if I am not thinking about it because it has gone away temporarily. By the sounds of it its more likely to be an infection with the one-sidedness and the frequent bathroom stuff but dont take it from me or just reddit In general, if its genuinely worrying you consult your doctor Thanks for the reply, I understand that I should still see a doctor, but this helped to ease my worries a bit.\n\nWould there be any chance that this could all be linked to anxiety? No problem, hope you manage to sort it out and if by any chance it is pgad then do come back", "Triggers or no? I am trying to figure out if what I have is PGAD or not. But everything I see says that it has no triggers. Whatever I am facing has triggers. It could be sexual but mostly not. It is scary or bad stories or car accidents or murders. It is just sweet things like kids playing or cute babies or pets. Basically anything that elicits an emotion out of me. It is also sometimes mundane stuff like a work meeting. \n\nWhen it is the inappropriate stuff though I start to panic that there is something wrong with me.\nIt is also worse during the first half of my cycle. \n\nDoes anyone else have this? Or is it totally random for you with no trigger at all? Anxiety, caffeine, unresolved trauma, sitting too long For me, my biggest triggers are: caffeine, anger/stress/anxiety (especially stress about university which makes me feel guilty sometimes because I happen to be studying geriatrics), music/key changes, intense flavors/esp. finally eating if I had been hungry all day, certain textures especially cashmere or soft fabrics, kind of any intensely good sensory experience.\n\nI used to work with kids before I started suffering from PGAD, but I quit my job. I never suffered from spontaneous orgasms at work and never suffered from PGA above my baseline severity, but I felt disgusting working with kids and having PGAD. It made me feel like a pervert, even though the thought alone disturbs and revolts me.\n\nTruthfully, the entire nature of PGAD is that it is involuntary and intrusive, and that the physical arousal comes with a lack of sexual desire. Nothing is inherently wrong with because you have PGAD symptoms during inappropriate times; that is the whole thing of PGAD. In fact, if you are distressed by it, that is even more proof that you do not feel sexual desire.\n\nThat being said, if you do not already see a psychologist, it might be worth talking to a therapist about it if you have the access to one. A therapist might be able to help you cope with the anxiety surrounding PGAD.\n\n**tl;dr:** You are not a bad person. PGAD is involuntary and intrusive. If you have the access to one, a therapist might be able to help you cope with the anxiety surrounding PGAD.", " Anyone else here after a lifetime of symptoms following traumatic childhood sexual assault? ", "Am I Experiencing PGAD? It all started yesterday at my partners house. We were watching tv and out of the blue I got the urge to masturbate. I was not thinking \u201csexy thoughts\u201d I just felt like I had to. I also kept having to pee a lot throughout the day as well when these urges came. After I masturbated, the feeling did not go away and now I have been noticing it all day today, along with persistent urination. I also noticed it before I went to bed last night and had a few orgasms in my sleep, which has happened before but happens very rarely. Is this PGAD? Sounds like it came on rather suddenly along with urination problems. Have you been checked for a urinary tract infection? Yes I got tested for a UTI today and my results were negative so it is not cause by that OK, just trying to think through some alternatives. I know I used to get UTIs all the time, but have also had UTI-like discomfort without an active infection that would last for a few days, and those symptoms can be similar to PGAD. I hope your discomfort will go away soon. Hey how is this going? Has it resolved itself or are you still trying to find out what caused it?", "Perhaps this sub might help me out? For more than a decade now, I have been masturbating several times per day. (I am a 29 years old white male.) While my testosterone levels are naturally very high (1000+ ng/dL and even 1400+ ng/dL once I used to do weightlifting without me taking steroids), I have never experienced my onanism primarily as an arousal issue, though there is that too, or as a perversion issue (I do not even enjoy porn), but truly as a dependence issue. What do I mean by that?  \n\nWell, I have had (untreated) inattentive ADHD and RLS since childhood. Which are complex syndromes, but based on the current paradigms, hypothesized as resulting from dysfunctional dopamine systems. But with me being born in a third world country, neither would be treated adequately. Even in the first world countries, there is a pronounced tendency to trivialize both conditions, not only in the popular discourse, but even among most clinicians who would scoff at the notion of the two being mentioned in the same breadth as (say) bipolar disorder or diabetes. Yet based on my personal experience, I can most sincerely attest that having either one is disabling enough, but having two comorbidly is literally living hell.  \n\nMasturbation has been my coping mechanism to (temporarily) control both (by \u201cartificially\u201d flooding my brain with dopamine, endorphins and all that), as well as my chronic depression, possibly stemming from the same (genetic) dopaminergic dysfunction, but additionally exacerbated by a very difficult life and a catastrophic childhood. If the aftermath of me reaching an orgasm, my RLS symptoms would be ameliorated for some time. My depression would temporarily lift... Etc.  \n\nAlso, I would often experience tingling and a very idiosyncratic restlessness in my genital area (mostly not even accompanied by an erection) which would go away only after an orgasm. I read about PGAD (persistent genital arousal disorder) but am not sure whether that applies to me or not, since it apparently is more common in women but is at the same time related to RLS, if I am not mistaken. I would often (have to) masturbate while studying. It is what it is. (To say this feels very embarrassing...)  \n\nAt 29, I have true CFS like symptoms and my RLS and ADHD are aggravated... but are finally treated with Ritalin and Lyrica. My urge to masturbate has diminished once I added Ritalin and Lyrica. I also have severe IBS and major depression disorder cluster of symptoms. No damage to my genitals, but chronic anhedonia, mental and physical fatigue. Truly CFS like. And I have run out of examinations to do. My brain MRI is normal but my brain fog is catastrophic. My short term memory and verbal fluency are barely existent, my long term memory has taken a great toll too. Whereas I have once been considered precocious and had my IQ estimated at +3SD in my early teens. My dream was to complete a PhD in pure maths... I have a passion for knowledge and a desire to do good... Alas...  \n\nSo I have been wondering whether all those years of masturbation might be the cause of my symptoms. (My blood tests are completely normal. Both narcolepsy and IBD were ruled out with polysomnography and colonoscopy.) Yet I felt ashamed to raise the question explicitly in front of my GP and instead tried to suggest it elliptically. Only to be told that the consensus on masturbation is that it is mostly healthy. That cases of CFS being caused by excessive masturbation are literally unheard of.  \n\nNevertheless, as a rule of thumb, too much of anything is hardly a good idea. I have read some online reports of young men complaining about masturbation getting out of control. They suggested that excessive masturbation (like cocaine, alcohol or meth abuse) causes the brain to reduce the density of dopamine receptors in the long run, which might bring about many cognitive and physical symptoms.  \n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the neuro-biology of chronic fatigue is still poorly understood. Some suggest to pay attention to the immune system, others to mitochondria or to the gut microbiote... But in many proposed causative chains, whether bidirectional, multidirectional or unidirectional... the topic of central dopamine is invariably brought up... Inflammatory cytokines reduce the density of dopamine receptors in basal ganglia... Gut issues mess up one\u2019s levels of neurotransmitters etc. etc.  \n\nBrutally oversimplified, have I perhaps brought genuine brain damage onto myself by \u201eartificially\u201c creating supraoptimal levels of endorphins, dopamine, other neurotransmitters and all that, and by doing so inflicted damage on my brain\u2019s reward systems? Neurotoxicity resulting from oxidative stress? Decreased availability of receptors? I have already heard the consensus on masturbation (mostly healthy etc.), but my case is very peculiar. And the research on this issue seems to be in its infancy...  \n\nSo I came here hoping to see whether anyone might help me out? Even the most seemingly minuscule advice or inconsequential suggestion might prove to be very of huge usefulness!  \n\nThanks in advance. You should look into electrotherapy, I heard that for females they do that, it might work for males too I will look into it. Thanks. Have any PGAD sufferers struggled with CFS? I have not heard of any cases but I think it is a no brainer one would feel very tired after excessive masturbation. In my case I do not even touch my self, and I still get pgad", "Need Help?

I came here because two days ago I felt the need to masturbate but when I had an orgasm I just could not get satisfied. I ignored it but went to bed with that feeling. The next day I woke up with it, is like a tingling feeling in there and sometimes it gets to the left leg and foot. That day I masturbated twice and also did not get satisfied. And today I woke up like that again, I tried masturbating three times but cannot get it to end and I have been feeling that all day long. The issue is that I cannot concentrate in school, only when I do something I really love like playing guitar or else I do not feel it. But I am rn really stressed out for it and do not know what to do. I do not want to the my parents cause that would be really shameful but it makes me really anxious and sad. Btw, I do not take any medicine, but I stopped exercising like two weeks ago cause my school schedule and also I have not been eating and sleeping well, but this was my routine two years ago and did not went through this. Do you have any advice of what I can do? Edit: Idk why but rn I am feeling the tingling now in all my face, but still feel some pulsations in there Hey &lt;3\nRight now the best thing for you to do is not panic. Try to breathe, meditate, and relax. If it is or is not PGAD, being anxious will not benefit you. I would recommend doing things that you really enjoy as much as you can in the next week or so, and trying to avoid masturbation if possible. If the feeling persists longer than two weeks, please see a doctor. You can tell your parents that you have pain rather than arousal, and tell your doctor the truth. Do not be ashamed, PGAD is gaining more and more light in recent years. \nStay strong &lt;3 It does sound like pgad. Are you male or female? I will try to do it, thankss! A great new is that today I woke up with it but not really hard, and when I focus in another thing it seems to go away with only little pulsations I am a woman): It could be pgad but can you think of any cause? Pgad is a result of something else. I was around your age when this started for me (I am 37 now), and my symptoms are the same as yours (right down to them going away when extremely focused on other activities, walking, off exercising) after all these years. I only just learned that it is PGAD, so I am glad you are already paying attention. Good luck! Mmmmm I do not really know what it could be, but maybe it is because cause I am not sleeping well Thankss! You still having it? And well, today it is been good news for me, I have not been focusing on it so I have been happier\ud83d\ude0a Have you had a history of bad anxiety? Pgad could be a psychosomatic response to stress in some cases. I do, but it is mostly just a dull roar that I cope with. I am glad you are able to refocus! I had it move to other areas too. I think that is the anxiety. Hi people! I got some great news, I guess maybe it was PGAD for a little time or maybe it was not, yet was really uncomfortable and I was not able to sleep good and I cried but rn I cannot feel it, maybe some little pulsations but nothing that makes me uncomfy.

I guess I will need to try out it, thankss!", "I think my GF has PGAD I need help please! About two days ago my gf talked to me, scared as hell, and told me that she has been having random fluids down there in large quantities and a weird feeling, without touching or even having sexual thoughts. Two days later and these random fluids are still present and after researching I am thinking this might be PGAD. As I recall the first time this occurred she had it 4 times. Please help me, I am clueless and lost. Is it PGAD or is it something else? What should I do? \u2026I would have her go to her gynecologist and get tested for an infection (UTI, yeast, BV, etc) before going straight to that. Excessive \u201cfluids\u201d are not really a symptom. PGAD is more chronic than that Thank you so much for your reply, I really appreciate it.  What I mean by fluids is the fluids that come out after orgasm, I asked her if she felt an orgasm when this happens and she said that she had a feeling down there. It has been going on for 3 days now and I am really worried about her; I am losing sleep because of overthinking. \n\nOn the bright side, she says she can carry on with her day and do whatever she wants while this happens. She can drive and do whatever as if nothing is happening. But I believe she is having spontaneous orgasms however I am not sure as I am not the one having them. What I am sure about are: she has a feeling down there, then fluids which come out after orgasm are there. You can excrete fluids for a ton of reasons. Increase in discharge can be caused by a number of things. Hormonal changes from your cycle or pregnancy, infections, diet, medications, etc. Feeling a sensation like arousal can also be from those. When I had a mild UTI, this was a symptom instead of pain. I would have her go to her Gyn to rule out other things first. They can do a blood test and check her hormonal levels and such too. Seems like a good first step. No reason to freak out. One day at a time. I have pgad as a woman, and I have had several normal relationships. It is great she is being so open about it with you. Can I ask your ages? (Just generally) I am 29 Sure. We are both 23 years old. We have been together before all this happens. She did not have this before we became a thing, this is all new for us. 4-5 days ago she called me scared as hell and told me what has been going on with her. That is why I am worried about it. Yesterday she had a burning sensation down there and what I assumed was a spontaneous orgasms, because she said it felt like it without the pleasing part.", "Hey can you develop spontaneous orgasm later in life with pgad?. I am afraid that is what might happen  That is one of my biggest fears. I have had PGAD since almost 5 years now and Im very glad I havent ever gotten to that stage. Although my arousal has gotten worse. Do you know what caused yours? Do you mean the woresing of symptoms or inital onset of symptoms? The cause like was it neurological, hormonal, psychological. Basically do you have any theories of what caused the symptoms in the first place. Pgad has to be caused by something. I think for me it was psychological. I was going through a really stressful time when it appeared. It did disappear for 4 years but reappeard when I went through alot of anxiety/stress recently. Now I have had it for almost 6 months  but it has calmed down a lot since I have managed my stress and anxiety. For me I think it is very psychomatic in nature. Everyone is case differs though. Yea me too, I think mine is also psychosomatic. I am in antidepressants and things are reducing a lot tho. That is great to hear!

It is also almost 2am and I am extremely sleep deprived(have not been able to sleep because of how bad my PGAD has gotten) so I might sound a bit loopy. Anyways, my PGD started in 2017, after a shower. I suddenly had extreme sensation in my clitoris that I need to relieve, so I did. I noticed the sensation would not go away. So then I relieved it again. And again, and again. Still the sensation remained. At this point I am panicking and I call my boyfriend, who was and still is extremely understanding. After some time, and many masturbation sessions later (days of masturbating), it randomly subsided. It would take me about 4-6 orgasms to feel relief. The weird thing was, after I had one orgasm, I always had to immediately relieve myself with a mini orgasm that easily came after. I ended up going to a pelvic floor doctor after doing some research. I was diagnosed with IC because with the arousal came bladder pain, leaking and urinary frequency. After a year of bladder treatments and no improvement, my doctors turned me away. I was so fucking lost. Every few days I would have to violently masturbate until I felt some sort of relief. If I was lucky it would be once a week. As time went on it got worse, I had to masturbate more frequently and it would take 8 orgasms, then 10 then 12 or more to feel any relief. Fast forward to now. I did more research in the last few months and figured maybe I have pudendal neuralgia, so I went to a specialist. Of course they diagnosed me with it and had me agree to do a pudendal nerve injection block. Worst decision of my life. They gave me injections through my buttcheeks, and in the moment the numbing stuff they injected into me did help relieve the sensation in my clitoris, but after a day from the injection (it is been exactly a week since I got it) my symptoms started getting even worse!! Whatever steroid they used did not do it is job. The worst part is, when I tried to relieve myself, I only had half of the sensation in my clitoris so it was hard to reach orgasm which I needed for relief. Imagine having to do that 12 times too\u2026 so fast forward to now. I have not had any relief in a week. I have been having to masturbate multiple times every fucking day in hopes that it would go away and it is only gotten so much worse.  I have not been able to sleep because the sensation makes me sick to my stomach and is not accompanied with some weird vibration which almost feels like a rush of blood near the clitoris. It is also extremely enlarged and everything fucking hurts. I have been screaming and crying and my boyfriend is afraid that the injection did permanent damage to my nerve or something. I hate everything!!! Not to mention overtime throughout the years, having sex became difficult because every time after sex, even though it was not touched or stimulated, my clitoris would act up and I would have to relieve it. I have also been having pain during sex since. I have been super suicidal and nothing feels real anymore. I am at a total loss. Perhaps I have pelvic floor? I have always urinated during masturbation and everything always felt tight around there. If I sit for too long I start to get this numbing sensation around the clitoris which then turns into PGAD. I have also noticed overtime the left side of my clitoris became more irritated and worse than the left somehow, it makes no sense. I want fucking relief and answers.", "What decreased my PGAD significantly So I decided to post this because as of yet I have not seen my \"approach\" to greatly relieving my PGAD symptoms and this might help someone. I started having symptoms June of last year after starting an antidepressant AND having a UTI. On top of that, I would had a really traumatic miscarriage the year before and it messed up my pelvic floor.\n\nLike most, I was completely freaking out when first diagnosed and IMMEDIATELY started reaching out to doctors. I eventually made my way to a pelvic floor specialist and she was able to point out that not only were my pelvic floor muscles cramped up, the whole right side of my body was cramped up. She was able to demonstrate how stretching my leg a certain direction greatly reduced the symptoms. The next several sessions was her trying a bunch of different things to see what helped, some did and some did not. She explained that the pelvic floor is SO connected to the rest of the body that working on other places would help reduce my symptoms, and it started WORKING. Ultimately it was certain stretches that helped \"even out\" my body and loosen up the muscles near my sacrum. Sacral chakra-specific yoga also help, as did breathing exercises where I imagine my pelvic muscles relaxing and opening up. I then started seeing a Myofascial massage therapist who helped me with the trauma side of my muscle issues. \n\nThrough my own research and testing out things on my body, I was able to isolate certain muscles in my glutes that were perpetually tense and painful to the touch. Whenever I have a flare up, I have my husband massage those muscles or I use a foam roller. Sometimes if I just pinch the muscle it will make the PGAD either go away or reduce enough that I do not think about it. A TENS unit in that exact spot also helps and sometimes feels like it switches the \"off switch\" on the PGAD. ALSO.. here is the big kicker. Massaging my right foot (the side of my body that cramps up) will get rid of my PGAD. Not super long term, but if I am somewhere were I have to sit for a while or dealing with a bad flare up, I will roll a tennis ball with my foot. Sometimes I will have my husband press this one pressure point on my foot and it will do the trick SO GOOD. ALSO, whenever I am flared up, instead of putting ice directly between my legs, I will put it on other parts of my body that are tense... under my thigh or my foot or even my stomach muscles. I have found that drawing the attention away from the clitoris helps a lot. \n\nWhen I was in the worst of it, it felt like my body was my enemy, which sucked a lot. It helped to build up a more trusting relationship with my body where I was very intentional with self care and connection. Sometimes I would even look at my clitoris and say \"I am not afraid of you.\" Psychologically, it helped a lot. Sex has even been possible because I am able to use all those techniques (plus a cold water bath) to \"come down\" after sex AND the heightened sensitivity has made my orgasms EPICALLY stronger. Seriously have never had organisms this strong. It took some time to get back into sex, and we took it small steps at a time while I built up my coping and \"come down\" techniques. Eventually, sex became something that helped me relax and be in tune with my body, thereby reducing the symptoms. Sometimes it actually helped take the edge off and if I go to sleep right after sex I will wake up the next morning with minimal to no symptoms.\n\nMy approach is not a complete cure, but I have gone months and months with out being really bothered by the PGAD. I am currently in the middle of a bad flare up because of hardcore stress and unfortunately another miscarriage, so I am going to look into having a surgeon do the neurolysis of the dorsal nerves to see if it will get rid of it for good, but overall I have a lot of hope with managing it and being able to live my life.  Approaching the PGAD problem through the perspective of muscles has really changed the game for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps someone! I know PGAD is so unpredictable and the \"cures\" almost random and many of you(us) have tried a million different things. If you try these exercises and it helps let me know how it goes! Curious to see who else it helps. Thank you so much for sharing! It is so important to bring attention to all of the little things we can do to help. Healing is not all about doctors and surgeries, but also what we can do ourselves. \n\nPGAD can be terrible, but I know I never would have taken as great of care of myself had I not been forced to listen to my body because of it. Can you explain what you are supposed to tell tell the neurologist for a diagnosis and treatment? My wife has been suffering and one of the hardest parts has been the uncomfortable laughter or dismissive jokes from doctors. She truly believes that no one will believe her or that there a so few doctors that have any experience with PGAD that no one can help her. Your post gave both of us some hope, thank you so much. We are both in our mid 20\u2019s and at this point I am just hoping we can at least kiss without potentially triggering symptoms. The way I explain it to doctors (that gets them to take it seriously) is that many women have pelvic floor dysfunction that USUALLY leads to pain, but if the nerve to the clitoris is compressed by the muscles, then it leads to a different sensation. I use the term \"pudendal neuralgia\" so they can relate it to something similar. I always mention that this condition leads to many women having suicidal thoughts, and that usually wipes the smile off their face. In my experience dealing with MANY different doctors, there is usually one or two (usually women) who quickly jump to doing a ton of research and are reassuring that they are \"with me\" all the way. Because I live in San Diego (same place as the specialist  Dr. Irwin Goldstein) him and another OBGYN (Dr. Erin Gross) have gone around to many doctors and offices to educate about PGAD, so a lot of times the doc has already heard of it. absolutely! The more educated I become about PGAD the more it \"makes sense\" to me. My hypothesis is that it is very muscle related, but it is deep pelvic muscles that tense up with stress and it is hard to control them with out a lot of pelvic floor therapy and release. Thank you so much, you have no idea how helpful this is. We have tried a few different OBGYN\u2019s and neurologists with no success but we are going to keep on trying. This will help a lot I am sure.\n\nAre Goldstein and Gross the experts on this condition? Goldstein is basically the PGAD God. He is really into finding Tarlov Cysts so he will order a full workup including spine MRIs, but he has several different treatment options like pelvic floor botox. The pelvic floor physical therapist who helped me sooo much is also in the same building. Dr. Goldstein and the physical therapist kind of work together to figure out WHERE along the nerves the PGAD is being triggered. He is also connected to other doctors and surgeons with experience in treating PGAD. There is a neurosurgeon A. Lee Dellon in Las Vegas &amp; Maryland who does the dorsal nerve neurolysis if the nerve compression is on the dorsal nerve. There is a surgeon in Detroit who does the sacral nerve stimulation implant. there is another surgeon in San Diego who operates on Tarlov Cysts. Unfortunately, we have such a rare condition that I think it requires trying things allover the country if meds do not work, but I sure as hell am not giving up. Dr. Gross specializes in pelvic floor disfunction but she basically will help diagnose and refer you out to specialists. She is booked for months and months though. Might need to try to book an appointment and some plane tickets. Thank you! absolutely! Come down to San Diego, enjoy the beach and see Dr. Goldstein. The full workup with all the diagnostic stuff will cost around $2500 including the MRI imaging they will do of your pelvis. IF you can, I would try to see the pelvic floor physical therapist a couple of times that is down the hallway. Her name is Pam and she will help narrow down the muscles you need to work on.", "I think i have pgad Hey guys I am 13 and a male and I know it might be insane to think that a 13 year old boy can have it but let me explain my symptoms.

I am 22F, and I am wondering if I may have PGAD,  but there is one thing that makes me unsure. Recently, I was finally diagnosed with interstitial cystitis after years of constantly feeling the need to urinate (even when there is not even anything in my bladder), and burning/itching/heavy pressure sensations in my vulvar and vaginal areas (both the vulva and a little actually inside my vaginal opening). I am also in a constant state of arousal. It never goes away, and it only lessens some for a few minutes to an hour at most after orgasming. I nearly always feel wet, my breasts get really sensitive and swollen out of nowhere, and I nearly always feel swollen and throbbing in my vulvar area. However, I know that actual desire and mental arousal are not supposed to be part of PGAD, but I nearly constantly feel that as well. Occasionally, I will not be in the mood, but still have the physical symptoms and feel like I have to try to orgasm even though I am annoyed and do not want to. Do any of you feel mentally aroused as almost as often as you do physically? Is it possible to have both PGAD and hypersexuality? I have not mentioned any of this to my doctor because it is so embarrassing and I feel so ashamed. I always feel stupid and think, like, what am I going to say? \u201cI am super horny all the time, but also still need to come on the occasion that I am not actually mentally horny\u201d? Eventually, I know I will have to talk to my gyn about it, but I would really appreciate any insight or advice from you guys before I do so that I can maybe get a better feel for what I even need to say to her.

Here is a post from mine 3 months ago about sex addiction\n\n Hey Idk but I am female too around your age and I kind have the same problem :( I know I do have pgad since I too feel the sensations unwantedly but a lot of times I have such sexual thoughts too. Though I cant tell if my thoughts are caused by my PGAD or not but I know before PGAD I barely use to think about sex or sex related stuff. Please share  if you learned anything useful regarding this.", "How I relieved my PGAD symptoms Hello, I am a 31 year old woman who suddenly started experiencing symptoms of PGAD about a week ago. I was in total agony for 4 consecutive days, not sleeping, and could feel my mental health spiraling, things were not looking good. \n\nI found this sub and heard about doing pelvic floor stretches.  \nI followed a youtube stretching routine 3 or more times per day, and immediately noticed some relief. After 3 days my symptoms were pretty much gone, however I had a bit of PTSD I had to start working through as I was afraid of my own body, and would have anxiety just from standing around for a few minutes.\n I use meditation to relieve my stress and anxiety, I have been doing so for years and can say that I feel pretty normal today, just some lingering stress that I can feel gradually fading. I still do the stretching routine twice a day, and plan on continuing the habit for the foreseeable future.\n\nI wanted to share my story because I feel as if this YouTube video gave me my life back, and while I know there are different possible causes for PGAD symptoms, there is a chance this video can help someone else.\n\nI followed this routine at least 3x per day on the bad days, and 2x per day on normal days: (", "do i have PGAD pls help!! im so anxious so for the past months my genital area has been feeling well.. for no reason when i sit down i feel a pressure around my clitoris and sides of my vaginal area and it feels so uncomfortable and im very paranoid about it these people have been saying im making sounds when im not its been proved but this damaged me alot and im so very anxious im making innapropiate moaning sounds mann im just so scared why do i feel like this?? its even when i walk and get anxious it triggers the area around my vagina feels like it has pressure and a almost itch around the sides i get tinglyness too sometimes i usally feel it for hours also, please tell me what it is and please pray for me :(\n\nalso i have add so im not sure if that contributes to the fact but pls help me This sounds awful :( I am so sorry, I am kind of going through a similar thing and got a couple of doctors to check it out, one was completely useless and the other was really helpful and heard me so it made me feel much better! yeah i know it sucks everyday im paranoid about it,  also could u also tell me what the doctor said, u dont have to! but it would make me feel better and atleast help me I will DM you", "Symptoms began two months ago. Hey all.\n\nMy story is - My symptoms began close to two months ago. At first it was just once in a while, then it ramped up in intensity as the days went on. I began taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen every 4 hours. My symptoms present as constant, intense arousal in my clitoris that wraps down into my vagina and up to where my g spot is. I do not spontaneously orgasm, but my clitoris is constantly aroused with a buzzing,  throbbing feeling. I was masturbating 4-5 times a day bc like so many stories I read, I thought the release would help, but it did not. I am now trying to not masturbate, but it is hard when it feels like I need to. I do not have pain per se, but there is sometimes a stinging sensation, usually when I pee. Otherwise it is this constant sexual feeling of throbbing/buzzing.  It is worse when I sit on a hard chair or do core exercises.  \n\nInitially, I thought it was connected to being on Testosterone (I am trans FtM) bc my clitoris had grown quite a bit and I was also masturbating way more often due to an increased sexual arousal.  \n\nSo I discontinued Testosterone therapy. My last injection was a month ago. My symptoms then improved for a few weeks, to the point where I was forgetting what it felt like. \n\nThen it started to come back again a week ago, just a blip for a few minutes at first, and now ramping up again, to the point where I ended up in the hospital yesterday, crying hysterically. \n\nI had my first appointment with a pelvic physiologist and a urologist last week. The urologist took a urine sample, it came back as having an infection due to too high of levels of ureaplasma, so I am on doxycycline for that, but I did not find that out until yesterday so I have only taken my first two doses. \n\nThe pelvic physiologist gave me lot of information that was a little overwhelming.  She explained the muscles of the pelvic to me - I was sexually abused as a very young child and we discussed how tense and hypervigilant my pelvic muscles have been for the last 30 years  - I am 36 now -  she did a physical exam and a just an initial introduction to pelvic massage. She was very confident that treatment will help. However,  this was when my symptoms had mostly gone away and we were thinking it was related to the Testosterone. \n\nI began reading about PGAD yesterday and I am scared that this is what I have and that it will lead to suicide \ud83d\udc94 this feeling is horrifically triggering for me bc it is reminiscent of the way my vagina felt after the sessions of child abuse - irriated, stimulated, no way to make it stop.  \n\nThe other thing I think of is that 4 days before these symptoms started, I had finished weaning off Effexor, which I had been on for the last 4 years. I read that anti-depressants can have an effect and I have been on some sort of anti-depressant since I was 17 and now I have been on nothing for the last 40 days.  \n\nWhen I googled Effexor, bc I could not remember if it was an SSRI or not and it came up listed as an anti-depressant and a nerve pain medication, I had no idea it was a nerve pain med. I am wondering if that could have spurred it on. \n\nYesterday they prescribed me Xanax, put me on Prozac (Fluoxetine), and started me on the Doxycycline. They also referred me to a pain management clinic to have them evaluate my Pudendal Nerve. They also prescribed me vaginal Valium suppositories, I am seeing conflicting information about that on the net. \n\nHas anyone been on Testosterone, had this happen, and stopped taking Testosterone? Did it help? How long did it take after stopping for the symptoms to subside?\n\nHas anyone been on Effexor or an anti-depressant and stopped and had this happen? \n\nHas anyone tried the vaginal suppositions and gotten relief?\n\nThanks everyone \u2764 Ureaplasma is a STI that causes sensitive clit among other unpleasant symptoms. I doubt your medication had something to do with it.", "Do I Have Pgad(Male) Hello Everyone I am new here to reddit, Anyway my problem is very weird. One day I decided that I wanted to shave my pubic hair, so I did, but after I was done I got this weird tickling/tingling sensation down under my testicles and or near my perenium. In a way it kind of feels orgasmic, but the feeling is not going away. It gets better when I exercise, but when I am alone or sitting or laying down is when it will get really bad. I would not say that I am experiencing any full orgasm, but it feels like I am about to orgasm, but like only a little bit. Hard to explain. It gets better in the morning, but throughout the day the tickling/tingling sensation gets much worse. Anxiety also makes it worse. I have only had this for 3 days, and I looked up my symptoms. The only thing that is popping up is PGAD. The internet says that this is a rare condition and that it affects mostly women. I am a male, so I feel very isolated and alone with this. If I do have this than I must have the worst luck ever considering how rare it is in males.  The feeling just feels very annoying in the background, and I do not want to live like this. I also really hope this is not PGAD, because I looked up PGAD, and people are saying that this makes people commit suicide. There also is not a cure or anything, so that also make me really upset. So my question is does this sound like Pgad? Does anyone get that weird tickling sensation down there? I do not really experience any pain or burning. Mainly just this annoying tickling feeling that kind of feels orgasmic. What do you guys think? I am scared. \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out. You can find help at a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline\n\nUSA: 18002738255\nUS Crisis textline: 741741 text HOME\n\nUnited Kingdom: 116 123\n\nTrans Lifeline (877-565-8860)\n\nOthers: \n\n Hello, I am very sorry you are experiencing this. Try not to always rely on what google says, I tend to look up my symptoms too but it only makes me feel worse. The internet will tell you all sorts of stories and it can only increase your anxiety. I would talk to a Dr. And see what they say. It could be a number of things (infection, hormonal imbalance etc). Try and stay positive, things can always get better :) I hope you get to feeling better soon! I am not sure if it is PGAD or not, I think most men with PGAD experience persistent erections? For women, our clitoris is engorged and hyper-sensitive, and that is analogous to the glans of the penis. Considering where you are feeling the sensation, maybe you should see a doctor and make sure everything is ok down there. You might have shifted something after moving your bits around while shaving? My bigger concern would be something towards testicular torsion because you are feeling it so close to your testicles. I have heard awful stories about men getting torsion from even innocuous shifts to their testicles, so that is where my mind went. It could be that some of the connective tubes got tweaked and are hitting the nerves responsible for that sensation? Thanks for your reply. I have heard of testicle torsion, and from what I have heard people say that it is painful. I do not recall any pain. I mainly just recall a tickly feeling around my perenium area, and sometimes it gives me chills. It also gives me an urge to poop. I do not experience erections from this, but I have heard from others on reddit that you can still have this without erections. I will definitely see a doctor about this, but i am sure that the doctor is probably not even going to know what to say. I will give it time and see what happens. I hope im ok. Maybe try to get an ultrasound to make sure everything is where it is supposed to be? That is probably expensive, but I will try anything. Thx Hello again, I forgot to mention that the tingling switches from the perineum to the glans occasionally. It gets really really uncomfortable when it moves to the glans, so my question is how do you handle that? Do you just accept it to be there and then it gets better? Do you think it is very uncomfortable too? Sorry if this is a little tmi. but I really need some advice with this. That is ok, I have no filter, which has actually been a good thing when it comes to this disorder. lol Since I do not have a penis I am not entirely sure. For me, when it flares up, my clitoris is just like, tense? Non-stop until it finally fades. It can be really distracting and frustrating, and sex or masturbation makes it worse. I feel relief for a moment, then it comes back stronger. Usually it only lasts a week or so then things calm down. I suppose it is more like an erection that just will not quit? \n\nI think if it is intermittent for you, that might be a nerve related thing? Does it depend on your position? It is possible that something is putting pressure on the nerve. Sorry, I forgot how shitty getting medical care is in this country. Yeah I am not sure what is going on. I just notice that the weird feeling just switches from one spot to another(perenium and shaft) though the shaft is usually triggered if I touch it a bunch, therefore it gives me a weird feeling there, like a lot of sensitivity which made me think it was PGAD, but it switches spots, so do people with PGAD experience the sensation switching to different areas in the genitals? I also do not know if shaving pubes could even cause it, since I heard that PGAD is caused from the spine. I hope it is not PGAD since PGAD does not seem to have any successful treatments,  but maybe I am wrong. Shaking  my legs seems to trigger it, touching the shaft, and sometimes running does to. For me masturbation does not make it worse, but I can still feel the tingling sensation even after I am done. Not as bad, but it is still kind of there. The only true friend that I can talk to physically is my sister. She says that I should see a doctor and that this PGAD worry is just me being a hypochondriac. Hope she is right. Anyways I hope this heals. I cannot tell if it is getting better or not. I think I am approaching it better than I used to, but I am not sure. I just hope the doctors can figure out what is wrong. Thanks for the talk... sorry if it is weird lol Since it comes and goes, I do not think it is PGAD but I could see how that would be something you would suspect. It might go away on it is own too. Bodies can be weird sometimes. Hopefully the doctor has an answer that does not require more than an exam. I would give it a bit before you jump the gun.  Work on lowering your anxiety and let the internet search portion fade from your mind a bit. Also shaving your groin is a massive ouch once it starts growing back. The area is a heavy large nerve network, so let things fully grow back as well. Two weeks after your hair grows back if the issue persists then it is time to consider an action plan. The persistent erections thing is a speculation. No as a male you can have Pgad without it. The reason for this is because you have many many nerve branches in your pelvis.\n\nPenis Pgad is different from general pelvic Pgad, perenium pgad, or prostate focused Pgad. Since every person is different and you can have just 1 or several neural networks involved priapism (persistent erection) is still very rare and just the most noticable.\n\nThe most common thing is called soft hard syndrome which entails the system is in full force but the man will remain soft or mostly soft.\n\nPersonally my system doesnt even allow soft hard syndrome and i get genital pain but have perenium/prostate arousal. So the mixed signal chokes itself not even allowing a natural release.\n\nSo yeah Pgad is weird and its sucks that it affects each person so differently that there is no real cure. Thankfully i am on a good plan now so its getting better. i agree with aserranzira on this. Without some passed time to see if it is sticking around, a plan of action is kind of fuzzy. In my case i had several of the symptoms of Pgad while growing up. But i didnt have it become a true condition until over a year ago when a medication mixed and combined them all together.\n\nWeird sensitivity sensations suck but the main symptom of Pgad is some form of permanent arousal signal that rarely goes away. This symptom is different than being horny because when you are done with sex the urge to keep going is gone. In someone with Pgad trying to reach a natural release will often piss off Pgad even more leading to more arousal, pain, and increased sensations. Once a natural release is obtained the arousal doesnt go away and may often increase.\n\nI suspect that sitting or your personal actions may be pinching or be affecting the perineum nerve. The perineum nerve being compressed over the day can cause exactly what you described for the poo urgency and the penis head pain. Common causes are biking, working out legs, stretching, or sitting for long periods.\n\nAlso yeah &gt;\\_&lt; i get that weird ball tingle at times. Its not a medical emergency but honestly Casper needs to keep his finger tips to himself lol.\n\nEdits: sorry cleanup and organization. my brain works funny Ah! Thanks, I was trying my best to relate as a woman, but I just did not know. NP! The last year has been........ eventful and a learning experience on my end. Yes exactly sitting down seems to cause the perineum nerve to go crazy and it does switch to the penis glands either those two. I do not know if that is what PGAD is supposed to feel like. It is hard to say if the tingling sensation is sexual. I kind of think it is just annoying, I also do not experience any erections with this, so that makes me think that maybe I might not have it, but I am not totally sure. I will give it more time. It actually feels a bit better today for some reason, maybe that is a good sign. Anyways thanks for you and asseranzina\u2019s opinions on this. This tends to also make my bladder feel weird, this whole 2020 year has been weird for me tbh. Hi, I have been experiencing the same thing too since 3 months ago. But my symptoms are improved now. So IDK if this can help you but I have been doing pelvic floor stretches and walking. And I try to not think of it (I know it is hard). I try to live normally but more active. I was an inactive person. Oh btw I am a male and I will turn 18 this September. I try to be more active and drink more water. Idk why this happens to me but I can be many reasons. Maybe because I was an inactive person made my pelvic floor sick or made my hormone imbalance. I masturbated too! 2-3 times per day. I seriously regret it now. But I try to stop doing masturbation and do exercises more. I also eat black seed oil supplements. And of coz, I pray to God for helping me out of this difficult situation too. My symptoms are not 100% gone but I definitely feel better.\n\nAbout the stretches, I told earlier here is the link\n\nAnd if you watch porn, I recommend you to stop as it can make your hormones imbalance and try to do more exercise like walking but definitely not the ones that can make your pelvic floor hurt.\n\nAnd if you have lower back pain, I think you better do something about that maybe do exercises for it and change your bad posture... Do something about all the pain you feel it may have something to do with your symptoms. Do the exercises specifically for them. Drink a lot of water and pray to God. \n\nThat is what I have been doing. I just hope it will help me and you as well. Hey everlucky, so it is been like 2 weeksand I still have this tingling feeling, and it is traveled to my prostate. Occasionally it will go to the glans but mainly it just stays in the prostate, and sometimes it might even travel to my stomach too. So I am quite depressed because at this point I am pretty sure I have it. Anyways my question is how do you cope with this? You said that you had prostate/perenium arousal, and that sounds like me, so I think that I could relate to you more. Anyways what helps you. Btw I do not experience  much pain with this, but the constant tickling feeling may feel worse. What has helped you? my doctor has me prescribed a long term muscle relaxer that helps with the middle and upper pelvic muscles so they dont flex constantly when i am having a sensitivity attack. I also go to physical therapy to help move pelvic pressure so i can achieve a natural release to lower the orgasm/arousal signal.Lastly i recently started a pain specialist promgram where they do shots. \n\nOn the making it worse side i have an exercise program that makes me work my pelvic muscles. Part of my issue is bad pelvic floor muscle tone. I am also a stay at home person so I sit a fairly high amount when not running errands on my bike or walking ( i am visually disabled so i cant drive).\n\nMedical field aside, try and see if being in an aroused state makes it worse. This is important because some people can lower the signal through masturbation. If you can then good because just seeing a urologist for a consultation, and maybe referral to a pelvic specialized physical therapist is the easiest route.\n\nBeing tested for a prostate infection is a very good option. An infection can most defiantly cause genital pain and prostate sensitivity. This can certainly mimic Pgad if you turn out just need an antibiotic and a month or so for the prostate tissue to become healthy again. Prostate infections are more common than you think and large percent of men get it before they are even 30 years old. You will be happy to know that regular masturbation is not the reason nor is hormone imbalance. So do not feel like that cursed you with it :D.  The only thing that can cause is penis chafing if you are too rough with yourself.\n\nBut yes pelvic floor issues can be a factor so good job finding something that works for you Ok thank you, quick question is it normal to experience arousal feelings in your chest, stomach, or even throat? The sensation seems to travel in my case. What do you think of this? due to pgad being an arousal issue yes you can feel anything that you normally feel when you are sharing time with another or just by yourself. so yup your face can flush and your chest and nipples can become super sensitive. \nStimulation from a prostate infection can cause pleasure as well so it is important to see if it is a prostate infection or a nerve/muscle issue like Pgad :D Even you said that it does not have anything to do with masturbation I still believe all these symptoms caused by masturbation. Here is why I think like that.\n\nI started masturbating since I was 10 or 11 y/o and at that time I did not even know what I was doing. All I knew it feels good. And when I was 11 I started having back pain and frequent urination but at that time I think it was normal. Skip forward when I was 14 I started having acne problem and it usually breaks out after I ejaculated. And after I masturbated my stomach would hurt and I would have to go to the toilet. My body became weaker and weaker. I started having mental issues like anxiety and panic attacks. And I was not really a problem until this year I started to feel like want to pee 24/7 the sensation never stop even after I pied and my penis started feeling a weird sensation. It feels like I am about to ejaculate but not. The sensation is little but enough to mess up my mind. My lower stomach hurts. And I remember last week my penis having an erection and suddenly ejaculated on it own. It is weird. \n\nBefore I started masturbating I was a normal kid. \nIt is definitely has something to do with masturbation.   Many doctors and websites claim that masturbation does not have bad consequences yet here I am suffering from unknown symptoms that I got after years of masturbating. I admit once I believed in those articles that claim masturbation does not have bad consequences, so I continued doing it even it makes me feel ill, day by day I become iller. Until the point that even I feel sick, I still believe it is normal. \nSo, please stop telling me that it does not have anything to do with masturbation cuz it does! \n\nAt the end of the day, it is all up to you to believe it or not. I believe what I believe, cuz it is my own experience not what people on the Internet say. Please do not reply to this to convince me because I will not change my mind. I am tired of believing masturbation is good cuz it did not bring anything beneficial to me but some mental issues and these unexplained symptoms. Ok thanks again, my worst fear is that the pgad will move to other areas of my body including my brain. Is that even possible? I got it in my throat yesterday instead of my genitals. Is it possible that this could all be in my head? I just hope things will be brighter in the future. It is very possible that the worry you are brewing up could be unfortunately messing with your perception. My personal name for mental caused symptoms is Ghost Symptoms. The anxiety caused from reading about about health issues can actually fabricate problematic symptoms from nothing.\n\nMany Doctors while in collage actually end up with Ghost Symptoms from all the health and sickness studies that they do while learning about their proffession. Mental disorders like hypochondria can actually do this too. \n\nif you have ever heard of the placebo effect the mind is extremely good at altering perceptions. In any case the mental stress from your worry definitely is not helping With or without the disorder since the interaction between a pain symptom and your brain just makes it stronger the more you focus on it.\n\nPgad is definitely one of those disorders that are truly terrifying. So even if you have a matching symptom or two anxiety can fuel to make those even stronger or worse. No worries everyone knows their own body best. I am just glad you have found something that works for you since few men with this issue work at a recovery program or even acknowledge that the disorder exists. Oh really, I have never even heard of anxiety ghost symptoms before. I think that might be what I am experience since I do have a history of hypochondria and ocd. Plus the symptoms I am describing do not really sound like pgad. Yeah that makes more sense. Wow the brain is a very powerful place lol. Thank you soo much, you have been a huge help. You have soo much good info. You should go into the medical field. Thanks man. No worries! it always helps to have someone to talk things out with :3 Hi again, I talked to my doctor and he said that I was experiencing symptoms of anxiety,and what I am feeling down there is from hormones caused by anxiety. So does that mean that the hormones are mimicking pgad? Is that how it works? Sorry for the questions I am just curious with what is going on. I am also experiencing some nausea lately, so idk if pgad causes that or if that is something else. Nope pgad does not affect the digestive network of nerves to cause anything like nausea. it stays in the pelvis. Hey thanks for the support, I have that same thing too where I have that urge to ejaculate but it sometimes gets better. I just wish that doctors could know more about this disorder. I understand that it feels isolating, especially if you are a male with it. I am just curious do you know what caused yours? I recently got off my SSRI and I have been experiencing low-key PGAD along with nerve pain/restless leg symptoms. There seems to be a genetic component too, because my mom has experienced the same sort of thing throughout her life, along with RLS more recently. So, it is definitely a nervous system thing related to serotonin levels. So high serotonin makes yours better usually? It must be more challenging for a woman, your clitoris tenses up ,and a man gets the obvious erections. My point is ,it must be more difficult for a woman to have it diagnosed.", "Men Hey guys,does anyone have any advice on how to keep your relationship going while having pgad Tell her not to take your unquenchable libido personally.

I also have PGAD, vaginismus, and recurring infections. \nI am not sure what could have triggered your symptoms, but it can definitely be emotional/psychological.

Anyone have any success stories to share and what helped them overcome this nightmare?", "New To This But I Think I May Have PGAD 19 Female here. I want to tell my story here, it might be a bit confusing or lengthy but I will tell it anyway.\nIt started about 8 months ago, with what I would assume at the time was just intrusive sexual thoughts. I had not felt any arousal for about a year before this, and was coming to terms with the idea that I may be asexual, when suddenly I felt like everything was sexual or arousing to me, including things that I found distressing (I thought for a while I may have pOCD, that is still on the table but its all very confusing). \nIntrusive thoughts definitely played a part in it but what was impacting me most was that things that I would never found sexually appealing before and that ordinarily would not be sexual at all seemed to be making me aroused. Just existing seemed to be what was triggering it. Despite this, I could not really enjoy masturbation, I would always found it kind of underwhelming but after getting these feelings they felt even more so, as if I could not satisfy myself in the least, even with orgasm. I have ended up masturbating an incredible amount more than I ever used to, up to 3 or 4 times a night when its at its worst.\nOver time, I feel like the intrusive thoughts aspect has lessened. I do not know if I am getting used to them, learning to cope with them better, whether they have just been going away or what. But the constant arousal has stayed, as has the constant feelings of dissatisfaction.\nSince this started, I have felt that this arousal completely overrides all my other feelings and its made me horribly depressed. I have a nonsexual partner who I loved deeply and I believe I still do on some level, but its as if those positive feelings have been absolutely smothered. They are insanely understanding and supportive about this (I am very open to them about it) and I wish I could feel the comfort I know I should from that, but I just cannot. I signed up for a mindful self-compassion program but when they recommend to hug yourself or think about things to comfort yourself, there is just nothing there but arousal and the overwhelming need to masturbate. I am strongly considering seeking out a sexual relationship to have on the side (with all parties consenting, my partner knows about this) in case that is the problem, but I am afraid what its going to mean if that does not change anything for me.\nI have talked to two therapists about it now, (about to move on to the third) but neither of them have understood. They focus in on trying to cure the shame I feel about this arousal, and I can understand where they are coming from but it all just makes me feel misunderstood and hopeless. \n\nI am not as concerned about learning the name for this as I am to know if its possible to feel joy again. If this is PGAD, will I ever again be able to feel good about wearing a nice outfit, eating nice food, or hanging out with animals? Will I be able to feel platonic affection and love again and feel comforted by a hug? I am scared that this arousal will be all that is left of me as it feels like it has been for the last 8 months. Has anyone with this been able to overcome the emotional toll and manage to enjoy life in spite of it, or is it better to accept I may not feel these things again and just try to live my life despite it?", "New here, but not to this. Hi,I  a 40 yo woman who has never been formally diagnosed.  It is so embarrassing and I did not think they could do anything anyway.  However, I am not thinking I much.  I am actually on the verge of going to the emergency room today because it is unbreakable. \n\nI also have severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD which I know can often be comorbid. \n\nMy journey started YOUNG, at least several issues before puberty.  If I felt embarrassed or frustrated, those feelings migrated to my clitoral area and rubbing against things was the only help. I got in trouble with my parents, but I did not know why and the drive was impossible to stop.\n\nI understand it is aa bit more now, but it does not feel like a sex drive. As far as I know, I am asexual and have never been sexually interested in anyone.  I am not a romantic.  I have had several relationships with men, I have of which produced me son, and I am now married to my wife.  I am simply not sexually attracted to them.  I can find partnered sex pleasant, but rarely orgasm or seek it out.\n\nOver the years, I have been on a variety of legs and supplements for my depression that help suppress libido.  Alot of doctors do not like using certain ones because of sexual side effects and I am super eager to get those. \n\nBut that brings me to today.  Two weeks all we stopped all my meds so I could get a baseline on how I feel.  It went very badly with physical withdrawal symptoms, so we had to add one back to control muscle spasms.  But I was ashamed of the libido stuff and did not mention it.  Guys, in the last 72 hours, I have been probably masturbation 50!.  I cannot even think straight.  I kind of want to go to the ER, BUT HOW? Aside from the off the wall complaint, how could I wait in the waiting room without making a scene?\n\nUgh\n\nAlso, I have PCOS.  Does anyone know of this is related to high testosterone? I hope you are feeling better now. \n\nI am not sure what ER could do as I do not think it would be classed as an emergency but definitely persist with going to your dr. \n\nI also have pcos and it is linked to higher levels of testosterone, that is why the symptoms are facial hair and missed periods.", "The nightmare is back again!!! I thought I would never ever be here again after being cured form this hell!!!i guess I was wrong after 2 years of completely being normal again and living my life to maxim traveling and making good memories now I am back at ground zero!!!!!i used to take ssri anti depressants to cure this been taking it  for 2 years now the last 4 months or so I stopped taking them permanently like I only take pill or so every 2 weeks or when I have panic attacks I did not notice any change everything was normal but a couple of day\u2019s ago I took pill !!!!started to feel weird down there like pounding of throbbing in my private area!!!iwas like I hope it is not pgad again!!!it lasted for 4 or 5 days I took another pill thinking it will fix this !!!!stupid me!!after that the pgad come back with its same felling and sensation I stared crying and hitting my self please god do not let it be please do not let the devil possess me again I was a good person for 2 years  I did not masturbate or engaged in any wrong doing please do not punish me!!! Hey, I know how you feel and it is awful. But please do not hit yourself or blame yourself for the PGAD coming back. I do not know where you got the idea that the devil is using it to punish you, but I get that it can feel like a punishment, like \u201cwhy me??!!\u201d \n\nYou just had bad luck. Me too. One theory I like about pain (physical or mental) is that maybe there is a certain amount of pain that must exist on the earth and everyone takes turns carrying it. Some very lucky people never have to carry it. Other people have to carry it a lot. I like this idea because it makes me think that maybe me being in this pain right now means I lifted it off someone else in the world, and they are feeling great relief. It is just an idea I like. \n\nI also do not think you should rush to conclusions. You do not know the PGAD is back to stay. \n\nBy the way - changes in medication can trigger PGAD, and you are not supposed to take SSRI antidepressants on an as-needed basis for panic attacks. Did your doctor advise you to stop regularly taking those SSRIs 4 months ago? Of course I cannot know for sure, but I think maybe if you go back on your medication and take it every day you will find the PGAD goes away again. But I am not a doctor so the most important thing is for you to contact your doctor right away! I am a guy, 26. I stopped my antidepressant, Zoloft 100 mg, about six weeks ago and I started feeling this way. It comes and goes, but it is torture. I feel for you, no one should have to deal with any of this. I am talking to my psychiatrist and primary care doc to see what we can do. We cannot loose hope, it is just not an option. Best of luck. Mine started without medication  it is actually what cured my pgad !!i do not know what is going wrong Did you try to get back to your medication because I was on the lowest dose 25 mg for year and a half!!!! Actually my doctor do not know shit we do not  discuss these topics here it almost forbidden!!and I would rather die than to talk about this with anyone!!!I lied to him about having him anxiety and gave me this and it what help me and I continue without stoping he gave for 6 months I took it for almost 2 years!!! Okay, then again, as NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, I would suggest going back on your SSRI and taking it every day like before.  I am going to bring it up to my psychiatrist. If I go back on Zoloft and stops I would be so relieved.", "PGAD caused by dermatitis/allergic reaction Hi, I just wanted to post this in case it provides an \"aha\" moment for anyone.\n\nBack in October of 2020, I developed PGAD symptoms. I had dealt with this before, after coming off Prozac, but the difference was that only lasted a couple of weeks -- and this was not going away. Symptoms continued for around four months. I even started noticing I was sore down there, almost raw.\n\nOne day I used a new soap, and my entire body broke out in a horrible itch. Along with this, my vulva became extremely sore, red and irritated. The \"arousal\" feeling turned into burning. I went to the doctor and got diagnosed with contact dermatitis of the vulva. Guess what substance was in common with both that soap and the lubricant I had been using for years... Aloe vera! Apparently, I am allergic to the plant that is supposed to help with reactions. Go figure.\n\nAs my reaction died down, I saw a decrease in both the burning and the PGAD symptoms. For me, low-grade irritation down there feels like arousal. Every time it is flared up again since, it is been because I became allergic to a new substance.\n\nObviously, this will not be the answer for every single person, but if you are at a loss, it might be an idea to treat your PGAD like an allergic reaction. I wanted to post here since I read through many of you guys' posts while I was in a pretty dark place trying to figure out what the hell was happening to my body.", "PGAD from Descending Modulation Hello, does anyone know about developing PGAD from Descending Modulation? Basically from using neural pathways that strengthen to become hyperactive? \nI have OCD and I have a worry about being aroused and I have a variation of PGAD now\n(I am male) I would suspect that your ocd is causing that/making it appear that way as opposed to it being a legitimately worrisome case of PGAD. If you want some maxims I use to work on my ocd message me. It causes me immense distress, my OCD did cause it but it is a real sensation that I feel that is very uncomfortable. Like I said it is a \"variation\" of PGAD. I have also read someone who feared getting PGAD actually developed similar symptoms. It is a neurological connection. What are maxims? I do not think any advice will help my case. Like mantras Mantras only  reassure ? Mantras cannot help OCD They do for me. How? Do you keep repeating them to yourself? During spikes That is reassurance and it is not good for OCD. I already have a few sayings for myself but using them over and over is not going to make the OCD better. Btw do you have PGAD? Are you male or female? Oh, no no no, they are not reassurance on the topic of the OCD itself. Just things like, \"I am ready to move on now.\" It does not have to be about the OCD. That phrase is a form of avoidance and it is a compulsion. That is your opinion, but it is similar to meditation Meditation can help short term but it is not the answer for long term recovery. That is the truth. I dm'd you btw Are you afraid to answer my question? Coward Hey what exactly is descending modulation?", "i cant tell if this is pgad or not but its driving me crazy during my period, i(20F) was masturbating and when i \u201cfinished\u201d it felt like it was lingering on which was odd to me. now, i have this strange feeling down there and i have for the past 4 days. its not like im about to orgasm, just more like an aroused feeling that comes on when i have to pee or im stressed / thinking about it. its not wet or anything either, just the feeling. i have no way to get to the doctor any time soon so im not sure what i should do. ive also been having pelvic cramping as well!! \ni need advice please and thank you !!! It sounds like it could be the beginning of pgad. If you have pelvic cramping the best if to do some pelvic physio. If it IS PGAD, it is not an emergency. Get some 5% Lidocaine gel for now, if it is hurting.\n\nIt will usually be worse during your  period, so maybe it will settle down. \n\nSometimes it is difficult to get diagnosed, but one treatment that seems to help the pain is Amitriptyline, which is an anti-depressant used for nerve pain. If you bring the information about PGAD and Amitriptyline in to your doctor, they will probably prescribe it. My psychiatrist prescribed it to me.  But a urologist or gynecologist would probably also prescribe it after they looked into it. \n\nPGAD is often associated with urinary problems - mine is.", "is this pgad?? I am really scared I have ocd and extreme anxiety, which is why I think it may be a manifestation of ocd or something \nbut I was on YouTube and I saw a documentary about a woman who suffered with pgad, at first I watched it and nothing really happened but as I started to think about it more I started to notice the symptoms starting in myself, but only when I thought about it and there would be periods of time where I would not think about it and I would be fine, which is why I think it might be a manifestation of my ocd, and I do not really get the symptoms that everyone describes, I see it more as a sort of groinal response that happens in ocd - however when I really think about it, the symptoms get worse and really start to stress me out but when I am completely distracted I am fine, this happened a couple of weeks ago but I was able to shrug it off as my ocd, but this time I am unable to get rid of it \nPlease help :( If you are worried please go to a doctor or some sort of specialist but, and I only say this going off your post, sounds like you are just over worried and it is messing with you\n\nIf you want to talk or anything dms are open (and for anyone else too) thank you ! :) Np I hope it all goes well with you :)", "Why would taking a shower provoke a PGAD flare? That is my main trigger. Wondering if others had that experience and if there is anything you found that helps? Reading stories online it looks like for most people taking a warm shower or bath can provided some relief, but not for me! It does not necessarily help to use cooler water either. Mine was psychological caused. I noticed that it got worse when I took a bath or went to a hot tub. I did exposures for it and chose not to avoid it, then it got much better and now baths are no longer a trigger. It could be an anxiety triggered symptom. Cause I do not think it would make much logical since for it to be a trigger if it was physical. But eh what do I know. My doctor thinks mine is caused by anxiety/OCD as well. Yeah it is totally possible. Mine is pretty much gone now. Though it does come back occasionally if I choose to think about it. The brain is a very powerful object. I am a guy and guys do not even really get pgad. Well only like .00000001% of them do, so I know it was brain, since for men it is caused by spine injury or like a big abnormality in the pelvis. And I am perfectly healthy. It also reduced in social situations so I know it was mental. But it took a long time. I think the reason why baths trigger it is because the brain  thinks water will make it worse and the feelings of anxiety can cause a sexual Or sensitive feeling down there. I think that might be the reason. Cause for people who have it physical taking a bath usually relieves it or it just stays the same. But very rarely makes it worse. So I hope this helps. I hope you eventually find out what the issue is physical or not. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Thanks for sharing your experience and so glad to hear it is almost gone!", "i need relief please   ", "Please help I am a 19F and I was masturbating last night when afterwards, I noticed the feeling of wanting more never dissapeared. This has happened before but it went away when I woke up in the morning. It has not gone away today. I have been feeling the throbbing ever since 3am last night. There is no pain, just a feeling of arousal. Please help. I am terrified and if I have this thing it will be hard not to end my life. I have already been suffering from coronavirus that I got in May. I was just beginning to feel normal again. I am TERRFIED. Hey, \nas hard as it is not to panic, that is the most important thing. You have said it is gone away before, so try to be positive and not fuel anxiety. Obviously nobody can diagnose you online, but here are a couple of questions to ask yourself (you do not need to answer publically, but keep these in mind if talking to a dr) :\n\n-Are you on antidepressants (specifically ssri/snri type\" or did you recently (and rapidly) withdraw from them? Pgad can be triggered by this in some cases, or cured from these in others.\n\n-How often does this happen to you? if it is very frequent, or only around certain times of the month (your menstrual cycle can play a part) \n\n-Any history of anxiety? Anxiety can really be a trigger for my PGAD. \n\nmy best advice is to do everything you can to calm yourself down. If the feeling persists after a week, you can talk to your dr or use an online medical service. I am not on any antidepressants, this is completely random. It happened before but only lasted a few hours. I do have a huge history of anxiety but it has never caused this before I wish you the best of luck and I am so sorry that you are worrying. I truly hope that you do not have it! Try to just ease your mind by giving it the week. See how it fluctuates/changes day by day. Did you notice your Pelvic floor muscles clenching more then usual? Maybe they became very tight. I have the exact same feeling right now \u00a3%\\# went to the doctors and all they said was to try anxiety medication. Makes it hard not to hate myself if I am only making this issue up in my head Hey Luna. I just came across your comment. And I was wondering if you could help me. I have been having PGAD symptoms. I am constantly aroused, but there are not any sharp pains or pins and needles feelings. I have just been aroused soo much that it is hard not to masterbate. And when I do, arousal feeling does not go away. \n\nBut your question about the antidepressant could be the cause of this arousal. Recently a doctor prescribed me a sinus medication which has pseudoephedrine. I was to take it for 5 days, and it definitely made me a very active and happy person. As soon as I finished it, I was back to my normal self. I have a feeling the medication could have triggered the arousal? \n\nIf not, then I have no idea why this is happening to me. Maybe I am just soo horny because I have not had sex in months You were aroused and throbbing in your crotch area?", "My experiences (46F) Hi all,\n\nI had a flare-up this week and found this group. I thought I would share my experiences for anyone who is new to this.\n\nI believe I have had this all my life, and in fact I believe it was triggered by childhood abuse because my symptoms were some of my earliest memories. Before I figured out how to cope with them, I spent countless miserable nights unable to sleep no matter what I did. You all know what it is like, when you think orgasming might help relieve the pressure but only makes it worse. There were nights I really just wanted to end it all or just cut out my privates, anything to stop the sensation and get some sleep.\n\nThere were also times when I did not have flare-ups as badly, and thinking back, those occasions were when I was more active and doing a lot of pilates and ballet barre exercises. Notably, I was flare-up free for a few years after I gave birth to my daughter naturally. The birth must have shifted things around down there.\n\nWhen I got older (adult), some of my coping strategies for bad flare-ups included taking Advil before bed. Before I researched the symptoms, I figured it might have been a nerve issue, and took a chance that pain relievers would block nerve signals enough for me to sleep. Advil would take the edge off so that the sensation was not as \"loud\" and allowed me to sleep until it wore off. This led to Advil every night for a few months sometimes. Not ideal, but at least I got some sleep.\n\nMy symptoms were bothersome only at night, since I kept busy throughout the day to distract myself from it. I guess you would call my case rather mild.\n\nAbout 7 years ago during a particularly bad flare-up, I thought to enter my symptoms online and see if anything would pop up. I was so relieved to find the early info about PGAD and a group on PGAD (I have forgotten where it was now) that I cried. I was not nuts, after all. And I was not the only person experiencing this.\n\nOf course, I still have not told my doctor about this because there is so little information about it out there. As it was, I had to really advocate for myself to get treated for hypothyroidism; I did not need to add another thing to fight with my doctor over, lest they flag my file and start treating me like a troublemaker or hypochondriac. At least with hypothyroidism, I had lab results to back me up. \n\nAnyway, I had a bad flare-up this week and came here, and found some great tips that I really appreciate. Stretching, staying active, avoiding sex and orgasms, moving around more... These were great reminders.\n\nI am lucky that my symptoms are so easily managed. I hope you all find treatments that work for you. I really doubt that this condition is as rare as the medical field says it is. Very few conditions seem to be as rare as the medical field states that they are.  That said...\n\nI hear you, with every word of this post.  Giving in just leads to soreness after repeated orgasms that give me perhaps twenty minutes of relief before the feelings start again.  This is exhausting...not the satisfying sort of exhaustion that you get from hours of fun with a partner, but an exasperating sort of exhaustion that is driven by a desperate effort to make the symptoms stop or even ease.  \n\n(hugs you)  I am here for you if you are interested in chatting sometime.", "So frustrating Yesterday I was at the store and people could visibly see I had an erection. There seemed to be a woman following me and she had her phone out. It looked like she might be filming me but I could not tell. She was always around me and looking at me.

Last month, about three days before the start of my cycle, I woke up fine and then, as the day went by, I was overcome with a strong feeling of arousal, that could not be relieved no matter how many times I masturbated. I also had tingling in my feet and legs, my muscle would twitch and sometimes my vagina would spasm but sporadically and it was not painful. It got progressively worse, to the point where I was literally in tears and had a mild anxiety attack. Then my period came and it got better and then disappeared completely for about 5 days. It came back, but it was only clitoral pain, the occasional vagina spasm + the tingling feeling all over my feet, legs BUT without the feeling of arousal. Now the clitoral pain is gradually getting better, it is still pretty oversensitive but less (it was never engorged tho) still no arousal tho. I still have a pins and needles-like feeling all over my feet, legs and butt which kind of worries me. Do I have PGAD? Even if I do not feel pain, I am afraid it might be something related to my nerves... FWIW, I (M54) have these pins and needles running down my legs as well. It is most pronounced in my penis and testicles and dissipates the lower I go until my toes. It is some sort of neuropathy near as I can tell. I do not have any priapism, just an overwhelming urge to stimulate myself to ease the buzzing. It almost feels like tinnitus of the penis for lack of better terms.\n\nI sent you a link to a Facebook page that has many more women than this group. Hope they can be better help", "What does it feel like to NOT be aroused?? I nearly always if not always have at least SOME tingling/throbbing type of sensation going on down there. What is it supposed to feel like for normal people?? The sad thing is I have no idea. Do they just feel absolutely nothing down there 90% of the time or more? Or what do they feel For me, I used to not be aroused all the time before I took Wellbutrin and addrerall for ADHD &amp; depression.\n\nIdk. It was a lot better. A bit like what you mentioned, more or less nothing down there unless something was getting me going.\n\nIs it literally just \"always on\" for you now?\n\nFor me it is \"on\" most of the time. But there are periods of time when I *can* not think about it and not pay attention to it. Hm...more or less nothing. It is just very hard for me to imagine. I mean, it is hard for me to say whether it is always on, because if it is ever not then I guess I just would not notice it...I would really like to be mindful of it and observe what it feels like if and when it is ever not on. But I do know that at least the vast majority of the time, it is on.\n\nBTW I find it interesting how much ADHD comes up on this sub. I have ADHD too and see that a lot of people who post on here have it. I would not be surprised if the two are linked somehow. It is not that I feel nothing, I am just not aware of it constantly. I have learned techniques to deal with it when it gets bad. I avoid riding in cars if at all possible. I do not touch myself no matter how strong the urge is. It gives me no relief and makes it worse. I use ice packs. I also use EFT/tapping to help calm down my parasympathetic nervous system. I am forth because I do have periods of remission (?). I am going to a new gynocologist next week and hopefully she will be somewhat knowledgeable about PGAD. I searched and found a specialist in PGAD, I am hoping for a referral to see him. I have learned to keep advocating for myself dealing with MS. I have seen a few articles about using Botox for it, but I do not want to be completely dead down there. For me, masturbating does not usually make it worse. It usually helps, just not that much, maybe giving me 20% relief. But I am def still aroused after. Actual intercourse sex on the other hand definitely does help, it is like my bf's dick is actually massaging my insides and it seems to really calm it down. I have heard people say they use ice but I just cannot imagine putting ice there! Ice is just so...cold?? But I did see one woman using ice inserts on YouTube and I think I would be open to that if I can find some. I was thinking the same thing about a specialist, I want to see one too. I know, same thoughts on Botox too. Heard it helps but most likely would not do it myself unless my case were to worsen.", "Seroxat for pgad!!!!!

I have not told anyone about it because it is not that kind of disease which makes you feel pain (still a lot of discomfort) you just sometimes feel like you are watching a pornographic movie even though you do not want to feel it and you have to masturbate for a long time to make the attack stop in my case the attacks happen every few weeks so you can actually live with it fully normally but I would like to get rid of it forever. A lot of doctors do not believe this shit exists, so I wanted to ask you for advice on whether it makes any sense to go to a neurologist urologist doctor.", "Do I have PGAD? Do my symptoms seem bad enough that I should see a doctor? Any advice? I am 17yo (female), and I think I might be experiencing PGAD. I have not partook in any sexual activity with anyone. I started frequently masturbating 4 years ago, but my frequent would be 3 - 4 times a week and sometimes 2 or 3 times in a single day.\n\nMy first acknowledgement below lead to everything making sense about why I believe I might be experiencing PGAD.\n\nA couple nights ago I was playing a (can be considered) violent video game, (so you can assume what I was doing) and I was suddenly aroused. I laughed about it and was jokingly like \"woah, is this my thing? I hope not.\" An hour had passed, and the feeling was still there, so I decided to search what my problem was. PGAD was the first to show. I read through many sites/articles and realized that I have experienced this multiple times before, but I unknowingly chose to neglect it. And now I wish that I continued to not know about it because now I am too aware.\n\nThat night after learning about PGAD, I was remembering times when I was randomly aroused. And the few times I can remember the most is when I was in the car going somewhere and I was aroused. Other times being late at night. I am always up late and will usually stay up until 4 or 5am. That is probably due to me just not doing anything with my life at the moment, but is that what is really happening? Maybe... but maybe it could also be because I am constantly aroused. I am not too sure about that.\n\nI failed to mention above, that at those times, I knew I was aroused, but just thought that maybe it was my hormones and that it was normal to feel that way almost everyday. And that when I feel it, it mainly starts off as a lingering feeling, and it is easy to not notice at first, but then it becomes more intense and that is all I can think about, but I cannot always go and relieve myself of that feeling. I do not remember how long this has been going on for, but it is been at least maybe 5 months or more. Somewhere below I mention I have had spasms for the past year, but I am not really sure if the two are fully connected.\n\nIt is quite an embarrassing feeling to have when your constantly around your family. I almost feel quite ashamed of it because I can already be aroused and just have to continue a conversation with someone. And it is even worse because my little nephew lives with us, so everyone always interacts with him, so I cannot just be that aunt that ignores him. I honestly hate having to mention him while talking about this, but it is worse having to be around him and feel that way. I am suddenly overwhelmed with sadness trying to write this part.\n\nThis one site said muscle spasms were apart of it. For maybe the past year, I have been experiencing those, but I thought it was something else. Still could be something else, but it seems that I do have them when I am aroused. It is like my whole body shakes, but mainly my right arm tenses up and shakes the most. At times it can be very exhausting. It will happen for a few minutes when I am either lying down or sitting, rarely when I am standing, unless the feeling is very strong. Another thing is that when the feeling is really really strong and feels like I need to take care of it right then and there, it is like from that spot and up to my abdomen, I tighten up (it almost feels very forceful), but it does not continually stay that way, it is more so like a pulsating feeling.\n\nSometimes masturbating feels like a chore. I can be physically aroused, but mind is not in sync with that arousal. They both need to be in sync for me to even climax quickly. With how strong it can feel, I would think I should be able to finish within maybe 5 to 10 minutes, but instead it can take up to 30mins or longer. Sometimes just after I climax once, I feel exhausted so I cannot even continue once the feeling comes back around. The feeling can come back after maybe an hour, but it can also be back within the hour. I cannot always do it because I live in a chaotic house with many people that can walk in on me at any time, so sometimes I just have to suffer with the feeling.\n\nI have only told one person about this, and that person was my online friend. He told me to just continue masturbating until the feeling goes away, I laughed and told him \"I have things to get done, I just cannot do that all day.\" Overall he was not being rude or trying to make jokes out of it, he just did not understand fully and did not know how to give me advice on the subject, which is understandable. I am afraid to tell my mother because I know she will treat me differently once I do. I fight with her quite a bit, but when it comes to health overall, everyone does not hesitate to speak out about it. I do not have health insurance atm, and I honestly do not know how to handle all that type of stuff, she would be the one to help me, but I do not know how to bring any of this up to her. If I do tell her, it would of course be very minimal information.\n\nAnd that is that. Sorry if that is very long, I am not that best at explaining things or I will ramble too much and sometimes forget important details, so hopefully whoever reads this can understand what I mean. If anyone does happen to read this, do you think I should see a doctor? Any advice on how to handle this? Thank you for sharing your experience.  A lot of what you have said is precisely what other PGAD that members have shared as well.  \nI do not have any advice but welcome to the community, I hope in time we grow to be a valuable resource for you. I am sorry to hear that you are dealing with all of this, especially without health insurance. If you do not mind me asking some clarification, have you previously been on any kind of anti-depressant or other psych medication? Or, have you ever suffered any kind of injury near the base of your spine or pelvic area? Regardless of the answer to these questions, I do think you should see a doctor if it is an option. If you can, try and see someone who at least somewhat specializes in sexual health or pelvic area. If you have previously been on psych meds or still are, definitely talk with your psychiatrist about it as well, as there have been links found between discontinuation of certain medications and the development of PGAD. \n\nAs for telling your mother, it might be best to frame it a bit vaguely, just giving her enough information to let her know you need to see a doctor with some sort of gynecological experience. Having these symptoms sucks, talking about it with family sucks, I know from personal experience, but I think it is really important that as many people as possible start talking with doctors about these symptoms. There has not been much research on PGAD and the stigma around talking about gynecological and sexual health might keep it that way if we are not brave. \n\nBest of luck, and keep the community updated on how you are doing! I have not been on any anti depressants or psych medication.\n\nA couple years ago I was in a car accident and got hit from the back, but I never suffered any type of major injury from that, only neck pain for a few days.\n\nI am in a bit of a weird situation at the moment, so I am mainly trying to focus on that, so it will be a while before I can see a doctor about this, but hopefully I will have the chance to see one soon.\n\nI also discovered in the past few days, that if i keep my body active by exercising or any physical activity, the feeling is not constant. So I have been exercising and using it as another way to relieve myself.\n\nThanks for the advice! I honestly appreciate it.", "Are anyone able to work or not ? In school ? Does anyone here have a steady desk job and how is your work affected? Are you able to do 40 hours a week and how is sleep ?  I am just curious what awaits me after I find a job. \n\nAdditionally, does anyone experience occasional tremors in your lower back ? Its the main cause for my lack of sleep. Constantly waking me up in the middle of the night while I already am having a harder time falling asleep due to the flaring. \n\nPersonally I am still in school studying comp-sci/stats. I take shorten course load because frankly I cant study/sleep as efficiently as I once could a year ago when I did not have this. \n\nAs for meds, I do not take any! I tried an anti depressants, I forgot the name, they work tho, sadly however they make so lazy. Besides, I are not depressed, rather I try to force myself to stay happy / stress free, otherwise my symptoms go nuclear ( :( ). \n\nLooking for someone to relate to ! I definitely feel tremors on my back and abdomen, most especially at night when I am flat on my back.  They happen almost every night when I am sleeping, but some nights are more intense and lead into spontaneous orgasms.   As soon as I feel my abdomen pulsing I know I am about to cum.  \n\nI am at home not working so, thankfully, sitting at a desk at work is not a concern.  I am not sure how I could handle this if I were working or taking classes.  If I have a particularly intense night where I get woken up I might sleep in or take a nap.  I find if I am around people or talking on the phone they do not happen, but as soon as I get in the car there is a huge release.  Being in the car is a trigger for me.  I just let myself go if I am alone, tho it is hard to keep in if there are others with me.  Talking or eating distract me and keep the car orgasm under control.\n\nI am not on any antidepressants or other meds.  I did have an umbilical hernia repair it is seemed to be the beginning of my having many orgasms.  I am married and although my spouse looks at me funny sometimes I do not tell him much about my new found abilities. He would either not believe me or think I was crazy! &gt; I definitely feel tremors on my back and abdomen, most especially at night when I am flat on my back. They happen almost every night when I am sleeping, but some nights are more intense and lead into spontaneous orgasms.\n\n\nI get exactly this! Except the spontaneous orgasm some nights (although I fear its progressing to it). Did you also get PGAD without the use of meds ? We may have the same variant of it. I had an umbilical hernia repair over the Summer for a misshapen belly button and about a month later slight pulses, vibrations and contractions began in my abdomen.  I recall driving home from a wedding and saying to myself what the heck was that?  I could feel my stomach get hard and then a rush just for a second.  Pretty much any vibration such as riding in a car, live music, and more resonates in my core and causes pulsing and then an orgasm.... I DO mostly enjoy the pleasure as long as I am alone;) I am very orgasmic now but had been normal before the surgery. I am currently on short term disability from work. My job is a mixture  desk work and standing, but the facilities are large so there is a lot of moving around during the day. I was diagnosed with a hypertonic pelvic floor at the same time as PGAD and that is what is causing my abdominal tremors. \n\nI also experience shooting pains at the base of my spinal column. It is possible that my symptoms are caused by a predundal nerve issue and I am currently waiting to hear about a referral for a nerve block. My PT said I have a \"very tight pelvic floor\" I am not sure if that is the same thing. And good luck on your nerve block.", "Would this be an option My doctor is referring me to a gynecologist. He said he was not sure if I had PGAD or not. He referred to having me put on hormone therapy or antidepressants to help treat the sytoms. I told him I can not take antidepressants because it is dangerous to my mental health. Would hormone therapy be a good option? I have honestly never heard of this. It did not work for me. It is not a mental health issue or a hormonal imbalance if it is PGAD. Everyone is different, so I am not trying to discourage you. A few of my doctor's have never heard of PGAD, including my neurologist. My doctor told me it sounded like PGAD when I described my sytoms. He is sending me to a gynoligyist because he could not say for sure if I did or not. Just my opinion: pgad is not a hormonal imbalance. It is inflammation of the nerves/ nerve compression Why would antidepressants be dangerous to your mental health? An antidepressant is what got rid of PGAD for me and that was a wonderful thing for my mental health. I have taken antidepressants before.everytime it lead to suicide attempts. I had to be taken off them because of this. Agree. He was the one who brought it up. However still wanted to send me to a gynecologist. Hope you recover soon", "PGAD is back Hey guys,\nI am in a pretty dark place right now. After about 6 months of remission my PGAD is back. About 2 years ago my PGAD started. It came on after I abruptly stopped antidepressants after 2 years. It started as this throbbing that could only be relieved by orgasm, but orgasms did not feel pleasurable. They felt like a release of a pressure valve - built up tension being relieved from my body. Inbetween orgasms I would experience spasms. Sitting down made the spasms worse. In fact, everything made the spasms worse - sitting, standing walking, you name it! Only sleeping pills helped. If I did not orgasm the spasms would go away but the throbbing pressure would remain - this uncomfortable and deep pain. I started amitriptyline, lyrica, bought myself a standing desk for work. I went to a pelvic PT who worked wonders and taught me exercises to release pressure with my pelvic wand. I was going to the toilet way too\nmuch at night so I did some bladder training and avoided straining to pee at all costs. Things got better! The pain stopped! The muscle tension never went away so I always did pelvic floor releases at the end of the day and kept up with the amitriptyline. I did not date for over a year because I was terrified it would come back. Then one day I had a spontaneous orgasm at night, but it did not feel unpleasant. My symptoms actually felt fine the next day. It got me thinking - maybe I am healed! I decided to masturbate the day following and again - no pain! Then about a week later when the urge came on I masturbated and it was back to that same familiar tension. I needed over 5 orgasms to get to a point of feeling ok. The pain did not begin straight afterward, but I got my wisdom teeth removed the following week. The general anaesthetic really fucked with me. I needed to go to the toilet but was not able to. I strained a lot to pass urine. Then the following week I got my booster vaccine. I was tossing and turning all night unable to sleep. I woke up at one point with that unfamiliar and unwanted feeling - The painful throbbing. The throbbing was so bad that a relieved myself the next day. I did it once and then the urge to do it came back stronger an hour later, so I masturbated 3-4 times. I have avoided masturbating at all costs in the three days following, but I started a new job and I have had to sit through a lot of meetings. Usually I would have a standing desk. My tips and tricks are not working and I am worried that I have damaged the nerve again for good :( I resigned today because the pain was so bad and I could not focus, but now I am left with my own negative thoughts and the pain has been awful. Does anyone have any insights they can share to keep the pain at bay while I figure out next steps? I really appreciate you all - no one knows the pain we experience and can empathise unless they have had this condition. Its taken away so much of my life - dating, shorts and pants, sitting for long periods of time. Sticking a plastic wand up your vagina every night to relieve tension is also just the most weirdly fucked up and lonely experience. I hope you know you are not alone, and my life did get considerably better while in remission. There is hope \ud83d\udc95", "Pgad and pelvic pain Hi everybody, I am wondering if anyone else on this group suffers from chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis, vaginismus, vulvodynia or pelvic muscle tightness and spasms as well as pgad? I am a 20 year old female and I have all of these things and they can trigger pgad episodes for me, which is completely horrible because anything sexual is so excruciatingly painful for me and then mentally I just feel so crushed because of all of it.

The \u201cinsatiable\u201d feeling. The hours, the pain, the awful socialization of women as unsexual creatures or if you were sexual then it meant you were a disgusting wh**e. \n\nI have masturbated as much as I can get away with since I was very, very young. It was a huge stressor for my parents. My school immediately assumed I was being abused. \n\nFinally, antidepressants killed it!! Yay!!!!

I would love to hear anybody's past experiences with CBD oil and PGAD or just anxiety/depression in general, and your dosage. \n\nThe bottle I have contains 25mg CBD and 1.2 MG THC per ML. I will probably try to update this post in a few weeks once I have had some experience with trying it out. Hey yes, I found it reduces the intensity of the tension down there for me. Definitely does not get rid of it completely though.\n\nI get relief from using CBD and also numbing cream designed to help guys last longer. That combo works the best out of anything. Thank you for replying! Do you use an oil? What is your dosage? No worries! For me I found 40mg worked, any more than that does not seem to do anything. How long have you been struggling with it?\n\nFor me it did not happen until I started taking an anti depressant about 6 months ago. I have had PGAD for about 9 years now. It started out of the blue for me, no previous anti depressant use (now I have tried a couple, none helped, hence the CBD!). \n\nI have got some hopeful ideas and procedures in the near future, so fingers crossed! Omg that sounds absolutely horrible. Congratulations for surviving that long!\n\nDo you get the regular orgasms as well or just the tension and pain? my PGAD is more constant unwanted arousal. When I have pain, my pain is really infrequent and is more like lightening shocks/ bruised feeling in the clitoris. My pelvic floor muscles are also pretty tense most of the time, so I see a physiotherapist. That is frustrating especially since you do not know what caused it.\n\nMine will ache with arousal that only goes away for 10-20 mins unless I have a TONNE of orgasms, then it lulls for longer.

Regardless, I cannot sleep. This pulsing is keeping me up. Switching sleeping positions will sometimes relieve it but not for long. How do I sleep with this?

Yes, that is what most of us experience. The persistent orgasms are at the extreme end; I think that end of the spectrum is primarily those with nerve damage.\n\nWhen I first came here after realizing that this was a repeating problem, some of the advice that helped me was using a cold compress to decrease blood flow, and taking CBD oil.

Thank you for your reply it is a massive relief :) Hey, fellow mild sufferer here. Do you feel like orgasms help relieve it at all? I find if I have enough orgasms I get some relief for a few hours. FWIW, I consider mine minor comparatively speaking. It is 24/7 non stop tingling like your foot's asleep and the only way to make it go away is if it is erect (by stimulation or by being turned on) Yep. This was my exact experience. I did not get spontaneous orgasms, just he constant arousal that would not go away. Felt like I was holding my breath all the time. Mine was caused by birth control, so when I got off of it, it improved 99% within six months. Sometimes, when I am really nervous about something, it will flair up, but go away once I am not nervous or the aggravator has left. Yoga, meditation, and watching comedy before bed helped me get my mind off the constant arousal. Sleeping with a pillow between my legs on my side was the best. Masturbation and sex did not help, it actually made it worse. Standing was when I felt most comfortable.

I have only recently begun struggling with PGAD in the last few months and it is been becoming more severe these past 2 weeks, but I thought I would share some lifestyle tips that I have found helpful for me personally. I am intersex and my genitalia is more vulva-like, so these tips are probably more beneficial to those with vulvas/similar genitalia, although some tips are more general.\n\n(This is not medical advice; talk to your doctor if you think you have PGAD, and so they can help find the root of the problem.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The biggest advice is that I cannot prevent PGA or spontaneous orgasms, so I have to alter my life to work around them:\n2. Experiment with underwear &amp; clothes that work for you, for comfort and hygiene. For me, this means flowy skirts and underwear that is smooth and breathable/does not rub or add extra friction. I avoid denim and tight pants.\n3. I always bring at least 3+ pairs of extra underwear in my purse anywhere I go. Again, this is more for hygiene and less for prevention of PGA.\n4. Invest in really good deodorant if sweating is a problem for you. An unscented roll-on like Certain-Dri + a scented anti-perspirant is my fav combo. If you are comfortable, shaving your armpits might help keep the deodorant on longer.\n5. Lay towels down when you sleep, and dress lightly (or consider not wearing underwear when you sleep), if night sweats are a particular problem.\n6. For night time, it seems counter-intuitive, but sleeping with a pillow in between my legs helps. Again, it does not prevent spontaneous orgasms. Rather, it gives my pelvic and abdominal muscles something to brace against and reduces muscle fatigue and prevents pulling a muscle.\n7. Sleep in a cool/cold bedroom if your doctor approves of it. A good tip for a good night's rest anyway!\n8. During spontaneous orgasms, try not to \"fight against it\"/tighten your muscles too much. Work on learning to maintain your breathing and relax your muscles. For me, this prevents muscle injury/soreness, emotional distress, and reduces the length of time of an orgasm.\n9. During spontaneous orgasms, reminding myself that it is involuntary, it will pass/it is temporary, etc. helps reduce stress and therefore reduces length of time of an orgasm. Whatever is most stressful about a spontaneous orgasm for you, develop a meditative mantra to remind yourself of otherwise.\n10. Learn any other triggers. You cannot avoid them all, but work with them. Sometimes it is car rides, intense music/flavors/textures/any sensory experience whatsoever, intense emotions, lying down, caffeine, etc. By learning triggers, you may learn what might help reduce the symptoms.\n\nAnd of course, before you try anything on this list, if you do not know if you have PGAD or not, you need to talk to your doctor. PGAD can be caused by many different things or mimic so many different other conditions, so it is so important to just have an honest chat with a medical professional about your symptoms even if it seems awkward. This list is designed to help those who already know that they have PGAD and are looking for some lifestyle tips to try.", "Living a normal life? Hiya I wanted to know how many of u guys can live a normal life as I beleive it looks pretty impossible.\nDo any of u have office jobs and how do u guys handle relationships?

Injuring yourself will NOT alleviate your symptoms. Put ice pack between your legs. Please do not harm yourself, it will not make your symptoms go away, it will make it worse. Yes, agree with previous post, an ice pack should help some, to at least make it less intense. Please do not harm yourself, will not help! DO NOT do any of that omg! DO NOT put peppermint oil on it. It also probably will not help as most of our genitalia is inside our bodies. I feel you, it is fucking uncomfortable and I often ask myself w h y . The best I can do is just masturbate constantly to try to keep it somewhat at bay.

I thought the pressure, contractions, urgency to pee, urgency to ejaculate, burning, PE, and lack of good feeling from ejaculations were all just part of premature ejaculation.\n\nAs we all know the subject of PGAD online is very sparse and almost impossible to talk to anyone about. I recently went to a Pelvic Floor PT here in Los Angeles and after telling them about all my symptoms they are the ones that told me what PGAD was. It finally makes sense to me! All these sensations are enough to drive you insane especially since there is such little information online about it. And for men it is essentially not even discussed. What an isolating feeling this is. Especially since it is accompanied by premature ejaculation I cannot even talk to my partners about it. The only thing that has kept my dating life alive is taking SSRI\u2019s to delay ejaculation. \n\nI have been seeing an acupuncturist in LA that focuses on pelvic pain and PGAD. Besides needles all over your body he puts 8 1.5\u201d needles into all your pelvic floor muscles which is then attached to a TENS unit. My lifelong pelvic pain ALL WENT AWAY after 1 treatment!!! Even my PGAD feeling of pressure behind my eyes and in my throat have almost essentially gone away. I am having a flareup right now and it is definitely causing my contractions to go insane but I am going to acupuncture twice a week and sometimes he hits a spot that flares me up big time. These contractions for a male are basically the same contractions that occur right as you are ejaculating. So essentially I am walking around constantly almost about to ejaculate. It is so hard to have normal conversations with people when you are always on the verge.... you know what I mean. \n\nThe one thing that has driven me insane as been that for me I have a squeezing and I have contractions. The squeezing comes from anxiety. I can literally feel the squeeze based on what I am thinking about the moment. The contractions on the other hand come directly from sexual thoughts. If I see a woman I am attracted to I immediately start getting those contractions that inevitably cause ejaculation. I will say that, besides the occasional flareup, this acupuncture has gotten rid of 85% of all my symptoms. The one that one go away are those damn contractions that happen from sexual thoughts. Until I get those to go away I will continue to have premature ejaculation I believe. \n\nIf anyone is in the Los Angeles area and wants a referral to this guy he is next level and if he can help me this much I would love to spread the word.\n\nThanks for reading I am so happy you have found something that works for you!! I agree it is almost impossible to find doctors who can help \u2014 the ones I have seen had not even heard of PGAD before.\nI do not live in LA but after reading this I am going to look up acupuncture as a treatment option.\n\nThank you so much for sharing! Glad I could offer something new. There has to be other acupuncturists that use this protocol. I could not believe after ONE treatment that one really sensitive spot in my perineum literally vanished. When he stuck it into that spot I could not tell you how happy i was because I knew....\n\nGood luck t you thank you for sharing! i am so glad you have now found some relief, that must feel amazing. my pelvic floor physical therapist actually was telling me about acupuncture the other week and how much it helps her, she deals with autoimmune disorders/endometriosis/ pelvic floor tension. seems like acupuncture is a very slept on method of medicine/ therapy! We also have to keep in mind that just like anything or any profession there is really good acupuncturist and there is bad acupuncturist and there is some acupuncturist that understand  how the pelvic   floor Works more than others so just find one that specializes in pelvic floor dysfunction Oh my gosh yes thank you for posting. I am also a male with this that suffers from really bad premature ejaculation. I cannot even last 50 seconds, honestly.  It had ruined my confidence, along with making my life torturous. I have horrible hypersensitivity as well, mainly in my testicles. That is my main symptom. Thanks for posting. I needed this Took me ages to work out my treatments so Im glad you found something that works for you. Sadly my town doesnt have a decent enough amount of acupuncturists to look into and my personal insurance prolly wouldnt cover it. So i am on nerve pain blocks to stop the contractions. Thankfully overall though my  physical therapist, pain center, and urologist all know about male pgad, or were open to looking into it as a valid diagnosis. Im glad that people who can apply acupuncture as a valid treatment now have another option to look into for pgad relief. \\^\\_\\^\n\nIm just glad I have dry orgasms and non erection pgad. That combo is for sure one of the worst symptoms for men. So I wholeheartedly send some feels to/for the people that do have erection and ejaculation pgad. \n\nMy trade off is a pain and pleasure feedback loop. Genital pain + contraction pleasure loop is no easy slice of cake and sometimes causes refusal of function in a sex capacity. However my treatments leave me only with 2-3 weeks out of 3 months of feedback build up. So it never gets as bad as it was when it was out of control.   &gt;\\_&lt;\n\nSorry for the tons of edits. My thoughts take time to fully set and I try and keep errors cleaned up in this reddit \\^\\_\\^ Wow well at least we know there is at least more than one of us. My life has been gorgeous too. Basically avoid all sexual relationships. \n\nHave you tried SSRI? I take tramadol and I can go from maybe 5 strokes to lasting over 10 minutes but if I up the dose I can last hours.\n\nAre you doing any treatment? Yeah thanks mate what I am suffering with is incomprehensible. So much anxiety and complete avoidance of romantic relationships =/ I feel so much better it is crazy... but I will not call it complete until my ejaculation issues are fixed. As a man I might as well not have a penis if I cannot fix this =/ Well sometimes I take Prozac for my anxiety, and that helps the PE a little bit, but I would say I still cum quite early but at least it is longer than it was before.  I might try upping the dose if you say that helps. I also do some pelvic stretches each day and that helps it temporarily, but not long term. Have to find someone that can help you do not live forever without finding a pelvic floor PT. Oh yes taking SSRI def helps. I lived with a girl for 2 years and she did not know I had PE because I would just pop a pill. I believe this is caused by the pelvic floor muscles being trapped. In order to free the nerve the surrounding muscle needs to relax. That is why acupuncture is helping so much. Do you do stretches every day? What stretches do you do? I do all sorts of yoga stretches I think in my situation having PGAD since I was a little kid I need way more than just stretches I completely sympathize. The constant turned on feeling/orgasms just leave me empty and not in a position to desire a romantic relationship myself. When in public and its happening it honestly spikes my anxiety as well since it feels like im walking around naked in front of everyone (like in those nude in public nightmares). I ran into a girl that i was very interested  in but have not seen in a year but i was in the middle of a flareup and my penis had SO much pressure i was experiencing so much anxiety i just ignored her and let her walk away thinking im not interestted and now living with regret and anguish. \n\nPGAD is tough but uf you have PE as a symptom it truly is a nightmare Been dealing with pgad for years and no doctors have ever brought up acupuncture, im happy you have found some relief from it and imma look into in myself thanks \ud83d\ude0a I took 40mg Prozac 2 days ago and yesterday to today I feel a phone like  vibration coming from my genitals. It is very annoying and I think this antidepressants caused it. But I also think mine is psychosomatic, I just hate this. I could tolerate it before, but this new buzzing feeling is very annoying. I heard that this disorder will never be curable so now I am just be try upset. Im venting , sorry. It just sucks cause I need antidepressants cause I am very depressed but the consequence is that it makes this thing worse. This fucking sucks. I hope there is hope for us. I had this for 30 years... not 100% cured yet but acupuncture took away 80%+ of my symptoms including pain. I still have contractions and sometimes clenching and PE but most pain/spasms are gone.   \n\n\nif i were you id call around some local Pelvic PT places and see if you could get a referral Thanks I am doing better now actually. I think the accupuncture may be able to cure the PE, from what it sounds Hey you seem like you know your stuff. Do you know if fluoxetine can make pgad worse? Fluoxetine usually slows down orgasm but can it make it make it worse. I took fluoxetine in the past, but I wonder if it can make it worse if I take it again after stopping it for awhile. I found an article in pgad's research history that has fluoxetine as an instigator to pgad. \n\nits under the how to diagnose portion of this article\n\n\nSo yep it can for some people be a starter for pgad. So just be aware when you start up if you have increased symptoms. Sometimes it can be sparked by quitting a med as well. I was on 40mg and felt a buzzing sensation there, but I stopped it and it went away. I am back on it but now it is 20mg so I am hoping I do not get it again. I think it is stupid to get punished by this disorder for using antidepressants. It is just the worst thing in the whole world. Btw I had pgad before meds i totally agree. pgad sucks and i hope it goes well Does stopping the medication usually mean that the sensations will reduce? in some cases yes. sadly everyone is made a bit different. so there is no 100% answer. Thank you. Last time I stopped it the buzzing sensation went away, so I hope this new sensation will stop after I withdrawal from the 20mg I feel like I might have this to a mild extent tbh.  I DEFINITELY have CPPS, particularly Hard Flaccid Syndrome.  Not the most painful, but regarding functionality, it is hell.  I too have the contractions when thinking about sexual stuff/seeing a hot woman too.  Fucking sucks\n\nDid you/do you also have hard flaccid? Not sure if I have hard flaccid but I do remember growing up I would ALWAYS have half a boner everywhere I went. Would have to keep my hands in my pockets.\n\nDo you have sexual dysfunction?\n\nMy understanding is PGAD is mainly caused by a compressed pudendal nerve. Yeah I do have dysfunction for sure.  Its primarily pelvic floor tightness so it gets worse when standing/exercising/pooping but it gets MUCH worse when having a boner/after ejaculating or in general being aroused.  It is almost like the reflex that makes your dick muscles contract (the feeling responsible for erection and eventually ejaculation) is overactive, which causes hard flaccid symptoms, because the muscle contracts before the penis is fully engorged", "Dr Goldmier Anyone seen this doctor who is based in london I am thinking about having a consultation", "Do I have PGAD? I (21F) often get an unexplainable amount of sexual sensation from no stimulation. It can be so uncomfortable that it causes pain if I do not pleasure myself but I will never just orgasm without touching myself. \nCan someone help? Does it come back really soon after masturbation/orgasm? Yes literally a couple minutes after I am not a doctor, but it looks like pgad to me. That is what I have. I know how hard it can be. I just shared my story in the comments of an other post here. Maybe you should read it. It might help. Hang in there Thankyou so much. I just looked at your page and I saw you are taking sertralin? Did the PGAD begin after you started taking that because I also take sertralin and it only started afterwards! Yes I did not have pgad before Sertraline I just posted a more complete story on this sub if you are interested So do you think it can be caused by sertralin? That is my hypothesis, but I am not a doctor. I would not know. Same here", "Muscle twitches Anyone have muscle twitches all over their body? me! specially legs and in the buttocks\ud83d\ude1e Apparently it is a thing wid pgad sufferers to have muscle twitches wouldnt that give an idea that the problem lies in the brain like how the brain transmits messages to the nerves Yes, I started with the symptoms when taking lithium and aripiprazole. I immediately left them but the pgad continued. it is already more than two years. So yeah I think it is a chemical brain problem\ud83d\ude2d Same I think mines lies in the brain that is why I am looking into more of the medication side of things i will do the same but honestly from this bad experience i am scared. if anything helps you let me know. get better soon :( Thank u soo much \ud83d\udc95if u find anything, medication natural whatever if anything provides any relief let me know F/ yes, but the twitches definitely radiate from my abdominal core area which is the center of all the action.", "Is this pgad? Unsure what to do at this point :(\n\nHello everyone. I am completely at a loss at this point. I have had OCD my whole life, and at one point I was completely free of symptoms. Back in February it hit hard again, but really intense. One day I was scrolling through social media and I saw a post about this woman who has uncontrollable orgasms and a disorder called PGAD. I instantly latched onto this and instantly felt a rush of panic run through me. I have never been one to latch on to bodily sensations but after reading this I felt like I had it, but never had this issue before. I have been dealing with it for months, constantly looking up PGAD symptoms. Bumpy car rides, or anything like that do not bother me. I also noticed when I am completely distracted I am fine, there is no symptoms. As soon as I am alone all the sensations come back and I feel helpless and panicked. I have truly convinced myself I have this disorder. I would masturbate and it would come back. It became a thing where if I did not masturbate my brain would tell me that I would get pgad or the feelings would get worse. But then sometimes it just comes out of nowhere. I am just so lost and confused and I do not want to go to the doctor because I do not want to be laughed at. I know it is rare which is why I am even more scared. Let me know what you guys think or if any of you have felt this way please. Sounds like it is OCD. Watch Ali Greymond videos. \n\nRemember with OCD, it tricks you into a sense of urgency. Can you let this question go for, say, 3 months and then come back to it if it is a problem then still? this is exactly what is happening to me- you are not alone:) this is exactly what is happening to me! thought I was so alone but clearly I am not, I hope you feel better soon :) I have ocd too! That Is the same way I found out was seeing a video of a woman and instantly thinking I had it and saying oh shit because it is rare. I have always had a problem where after I try to watch adult things and you know.. do the thing and afterwards it is like it is not satisfying and the urge is ten times worse after. I have tried to make it go away doing that and I kid you not 12+ painful orgasms later I thought I was stuck and wanted to self harm. Sometimes I hardly notice it if I am distracted and can ignore it, what makes it hard is the anxiety that comes with it, I dread all day long for the moments I have to \u201crelieve\u201d myself man and it sucks but because it is such a newer unknown thing it just takes longer sometimes to find a good doctor, I strongly believe this can be cured and will be for everyone that has it at some point and we all need to support each other. This is temporary hello, can i dm you? i have something to ask about it :( Yeah\u2019 i cannot. it said guest not allowed. idk why Well that is weird, can you just comment it?! or make another account real quick i am commenting with an account tho and i can dm anyone else without any issue but anyway, i was thinking if we can talk regarding the said post. i have been feeling this way too. i saw a video of a person having this PGAD few weeks ago and i started to think if i have one and try to match every symptoms of it in myself though i do not have one. it sucks that i keep googling about it which i know i should not. i have been ruminating for nothing and it just scared me if i have one. i started to feel discomfort down there too only if i think of it. nothing happen when i am not focusing down there and the thinking about the video \ud83d\ude14 Yeah it is pure O OCD intrusive thoughts. You need to watch Ali Greymond's videos on YouTube seriously! And start mindfulness and meditation...get the Headspace app and read Thich Naht Hanh. And get a therapist if you can that specializes in OCD okay i will try searching that. thank you for the suggestions. also, do you think thinking about it (fear of having pgad and constantly trying to focus down there to find out how it feels) will result down there actually feel something? Yeah it is called groinal response. Google 'groinal response OCD.' But that does not mean it is PGAD, it is just basically you hyper focusing on that area and overthinking things to the point you psych yourself out you are right \ud83e\udd7a . have you ever experienced this kind? this is my first time feeling this way and its been four weeks of worrying and wondering Not for PGAD because it is just not one of my OCD topics and I actually have it, but I had OCD that other things made me aroused. I really think you should get to an ocd therapist if you at all can!! ah i see. i wish i can talk to you more on this privately. i am new to this and i have been wondering about few stuff. is there any platform that i could reach to you? discord or twitter maybe? if no, it is alright \ud83d\ude0a", "I know I have PGAD Now that I know what it is I can say for sure I have PGAD. I have a doctor's appointment because these are the sytoms I experience on a daily basis. \n\nI can physical feel my \ud83d\ude38 contacting and squeezing all the time. \n\nI am always horny/ arroused without the presents of stimulus and without sexual nature thoughts \n\nmasterbating for hours on end daily. Have multiple orgasms yet I am still horny and as soon as I orgasm I will be horny again with in seconds \n\nMy \ud83d\ude38 will be swollen up and throbbing thought out the day even when I am sitting around doing nothing to stimulate myself. \n\nI cannot bare how aroused I am at times. I feel as though my \ud83d\ude38 is going to blow up. I feel as though I am on the verge of orgasming even though I have not been stimulated. \n\nI had tests done to check for ovarian cyst as my \ud83d\ude38was in very bad pain. The tests came back clear for that and no cervix cancer. After opening up to my gynecologist how often I am masturbating and how I do it ( using only my pelvic muscles a lot of the time) she figured I could have pulled or torn a muscle and suggest I restrain myself as much as possible. Now everytime my \ud83d\ude38 is swelling and contracting I get pains in my \ud83d\ude38 and it is doing it without me even thinking about it \ud83d\ude2c"]
