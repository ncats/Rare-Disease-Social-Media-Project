["Fml I am here again I am starting to get nodes again, erythema nodosum.  Does anyone else get this? It is debilitating.  Last time I ended up in a wheelchair for 7 months of my life no longer able to move my legs essentially without horrendous pain, while having to be on heavy duty pain meds.  It also came with tendonitis in all of my tendons around joints.  And horrendous arthritis in every joint from toes, feet, knees, hips, wrists to elbows and spine. It grew from my feet up each week like a paralysis spreading.  No one could explain what happened.  Just \"oh it is just your crohn's or behcets, try stretching.\" My legs and feet swelled to twice their size and no one was concerned for long term damage.  It was that way for over 5 mo.  I could not even wear shoes anymore. My doctor's still keep me on a crohn's diagnosis because they say they cannot tell the difference between the two if intestinal inflammation is involved.  And crohn's offers me more trials that behcets.  So I guess that is that.  \n\nI noticed pain points randomly deep in my legs here and there.  Thinking this feels like nodes, but no nodes.  Tonight I feel my first node since 2017.  I am on remicaid, though I switched to inflectra just last may.  Which in July I got eye pian that never goes away and shows nothing in tests.  I am scared now, as every few years something horrible happens and cannot be explained and ruins my life for a bit and then I recover.  Well I recovered last time because I had an allergic reaction to Imuran, which led to big dose of steroids and epinephrine. Overnight it was gone. \n\nAnyone experience these nodes? Or anything like this?  I have tried colchicine before, but it had no effect.  Cannot remember my dose. \n\nI am attaching pics of before, if anyone has experienced this before, how do I stop this before it gets here again.  (\n\nI also had over 50 canker sores that it deformed my tongue into a ripple edged shape.  I could not really eat or drink or talk much. I cannot say I have had the nodes. I am so sorry. That sounds horrific. I am also sorry about the deformed tongue. I had that happen to my labia, actually. It never was the same shape again. \n\nI took colchicine for two years to try and get my pericarditis under control, which was just insanely debilitating. It is an amazing medicine but the combo between it and ibuprofen trashed my kidneys. I am on imuran now and doing much better. I do not think I would trade your crippling joint pain for constant stabbing chest pain though. Yours sounds just awful. I just cannot even imagine. I am sorry to hear that.. but how is it that you took colchicine and ibuprofen? :/ It was the first thing my doctor told me not to. As long as I take colchicine, absolutely no ibuprofen. \n\nI too had ulcers in my labia once, I could not walk.\nI cannot imagine how OP is tho...\nI did have swollen knees for a while, with a lot of pain to the point I started to avoid going to the toilet (bending the knees killed me). But turned out I had meningitis caused by the Beh\u00e7et. \n\nOverall I took colchicine + Imuran + Prednisone. The doses were adjusted over time, and now I take 100mg of Imuran + 10 of Prednisone (and lots of supplements like vitamin D, potassium, calcium etc). I never had anything again so far, except (after decreasing the Prednisone) my skin that develops a sort of lumpy acne very agressive. We are now trying to find something that works for my skin Holy crap, did not know it could cause pericarditis.  That is a worse nightmare for me.  Anything that effects breathing freaks me out.  I do not think I would trade either. \n\nHmm,. maybe I will ask about the colchicine again. I am sad I am allergic to Imuran, literally the only drug I have an allergy to is the one I need.  It is anaphylaxis allergy too, stupid. My cardiologist told me to :/ it was an attempt to keep me off of long term steroids. \n\nI have had them five times, all when I was a tween/teen/early 20s. It was horrific. \n\nI am on 100mg of imuran per day now. It made my hair fall out originally which was an interesting experience! Did your hair fall out? Yeah, labia ulcers would be just awful.  I had one, and only one.  It sucked. Luckily my tongue returned to it is shape.  Honestly the whole thing did not seem to do any actual damage (other than inflammatory long term issues and losing a lot of muscle mass from being bed bound).  Mental damage sure. Ah I see :/ still... kidney issues is no joke. \n\nNot at all. But I have seen here in Reddit a whole lot of side effects related to these meds, and I suppose I am lucky... Apart from the occasional headaches (that I had all my life prior to the Beh\u00e7et), nothing happened to me from taking those.\nIn the first months I took aspirin and that made me bruise a lot of course. \nRegarding hair, I always had it long and quite abundant, it falls a lot seasonally, but I see absolutely no change. No nausea, dizziness, redness, rashes...\n\nI also chose to drink a lot of water in the beginning, in an attempt to reduce any kidney issues. Plus, for half a year I avoided sugars, and I did blood tests weekly to ensure my levels of everything were fine. \nI cannot imagine having my hair falling, it was one of my big fears with the Imuran. Did it grow back just the same? Yes, I have had these exact leg symptoms. Before I was diagnosed I basically could not walk. For a while I was on colchicine and plaquenil and that kept the symptoms mostly under control. We switched the colchicine to otezla (still also on plaquenil) and it has made a huge difference for me. In the short term prednisone worked, and as a painkiller indocin was great when ibproufen was not enough. Feel free to DM me if you have more specific questions. I would ask about the colchicine, but I dunno much about chron's... \nYou mentioned that the doctors are more inclined to that than Beh\u00e7et? I would try to insist on a review of the diagnosis. Maybe see another doctor? Where I am from this is not a problem, but I understand that certain counties have not so good health systems and seeing other doctors is not possible... If it is for you, I would try that to get another opinion.\n\nAlso, I have seen here before people that for different reasons cannot take Imuran, and they manage the thing with other stuff. You could make a post in this subreddit about that specifically, and take the different opinions to your doctor to discuss. Cholchin and ibu is textbook medication for heart inflammation. It worked great for me. But i was only supposed to take the combo for 2-3 weeks. Mental damage from all these things is not mentioned enough I think... There is a lot going on, even if we exclude the obvious stuff disease-related, there is often image issues that come from effects and side effects, the overall feeling of not being healthy no matter what, the constant need to take care, the pains here and there, fatigue etc... I also get that lumpy acne.  Eliminating dairy for me helped significantly, but of course I got better then went back to dairy because I love cheese.  But it did work for a solid year.  I did it the year before my wedding as I did not want lumpy acne then and these scarred and took forever to heal up.  So that plus neutrogena salicylic acid pads helped the scarring clear up significantly (over the year).  \n\nDoes not mean that is the only variable though could just be coincidence which I find happens often enough.. \n\nI also get random sandpaper like rashes in places all over (bottom of foot, breasts, chest, lower back, neck, shins) that dermatologists just cannot really figure out but we just live with it as it is small in the whole mix. Yes.  Honestly I wish there were more specialists who dealt with this as a while.  Getting my life back was strangely life altering.  I had accepted this fate of never walking again potentially.  And then one day I could.  I was seriously depressed as I remember my mom asking me to come over and I said why, the couch is just fine for me and I do not need anything else anymore And she came over right away.  \n\nWhen I got better I wanted to just go back, but everything was hard. Stairs, slightly long walks, any exercise.  I had to just relearn how to do things because my ability level was so low compared to how it was. Not a single doctor asked or mentioned this.  I sought personal trainers who dealt with medical recovery but really could not find any. Others just pushed me too fast thinking I am a 30ish woman that seems in shape. I have been looking for a mental health professional too that might be more specialized in these areas but they also seem hard to find.  \n\nI feel for those over at chronic pain and other chronic illness subs as there is little support for anyone with chronic illness. Or at least I cannot find it. I see... I tried stopping cheese, I did not see any difference (except for my deepest sadness about it). \n\nLately it seems bicarbonate works to an extent (it is been one month I have no big lumps with nasty pus that explode :/). \nI will maybe try those neutrogena pads for the parts that are just scar now, thanks for the advice!\n\nSandpaper like rashes? I dunno if it is the same, but the day I reduced the Prednisone I got many many tiny red dots, that would turn yellow (with pus). But very tiny and many, mostly in the shoulders and neck. Doctors were not sure if it was caused by the medication or the Beh\u00e7et's (thus happening once I started to reduce the meds). But now we figured it is the Beh\u00e7et most likely, because it stopped but the lumpy acne appeared. Oh I got those too!  Not related to my rash, just out of the blue. It also happened after I was coming off prednisone 60mg daily.  My doc said it was a type of strep on my arm.  Gross. But mostly harmless. Just googled strep on arm (English not my main language), and those seem quite scary :| but not exactly what I had... Yeah having pericarditis for years has not been particularly fun. If I ever have a real heart attack I will probably die because I will not be able to tell the difference between my regular chest pain and that lol. I have always had thin lame hair so I pretty much expected it would fall out. I did not end up completely bald, but my scalp HURT so much I buzzed off my hair just to get the weight off of it. It was coming off in handfuls anyway so it was much less annoying to clean up short hair. My kidneys were already in stage 3 function by the time they switched me to the imuran. I honestly felt like it was baby chemotherapy, which it basically is. I vomited and lost a bunch of hair lol. I am adjusted now. My hair is growing back but it is a different texture now, which was very odd. I have always had baby fine thin hair and now it is a little coarse. Yeah I was on it for 2 whole years lol. It was not pleasant. It is dramatically better now that I am on the imuran but it still sneaks up on me occasionally and gives me a stabbing pain that leaves me gasping. Or if I exert myself too much ill hurt afterwards. Or if the weather changes dramatically. Like I have been fine for weeks and today it hurts. Like, why chest inflammation, why. I do have to thank it for finally getting me a diagnosis though. I got evaluated for behcets when I was a teenager and my obgyn then backed off when I freaked the hell out about going blind. I wish he had not. Also one thing to note it might have been because of the imuran he said no ibuprofen. I am forbidden to take ibuprofen with imuran. Yup coming to say this! Colchicine and ibuprofen can and often are taken together, they are just usually closely monitored; however imuran and ibuprofen are a definite no because of how hard they are on the kidneys together. Are you on a biologic or just the otezla &amp; pred? Otezla and plaquenil only. Prednisone if flares, but have not needed it since starting Otezla.", "newly misdiagnosed with herpes, test negative the past three weeks of my life have been a whirlwind. 22f here, recently graduated college and started seeing a guy from out of town around march. he is the only person i have been with in the past 6 months, so when i got an outbreak of genital ulcers three weeks ago i was hardcore tweaking. got the igg and igm blood tests and also got a culture done by my gyno towards the end of the outbreak. all three tests came back negative, and his igg / igm came back negative too (and he is never had any symptoms, it was just me). \n\nstarted reading &amp; beginning to think it may be behcets. i have been prone to mouth ulcers my whole life and the other day I woke up with a strange pain/sensitivity in the middle of my palm, which is what prompted the google search that took me right to behcet\u2019s as a possibility. any input/similar stories? i have heard diagnoses are hard to come by due to the come &amp; go nature of symptoms for behcet\u2019s, but i am eager for answers That happened to me when I was 20, but my gynecologist ruled it out with those negative tests. They cleared up and fast forward to 30, after years of mouth ulcers, stomach issues, vertigo and multiple tests - I finally got diagnosed with Behcets. Hang in there and some of the things I did was to take photographs of my ulcers, joints, etc to show my rheumatologist to chronicle my symptoms. thanks for the info! mind if i ask how long it took to get a diagnosis from your rheumatologist from when you first started going? do you regularly take any meds to help with the genital ulcers, or have they not come back much since the initial outbreak? my first one was so painful i cannot imagine that becoming a regular occurrence in my life \ud83e\udd75 I started getting ulcers at like 10, and probably went through 10+ swabs and biopsies throughout the years to test for herpes before, as doctors were convinced it had to be that and they were just getting bad samples. I FINALLY found a gyno that said \"hm maybe it is this thing my rheumotologist buddy is working on\" and from there we went through the elimation process of everything else around my seventeenth birthday.\nGenital ulcers are almost identical between the two illnesses is unfortunate. Even more so, is that the main difference is behcets ulcers typically scar, while herpes does not.\nGetting a referral to a rheumo is probably the best way to go about getting a diagnosis. In the mean time, auqaphor(not vaseline, yes there is a difference) is your best friend for open ulcers, and toasty baking soda baths are the best for discomfort.", "Could this be that? Could that be this? Hey thanks for your help behcets community!\n\n\n\nI have been experiencing wicked bad joint pain, for just over a year, maybe a bit longer, and recurring, debilitating canker sores(for not quite as long as that, maybe the last few months.) I also get blurred vision from time to time that does not go away for upwards of 20, 30 minutes. (That is been happening for several years) I always thought I was like, iron deficient, or dehydrated, or something? But then I started getting genital sores literally this week.. When I google all the symptoms this is what pops up and I am a little freaked. It is just too perfect of a fit to NOT be this, but I do not want to jump to conclusions.\n\nWhat were your first steps in diagnosing this? \n\nIs there anything else that looks exactly like this, maybe some kind of deficiency or something else I could have, that I should ask my doctor about?\n\nWhat kind of doctor do I even need to see?\n\nNot going to lie this is kind of scary. An ophthalmologist can see scarring if you have had iritis with damage in the past.  Not all rheumatologists are created equal... it took me a few tries to find one I could connect with and safely share these other scary symptoms and be met with explanations and understanding. This disease belongs to Rheumatology, so that is the kind of doctor you want. Might be, might be not, Beh\u00e7et diagnosis is pretty hard since there is no test to take that gives a definite answer. What can make lean more on a diagnosis is the HLA-B51 allele test. BD has been found more present in people with this gene, but having it does not mean having the disease and you might have the disease without the allele.   \n\n\nWhat makes me think it might not be Beh\u00e7et's is the fact you have had mouth ulcers since very recently, whereas most BD cases have had them pretty much since birth with just an increase of frequency during flares.   \n\n\nYou might have something else, just not BD. Anyways just know that BD is indeed a terrible disease BUT if left uncured: if you do get a diagnosis and follow the cure you will live a completely normal life. Also the bad effects are usually pretty long term, so take all the time you need to get a real and solid diagnosis and do not rush it since the drugs used to keep BD in check are fairly strong and taking them when not actually needed is very much not good. I do not think that is quite true. Mouth ulcers are usually the first symptom, but they can come on during your teens or even young adulthood, not necessarily from birth. But I agree that if it is Beh\u00e7et\u2019s it is weird that the mouth ulcers were not the first symptom.  First step is always rheumatologist if you are concerned about this type of thing. I am going to be honest though, it took me 21 years from my first non mouth ulcer symptom to actually getting a behcets diagnosis. The symptoms can be so off the wall you do not get to the right doctor until much later. A lot of behcets symptoms overlap with a lot of other things so it can be tricky. I will be honest its probably more likely that you have like RAS, arthritis and some form of idopathic uveitis than behcets. It is a a very rare disease if you are not in the middle east, japan or korea. Still it you should consult rheum because of the genital sores. They can rule out other autoimmune diseases too. There is enough there to confirm a diagnosis of behcets if a doctor either rules out Rheumatoid arthritis with labs or your eyes have uveitis. 3 mouth ulcers in a year also, which i assume you already had. For most people  it is not a dangerous deadly disease, especially if you are female and current advancement in therapies is reducing morbidity and mortality very well. Dont stress out too much and see a specialist if you can!", "2nd Moderna Shot Experience I am back to follow up on my Covid vaccine experience for you guys. Quick recap, I got the first shot in the end of December. I had site swelling, arm pain and intense back pain for the following 2 days. \n\nI got the 2nd shot last Tuesday and had a completely different experience. Almost immediately after the shot, my arm began to swell, became painful and stiff. I did not experience this until the following day with the first.  I did not get the back pain at all with this one, instead I had fevers, chills and fatigue. My temp would get up to about 101 with chills and overall pain. It would completely dissipate with just Tylenol. Every 4-6 hours my temperature would spike, I would take Tylenol, sweat profusely for about half hour and repeat. After about 36 hours of this cycle it just all stopped. I feel completely fine now. I know I am not the best writer and often forget things so if anyone has any questions please ask I am happy to help. How are usually your flares?\nAre you a serious case of Beh\u00e7et, or a light one?\nHow long has it been you had the first flare? If I may ask, how old are you, and gender?\nDo you live in a rural or urban area? (Basically, are you very exposed to stuff or do you breathe fresh clean air when going out of your door)\nIn case it is not been long time you have Beh\u00e7et's, have you ever been sick with anything besides it? Like common flu or really anything actually..? If yes, how was it? Like, would you describe those symptoms as normal compared to other times when you were sick + Beh\u00e7et? \nWhat about respiratory issues? Did you feel anything at all, or was it all fine? Wow, that is a lot but I will do my best to answer it all. I am female, was diagnosed at 18, 35 now. I had oral ulcers my whole childhood but did not develop the other classic symptoms until 17 after I had mono and was never the same. I was in GT classes before this and afterwards I struggled to keep up. From the ages of 18-24 I was in pretty bad shape. I was in and out of the hospital a lot during this time with classic and neurological symptoms. I was on colchine, plaquenil and immuran daily. By 26, I really did not have any symptoms except for migraines and an oral ulcer here and there so my rheumatologist weened me off all medications. I did begin to exhibit intense ADHD symptoms after coming off immune suppressants and now take Vyvanse just to function on a basic level, unknown if coincidental or related. I almost feel like the years of being sick cooked my brain a little. I never really got sick or had any serious flares since until last October when I developed dizziness and vertigo which I am still dealing with now. I have some issues with the bones in my ears and the rheumatologist says it is not related to the behcets. \n\nGoing back to answer a few more questions. I do not think I ever had the flu, I get the common cold a lot but nothing serious.  I have sports induced asthma and do have an inhaler for that but otherwise never have had any respiratory symptoms.", "Vasculitis Symposium Raising  awareness of vasculitis begins with your own understanding of this  complex disease.

Lots of water, get rid of processed sugar if you can. Stay active. I started back to work in May. My exercise has dropped off hugely, and I feel my joint pain coming back badly.

I did but I was pregnant and had not had a flare up in a really long time, so I mistook the symptoms for normal pregnancy symptoms.  I am just curious if this has been anyone else\u2019s experience.", "Looking for advice and insight Hi Everyone. This is my first time posting here. After I (29/F) went through a lot of posts here, I am still confused about whether I might have BD/BS or not. Putting down my journey here and I will try to be concise and relevant.\nRight when the shelter in place started in March I started going running everyday due to lack of gym access. All through March I ran 5 miles everyday which is more than I have run in the past. First week of April one morning I woke up with burning and itchy vulva (major and minor labia). In the course of that day I had an ulcer outbreak. It started on the left labia and healed in 10 days then another outbreak on the right labia. Healed and then another outbreak on both. Went to urgent care and they thought it is STI and swabbed for a full panel test. Due to covid they could not test for herpes and prescribed valtrex because they were sure it is that even though I told them I have been in a LTR with my husband for 8 years and we only ever had sex (oral included) with each other. The full panel test was negative btw. The OBs periodically continued. Also I have had chronic mouth canker sores since childhood so this entire time I am getting mouth sores as well but I did not pay much attention until later when I noticed both outbreaks happen at the same exact time. The number of sores in my mouth went up too with recurrent sores in my gums which is new.\n\nAs the OBs continued I got referred to an obgyn who swabbed me for HSV and it came back -ve. I was prescribed more valtrex and the OBs continued still. I got another swab done which was also -ve. Finally a blood test showed presence of HSV-1 antibodies which doc says is very common and should not cause these aggressive OBs. I got referred to a Dermatologist who is suspecting Crohn\u2019s among other possible inflammatory/autoimmune syndromes but I do not show all the GI issues associated with CD. Derm asked me about my eye issues which made me wonder if dry eyes, floaters are common in Behcets or does it have to be inflammation only. I did have some eye pain/ brow ridge pain and some pin like sensation in my eye during the severe outbreaks but later when it went down I happened to go for an eye check up and other than my right eye being extra dry they did not see anything abnormal. So can the eye inflammation issue be detected only during a flare up?\n\nI have been prescribed betamethasone as a test of whether the genital sores respond to them and they actually did. Last night I saw new bumps and it started to itch/burn like paper cuts and after I applied the ointment I woke up in the morning with burn gone which never ever happened till now since April.\n\nI have spend a lot of money due to a high deductible health care plan trying to get answers and still pretty confused. Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated. Hi, I have NOT been diagnosed but we literally have the SAME story. I have been researching Behcet\u2019s for weeks now and do plan on seeing doctors asap. I have been having oral ulcers for years and recently I got them on my gums (never happened before) and were so big I could not close my mouth. I have genital ulcers for the first time after I ran many km in two day wearing a thong and tight leggings while it was really hot (I know, stupid). At first it was just sensitive but then I got what I thought were pimples but they became BAD ulcers and it was awful. Only got them once since but I have been having really bad eye dryness that hurts. Hope you find out soon if it is. Good luck :) Oh wow! I forgot to add that I have been waking up every morning with a dry mouth which makes my throat itchy too. I do not know if this is a primary symptoms or secondary reaction.\nAlso, just before new sores show up I either get pain in my pelvic bone or knees. It is temporary and goes away in a day or two. \nThe sores too heal in 4-5 days, earlier it took 8-9 days and then I get 2-3 days of relief until new sores show up again. I would say one thing based on my experience, get a genital swab when the ulcers are fully visible ASAP. Not only will it help confirm if it is hsv it will also quickly rule it outif it is not. Docs obsess about hsv before moving on to \u201ccrazier\u201d ideas. (That is literally what my doc told me. Let us confirm whether it is or is not hsv before we move on to crazier ideas) Oh wow!

Let us confirm whether it is or is not hsv before we move on to crazier ideas) I am not any sort of expert but I have pan uveitis and that is how I was diagnosed. I do not have genital ulcers but I get mouth ulcers and skin blisters (which for like seven months I thought was bed bugs). I also had a fever off and on for a month and lots of weight loss. I have a history of stomach ulcers too and RA which I was told pointed to Behcets. \n\nHave you seen a rheum? If not I would start there and with an ophthalmologist. I was just diagnosed (planning on starting a thread - it was a long 2yr journey) - so I can comment. I have oral lesions, skins lesions/rashes, joint pain, abdominal pain, and horrible fatigue during flares. \n\nYou meet the diagnostic criteria for Behcet's Disease:\n\n* Oral lesions that are recurring 3+ times a year (extra points for being sensitive to corticosteroids). \n* Ditto for genital lesions\n* Joint pain in the lower half of the body. \n* Eye involvement during flares\n\nGo find a rheumatologist ASAP that specializes in Behcets, sarcoidosis, or autoimmune vasculitis. There is no definitive test, but rather it is an assessment of the symptoms + response to treatments. I am now on low dose prednisone + azathioprine and am starting to recover. \n\nSome supplements that have helped me get through flares:\n\n* Ubiquinol (400-600mg) - this helps lower oxidative stress caused by hyperactive neutrophils caused by the disease. \n* Quercetin Phytosome - a mild immunosuppressant. \n* Huperzine A - increases acetylcholine, which decreases neutrophil and microglial cell activation. \n* NSAIDs - ibuprofen works in a pinch. \n* CBD oil - another broad spectrum anti-inflammatory. I recently went to an ophthalmologist who cleared me for everything. I mentioned the headaches and the brow bone pain and doc said there is not anything abnormal during the checkup. I am curious, to your knowledge are the eye issues detectable at all times or only during flare ups? Thank you for this detailed info. I am going to follow up with my dermatologist and see if she can refer me. She mentioned referring me to a GI specialist first so Idk if she has a plan of action in her mind already. I read about lysine being useful for canker sores. Have you tried? Did it help? I will look into the other stuff you have mentioned. Again. Thank you so much! Your symptoms sound like Behcet\u2019s. Other great advice here already, but also it is very important to watch your diet and consume 90%+ real food. Wild fish and organic grass fed meats, too. Anti inflammatory diet (just keep it simple) is best to mitigate flares. I have damage and it caused glaucoma so those were found before I had a \u201cflare\u201d of uveitis, yes. I went in for a checkup and they caught it then. This is pretty much exactly how it went for me, dragged out over 2 years. The first year or so was herpes testing and re-testing (all negative) and valtrex, then my gyn referred me to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy to rule out Chron's (I had some minor GI symptoms generally but not timed with the flares). From there I was referred to a rheum, whose approach was that we would treat it as Behcet's even though I did not have the full diagnostic criteria (ie no eye symptoms or skin lesions other than the mouth/genital ulcers, I get joint pain but that is not technically part of the core criteria) since we would basically ruled everything else out. I definitely get wanting to skip the gastro step with no symptoms + a high deductible plan though, unless you are going to hit it this year anyway. Definitely try to get referred to a rheumatologist if you can. And document everything! Take pictures of ulcers, notes about when you had symptoms and for how long, etc.\n\nYour eye symptoms sounds a lot like mine were, but my opthalmologists assured me they are unrelated to Behcet's. My floaters are due to lattice degeneration, but they are just pretty common symptoms generally. I had some eye pain during pre-diagnosis flares that has gone away completely with treatment, and I have coincidentally been to the ophthalmologist during a flare since then, and she did not see anything that she would attribute to the Behcet's. I have also been told by a couple doctors that Behcet's cases without eye involvement are generally milder, so there is that.\n\nThe thing they \"tested\" me with was a short burst of steroids, and it cleared everything up quickly, but I never got anything topical so I am not sure if it would be better or worse than what you already have. And prednisone's not a med you want to be on long-term, much less during the pandemic.\n\nI am writing this on my phone so it is a bit all over the place, but if you have any questions please ask. No problem! Feel free to reach out anytime - I know how terrible it is to be stuck in diagnostic limbo. Lysine did not work for me - it is supposed to be decent against HSV1/HSV2 positive canker sores as a weak anti-viral - so it makes sense now why it did not work for an autoimmune-based canker sore. I was actually able to keep the oral ulcers at bay using heavy antioxidants and those mild immunosuppressive supplements - but they did not help much during an active flare unfortunately. \n\nI will echo some of the other comments here regarding diet. I am usually not someone who believes in diets fixing medical issues, but there is quite a bit of research in this area for Behcets. I would avoid alcohol, super high fat diets, and sugary foods until you can get everything managed. I have switched to a largely \"mediterranean-style\" diet, which has helped significantly. It is pretty much fish, veggies, and some complex carbs. Also - probiotics are your best friend whenever possible - Visibiome or Align capsules (once or twice a day) did wonders for me. These probiotics contain friendly bacteria like bifidobacteria infantis/breve/longum which release IL-10 in the gut, which helps \"calm\" the immune system further. \n\nBut yeah, you fit the diagnostic criteria, so keep pressing for a rheumatologist! I eventually had to give up on my primary care physician for a referral and had to schedule directly with a rheumatologist's office. Yes, this is how it goes! Oral lesions first then other symptoms pop up over the months/years. Good luck to you! &lt;3 Can you explain your brow bone pain a bit more? Is it both sides? Forehead? The brow bone pain when it hit was only on one side. It felt synonymous with a blocked sinus pain but it was not quite coz I had difficulty concentrating on things and that has not happened in the past with sinus related aches. The next day it just went away but there was a little leftover tenderness from the pain. Also, I started feeling a pin prick in the other eye. It was as if an eyelash is stuck in my eye but because I have had dry eyes issues for 5-6 years now I knew this was a dry eye sensation. I just kept applying my regular eye drops to keep it moisturized. Interesting you say that. My oral ulcers have been a childhood issue. Mom has it too but hers never got as frequent as mine. My mom mostly gets trauma ulcers (biting of the cheek) whereas I have woken up mornings with sudden appearances of bumps which became ulcers in a course of hours. This was really helpful. Thank you so much replying with so many details! Okay so I have the same thing on the right side of my forehead off and on for 2 years! It is like tender to light touch, so when I put makeup on it drives me insane when I brush over it with a soft makeup brush. Or even if I brush over it with my hairbrush. It is the same spot every time. I know, it sounds really dumb when I try to explain it lol. Also, you are blowing my mind with the pin prick explanation because I have been getting what feels like an eyelash stuck in my eye but there never is an eyelash! I will even make my boyfriend look in my eye because I swear I feel it (I have long eyelashes so this has happened to me my whole life, I know what it feels like!) but he assures me there is nothing there. I have not had any eye involvement so I am not even sure what signs or symptoms to look for. First let me say, I am so sorry you are going through this. I had the same experience with Doctors diagnosing me with herpes and insisting I take Valtrex even though my tests were negative. Get an apt with a good rheumatologist, this May takes a few weeks/months and in the meantime, journal! Journal and track all of your symptoms. It has taken me 9 years but I finally have my Behcets managed. Good luck!! I will echo your echo... diet was a huge factor in all my symptoms, mouth ulcers especially. You may consider getting a Food sensitivity test at some point, this was helpful for me. Also, for the oral ulcers, switching to a toothpaste that does not have Lauryl sulfur in it was a game changer. I have been 99% oral ulcer free for 3 years now. I took Valtrex for YEARS and it did absolutely nothing. I have had the oral ulcers since I was a toddler and that was what my childhood pediatrician tried. I was finally diagnosed when I was in college and had a flare up so bad it sent me to my university health clinic. One of the med students working mentioned Behcets and it all finally clicked into place. I started at my GP and OBGYN, then went to an immunologist who sent me to a rheumatologist. I would get into a rheumatologist as soon as you can. Mine has been the only person who has consistently been able to understand how all the weird symptoms I have fit together and treat them as a whole, not a bunch of separate issues. Third on food. Turns out I was sucrose intolerant as well. Once I cut sugar and ate whole\nFoods I can manage very well and was able to get off all my meds. Hey! I am looking for advice! I just got a sudden outbreak of ulcers around my vulva! Do you have any tips for a quicker recovery? Not sure if this will work for you but for me a cold soak with Domeboro astringent dries up the ulcers in as good as one day. Just did it last night as well. You can also do a sitz bath if you prefer that. This of course does not treat the underlying issue but gives relief from the ulcers when they occur. What is a sitz bath? It is a warm shallow bath in a tub (with or without medication dissolved) that can be helpful for hemorrhoids, anal fissures and in this case, genital ulcers.\n\nYou draw a shallow bath in a tub just to reach your waistline with warm water and you sit in it such that your genital area is fully covered by the warm water. Lukewarm water is sufficient and the warm water is supposed to improve blood flow thereby providing some relief.\n\nPersonally for my ulcers, I prefer the cold soak because the cold water really feels good against the ulcers.", "Periodontal issues My wife has been doing ok with cancer sores lately, but ongoing red gums that feel like they are cuts are troubling her when eating, rheumatologist has recommended increasing prednisone dosage and frequency of infusions and dosage in that as well. In the meantime is there anything we can do to help her? Has anyone else had gum issues along with Behcets? Thanks I treat them the same as mouth ulcers, get an Orajel with lidocaine and apply it before she eats, or she can see her doctor or go to urgent care and get a prescription for lidocaine and you swish it in your mouth. I used to have them really bad and I am on Humira now and have little to no canker sores or gum issues! During my teens and the first half of my twenties (I am 41 now), I used to get big, open oral ulcers (along with genital ulcers). Then they just kind of stopped on their own. However, I do still get frequent gum inflammation. Sometimes it is a little sore, sometimes a lot. Still, I would rather deal with anything other than the open sores. Be watchful of the foods she is eating. Many foods make the ulcers worse. Check Google for Behcets then find one that explains what foods make it worse.\nThank you for supporting your wife through this! \ud83e\udd2a No advice just want to say I am glad I am not the only one with gum inflammation, it is weird to know that is also a symptom. My entire gum line will hurt and sting so much during a flare, it is brutal.", "Remicade/Infliximab Hi! First ever reddit poster here. I have been diagnosed with Behcet\u2019s and Psoriatic Arthritis for about 10 years. Nothing was working, and I could never afford consistent treatment until about two years ago when I got my real adult job with decent insurance. I just started Remicade (in conjunction with azapriothine and otezla). I am a bank manager and essential worker (I work alone mostly with my best friend and colleague in the drive thru since the pandemic so it is minimal exposure). One of my other employees that I have less contact with, my personal relationship banker, is going through a horrible time- her husband has cancer, long story. I comforted her when she cried (mostly from a distance as much as possible and we were both wearing masks). I had my infusion Tuesday, and she called in with Covid yesterday. I have a fever today, and some flu like symptoms, and I am wondering if anyone on here experienced flu like symptoms after their first infusion? Or if this is definitely Covid? I do not get paid if I have to go home and quarantine and were paycheck to paycheck. I obviously care way more about the health of others and am obviously going to do that until I know for sure, but tests are backed up here in the southern US (also it is terrible how not seriously people are taking this down here) \n\nMy anxiety is just high and I am trying to convince myself it is just side effects, but does anyone here have an experience with Remicade side effects and fevers? Sorry for the unnecessary back story. Any info would be appreciated. I am going on Infliximab in the next week or two so I do not have an answer. Having said that, if you have symptoms stay home for Monday at least and get tested. I went through the same thing and do not have any underlying issues besides behcets, and I was fine. The 3 S\u2019s worked for me. Sun, Spa, Sauna. I did this everyday and pulled through really fast. Thank you so much for your reply! I honestly have never tried any of those. I am new to this sub. Does sun actually help? I get burned so easily I usually stay away. I need to do\nSome more research lol Got tested waiting for the results! That being said \u2014 the side effects are not bad. And I will say I am liking Remicade so far. I do not have ulcers for the first time in ages AND I can move my left hand for the first time in months. Which is pretty huge for me. Good luck with the infliximab, and do not be nervous! They do give you a fair fair bit of Benadryl to counteract any possible like allergic reactions, so I would recommend not driving afterwards if you can help it. I was knocked out lol \u2764\ufe0f", "Is weed out of bounds? Hi I was just diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et's and I was wondering if any of you smokes weed or was indicated not to. I know it is an immune system suppressor so that should help, but since I will stop drinking alcohol I would just really like to keep smoking or vaping, not really for medical reasons. Any comments are appreciated! Stress makes it worse. When I quit smoking, I got more ulcers. I am not starting back anytime soon for job reasons but I wish I could. Maybe consider just vaping for overall health/less carcinogens? \nWeed always helped reduce my stress. Thanks for your reply, that is encouraging! I have gotten a couple of direct messages from some of you which are great, please keep them coming if you do not feel as comfortable posting here, some of the suggestions I have received have been mostly around focusing either on CBD products or strains with high concentrations of CBD, thanks a lot! I feel behcets is touch and go. What works and damages some, works opposite for others. Stress is definite key. If smoking reduces stress- do it. \n\nI binge drink my ass off on fridays. Alcohol suppresses immune response. Yet I feel better mentally with my \u201cblow this week off\u201d technique. \n\nI mean it does drain me for the wkd, but I am content sleeping and napping and resting back up. Yup from what I have read around the other posts it does seem that each case responds differently to different treatments and substances, thanks for your answer! Medical marijuana can be prescribed for Behcet's sufferers who have chronic pain from arthritis, etc. I was told this by my rheumatologist, so it seems to be OK. For me, smoking is a must because I do not use pain meds. It helps with a lot That is a relief! Great, do you vape or smoke or both? I am concerned regarding if smoking may cause an infection in the ulcers or something like that \ud83e\udd14 I do not smoke anything, but I drink alcohol from time to time. Not much really, that is true. Doctors told me that there was not any problem with it. Alcohol can cause problems with the absortion of prednisone, but as long as you do not get really drunk or ar always with alcohol in blood that does not matter, if you start drinking at evening/night, you probably took your prednisone at morning and the hormons levels are droping, it is the natural thing to have low levels at night. So a couple of glasses of rum after dinner (what I drink) or some beers, should not be a problem.\n\nIn any case I am not a doctor and your case may be different or there can be other reasons to stop drinking, just saying what I heard.\n\nAbout weed, as they said, better stop smoking, maybe vapes are better. This is specially true if you are taking some inmunosupressors that specifically target the part of the inmune system that deals mostly with cancerous cells (I mean, with every inmunosupressor we get more chances of cancer, but with some of them chances are even higher). This is very helpful, thanks a lot! I must clarify that I take that one weekend each two months or something like that, if you take it everyday maybe it does not work the same way With \"that\" do you mean the medicine or the alcohol? Alcohol.\nI take medicine daily, it differs from time to time but just now: \n15mg prednisone\n150 mg inmurel\n1mg colchicine Great, I am taking 150 mg inmurel daily just now since I am starting Phosphorite piss XD\nIgood luck, it is one of the \"less bad\" neds you can take, I hope it serves you. Thanks man, will make sure to piss in the dark hahah Oh wait, not fluorescent. Do you have any kidney problems due to the medicine? No, no, It was just an exageration, it just has a slightly more yellow/green color, I cannot describe it. And I guess you will not ser anything if you drink a lot or have a different proportion dosis/weight or you eat other things I do not know, I just have Cherbobyl piss XD\n\nI am fine, I have some veins obstructed or nearly obstructed, in the jugular/part of the brain and in the... Lungs... Lungs are the ones you use to breath are not they? English is not my main language and I always change them with the kidneys. Anyway I do not have any damage that can cause symptoms, if my Beh\u00e7et is inactive I am as healthy as anybody (but taking meds). \n\nIf you have kidney problems then it is surely better if you cut alcohol. Understood! \ud83d\ude01 Weed has helped me TONS. It helps with nausea and appetite suppression caused by azathioprine. It helps me to sleep. And, of course, it makes everything a little better: food, music, comedy, etc. I did not know azathioprine was the cause of my lack of hunger, thanks for that insight! I will definitely continue vaping once my mouth is fully recovered Glad I could help. Best of luck! I got a script for it in Canada, if you need help getting one hit me up. Absolutely, and vaping. A lot of the times when my mouth sores flare up really bad like right now I like a nice hunger suppressing weed to keep me from wanting to eat more than I need. Fuck munchies hurt so bad \ud83d\ude25 I live in Wales, UK. Wish it was legal over here, I can get weed but I just wish I did not have to become a criminal to do so", "Pretty sure I have it. Hi everyone!\nUnfortunately I cannot get an appointment with a doctor because of the virus right now, mainly because I feel bad since I am not dying but also because they are really busy with the pandemic. I do plan on going soon. \n\nBasically I think I have Behcet disease. But I want to know what you guys think about it and if you have any tips.\n\nSo for as long as I can remember, I have always had bad ulcers in my mouth, especially around my period. The last few years, they have been REALLY bad, hurting so bad that I could not eat or sleep. Recently, I had a yeast infection for the first time ever combined with irritation on the vulva because I ran like 10 km in two days with a thong and tight leggings when it was really hot (I  know I am fucking dumb, learned my lesson). \nI got my period the next day I did that and as expected I had three bad ulcers in my mouth. Now I have 5, one being on my gum where my wisdom tooth is coming out and it hurts like HELL. I am taking like 8 advils a day and cannot even close my mouth. Its BAD.  \n\nBut the worst thing is I have ulcers on my vulva. I want to fucking die this is the worst pain I have ever experienced EVER and I have a high pain tolerance. I could not pee without screaming. I am 20 years old btw. At first I did not know what it was and did not even cheked what it looked like. Then I decided to take a look down there and I was horrified. Did not even feel comfortable showing my bf. After screaming hysterically while trying to pee, my mom wanted to see and she was positive it was an STD, like herpes (keep in mind ahe does not know shit about stds) which would be really unlikely for me. After crying hysterically and have multiple panic attacks thinking I caught herpes, I realised that the many sores (I had about 10) I had on my vulva looked exactly like the ulcers in my mouth. Also they wee raised like pimples (herpes is not raised so theres that) at first and then became ulcers. They are healing now and do not I do not have any more pain when I pee. I used coconut oil and I think it helped. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Could a yeast infection trigger ulcers or it was just a coincidence? Can I go my whole life without having them down there and suddenly have them? Do you guys have any tips? I research a lot and it looks like it to me. Also I have been really tired do not know if its just my period though.\n\nThank you so much guys!!!\ud83d\ude01 The first time I had ulcers it also coincided with a yeast infection too!! I saw my OBGYN - also seriously freaking out about herpes, even though chances were very slim. She did a full panel and it all came back negative and said that chances of it being caused by the infection were very, veryyy small. I think it may be more related to yeast infections and flares both possibly coinciding with PMS? The fatigue is huge for me too - of course it could be your period, but as I was going through the process I had no idea how many symptoms I thought were just normal things I experienced were actually not normal, and related to the disease.\n\nGetting a diagnosis can be a really, really long process, and then getting a management plan can take even longer. I really recommend trying to see someone now if it is severe enough; you will probably have to see someone for a referral, and even getting that can be a headache. Then rheumatologist, then labs, etc etc. Take pictures of your sores!!! And any other symptoms you can. It will help the doctor once you get in the door.\n\nI am really sorry you are experiencing this. Thank you!!!!! I will try and get the diagnostic ASAP. I feel less alone. Can I ask you how many ulcers you had and how long did it take to go away? \u263a\ufe0f The first time I had three, really close together and near the urethra (ow). Now they are much more sporadic, I am lucky and do not usually surpass 4 but I think any range can be normal. My doctor prescribed me colchicine which works really well to control both oral and genital sores. Thank you so much!!!!! :) Pee in the bath- disgusting but less painful. \n\nI know how you feel about the ulcers, and the embarrassment they cause on top of the pain. They can and do scar so I would try and get seen sooner rather than later. \n\nThey also can cause something called vulval melanosis if the scarring is particularly bad, which is not dangerous but it is really ugly looking, and should be avoided if possible. \n\nI always found they were worse during my period and any hair down there makes them a hell of a lot worse. \n\nI was diagnosed at a really young age and am lucky enough that my flare ups have been further apart since my 30\u2019s. I sometimes have an entire 6 weeks ulcer free although the joints are still a bit achy.  \n\nFor your mouth ulcers, there is a study that the foaming agent in toothpaste can make them worse so maybe swap brands. You can also get second skin mouth spray which will help lots. Avoiding spicy food, vinegar and citrus also helps. \n\nI really hope you manage to find a treatment that works for you- there is so many variations and no clear treatment path so it is a process.\n\nSomeone on another post recommended these, they are amazing for the genital ulcers- \n\n\n\n Hey I am really sorry to read what you are going through but I feel with you as I have been there being diagnosed at 15 years old and am now 27. \n\nInterestingly enough I have taken the approach where food is my medicine. I have switched to an only plant based diet now becoming completely vegan overtime. I started by eliminating dairy for one year. It is hard but not impossible bc there are so many alternatives if you are not able to make everything from scratch yourself. Just read the ingredients!\n\nMy health has drastically increased / symptoms lessened but there are still times where I struggle. It is helped drastically though and I would really recommend it. \n\nBeing plant based takes a lot of learning about nutrients your body needs so spend that time otherwise it is detrimental to your health. \n\nI have also started using authentic natural ingredients for my toothpaste / mouthwash. Tom\u2019s brand works well. \n\nRemember to keep a positive mindset. I meditate daily and write gratitude lists often to stay happy. It also helps. \n\nHope this helps and please let me know if you have questions.", "Covid?  Always go for testing if you can: lhi.care \nIf the link above can locate testing near you, it is free and available for routine screening. I have done three tests over the last six months. Sometimes my lymph nodes get really swelled for no apparent reason and my doctor says it is just behcet acting up. Since swollen lymph nodes are a sign of inflammation in the body it makes sense to me. \nBut, if you think you were at risk of getting covid or if you simply need the reassurance go get tested. I hope you are okay ! Apparently only works in California, Florida, Indiana, New Jersey and North Carolina.\n\nIf you live in any other part of the world no need to even open the link.", "Behcet\u2019s eye variant Hi guys, I (24 M) was diagnosed with Bechet\u2019s yesterday, I started getting symptoms last year, and had three flare ups within 6 months. \n\nI only seem to get canker sores genital sores and a really awful conjunctivitis when it shows up. I do not have any joint pain, gastrointestinal or thrombosis problems.\n\nI guess I just want a little reassurance. I know it is not a particularly dangerous disease but I heard the eye thing can be pretty dangerous for your eye sight. I am going to see a specialist next week about it for the first time. \n\nI wanted to know if anyone has had this mostly eye-centric variant of the disease and how it is panned out / is panning out for you. Do you get any other symptoms that are more systemic like fatigue or fever? I cannot be certain if I am just tired or if it is because of the flare up itself. \n\nFor the boys, how do the genital sores manifest? I heard it is supposed to be scrotal but I just get these large asymmetric red plaques that grow on the head and get so raw and sore they make me so thankful I still have a foreskin to protect them.\n\nSorry if you get a lot of these posts, my mum\u2019s kind of freaking out and I wanted to get some non-YouTube non-specialist experiences with this thing. Cheers! I had an issue a while ago of ocular uveitis, temporarily lost 70% vision in my right eye and 10 in my left. For a couple weeks I had this big grey patch covering most of my sight in my right eye with a small clearing just below centre.\n\nI was in grade 11 at the time, and it was admittedly scary, but it did clear up and I still have 20/15 vision despite the scar tissue it left behind. That is just my rather brief experience with BD and eyes, and from several years ago.\n\nAs for genital sores, for me they look the same as an oral ulcer, just on the sack and shaft. Have not had any on the head, but I am circumcised.\n\n\nEdit: I am a 25 year old male, was diagnosed when I was 18 after two years of tests, eye inflammation happened during those two years. Dang, sorry that must have been scary man. Was it because you caught it late or it was just particularly aggressive? Also have you had issues with your eyes since? 90% of patients only have 4 symptoms, eye, skin, mouth and Genital ulcers. Usually with joint inflammation you get more of a deformation osteopathic Arthritis more than anything. My rheumatologist thankfully did an extensive study on bechets when I was diagnosed 25 years ago. \n\n( \n\nWatch out for a lot of support groups, it is been my experience a lot of people will couple unrelated stuff with the disease that has nothing to do with it. I got my only flare-up at 26 (M). It is been 2 years. Genital sores are the one diagnostic criterion I am missing for an official diagnosis of BD. I got global vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels all over the body) affecting my nervous systems. The symptom I am still dealing with today is retinal hemorrhaging. \n\nMedicinally I was on the anti-inflammatory corticosteroids/prednisone short-term and am on the immunosuppressant azathioprine (AKA Imuran) long-term. Pantoprazole as an antacid. Corticosteroids can give mood swings, acne, moon face (fat cheeks), buffalo hump (pot belly), muscle atrophy, stretch marks, heartburn. Azathioprione has not had any side effects on me, but the most common is nausea.  \n\nI got eye surgeries: non-invasive ( (cauterization) at the office and ( under sedation (awake) at the hospital O.R. to clean out the bleeding, remove scar tissue, implant an artificial lens, and put in a gas bubble to prevent retinal detachment. \n\nIn Canada. They will tell you, if there are any sudden changes in your vision, you can report it to their emergency line. The hospital usually does not treat mine; I need an appointment at the retinal specialist's office. They will prioritize you if they need to. \n\nIf there is anything else I can tell you, stress probably makes it worse (as it makes anything worse). So whatever you do, ***DO NOT PANIC!!!!!!* PRACTISE YOUR BREATHING EXERCISES: HAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!** Yeah I have also noticed a lot of different sources saying very different things. Thanks for the link Sounds rough! Thanks for your answer. I got my first flare up when I was a few weeks away from submitting my thesis, and again now, with all the uncertainty about work and lack of seeing friends etc, I definitely think stress is a big one for me. I have always had cold sores as well and they always show up when I am sad or stressed. Good to know it can be a trigger for BD too then  I thankfully have not had any issues with my sight since. Docs really wanted to be sure what is wrong with me before confirming one disease or another, as well I am an enigma from most BD patients because I suffer from chronic calf inflammation. When I have flare ups my calves will get very sore, and even walking will become incredibly difficult.\n\nNow days I just mainline turmeric and vitamin C every day and seems to be handling it fairly well. Occasional flares, colchicine if I have oral ulcers. Just take it day by day.", "misdiagnosed with herpes, might have behcets\u2026 Forgive me in advance this post might be a lil long. So let me start the first time I remember ever getting a canker sore I was 19, I just got one and ever since then I would get them constantly. I am 24 now and to be honest I get them all the time. At 23 I started getting genital ulcers (first thought herpes)! I have gotten swabbed twice but both were negative, then blood work showed positive for HSV1. Fast forward to this month I went on vacation and noticed an outbreak on my genitals very small so I upped my antivirals, they did absolutely nothing. Then my mouth sores went insane I probably have around 10. I went to my GYN begging to switch antivirals because the pain is so unbearable and I just want something to work. Next thing you know she gets a second opinion and the Dr. asks have you ever heard of Behcets? I do not think that is herpes in your mouth &amp; all your genital swabs have been negative. (they swabbed me again so results will be in next week) there is still a 50/50 chance that I might have herpes but I have a referral for rheumatologist that is the first step. I just have a few questions about medication side effects. The pain is fucking awful, but do the steroids actually work? Have you gotten weight gain? Steroid induced diabetes? These are things that fear me. Thank you so much for your time and if you actually read this. It means A LOT!!!!!!!! Is Behcet\u2019s actually manageable? These past few days i have been living off soup. It hurts to swallow, this has been the worst genital sore of my life. I would really just like some relief. Are there any foods I should avoid? Things like that. My first tango with Behcet's landed me in the hospital for like five days. I had a secondary infection from it and could not eat or drink so I was on IV fluids, pain meds, and steriods. It is the steriods that ultimately helped. As far as food or drink? The only thing I could manage was a little water and super soft scrambled eggs coated in olive oil timed exactly 15 minutes after my pain meds (tramadol) kicked in, followed by magic mouthwash. I had a window of about 5 minutes that I could swallow anything after those (granted my sores went all the way down my throat too). It was unbearable for about 2 weeks, I lost a lot of weight. Peeing in the shower or bath is the only thing that helped with the excruciating pain down below ( lidocaine was minimally helpful) . Total of about 2 months to heal and about six months to be rid of residual nerve pain below the belt. Have a gnarly scar down there too. \n\nManagement? Steriods during a flare and pain meds. That is really it as far as I know. I see a rheumatologist regularly for blood work and checkins because I also developed PSA after that first BD flare. I consider myself incredibly lucky because I have not had a BD flare in over a year but the PSA is currently front and center. \n\nUnfortunately, like with everything else, every body is different. Wow, I totally feel your pain on peeing in the bath or often times I use a water bottle!!! And as for food I have a lidocaine swish and have a 15 min window before it wears off and then I do not want to eat nor talk to anyone. The ulcer I have down there right now is pretty huge and I have no doubt it will leave a scar. Do you mind explaining what PSA is? Psoriatic arthritis. My rheum said that it is not uncommon for one autoimmune thing to trigger another, especially if it already runs in the family (which PSA does for me).\n\nMy gyno said my largest ulcer looked like saddle injuries she is seen from bikes. Started pimple sized but at its largest ulcerated to over 2 inches. Or so they tell me. I never managed the courage to look myself. thank you for your time &amp; explanation! There are foods that make it worse. Google Behcets for a list of what to avoid. My doc has me take Otezla for flares so bad l cannot eat or drink. I only take it for a couple weeks at a time, and only when desperate. Avoid as much stress as you can, delegate, do your best to simplify things. You will get thru this!\ud83e\udd2a The side effects of meds are better than the sores for sure...\n\nI need to be screened for diabetes though, I have not seen my RA in 6 months (She switched practices, and I am having a hell of a time trying to reach them.. arg). \n\nBut for what its worth, to at least get over the flare.. for me prednisone is like a magic cure. Cannot really stay on a high dose for long, but at my very worst, I did 40mg for 5 days, 20mg for 5, 10mg for 10, 5mg for 20.. then I pretty much live on 2.5mg most of the time.. I can drop it for a month maybe (psyc effects are a real bitch tho for me), but these days, I just start at 10mg when a flare starts.\n\nI had a sore between my legs the size of a quarter when I was finally diagnosed and started the Prednisone, and it and my mouth ulcers were mostly healed over (pain free) in like 3 days, and gone within a week to 10 days.\n\nLong term use is not pretty, and hopefully we find something else to keep them at bay, but short term it was absolutely worth. Hey I have PSA and Behcets too!  The TNF inhibitor is supposed to help with Behcets but idk if it is an approved treatment for it like it is for PSA Do not worry it it is actually controllable. You will get the right meds and you will learn how to live with it. In terms of food, I have noticed eating a lot of sugary things can set my mouth ulcers off. Same with sour sweets We have almost the same exact story.  Misdiagnosed with Herpes until I got a new doc and fortunately they referred me to a rheumatologist.  Started azathioprine a couple months back and it is been fantastic!  I have had a couple episodes where I feel mouth ulcers beginning to form, but then they simply go away over the next couple days.  No adverse side effects yet, except maybe feeling a bit more achey in my joints. how often do you take it? My s/o has Behcets. The ONLY thing that works for him is Remicade. Which is $2,000+ for treatment. He was recently denied through insurance. My baby is suffering. Sores all over his genitals and body. I wish there was something I could do!!!!! Typically they only have you on Prednisone (the steroid) while you are having a flare up. \nBe sure to take good, detailed photos, they are helpful for when you see doctors and you are not having a flare up. \n\nThe worst flare up I ever had, I had 3 genital ulcers, two of which were about an inch long and the width of my pointer finger. It was absolute torture that went on for almost 3 weeks (in which they stuck me on antibiotics because they thought it was a very bad case of bacterial vaginosis which now, makes absolutely no fucking sense. This was before my diagnosis, naturally. Those antibiotics made me vomit for 5 days straight, could not even keep fluids down, which tends to make urine very acidic which made urinating.... Absolute fucking torture). I finally bit the bullet and ended up going to the ER 3 times in 4 days. The last doctor I saw at the ER insisted it was herpes WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT IT even though all of my cultures came back negative. 3 times. He insisted they were ALL false negatives and just left the room. \ud83d\ude44 \n\nNow I have pictures to prove that awful flare up. \nBe insistent with your doctors. You probably do not have herpes. Tramadol and toradol are lifesavers. WOW. Sorry that doctor was so disrespectful to you. That explains why every single new doctor I have had has insisted on more herpes tests, even though every single gyno who has seen my genital ulcers has said that it did not look like herpes. I have had too many herpes tests to count and it is irritating because I have to pay for them and at after over 10 years, and numerous tests, I KNOW this sh\\* are not herpes, but I had to do it again this year because my gyno moved and the new did not believe it would be negative.  So ridiculous and hurtful, they could just look at my medical records and past test results. My faith in doctors is very, very low. When you get ulcers I would highly recommend taking good pictures because it definitely does not look like herpes and be insistent on it. \nI am so sorry for your experience \ud83d\ude14 I was first diagnosed with herpes on my first flare even though my doctor said immediately after seeing things down there \"that does not look like herpes.\" She did a swab, then when it was negative told me to keep taking Acylovir and do a blood test in two months, good chance it was still herpes. Apparently negative herpes tests are fairly common. She did not take me off Acyclovir until a second blood tests 6 months after the first came back negative again. So it took 3 tests and that still did not bring any answers. TBH at this point, I already went 6 months thinking I probably had herpes, and if I could trade, I would. I even went through telling my partner and previous partners that I had it. It sucked, but not as much dealing with doctors who do not have a clue what it going on with you nor the time to worry about figuring it out. Literally everything I have gotten that is helped has been because I did the research and advocated for myself. It should not have to be that way. I have good insurance and go to a supposedly good hospital in a fairly large metro area, it is amazing most of my docs have never heard of Behcet's.\n\nWhatever it is, I hope you find something that helps. Both are manageable. One is just much more common and well known than the other.", "How is your life with Behcet ? Do you feel you have had a before and a after ? \n\nHow frequent do you have ulcers ?\n\nHow swollen do your feet/leg get ? Is it a recurring thing ?\n\nHow long does it take for your ulcers to heal ?\n\nHave you had surgery because of ulcers ?\n\nDo you think a treatment will be invented some day ? 1. Yes, I definitely think of my life in terms of before and after getting sick. For a while, I feel like I was grieving the life I once had and all of the dreams I had for my future. I think this deeply affected who I am today and my outlook on life. \n\n2. I only have oral ulcers and most of them are on my throat. I am not sure if it ever goes away or if I keep on getting new ones. I have them on my throat 24/7 at this point. Sometimes I have some on my mouth and they usually last some days or some weeks, it dependes. \n\n3. My knees and feet usually swell a bit. It was my first symptom actually. My feet got so swollen that I could not even fit my shoes and it was so painful and limiting, i could barely walk. \n\n4. Never had surgery because of the ulcers. The most invasive thing I had was a colonoscopy and they found ulcers on my intestine. \n\n5. I do not believe in any magic treatment or cure. I believe that maybe if there is more money invested that scientist can come up with new medications with fewer side effects. Have you tried with TNF-alpha inhibitors? Since I started my Adalimumab treatment I have not had any symptoms. This does cause some fatigue, but I had fatigue from BD anyways so it is not much of a difference. Yes I tried it but I had a paradoxal reaction and I had to stop it immediately. \nMy doctor said I have refractory behcets so I am not sure on what to think anymore and I am losing hope on finding a medication that helps me. So you never stopped having ulcers in your throat up to this day ? How do you manage to speak and eat ?\n\nCan you tell me how you cured your swollen feet and knees ? Can you do sports now ? \n\nThanks for your replies which are very insightful. I suspect I have this condition too and I am trying to document myself. In the beginning, I had more ulcers on my mouth and tongue but eventually they started appearing on my throat. Occasionally I still get them on my mouth but it is not as severe as it was. Honestly, I am kind of used to it, it is painful to eat most of the times so I drink a lot of water during the day and while eating. \nI did not cure my joints, they are still really achy and it is hard to do exercises, so no sports for me. My doctor only recommended swimming but since everything is closed due to covid so no exercise for me. \nIm only 21 but I usually jokingly say that my 96 year old aunt has better legs than me lol. \nFeel free to dm me, I know how lonely and scary this is so we can talk a bit, I can share more abo my experience and you can share yours too. Are these the only treatments you have received? There are a number of biological and chemotherapeutic drugs that, used alone or in combination, may be of help. A local treatment such as frequent doxycycline or minocycline mouth rinses may help, though it seems very few US clinicians prescribe them. Judicious use of lidocaine viscous can make eating far more tolerable. Have you been offered any of these treatments (including a wider range of systemic drug treatments)? First of all, I am not on the US so I do not recognize those treatments. \nI have tried so far :\nPrednisone \nColchicine \nHydroxycloroquine \nAdalimumab\nOtezla \nEtanercept \nMethotrexate + otezla + prednisone at the moment but it is not working \nThe TNF alpha biologics do not work with me, I always get weird side effects and I almost died after my second dose with Adalimumab. \nDo you know about other stuff I could try since the TNF alpha biologics are out of the table ? If you do not respond to corticosteroids then their continued use is not only futile but will ultimately prove harmful. One thing BS and psychiatric illnesses have in common is that some clinicians stack drugs that did not work alone and for which there is no rational basis for expecting them to when combined\n\nUnfortunately, the cytotoxic drugs like methotrexate and azathioprine frequently cause adverse effects and both are mutagenic and depending upon your age, circumstances and inclinations pose a reproductive risk.\n\nYou might discuss the use of topical treatments as discussed here:\n\n(\n\n  *\u201cAntimicrobial agents including antiseptic agents and antibiotics are used to control microbial load \\. Two controlled studies with antiseptic agents, listerine mouth rinse \\, and chlorhexidine gel \\ in RAS noted the effectiveness on the pain severity and duration. Triclosan, a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent has been shown to reduce the number of aphthous ulcers in a double-blind cross-over study in RAS patients \\. Antibiotics, especially tetracycline has been widely used in OUs of BD for years. Tetracycline mouthwash (250 mg capsules dissolved in 5mL of water or flavored syrup and held in the mouth for about 2 minutes before swallowing four times daily) decrease pain severity and duration of OUs. A double-blind trial of tetracycline suspension showed significant reductions in ulcer duration, size, and pain in RAS patients \\. A recent study \\ assessed 0.2 percent minocycline and 0.25 percent tetracycline aqueous solution mouthwash in patients with RAS in a clinical randomized crossover trial. Minocycline mouthwashes as compared to topical tetracycline rinses resulted in significantly improved pain control, by reducing the severity and duration of*\n\n*pain. Cephalexin \\ and penicillin G \\ have also been reported to be effective antibiotics. Sucralfate (1 g/5mL), 4 times daily, for 3-month duration as mouthwash, decreases significantly the frequency, healing time, and pain of OUs and healing time and pain of GUs. The effectiveness of the sucralfate on the OUs frequency and healing time continue during the posttreatment period in decreasing order \\.*\n\n*This compound binds to ulcerated tissue and forms a barrier and augments ulcer healing. Recent controlled studies suggest that pimecrolimus, a topical immunomodulator, twice a day seems to be safe and efficient in the treatment of genital ulcers, by accelerating the healing process and shortening the pain duration \\. Amlexanox accelerate the healing and decreases the pain severity of oral ulcers. It has anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activities \\. Amlexanox is used in oral paste (5%) 4 times daily (after meals and at bedtime) for 4\u201310 days.* \n\n*Anti-inflammatory agents (benzydamine, diclofenac), anaesthetics (lidocaine 2\u20135%, mepivacaine 1.5%, tetracaine 0.5\u20131% gels, or mucosal ointments), and silver nitrate, in general reduce the pain severity of aphthous lesions \\. Recently, beneficial effects of colony stimulating factor on the healing duration and pain severity of OUs and GUs have been reported by our group \\.\u201d*\n\nFWIW, I virtually never use trade names for drugs and the two I mentioned,  doxycycline and minocycline,  are very old and inexpensive antibiotic drugs that are likely available in every country in the world. They work by the same mechanisms and in the case of BS it is thought that their antimicrobial action may be of benefit. However, they are also reasonably potent inhibitors of a class of enzymes, the matrix metalloproteinases, which are released from neutrophils and degrade connective tissues and provoke inflammation. This is an example of a treatment that targets the most downstream causative  events in the BS oral ulcer process. \n\nThere is some evidence that some types of BS result (at least in part) from excessive activation of a pathway called mTOR. Drugs like rapamycin and sirolimus inhibit this pathway and there is some very preliminary evidence that they may of benefit in BS. One rheumatologist I have corresponded with is currently trialing 3-5 mg of rapamycin taken once a week on the same day of the week. \n\nThe old and inexpensive anti-diabetic drug metformin seems to be showing some promise in BS-related autoimmune/hyper-inflammatory diseases:\n\n(\n\nThere is a single, low quality report of its use in BS:\n\n( Oh my god thank you so much for such a detailed answer ! \nI am a 21F so fertility is definitely a concern. I never really thought of it but I guess I maybe would like to have kids in the future so I do not want to mess that up. \nI already tried diclofenac and sucralfate and none of them worked. Diclofenac makes them hurt less but it does not help them go away. Mouth and throat ulcers suck but my main concerns are joint pain. I am still very young and I feel like my mobility is getting really impaired. I have trouble walking and I usually cannot even sleep through the night due to my joint pain. Some daily routines are getting affected. For example, I have trouble making my bed due to wrist pain. \nMy doctor told me that we were going to try some new molecule that is effective on refractory arthritis and in joint pain but he is afraid since it will imunossupress me further and it can be risky due to covid, although it is also been used to treat Covid-19 patients. Have you ever heard of it ? He never told me the name and I would like to research it more before my next appointment. \nThank you again for your answer. There have been so many molecules thrown at COVID-19 it is hard to say which one was under discussion. The anti-IL-1 inhibitors anakinra, canakinumab , and gevokizumab come to mind as possibilities:\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nThe majority of the drugs used to treat BS are immunosuppresive. You might consider delaying immunosuppressive treatment until after you have been vaccinated with a COVID variant effective vaccine. Having said that, your youth and sex should provide you with considerable protction against a bad outcome should become infected. I would also not that there is not a lot of evidence that immunosupprssive treatment adversely affects risk of contacting OVID or of having a worse outcome:\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nConversely there a few reports of much increased morbidity and mortality from COVID in some transplant patients. I know the majority of drugs are immunosuppressive and I think methotrexate is one of them. At this point, I have no idea of how is my immune system or if that is even a valid concern.\nHave you ever heard of refractory Beh\u00e7et? My doctor thinks I have that because nothing seems to relieve my symptoms. \nI am reading everything you sent, I have never heard of the anti-IL1-inhibitors. \nMy doctor told me we had to first try a higher dose of MTX because the hospital would not let us go to the other medications while I did not try all of the conventional ones. \nThank you so much for taking the time to give me such detailed answers. Unfortunately, yes, there are cases of refractory BS. I hope you find some treatment that at least reduces your pain and discomfort. Do you have any idea of what can happen in such cases or am I doomed to feel like this until the rest of my life ? I do not know the answer to this question. It is okay. Thank you so much for everything. Hi! First time posting or commenting on here, but worth a share. \n\nI began having symptoms when I was 12 years old, starting with genital ulcers. My birth mother (deceased since I was 7 months old) had a Behcet\u2019s diagnosis when she was 13 (makes sense why I got it passed down to me). \n\nThe first few years were rough, and it was physically and emotionally exhausting. Constant fatigue made me feel like sleeping for days on end when I would have a flair, and it made me feel very send conscious as a pre-teen. For a couple of years, I would have a flair up every day or every other day. If my memory serves me right, I was prescribed a low dose of dapsone daily and prednisone for when I had a flare. By the time I was maybe 18 or 19, they only would occur every few months or in college when I was majorly stressed out. \n\nI am 26 now, and luckily with age the symptoms slowly have dissipated. I credit the strength I had in my teen years to my father, who was very supportive, transparent, and reassuring that it simply was a genetic trait passed from my birth mother before me.\n\nHe expressed to me that years before I was born, he experienced the same routines, symptoms, and pain that it brought to my mother before they had gotten married. \n\nIt was not easy at first (that is for damn sure), but over time, I learned to cope and take care of myself and my behcet\u2019s to the best of my abilities. When they found ulcers in your intestines were you having GI symptoms? What symptoms do you have? Did you rule out everything else? Usually if all of these treatments do not provide any relief they should start looking for other answers. Yes, I had a lot of cramping and diarrheas, sometimes bloody. They suspected I could have inflammatory bowel disease and that is why I did the colonoscopy. I have mouth and throat ulcers, joint pain on my ankles, knees, hips, wrist, elbow and shoulders.  I also have migraines sometimes. I feel tired and exhausted all the time and it is hard to focus. I still have diarrheas, purple spots that look like a web on my legs, and I developed Raynauld syndrome. \nI did a ton of testing and everything came back negative. My inflammation markers are always a bit high and the genetic test came back positive. \nIm still trying new medications but with no success. My doctor says I have refractory behcets.", "Finding Medical Funding in America Newer to Reddit, and not sure if this is the best community to post in, but does anyone have any tips for qualifying for behcets medical funding in America??? As most of you know, research for the disease is super limited in the states, and my husband and I live just above the poverty line and have acquired a lot of medical debt that we have been unable to pay off. After a few years of misdiagnosis, we finally got his diagnosis last year. He really needs to see a neurologist, but getting his diagnosis alone was too expensive of a bill for us... Any tips for finding medical grants or medical budgeting would be super helpful! Check with your local hospital. Most have charity care programs based on your income. You may have to reapply every 6 months to continue to qualify, but they are usually VERY nice and it is just a little bit of paperwork. Also, depending on your state you may wishlist for medical assistance during the months when the bills exceed your income etc. Thank you for this! It is extremely helpful :) I have no idea what word got autocorrected to wishlist, but I guess it works!", " Do you use a Fitness Tracker? Does it help you with your Chronic condition? Survey  all feedback appreciated", "New to BD, any and all suggestions welcome My boyfriend for sure has behcets, he is had every single symptom and just recently went through a bad episode of this and today he called to tell me it is coming back. His mouth breaks out sores, same with his genitals, intense muscle aches, fatigue. It goes on for about 2 weeks then goes away. You should see pictures of his mouth during this time, I cannot even believe that this happens to him I feel awful. \n\nWe are in the middle of trying to figure out where to go from here while we go see doctors to get diagnosed. I feel so bad for him and want to help all I can. \n\nWhat do we do to help prevent this? Any foods to stay away from or incorporate? Any medicine doctors prescribe?\n\nPlz help!! Thank you &lt;3 First of all, I am so sorry you are both dealing with this. I am 26 years old and was diagnosed last December. \n\nMedicines - The quickest and most effective short-term treatment is prednisone (a steroid), and will be prescribed by a rheumatologist. For me, prednisone works within 3 days and I instantly feel better. Literally every symptom improves and I feel limitless. But please do read up on it because it has some pretty rough side effects. I got lucky and have not experienced any other than hunger, which I actually benefit from due to frequent appetite shifts. Otherwise I take Colchicine 0.6 daily but just started last month and have not seen much improvement, apparently it can take time for some so we are waiting it out. Prior to colchicine I tried Otezla, which actually works really well for most people with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s, however I had terrible side effects and could not stand it. I also know many patients have success with Remicade. Depending on your boyfriend\u2019s individual needs and symptoms, the rheumatologist may prescribe one of these types of medications. \n\nFood - everyone is different. I started an anti-inflammatory diet last week which many people have suggested. Amazon has many beginner-level anti-inflammatory cookbooks with great simple recipes, and handy lists of foods to avoid and foods to consume. Google does as well. Start taking note of everything he eats when he feels sicker, and try to notice his triggers over time. Many people will suggest cutting out dairy and gluten, but again it is different for everyone. I cannot tolerate lactose but bread is my best friend. \n\nBest of luck and feel free to reach out directly with any questions. It gets better, but it can also be tough. You found an awesome community of kind and wise humans so you are off to the best start! I am so so grateful for you right now thank you so much For me, prednisone is way more efficient when I use it preventively, when I feel I am about to have mouth ulcers (it works in 1-2 days while if I wait, it takes more 3-5 days). But since you should not use it often, a doctor gave me clarelux gel, which is less effective but still helps. \n\nAs for colchicine, I took 1mg every 2 days and it was not enough: I still had mouth ulcers, sometimes for what I ate / drink, sometimes without known reason. I now take colchimax (basically 1mg of colchicine + other medicines to help with side effets) and this is better. \n\n(I am in France so the medicines may be different, depending of your country). \n\nAbout food, the whole food plant based helped me A LOT, especially before I got medicines, and I am still following it whenever symptoms are showing. Vice versa: processed food, fat, salt, sugar and cheese definitely trigger them, and beer as well. Sadly, as u/myspeckledface said, it is different for everyone so he will have to figure out what he can and cannot eat. \n\nAlso, until he can get a proper treatment, I found out that doing a mouthwash with bicarbonate was numbing my mouth enough so I could eat. But TBH I do not know if this is a good advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope he will be able to see a doctor fast, and good luck to both of you! He needs to go to an eye doc ASAP to check inflammation in his eyes. If he is in a bechets flare there is a high chance of him having uveitis. The criteria for bechets is now eye inflammation, reoccurring mouth ulcers and/or skin lesions more then twice in a years span. \n\n\nHe might have another disease and needs to see a rheumatologist to determine what it is. There are many medications that can help with the symptoms but no cure. Like stated above prednisone treats the inflammation that can trigger reactions. I am also on Otezla that has been approved to treat mouth ulcers on label and skin lesions off label. \n\nGood luck!! This is a journey and it is a hard one. Rare diseases take an average of 4 docs and 5 years to properly diagnosis. Keep a symptom log and food log as detailed as possible with at least the following info: \n1) Pain Scale  (where, intensity eh, burning sharp, numbing sore) \n2)Ulcer Tracking (take pics of these and the whole life cycle where ever they are!! Body, testes, mouth anywhere) track size and severity \n3) Food journal \n4) fatigue/energy (1 being cannot keep eyes open - 10 being I can run a marathon)!! \n\nFeel free to message me for anything else \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n(Have had symptoms since I was four, diagnosed when I was 12, now 32). You have to stick with the otezla! I was miserable for two weeks but now that I have been on it for 5 months I can imagine life without it. (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is my symptom tracker. It is basic but it will help. Has he seen a rheumatologist? That is the first thing to do. That doctor will then refer you out for other things, like the ophthalmologist, the dermatologist, etc. I used to get the mouth sores something terrible, but now that I have been diagnosed for like 20 years, the mouth ulcers are much less frequent. Carbamide peroxide rinse (GlyOxide is what I use) for the mouth ulcers really helps. Hi :) I am sorry he is experiencing this discomfort. If you suspect Behcets, please go see a Rheumatologist. Behcets is a diagnosis of exclusion,  meaning you have to eliminate all other diseases and display a triad of symptoms. He needs blood work and testing. Many other Rheumatological diseases have crossover symptoms such as: Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, MS, Scleroderma, etc. \nIt took my over 2 years and I saw 9 doctors; something that helped was keeping a health diary of symptoms with pics. Best to you all. Hioe he feels better soon. Find a good rheumatologist.  Oral steroids or topical steroids help with the sores. Stress often is what triggers the outbreaks. Be patient and kind to him as he is most likely frustrated and overwhelmed by his own body turning against him. He probably feels like this is a burden on you and is thinking about his future and how it is not going to be like he always dreamed. Just keep this things in mind. \n\nLittle things like I find that the crest pro health mouthwash makes my mouth numb for an hour or so and that allows me enough time to get some decent food down during that time. \n\nI find hot coffee and tea soothing on the sores but I have heard people say the opposite. Also some people\u2019s sores are triggered by caffeine so keep that in mind. Thank god mine are not. \n\nAlso we are all here for him if he wants to chat, or just bitch a little about behcets. Would you be willing to share what side effects you had with Otezla? I am just about to start it, and it is my first time trying long term meds for Behcets Has Otezla helped with symptoms other than the mouth sores? When I have read about it, it mostly just talks about reducing oral ulcers. I am about to start taking it, but am wondering if it is worth it because my mouth sores are not that bad.. my main complaint is chronic fatigue and frequent low grade fevers, and I am somewhat doubtful the otezla will help with that My personal experience with Otezla was really tough, and I could tell my rheumatologist really hoped it would work, but knew it was not the right fit for me. We tried it twice - first in December with the normal starter pack, I think you get up to 30mg in 3 or 4 days. By day 3 I was in ER with the most intense abdominal cramps I have ever experienced. Nausea and vomiting too. The room was spinning and I felt so confused. All scans were normal, they gave me morphine and took me off the Otezla and my I felt better again within 3 days. Second time around, my rheumatologist dosed me up very slowly. I think I took 10mg for 6 days, then 20 for 3, then eventually 30. Something like that, but I could not work and it was unbearable still after 1 month so we decided to stop. I do hear it works wonders for other people, so it is best to give it a try and keep an open mind. Maybe plan to take it when you know you will have some comfortable time at home (and near a bathroom for most).\n\nBest of luck! \u2764\ufe0f \nalso check out rareconnect.org if your specific questions are not answered here.

Thank you, I really appreciate you sharing your experience! I am so sorry that it did not work out for you. I think his eyes are what I am most concerned about. They have been alright this last time around but the first time in the mornings he could not open his eyes he had so many eye boogers. Like it just had puss and it was all red. I could not believe it.  \n\nThank you so much\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f We are going to see one this week! Thank you so much!! It is only on label for mouth ulcers. Depending on what your fatigue stems from it might not be worth it. It is used for psoriatic arthritis so joint inflammation will lower also which could be causing the fatigue and fever. That is an infection which can lead to inflammation. Do not touch them and use a clean WARM compress for 10 mins then flush out with saline solution until he can get to a doc. No over the counter meds they can lead to worst symptoms. (Eye lubricant like systane is ok) The RA doc should make a recommendation on an eye doctor who specializes in the specific type of inflammation we can get.\n\nTake this appointment very serious, even if he does not have any current eye symptoms. They will be able to establish a baseline and see if there is been any damage already because once the inflammation in the eyes start depending on where it is it can lead to blindness very very quickly.\n\nit is important to note that blindless can be pretty rare but it is good to have a specialist on standby. From what I have read it can be treated as long as it is caught early.", "Any help would be great I have been fighting for thirteen years to be taken seriously by my doctors. I deal with so many symptoms that it has been overwhelming them for years and for a long time it seemed like they thought it was all in my head.

I am currently in excruciating pain and worried I will end up in the emergency room like I did the other day. I keep getting reoccurring mesenteric adenitis and it is so far more painful than it is supposed to be for me and no one can tell me why I keep getting it just amazing to me that I have had blood work off for years and all of these insane symptoms and they are still so many things wrong with me and they do not know why. It is hard to believe that this is happening in 2020 and I know there are other people with issues far worse than mine but if anyone on this entire side could maybe give me some insight I would certainly appreciate it.

If you have not, I would ask over in /r/personalfinance.", "I am an archaeologist and I dunno if I should go on excavations this year because of my medication Ok, so, as the title says, I am an archaeologist. I have been diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et last year, so, thanks to Covid, so far I did not have to face this issue because there were no excavations happening in my country.\n\nBut now with the vaccine and all, things are starting again and I dunno what to do.\n\nI am taking 7mg of Prednisone + 100 of Azathioprine (Imuran).\nMy situation is stable since I started, but I come from my first flare ever that started with meningitis + vasculitis in the eyes that almost took my sight by then. It was very sudden.\n\nI assume you guys do not know how an archaeological excavation goes, but, here, since the financement is scarce, the conditions are not great.\nWe always sleep in shared rooms with 6 or more people, and since many volunteers are young students, we end up mixing everyone around all the time, many more people inside the room etc.\nThis, when we have the luxury of having rooms. Twice it happend that we had to stay in the locker rooms of the municipality public swimming pool. Yes. We slept in the floor, in the place where we also took shower. I live in a hot country during summer (40's\u00b0 C), we spend the day digging under the sun, we eat poorly for the effort, and we keep inhaling dust.\n3 years ago, one guy caught tuberculosis and we all had to be tested. Hopefully no one else caught, but it was luck.\nIt happens that people get sickly, I was once bitten by a spider, there are scorpions, and by the end of two weeks I feel my lungs have more earth than the one I dug up...\n\nI usually loose quite some kg during 2 weeks of work, and by the end I am exhausted. (2 weeks is kind of the standard duration)\n\nI am worried that this is not the best idea for my immune system... Even without covid (which is still an issue of course).\n\nWhat do you people think?\n\nI am worried because I need to do 2 weeks of full work for some credits of my Master's. I cannot have the diploma without those credits. \nShould I ask the doctor some sort of paper?\nI already asked him today what he thinks of course, I am waiting for the reply. But I would like more feedback.\n\n\n\nHope everyone is safe! If I was you - and I am not saying this is necessarily what *you* should do - I would go for it. \n\nArcheology is your passion (I assume. Last time I checked, no one goes into archeology to get rich lol). It is what you want to do. So do it! Behcet's will likely complicate certain aspects of your education/career - but that is not unique to archeology. No matter what you do, Behcet's is going to present unique challenges. I say take some reasonable precautions, but go for it. \n\nI was diagnosed with Behcet's in 1997 at the age of 16 after partial blindness, blood clots in multiple parts of my body, painful oral and genital ulcers, terrible arthritis - and a lot more. My stubborn teenage self made the conscious decision to never let this disease dictate how I live my life. I have stayed true to this decision ever since and I do not regret it for a second. \n\nEven in my late teens when Behcet's was at its worst, I traveled all over the continent playing guitar in a rock band. It certainly was not always easy, but it is what I always wanted to do - so I did it. And I have done all the other things I have wanted to do regardless of my diagnosis. It complicates things for sure. But it has not stopped me and I do not think it should stop you either. \n\nDo not let fear control your life. You will always be left wondering, \"What if?\" Behcet's is scary as shit: you do not have to tell me that. But I would rather not live at all than to live full of fear always wondering what if. \n\nThat is my two cents. Like I said, only you can decide what is the right move for you. But, for me, the right move would be to follow my dinosaur-diggin' dreams. Best of luck to you! Wow, thank you for your reply!! \nI will really consider what you say, because yeah, it is my passion X) I have been doing mostly laboratory work and such, but now it is been a long time without our adventurous diggings, and I really need those credits so I can start directing stuff after. Got some projects in stand by waiting for the diploma, and at 27 I feel like doing them soon. Covid already dragged my master's a lot with all the lockdowns.\n\nI will see what the doctor says, but your answer really helps to clear the head. My family keeps being worried and I end up feeling a bit blocked with all this.\n\nAlso, you seem to have a very cool life btw! And a great way to face things. Bf has a metal band so I am familiar with the travelling, being myself no stranger to it thanks to the excavations. \n\nThank you again! Really helped :) This disease takes so much, do not let it prematurely take something you love away. It is obviously your body and only you know how you feel, but I know if it were me I would want to try and see if my medications are managing my symptoms enough to make it possible to keep doing what I love.\n\nI am biased. Behcet\u2019s took my career from me by taking my fine motor skills and balance. If I had the chance to fight back and do what I loved again, I would. If the worst thing that happens is a miserable few weeks that shows you that your disease has created a need for a career change, then why not try? \n\nI am retraining for another career field, medical research, but I still dream of being back in the laboratory and hospital. It is hard not to be angry and bitter. Still, I tried hard to stay in my field for as long as I could. In the end, I was a liability to patients and my team, so I needed to leave. \n\nI say fight for what you love and do not let the disease pre-determine your destination in life. Perhaps it will not work, and you will need to shift your career path, or at least how you proceed, but I do not think it is possible to know without trying. Thank you for your words! \nI truly appreciate all the support to pursue my dreams while living with this. It is definitely something I will try to always keep in mind.\n\nYour personal experience speaks a lot to me in the sense that I often wonder how will I manage everything. I hope, in spite of  your choices, that you found a way to be happy about what you do, even if it is not your first choice! Besides it must have taken a lot to decide that, it was very responsible and reasonable, but still... \n\nStill waiting for the opinion of the doctor, in the end I will listen to him because so far I am extremely happy with this doctor and he is always very reasonable. If he thinks it is not good, then it is not, and I will try to find a solution...\n Maybe he can write me down a letter and I can try to apply for some excavation where the faculty/ department of archaeology can pay for at least a room for me.\n Last time we talked, he did not seem to like the idea of me sharing accomodations with lots of people, not just because of Covid, but also for all the other more simple stuff I can catch. So I will see. \n\nBut I will definitely try to find a solution, and I will maybe be a bit pushy with the department if it is the case. \n\nThank you for your reply :)\nAnd good luck for your own goals!!", "We have our own awareness day! Cheers to you all! (I would drink, but I have like 8 ulcers in my mouth due to a flairup)  You beat me by 12 minutes haha! I was going to make a post to wish everyone a happy Behcet's Awareness Day.\n\nHappy BDAD my fellow Behcetitors! This disease is wild! Glad to see a community rising to advocate!!", "Oral Cancer Concerns I have noticed that aside from my daily 5-10 mouth ulcers that my gums have been extra red and uncomfortable. In the last two months I have noticed some receding gums. My lower gum line is so sensitive.\nMy entire mouth is swollen and the sores are everywhere, roof of mouth/tongue/gums/cheeks, but this is all normal for me.\n\nI do have a dentist appointment booked, so I am not looking for a diagnosis, but have any of you experienced issues with your gums as a result of BD? Gum disease? Severe receding gums? Oran cancer?", "Can abdominal/full-body exercise lead to a flare-up? I \\ was diagnosed with Behcet's last December. Prior to feeling sick, I was extremely active and worked out 5-6 times per week, including running, pilates, and HIIT.\n\nI paused most physical activity last October, maintaining a light yoga practice and walking/hiking with my dog daily. I started Humira in April and have been feeling significantly better, so I have tried introducing more exercise into my routine but I fear that it is actually doing more harm than good for me. I typically feel better after yoga, but if I ever incorporate basic core/abdominal exercises like crunches, planks and push-ups, I am completely wiped out for about a week. The first signs of my flare up typically appear the next morning and involve extreme fatigue, shakiness, weakness, nausea, loss of appetite, tinnitus, chest tightness and light/screen sensitivity. Even walking the dog feels like too much effort for me. It is a \"flu-y\" feeling that starts off mild but turns pretty severe after 24 hrs.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? I really want to build up a regular exercise regime but it is difficult to maintain when I need 4-5 days to recover. Any advice is much appreciated :) Hi :) I am an Exercise Physiologist and have BD. Behcets an inflammatory disease,  many physiological reaction stem from cytokines.  Cytokines and IL-6 are affected during/post exercise.  Some exercise regimens, especially those at higher intensity may aggravate disease.  Work with your doctor to find something moderate that will allow you to get health benefits of exercise without the inflammation.  Hooe this helps.  Best to you! :) What kind of exercises do you do (as an example of moderate exercises)? I find yoga too strenuous but seated exercises and swimming work well so far Sorry I do not quite share your experience. Behcet's is my working diagnosis. I only had one flare-up. At my worst I remember being asked to sit up in my stretcher then I felt like I ran a marathon (which I have never actually done afaik but y'know presuming). I guess physically I recovered quickly. I remember regularly anaerobically exercising in the hospital without fatigue, except from sleep deprivation from left pinky nerve pain keeping me up. Thank you so much for your response! That all makes sense to me and I will bring it up at my next rheumatologist appointment. In the meantime, can you please share some moderate exercises you personally benefit from? I understand everyone is different but I am looking for inspiration to try new things. Thanks again :) Hi! Just wanted to say I understand you and have same issue. My doctor said it is actually normal and the more intense the workout the more likely to cause flare. But generally speaking he described it as working blood flow throughout parts of your body that do not normally get it (he mentioned the capillaries but cannot remember exact wording sorry). And he also said it was normal for me to feel\nTired the following day as it takes time for it to affect the body I guess. But nothing I can really do. I stopped doing hiit and lifting heavy. I did have a mini stroke before my diagnosis and issues with HBP because of my bechets/fmf. I have a lot of nerve pain down my left arm, so it is why I took up yoga well before I knew I was really sick. And stopped lifting heavy. But still workout ..I love cardio. Just do more endurance focused now as it seems to be less stressful on my body. And power yoga. My advice is to of course talk to your doctor but listen to your body :) exercise for me is such a big part of my life and mental health along with reading. And on days I have bad flares I cannot do either..and it definitely gets me down. But I know others have it worse. And my kids are what keep me riding out the bad days. feel well \ud83d\ude42 Thank you so much for sharing this! I was worried that something deeper was involved, because up until recently, workouts never affected me negatively. But I now understand it is normal and will adjust as needed with my doctor. At least we have yoga!! Idk what I would do without a regular yoga practice. Thanks again :)", "Has anyone LOST THEIR HAIR from colchicine? \ud83d\ude29 My rheum wrote me for colchicine but I have not started it yet and one thing I keep hearing/reading that DISTURBS me is people's hair thinning or falling out from it....\n\nMy luxurious mane is literally the sole buttress of my mental health and I would rather live with untreated Behcet's (or use steroids) than have my hair thinning or falling out. I already have fine hair and my last stylist cut internal layering which long story short, thinned it out a lot more than I wanted. \n\nSo I have to ask, has anyone taking colchicine daily actually had hair loss and how bad was it? My understanding is it can continue falling out for 6 months even if you stop the med.", "I saw this and thought of you...lol  Prednisone is a fucking godsend And also the nightmare of my life! Yeah the side effects can be rough, but damn that recovery is nice It is. However with my job I cannot take it. So I have to use a topical steroid. Including for my mouth sores. Prednizone would be so much easier.", "2nd Pfizer vaccine experience I got my second shot this past Thursday (so grateful!). I felt fine until I went to sleep. I woke up with a 102 fever just miserable. I also had a mouth ulcer. I had that fever for around 24 hours but I woke up with no fever this morning. This evening the inflammation in my chest is back in full swing, but I am otherwise fine. Hopefully the inflammation will die back down soon, but I sort of expected it with my immune system ramping up. I take imuran daily. I had to take my colchicine again for the first time today since I got on my current dose of imuran. \n\nSo if you are worried about getting the shot, it might knock you down like it did me, but I do not have any truly severe symptoms. You get away with just Imuran most of the time?\n\nI am jelly. I keep playing with my colchicine dosing as it works for the ulcers but my gut does not agree with it at all.\n\nCongrats on the vac dose tho! I have only been on the increased dosage of imuran without the colchicine since the beginning of February, so its still a work in progress. The colchicine was absolutely trashing my kidneys so I cannot stay on it anymore. I was on it for two years. Is colchicine bad for kidneys ? My doctor said 0.5 mg twice a day wont harm your kidneys. I was taking more than that but two of my doctors disagreed about it. When I stopped taking it, my kidney function improved. I was at an eGFR of 48 on the colchicine and I was back up to 70 off of it. Colchicine is basically a prescription NSAID, like Advil/ibuprofen, which is also not great for kidneys since it is where it is filtered! I did not know this either until I asked my doctor.", "Otezla for my mom Has anyone taken Otezla for stomach ulcers? Asking for my mom who gets debilitated by stomach ulcers. Any other advice would be helpful as well. She gets mouth and stomach ulcers to the point where she will not eat and cannot get out of bed.\n\nThanks! I took otezla for oral and stomach ulcers and it helped me although the side effects were pretty bad. Thanks for the reply what are the side effects?", "Behcets in the UK - Anyone been to the Behcets Centres of Excellence? Looking for feedback Hi everyone,\n\nI am planning to move to the UK in the next few months (Covid restrictions permitting) with my family. \n\nI have a confirmed BD diagnosis, and I am looking for feedback on the NHS centers of excellence for BD. From what I can see online there are 3: London, Liverpool and Burmingham.\n\nWe are planning to live in Wales, so I am open to any of the 3 as choices as I will have to drive there regardless. I just wondered if anyone on here had any experience in any of the centers ?? I would love to know this for myself, I am moving to London and have the same thoughts. Do you live in the UK currently and are moving to London or are you outside the UK? If you dont mind me asking.. I have lived in and around London since I was diagnosed 7 years ago and have attended the clinic in London for the past 6 years.\n\nWhat is it that you would like to know?\n\nWhen you first attend the clinic is when you will have the most contact as they will look to fully understand your specific symptoms and make sure that you are continually tested for you symptoms to ensure they are under control through medication.\n\nI now attend the clinic once every 6 months where I fill in a form regarding sleep, another regarding ulcers and another regarding mental health and thoughts about Behcet's. Each clinic visit you are offered the opportunity to talk to a mental health professional.\n\nThe staff are extremely friendly and approachable, from the reception staff to the head of the clinic. They are all very knowledgeable about the disease and always willing to put the patients care ahead of anything else.\n\nFor example, I am currently on Humira injections and have been for a few years which stabilise my symptoms. A couple of years back the top down instruction was to move a lot of patients onto a different, cheaper, medication. In order to do this they always try to invite you to the clinic in person to talk about this. Instead the professional I was talking to did not like the immediate results of the change of medication on other patients and insisted I stay on Humira so that I did not relapse. The other medication ended up not being uptaken in the clinic due to relapse rate.\n\nAttending the clinic in London though can vary in terms of time depending how busy the clinic is. I have sometimes been in and out of the clinic within a few hours, some times I have had to wait for 4 hours before being seen. It varies due to staffing, but the care given is always fantastic. Thank you so much for your reply. \nI guess I just wanted confirmation that patients have positive experiences at the centers. Where I am from, there is nothing even remotely like that, and most doctors have never even heard of Behcets. I cant get my medication here either, it has to be shipped to me from the US. \n\nSo, moving to the UK and having the opportunity to have not 1, but 3 centers specifically dedicated to BD is amazing to me. Just didnt want to get my hopes up. \n\nSounds like your experiences have been positive! \nI wonder if anyone else has been to the centers in Liverpool and Burmingham?? \n\nWould love to know if any one is better than another... I do not think any one is better than another as they all have the same resources and the same sway.\n\nI believe the London centre however is the largest and I can only speak highly of all of the medical professionals there.\n\nI understand that symptoms differ, but the team at London have always been very receptive to my feedback as well as adaptive to my medication requirements or flare ups. They are very quick to refer to a specialist or request scans as they very much operate under a 'better safe than sorry' motto.\n\nSorry to hear about your current situation, hopefully being in the UK will help you live a better quality of life! Thank you! It is very reassuring to hear that you have had such great support there. \nIt sounds as though they really work together as a team, which is so important and must make the process of getting treatment right much easier than what I have to deal with here - different doctors and specialists in completely separate parts of the country, who are not familiar with the nature of BD. \n\nReally appreciate your feedback and hope you stay well!", "High dosage of Cortancyl ? Hello, so I would like to know if anyone has used this ed before, called Cortancyl  \n\n\nSo I am 27, I did Cerebral MRI, th result was that I have some lesions in my brain, in the right side, and I feel like my left side is not okay ( Hand hurts, moves on it own sometimes like I get an electric shock or something, weakness in left side ), and MRI says it is some kind of Vascularitis, and I checked a Neuro, she said that this has to be treated but do not seem to be so dangerous, it is just few spots, almost same thing said by the internist but the medication she gave me is just not normal to me .. I feel like I do not trust her because of the bad reviews I have seen in Google..   \n\n\nSo she asked to do some blood tests and most of them were normal, nothing seems to be bad ( antibodies ), but she asked me to pick 3 pills of 20mg Cortacyl ( 60mg ) in the morning, those values to me are shocking, I really do not understand if this is a mistake or this is the right treatement, that is why I am here to check with you, to check with people who had Vascularitis to telll me if they started with high dose of this med or something similar, .. is this normal ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny idea about the subject would be much appreciated.  \n\n\nI am still not a confirmed Behcet guy, but my uncle had it and my grandma as well and we had similar symptoms, so mostly I have Behcet disease, I am waiting for results this coming week", "Report on havinh behcets and testing positive for Covid I thought it may be helpful so...\nIn my case I started showing symptoms on the 14th, some days after my mother. Headache and sore throat. I started feeling fever symptoms and my temperature was at 37C\u00b0 on the 16th. On the 17th I went to the hospital and got tested. Yesterday the tesults came out and I tested positive. Over these days I only had sore throat, congestion, headache and neck pain. I do not have fevers since Monday. I had throat/mouth ulcers since yesterday (not Behcets ones). I think I am almost recovered by now, except for the ulcers my throat does not feel that bad and I am a bit congested. Overall it felt very similar to Behcets+Cold so you guys should look out for symptoms, if you believe it is not your normal Behcets (in my case I can tell by neck inflamations) it would be better to go to the doctor and check it and be careful with people around you. I will update if I need to. Stay safe zebras!! Do not be surprised if after you fee a bit better you regress a bit. I have muscle aches over two months later. Thank you both for sharing. I have come down with something and was not sure if i should go to the doctor to get tested for covid if i did not have loss of smell. Now i know i should go in anyway. Thank you for sharing! I have been super terrified of catching covid with my behcets. Thank you! I would be scared if it happened suddenly. That is good! Stress and anxiety seem to be common and big triggers for behcets so the most chill you are about it the best it will be for your health! Hard to be chill about it when your doctors say things like \"bad outcome\" and \"will not recover\" \ud83d\ude2d", "I do not have a diagnosis After my first episode of genital ulcers, nose ulcers, headache  and the baddest of all, joint pain,  that happened in July and ended at the start of October, all these stopped. Now I have 4 months symptoms free. I have no official diagnosis, my blood tests did not show smth else at that time. It could have been an episode of smth else, an infection maybe? Or this pause in symptoms can happen with Behcets ? For me I did not have a diagnosis until my 4th flare up of bad ulcers. Every time I was hospitalized for it and in between the flare ups (every 2-3 months) I was fine!\n\nI believe it is a pause in symptoms and usually is not diagnosed until more than two flare ups It is often a long process of ruling out more common conditions.\n\nWhat sort of testing have you had done, beyond blood work? Blood work in Beh\u00e7ets patients can show elevated markers pointing to inflammation, however many also have blood work that is indicative of nothing/normal.\n\nHave you experienced mouth ulcers? How frequently? Most Beh\u00e7ets patients have recurrent mouth ulcers.\n\nI live in Canada. Since diseases like Chron's are much more common here, I had an endoscopy/colonoscopy first to rule out Chron's, and then I was clinically diagnosed with Beh\u00e7ets based on symptoms (mouth/genital ulcers, skin lesions). My blood work was normal. My blood work ruled out lupus and other autoimune diseases. Ana was always negative, CRP not elevated, patergy test negative. I experienced a single episode of mouth ulcers maybe 2 years ago, that did not concerned me At that time. Another single episode of genital ulcers last summer along with knee, wrist, elbows pain. Genital ulcers dissapered after 3 days and the aches after almost 3 months. I felt very well and energetic during this months Even if the aches were annoyning. I Also had an endoscopy done in 2019, everything was fine.", "Preventing Flares I am 22 y/o and I have been diagnosed with Behcets since I was 18 y/o. But I have had the genital and oral ulcers since I was in middle school. I was doing really well until recently (I had not had a flare of genital ulcers for about 4 years). Around Christmas I started feeling shitty and for the next two weeks I dealt with a cough and then a couple genital ulcers. Turns out I had pneumonia. I used a steroid gel and the ulcers cleared up after about two weeks. Thought I was on the mend but started to get the inflamed vesicles again last night and I am panicking I am getting back on the \"flare-every-two-week\" schedule that I was on before I was diagnosed. \n\nBackground: since August I began really focusing on exercising. I worked out anywhere from 3-5 times a week for about 1 hr and half each time. I do strength training for 45 min and then cardio for 30. Now, right before I got sick I had just started seriously running on the treadmill regularly. I guess what I am asking is, does anyone find a correlation with flares and impact exercises? I have never really talked to anyone else with Behcet's and I am really in the dark about things I can do to prevent flares while also living a healthy, active lifestyle. I loved the strength I felt from working out and especially running, but I have a feeling I am going to have to give it up. I just feel like in order to stay healthy I have to sleep and be a slug. Anyone have any non-medication tips? \n\nI know this post was all over the place, I am just excited to talk to people who have what I have...Thanks for reading.  I am a personal trainer, I powerlifting, and I do cardio regularly. I was just recently diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. I have found no correlation between exercise and flares. This is just my opinion, but two things I would consider are that the holidays are super stressful which probably lowered your immune system, in turn making you susceptible to the pneumonia. Which both having an infection, and being stressed by themselves can cause flares. Staying active with diseases like this is very important. If you are not feeling well it is perfectly fine to scale back but exercise has never caused a flare for me.  I would not think that exercise is related to a flare but then again, I do not know what causes my flares either. I think exercise overall tends to do more good than harm for most illnesses though. Plus, if you feel good while doing it the. It is beneficial to your mental health too! \n\nIt is really frustrating dealing with the pain of those ulcers &amp; not knowing how to get relief or what is causing them. I think that is just the shitty part of Behcets. \n\nHave you tried any biologic drugs like Humira or any of the other drugs used to treat Behcets? There is quite a few that would be worth a try for you! \n\nGood luck to you!  Thank you! I am currently on azathioprine and colcrys. They have done their job so far.  Thank you! One of the first things that my dad showed me when I was diagnosed was a Olympian with Behcets. I had to stop soccer because of my flares but it is nice to hear that there is hope to stay active with the disease!  My friend has Behcet's and I exercise (heavy weightlifting/powerlifting) with him regularly and it has not caused him any problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, my friend has been free of flare ups for a year due (disclaimer: we think!) to his daily supplementation with White Maeng-Da Kratom. It is a natural plant that helps reduce inflammation. Do some research, it could help! And it is better (disclaimer: probably!) than pumping yourself full of steroids and random \"medical\" chemicals. 17/m diagnosed 3 years ago. I am pretty active, I have swam and ran for most my life. I have never had any correlation between excessive and flares. For me it is almost 100% dietary, more sugar=more sores. That is interesting! I have never even thought to look at that, is it carbs too or just simple sugars?  Simple sugars by far have the biggest effect, but carbs do affect it, just nowhere near as much. Do you have a gram limit you go by or is it just monitoring it?  I definitely just feel it out. If I have too much I usually start to feel a little sick the day before the sores start showing up. I have found my Beh\u00e7ets flares up when I begin a new exercise regime. I have found it is better to do little and often rather than try and kill it in the gym. ", "Does anyone\u2019s uveitis look like this? ", "Does anyone else here get sores like these? These keep coming back every month or so. This time around I also have a flu :/ Day 10 and still spreading. Anyone else have similar symptoms ?  My loved one (the reason I am on this subreddit) gets these absolutely horribly. Everytime he has a flair up they come back on a bigger area of his mouth. Just this past time they were these gigantic things on the outside of his mouth too. Super sorry you are dealing w this. I usually buy him some low sugar kefir (the drinkable yogurts) to try to keep some calories in him because it is so painful to eat. Thanks for your response I am just looking for some idea of what other people are doing to manage :/ eating is really rough at the moment but yogurt burns the sores so I am trying to stay away from it. I am hoping someone will have found some treatment that works for them that maybe I can try also. I have tried all types of vitamins and medications to no avail. It seems the thing that helps most is time. Waiting it out and managing with positivity in the meantime. Let your husband know he definitely is not alone! That helps me out just knowing that other people are also dealing with these things.  Have you tried the \u201cmagic mouthwash?\u201d If not is really recommend it. It is got lidocaine, liquid Benadryl,(the drinkable kind) and some kind of antacid I believe. Sorry I cannot be more specific. You can also ask your doctor for a prescription for the stuff. It numbs your mouth and as a result you cannot taste anything, but it will let you eat until your mouth is healed. Yea I have got that and straight lidocaine as well. It is the most helpful treatment for me to manage the pain. The only issue is the pharmacist will not always make it the same. Also it wears off pretty quickly :/ it is just really hard to properly swish when my mouth is this irritated :/ I am trying to figure out what I can eat and what I can use for pain. So far it is just slowly and lightly swishing the mouthwash and sticking to soft veggies for the most part. I have had these sores on and off for about 5 years now. The methods I take to treat them vary on the severity of the ulcers. I just wonder what other people are doing. Seems like most people do the same thing. I am hoping someone has found a particular vitamin or medication that has helped them.  Yea, and I have been told (and totally noticed) that any time you get sores on the back of your throat like that that you will experience flu like symptoms from them. I have had tonsillitis almost once every other month for years now and it always starts with a large sore on my throat. I am currently having a rough few days with a dozen or smaller sore scattered about my mouth, I do not do anything for them besides take Tylenol 3 for the pain, I have had them since I was 2 and I have tried all the \u201cremedies\u201d but nothing really helps. Awe man you have been dealing with this longer than I have. The flu like symptoms you mention are the icing on the cake. The pain from the sores is one thing but the weakness and sweats are really demoralizing. Thanks to everyone for sharing with me. I tend to have these flare ups every 4-6 weeks. I am going to start logging these flare ups more often. The feedback makes me feel safe if that makes any sense. Instead of freaking out about feeling so sick, I feel more like myself and have faith in knowing I will be well soon. Hope you guys are feeling the same. This is one of those things that just sucks.  For me personally, I usually do not get them to badly, and also just use the mouthwash right before I eat so I can get in some calories before it wears off. It works pretty well but I have had the same problem where the effects are very short lived. Sores finally healed yesterday. I am ulcer free for now and hoping this new gluten free diet will keep them at bay for a while :/ we will see and I will continue to post flair ups if they return. If anyone else sees the posts and is also having trouble feel free to pm.  I tend to get these sores and they last for about two weeks. My doctor put me on Colchicine - I take it as soon as I feel them popping up, usually in the back of my throat. It is the only thing I have tried so far that helps or shortens the duration of the whole thing. I have dealt with them for almost 11 years now.. so I understand. Often also accompanied by a high fever. Macaroni &amp; cheese is all I can eat when it gets that bad. And plain milk.. but blech. Im here if that shit ever gets really difficult for you to stomach my friend. I have been to UPENN and Leon Smith also a Dr. Weber in NJ. Neither of them specialize in behcets but they are all very experienced physicians and helped me with diagnosis. It seems to be very difficult to diagnose behcets because of its rarity. However I seem to find the best help from talking to others who experience similar symptoms. I agree that Mac and cheese is an awesome way to get food into my system! When the sores are as bad as they get it becomes increasingly difficult to eat anything at all. My symptoms tend to last for about 20 days and then I am back to eating regularly. The problem is I wind up with gastritis from the Advil and excessive antibiotics and antivirals also the nystatin ( antifungal ) .. I use valtrex and anti biotics to prevent infection during these times as my immunity is low : / I am now dealing wi h gastritis after my thee week flair up :/ thanks for posting so that we can share our experiences. It is rare so it is good to hear that other people have been fighting this. I am hoping my next flare up is at least 4-6 weeks away. Hopefully I do not get another flare up but it is most certainly on it is  way. Feel free to PM me and please keep me posted if anything helps specifically. ", "Brushing tips? I have had multiple sores in my mouth every single day for 20 years. I have learned all the tricks but I just cannot find a way to brush with out awful pain and gum destruction. A mouth rinse, water pick, soft cloth.\n\nMaybe you have found a way? I have had some recent success with a sulca brush. It has small, angled heads that I have been managing to brush a bit without hitting sores. It is mostly for the gum line but it is been helping. I use a very soft toothbrush  and mostly when i hace sores i used a mouthwash  that is made to reduce the ulcers. It is  called hyalugel. Do you avoid toothpaste with SLS? Toothpastes with SLS hurt and sting more. Also not sure if you have looked into it but Oracort is great in healing ulcers, cuts the healing time by half at least. Unfortunately it is something you need a prescription for though I have never heard of Oracort. I will get looking into it right away! I use a tooth brush that is meant for children/babies so it is very soft. I also get a magic mouthwash prescription when I have sores so that helps to numb my mouth significantly while I brush. Crest pro health mouth wash makes my mouth numb enough for about five min so that I can brush. Oh this is great to know! Is that mouthwash the same as magic mouthwash? Not sure I never heard of magic mouthwash", "Autism - Brain Disorder ", "Unsure about provisional diagnosis Hi, my rheumatologist recently ran some tests for my persistent mouth ulcers (~ 3 years) and having ruled out several other auto-immune illnesses, has provisionally diagnosed me with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease.\n\nHowever it seems like with just one symptom and no occurrences of anterior uveitis or genital ulcers, I am not so sure about the diagnosis and was wondering if anyone here has experienced something similar (and finally gotten a more confirmatory diagnosis) The issue with behcets is that there is not any real black and white testing. There is being HLAb21 positive, but I hear that is more or less likely depending on your ethnicity and even then is not 100% one way or the other. \n\nI have the dx and I doubt it sometimes, but my rheumatologist is willing to treat my symptoms so I do not really care what we call it, to be honest. I did not find out that my gastroenterologist suspected Behcet\u2019s until I looked over notes seven YEARS later. He suspected it at 21 and I was diagnosed 6 years later. The thing is, rheumatology was never told, nor was I, at the time. If GI had told rheumatology their suspicions, I likely could have been diagnosed sooner. \n\nMy whole point is, be patient but track all symptoms you have. Something you think is not a rheumatological issue very well could be. While your case may not exactly be Beh\u00e7ets I would the symptoms are similar, then the cure will most likely also work.\n\nSince there is no clear cut diagnosis possible, I would the symptoms look enough like a BD you get diagnosed, and that means that following the cure your symptoms will most likely get better. Like u/elq3 said, it really does not matter what they call it. Try some drugs to see if they work. If so they can call it whatever they want.", "Is Behcet Disease related to region? Hello Everyone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was first diagnosed, I started looking for the disease. Professor Hulusi Beh\u00e7et from Turkey was a dermatologist who first diagnosed the disease. The biggest distinguishing feature of the disease is that it is seen around the silk road.\n\nI wondered where you are from. Are you related to slanting eyes like us? :) I am first generation Italian American. My ancestors are primarily Irish. I was born and raised in Kentucky USA. I am Cajun French from America and a little bit of German. I have read that behcets is common in Eastern European Jewish populations I am about 75% from the UK and 25% Russian My Grandpa is Croatian. Yep I have Silk Road heritage and Behcets 99% northwestern European heritage here, but perhaps that 1% Spanish comes through in me through Behcets. That, or the fact that I lived in Japan for a number of years as a child? Perhaps there is an environmental influence at play. Kentucky import here! Hi neighbor. \ud83d\ude01 No ME history for me. Also negative for HLA-B51 and HLA-B27. I am leaning towards the proposed staphylococcal infection theory. From Boston of Irish and Portuguese ancestry. And if you are interested, I wrote an article about Hulusi Behcet: ( Hey there! Far Western Kentucky here! I am in Lexington. \ud83d\udc99 Wooo! Cincinnati! I read it. Thank you for it. I am hoping to move to NKY area this fall!! Second generation Italian American with a hint of polish You are very welcome! I am from West Virginia and had Behcets many years before dx. Did my dads DNA and it goes back to Turkey. But it is way back.Also look into Melungeon ancestry in Appalachia.", "Trying to spread awareness on Behcet's Disease &amp; my movement disorder. ", "Heart problems? I have a family history of behcet\u2019s and was diagnosed about two years ago. I recently had to come off my methotrexate because my doctors suspected I had COVID. It is been six weeks and this last week I have been having bad reynauds, mouth/vaginal ulcers (which I have not had for two years), heart palpitations, pounding heart, migraine, increased resting heart rate, and high blood pressure. Has anyone ever had heart related symptoms from behcets? I am trying to figure out what course of action to take. Thanks! I have had those same heart and blood pressure symptoms. They will usually last for a month or two but they will not be present the entire time, it is more like the symptoms come and go randomly within a 2 month window. I have had an ekg done before but the timing was off and I was not having any symptoms during day of the appointment. Recently my doctor has been throwing around the possibility that I have polymyositis. Both reynauds syndrome and similar heart issues can be attributed to polymyositis, though I think breathing problems (which I also have on-and-off) are a more common symptom. I think they have several ways of verifying if you have it, MRIs, EMGs muscle biopsy...\nNext time my heart goes crazy I am going to try get tested for it I hope to god they do not need to biopsy me haha I am so sorry that happens to you! I had an ekg done and it had all sorts of things wrong. I have a congenital heart condition called long qt type 2. But these symptoms are new and different. I also have SLE, scleroderma, hypothyroidism, interstitial cystitis, asthma, sjorgren\u2019s, raynaud\u2019s, etc. I am hoping to have a ecg done this week, but my resting heart rate jumping is scary. Maybe you should ask for an ecg so they can catch it? I am just trying to figure out what is causing the heart stuff. I have never heard of polymyositis. Is it related to Behcets? Have not had them myself, but given that Beh\u00e7et's is a vasculitis, it seems reasonable it might also affect the heart. I didnt attribute these to Behcets but I do have additional heartbeats which I dont even feel, but were picked up during heart monitoring, as well as occasional palpitations and chest pain (pericarditis) intermittently that I have lived with for as long as I can remember.\n\nI guess anything that ends in -itis can be a symptom of Behcets? If it is an overall inflammatory disease.. Talk to your rheumatologist and maybe schedule a Cardiology appt? Although VERY rare, I had a coronary aneurysm that did not respond to any treatment, had to have a bypass. I am not trying to fear monger, since again, it is very rare, but with vasculitis you never know. If you are having active inflammation (ulcers) you should get a checkup, maybe some imaging? They found my coronary aneurysm almost by chance with a full body MRI that was done to check the progress of OTHER anurysms and clots I had all over. I am any case, definitely discuss this with your doctors! I had an ekg and it flagged some things so I have to get an ecg done. They did I d-dimer and I was not having a clotting problem. My rheumatologist knows what is happening too. But with COVID they are only seeing me over zoom. Do you think a d-dimer would rule out a coronary aneurysm? I think I am going to get a referral to a neurologist too. I have migraines and I think that might be part of the issue too. Right? And it can lead to vascular disease. So I am just trying to sort it out. My whole life I have had palpitations. Makes you wonder...How much research is out there on Behcets anyway? This is difficult for me to answer because I do not want to scare you, but this aneurysm did not respond to any treatment, and my blood work was normal when they realized I had it. I was not having active inflammation anymore but the aneurysm had been there and just had not responded to the methotrexate, prednisone, infliximab.... So it did what aneurysms tend to do and kept growing. When they found it they realized they had seen it before in older imaging but it was just so big they thought it was a congenital malformation. They put me back in a bunch of meds only for that because I had zero symptoms after a year of very intense treatment for everything else I had initially. None of these meds worked and it kept growing, and since I really had no inflammatory markers they decided to do the surgery. I am NOT saying you have a coronary aneurysm too, but Behcet's is a very complicated illness, it can pretty much affect your whole body and it presents in so many different ways. You are having what seems to be cardiac and/or neuro symptoms so I would talk to the rheumatologist and ask them to refer you to a cardiologist they have worked with. It is always best when your medical team can communicate easily My cardiologist did look at my ekg and said it looked fine to him. I have long qt 2 so my ekg is always off but it had new stuff flagged when they gave me the print out. But my rheumatologist is asking my cardiologist to order a heart monitor. I had a chest X-ray that was clear, but no other imaging. I might push my cardiologist a little bit more and maybe ask for a sonogram. I doubt they will let me get an mri without a good reason though. I have been off my methotrexate for almost two months because they thought I had covid. I had all the symptoms of covid. I have so many things going on it is hard to speculate. I just wish I had my own lab/radiology department.  I just need some tests run to rule out some stuff. But you know how that works in medicine. I hear you! I have had sonograms for monitoring after surgery and that seems to work fine so that is certainly something worth mentioning. I am feeling a little conflicted in sharing because I do not want you to get too scared from my experience; especially since this illness is very much influenced by stress. But I think if you keep talking to your doctors and advocating for yourself you will get to the bottom of this. I have been through a lot so I do not usually panic or jump to conclusions about my health, so do not worry about that. I understand it is a super unlikely thing, but a possible thing. Just something I will have them rule out. I am self-aware about stress and meditate a lot. I am not a person who self-diagnoses off of google and freaks or anything. I appreciate your concern and I will just make sure they tic that box off along with everything else. Unlikely, but possible. Last night I took an imitrex for the migraine and my bp and heart rate stayed much lower and hardly any pounding symptoms. Which makes me think maybe it is a migraine thing. Thanks for all your suggestions and help!", "anxious for advice I came to terms with thinking I have hsv2 now but I am starting to second guess\u2026So after some risky sex I started getting genital OBs. (Have had hsv1 since childhood) Never pustules just acute ulcers. Took a hsv2 blood test which was negative, dr said it did not look like herpes \u201cby nature\u201d but I have learned it is pretty a misunderstood diagnosis so I have taken it at face value. 8 weeks after exposure I took another blood test. Came back positive but my igg levels were 0.0 . Dr said it was a false positive. However I get outbreaks pretty much monthly so with the positive test results I bit the bullet and accepted. My first disclosure ended up as a relationship so I did not bother getting retested. I was pretty lax with the valtrex and he did not care about sex during OBs. They are fairly painless just annoying. \n\nWe broke up and I am getting ready to date again. Going to get retested for HSV2 but reading up on behcets \u2026 dare I say I am hopeful. Every so often my eyes will get incredibly bloodshot, and will not subside. First time it happened I thought it was pink eye from hell but nothing worked to get rid of it and I did everything I mean EVERYTHING to get rid of any pink eye bacteria. it never weeped or oozed. as a kid my eyes would constantly water. Used to get upset when I first started wearing makeup , would last like 10 minutes lol. To this day I have pretty frequent ocular pain when I try to look side to side, was told this could be my astigmatism. \n\nI get acne like bumps all over my body, never thought much of it. Cannot tell them apart from pimples until I try to pop them and they are so much worst after that. Thought it was a weird type of acne but I am almost 30 now. Wake up with mild ulcers on tongue / soft palette thinking it is a food problem every other month, goes away quick and they are not severe. I have psoriasis, sometimes starts as pustules on my legs that spread and scar , sometimes stems from a wound (satellite patches from surgical scars) \n\nI have a history of excruciating migraines, diagnosed anxiety, depression and eventually bipolar disorder. I have had a lonnnnggggg history with GI / digestion problems. In and out of hospitals as a kid, now I just buck up as my tentative diagnosis was GERD and the medication is linked to cancer. Hospitalized for Ovarian cysts (fever so high they have thought it was appendicitis and was prepped for surgery , twice) episodes of localized extreme abdominal pain, felt like I was being shot over and over. ER could not find anything responsible (morphine helped). Arthritis runs in my family pretty rampant + my psoriasis (psoriatic arthritis) so I do not pay much attention to it knowing I am just going to have it and that is that. I get super fatigued, like the thought of getting out of bed sometimes feels like backpacking the Appalachian\u2019s but I attribute this to my depressive episodes. as a kid I had utis and pneumonia like a tag team. This has subsided as an adult but I know how to avoid the uti (does not always work) \n\nDoctors have wrote off my pain my whole life. For fear of sounding like a hypochondriac or being considered   weak and not pain tolerant I avoid doctors like the plague(ironic, innit) but looking back on my medical history I am like\u2026 wtf . I know my pain and experience is real. It is all to finally discover it all might be related? From suggesting I am psychosomatic, to being shamed for my sexual choices, told by an obgyn if I got another X-ray/CT she would not see me anymore because my ovaries would rot, to being told i must be unhygienic (I am a clean freak btw) \u2026 frankly I have not had a primary care doctor since I was like 20. I will not be condescended anymore. Im so dismissive about it I do not really even think about it but now I am pissed lol. But I do not want to go through the painful diagnosis process - seems like the more you bring to them, the less likely you will get a good outcome \n\nWhat made me even come here is I saw a couple articles about behcets patients being extremely irritable upon waking up. It is like a running joke among my family and partners that I am a heartless person my first 5 minutes of the day. I have made grown men cry, people. It is bad. I may have read these articles wrong but I scoffed when I read it. I would be sold based off that alone. \n\nLastly to note, my ex never once got an ob and as mentioned we would have sex during mine. I kind of summed it up to the thought that he might already have it and that is why he was so chill about it in the first place.", "My mouth hurts. Sores everywhere. Tongue hurts and is swollen. That is all. Chloraseptic, for immediate relief. L-lysine, for recovery of the skin. Speedy recovery, friend! Talk to your doc about otezla. I was like that for years.  Started taking otezla and boom I have had one mouth sore in the four months I have been on it and it was a tiny one that lasted for a day or so", "It Takes a Village to Diagnose this Disease  \n\nI was diagnosed with this disease almost two years ago. I have a rare form of it that has caused chronic inflammation in my heart and two heart attacks. Like many of you it was not a straightforward path to a diagnosis, more like a maze with more dead ends \nthan paths forward and finally a plausible answer. Mine was diagnosed through a colonoscopy and confirmation of aphthous ulcers in my GI tract. My history with autoimmune related symptoms goes back to my childhood, but as the symptoms escalated  I reached a point where I refused to be ignored or dismissed as the consequences of having the wrong answer were catastrophic. Dr Lisa Sanders documented my story in the New York Times, albeit somewhat simplified to fit into her column. I have been having chest pain and this weird feeling lately. I am scared, I cannot get doctors to listen and I have no energy. Thank you for sharing this very important information.\n\nWhat has helped you throughout it all?", "i was told to come here :) hello ! i am 19, F, and i (and some kind folks on reddit) think i may have behcet's. for the past year I have gotten recurrent tonsillitis every month with swollen lymph nodes. i also get sores on the back of my tonsils during this. i get canker sores in my mouth decently often- any small bite to the lip or cheek will absolutely turn into a sore, and i occasionally get them out of nowhere. i have the first sore I have ever gotten on my labia right now, and that is what pushed me to ask reddit to help. what are some other symptoms to look for and jot down when i go to the doctor and pursue a diagnosis? i have a lot of body aches and pains and my eyes hurt sometimes but i usually chalk it up to not wearing my glasses. thank you ! It definitely sounds like it could be Behcet\u2019s, but it could also be many other things. I would talk with your primary care doctor about getting a referral to rheumatology. Let them know all of your symptoms, including any gut symptoms, fatigue, joint pain, eye symptoms, etc. With eye symptoms it is not good to wait. Uveitis is tricky, I did not know I had it the first time I had it. The headache was there and the sensitivity to light, but I have been light sensitive for some time now. \n\nTake photos of the oral ulcers if you can. This was how I eventually got my diagnosis. I did not think canker sores were unusual even though I would get dozens at a time, or ones the size of quarters. This was my normal since childhood. My dentist is the one who realized something was off and told me to consult my rheumatologist. (I already had one for the joint pain, fatigue, and other symptoms. I have a finally history of autoimmune diseases so I was under the care of rheumatology already.)\n\nDocumenting symptoms and severity is key. They will want to rule in and out other potential causes before landing in Behcet\u2019s. Obviously you may not have Behcet\u2019s, but it sounds like something is going on and it is definitely time to chat with your primary care doctor about seeing a specialist. I would say that your first stop should be the gynecologist ASAP so they can swab the genital sore. Otherwise you will end up playing the \"is it genital herpes?\" game with all your docs. Since Beh\u00e7ets is so complicated it is so difficult to track all of your symptoms and to even know what is related! I highly recommend keeping a journal - mine is basically like a spreadsheet with dates along the top and symptoms down the side. Every day I just put checks at the intersections where I have had a symptom and add new symptoms to the list even if I think they may not be related. Super easy and helps not just with doctors appointments but for me too. I can track ebbs and flows that correspond with my meds (Remicade infusion every 6 weeks) and when I am feeling down it is nice to see that I have had really good mostly asymptomatic periods of time too!\n\nThe thing that was most difficult for me to track was joint inflammation. I did not really know what counted because I never get red and do not trust myself with a visual. Recently I have started tracking my hands with photos. My doctor always has me do a test where I pull my hand in almost a claw, like try to get my fingertips as curled as possible without bending my wrist, with the goal being fingertips touching the inside crease where my fingers meet my palm. Think the American Sign Language for \u201ce\u201d but pulled in as tight as possible... Some days they are swollen and I do not realize how bad it is until I do that test!\n\nI second the comment about seeing the obgyn as soon as you can. I had the same reaction from GP\u2019s telling me it was likely herpes, plus every time I went in feeling inexplicably ill they made me get flu, strep, and mono tests. Diagnosing Beh\u00e7ets is a frustrating process of elimination so the more you can do before your first rheum appointment the better!\n\nHope this helps! Happy to have you in the group but so sorry that you are feeling unwell. 19M here, writing especially because you mentioned tonsillitis.\n\nBeh\u00e7et's affects everyone in very different ways, so I can only talk about how it was for me. After BD decided to \"wake up\" in 2015 every month I had tonsillitis and fever at around 38-39\u00b0C. This resulted in me having my tonsils removed after 3 years of observation. Of course the tonsillectomy removed the tonsillitis problem but all the other symptoms stayed. \n\nSince when it had awoken I was getting recurrent arthritis especially in my ankles or fingers and epydidimitis. It was... very unpleasurable to say the least. Also huge and constant mouth ulcers had been present since birth pretty much.\n\nDiagnosis did not come since July last year, when one day I woke up completely blind in one eye: edema of the optic nerve. \n\nAfter the BD diagnosis I was able to heal the eye to about half of visual acuity and they have told me it already is a lot.\n\nMy advice would be to watch out for any arthritis (extreme swelling of a joint) and on your eyes, since BD-induced eye problems are big cunts and stay hidden for long but one day you might wake up and something is not right anymore.\n\nIf you want to ask any questions feel free to reply or private message. Gynecologist to exclude the herpes should be one of the top priorities I think. If not, I keep reading it is a big issue because they insist on that.\n\nThen your symptoms match, but as said here before, can be something else too.\n\nTo me, the big red flag last year (when it appeared) was my eye. Suddenly my left eye started to have a cloudy + blurry vision, but not where the eye actually focuses. It was like, around in some stains. And straight lines were curvy.\nI had also a lot of pain in my knees (to the point of me having tears when going to the bathroom because I could not sit and then get up with the pain). But that pain was before my eye, so I went to the orthopedist and got out with a subluxation of the kneecaps.... That spread to the ankles and hips in the next days and made me see bad. I had red eyes, that I assumed it was due to the lack of sleep because of those pains. \nThe eyesight got me worried enough to eventually go to the urgency, and I ended up hospitalised with a meningitis and vasculitis. I had of course, also, mouth ulcers, few and small, that I did not really care about.\nIn the previous year, I had had ulcers in the labia that the doctors thought it was due to a medication I took then for a spider bite. \n\nAll these symptoms put together made my case, apparently, a very solid Beh\u00e7et situation.\n\nWhen asked if I had diarrhea frequently: upon thinking, I said yeah sometimes.\nWhen asked if I often had red eyes: yeah a bit sometimes\nJoint pains? Yes, my knees all my life almost.\nUlcers: genital only that one time, but mouth? Yep, not frequently, but sometimes.\nSinus issues? Yes sometimes\nSkin problems like sort of acne that never goes away for real in spite of whatever I try? Yes. \nHeadaches? Oh yes, all the time. I suffer a lot with migraine. I must add that the medication made this worse however.\n\nFamily history of any of these? Yes. - it is not hereditary, but there is a gene that seems to be related, so it is something that can run in the family and sometimes it goes unnoticed.\nThanks to my diagnosis, we now think that one of my aunts has it, or had it. She no longer has symptoms, but she has a weak immune system with her age, and it makes sense. Many times with age it \"goes away\" (kind of, but there is a chance). I even think my dad has it, but very light - one of those cases that will never be diagnosed because there is just not enough to go with it.\n\nThey did the gene test to me, and came positive, so with what I just said, my doctors say it is a \"book case\". \nI would watch out for these symptoms, as they apparently are the most frequent ones (in their many different intensities). \nAnd combinations of these. I would go to rheumatologist or internist that knows Beh\u00e7et and works with Beh\u00e7et patients, and see - he will likely ask for that gene test, among other stuff.\nI did r-rays and magnetic resonance to the joints, head, and TAC to the chest. They were 80% sure of Beh\u00e7et, but wanted to exclude Lupus I think. \n\nAlso, I suggest you take photos.\nBy chance (and because I am a weird person xD) I had photos of my red eyes going back 2 years before being diagnosed. Also from my skin issues, and swollen knees. That helped them so see the slow but obvious evolution of my case. Location and sexual activity could help here america, i am a virgin Being virgin doesnt exclude all STD (which you can also get from non sexual activities, such as sharing towels, or from receiving oral for instance) usually you are more likely to get  behcets if you are from the Mediterranean region. This being said I would see a gynecologist first, and share with them all the other symptoms. i am 100000 percent certain it is not an std. have not shared anything, have not even been naked in another person's house since i was a child. my parents also do not have any. I do understand, the thing is that you cannot test for Behcet, what doctors do us to rule out conditions that may present similar symptoms. Since it is your genitals that are concerned, it is advised to see a gynecologist who will most probably swab you so that you can start the process of ruling out possible conditions other than Behcet. It is so different for everyone, but sounds like it could be possible for you. \n\nMine manifests with arthritis, red hand Flushing, nose and oral ulcers, rashes on my legs and arms, heat sensitivity, butterfly rash and abnormal bone growths. In flares I get these symptoms in addition to histamine intolerance, extreme migraines and severe anxiety.\n\nI also have diagnosed adhd, I was told this could be a secondary. They also believe I may have neuro involvement since I have expierenced MS type symptoms but I cant complete the additional testing until I complete my current pregnancy in December. \n\nHope this helps you on your journey.", "Genital sores that are not ulcers. Anyone? My country has no Rheumatologist. I have been on a merry go round of doctors and medications and I just seem to be getting sicker. \n\nA symptom I have that is baffling everyone I have seen is vaginal pimples. They are not open sores or ulcers. They act and look just like pimples but they appear internally and externally. For years I would get one small one maybe every six months. Now for the last year it is been constant. Sometimes up to 6 at a time. Some of them swell up to the size of a marble. It is incredibly painful. I have been on 5 rounds of antibiotics, the last one 30 days and it is wreaking havoc on my digestive health. I am at the end of my rope here. \n\nI do not get mouth ulcers. I was diagnosed with R.A earlier this year over a zoom chat with a rheumy. Other symptoms include blurry visions, joint pain, fatigue, bloody nose and gums, easy bruising and heart palpitations. I have seen almost a dozen doctors this year an am still at square one. I had an allergic reaction to anti-inflammatory medication and a reaction to HYdroxycloroquin, I am currently on no medication for the arthritis as the doctor wants me to travel to see her in person but the borders have been closed due to covid. \n\nHas anyone had anything similar? Thank you so much. Mine look like zits too, I was still diagnosed with Behcets. I have not been without a mouth ulcer in a year, though, so I have the two that are constant. \n\nHave you tried hibiclens? Hi.  Sorry u r having such a bad time. I have had different types of lesions some like u describe some that are more like open sores or white  apthous ulcers. Some are like paper cuts but I have not had this in quite a while. I get one in my left nostril all the time and I get the pimple type on my shoulders upper arms and back. They itch horribly. I have not been able to find hibiclens, and importing things is a mess due to covid. I am going to keep trying. Mine are normally quite small, but when I was pregnant they were big and awful. Had I not been pregnant, I may have never noticed them at all (I thought the discomforts were regular feelings or being too rough with toilet paper). I get those pretty frequently and I thankfully get the genital ulcers rarely (I am insisting I am hospitalized with a catheter and morphine the next time those happen). I had not connected these pimples/bumps to behcets and have not seen them listed as a symptom of behcets anywhere. I just put topical lidocaine and antibiotic ointment on them and they will go away after a week or so. My gynecologist just said some people get these kinds of bumps/cysts/acne in the genital area and she did not know of any definitive cause of any more treatment than what I mentioned. \n\nFor me they feel kind of like when underwear pinches your skin or hair except no matter how many times I adjust my underwear it still hurts, eventually I will realize it is one of the bumps. \n\nIf they are really extremely painful you can keep looking for other options and I guess if they will not go away, but otherwise it might be best to just use topical lidocaine and topical antibiotics. Maybe the next time you have one they can take a sample of what is inside to see what kind of bacteria is growing so they can use a more targeted antibiotic. I am seeing a dermatologist on Monday, perhaps she will have some answers. Let me know if they have a diagnosis! Have you seen a gynecologist about these yet? Yes! He said he had no idea and then only tested for yeast, even though I asked him to test for bacteria too. Another doctor suggested a staph infection and prescribed 30 days of antibiotics, it is made no difference. It was so infuriating. I wanted to add that the doctor who suggested staph did not look at the bumps at all. That is so stupid. You cannot get an accurate view of things by just a description, everyone has a different view of what words mean, tiny might mean one size for you and a different one for me. \n\nI think I had a herpes test on one once but it was negative. Are yours always the same thing? I get some that are like small acne things, some that are larger and like painful acne, and some that have no \u201chead\u201d to them at all, they are like totally under the skin so they are more cyst like. Right?! Yeah that is pretty close to what I get. It is not clusters at all, just lone boils/pimples/bumps?? Sometimes it is really tiny and sometimes really big. It starts off with an itchy feeling on the skin and then an under skin bump starts to form which eventually will come to head and drain. Mine are not itchy as far as I am aware (I have ADHD and do not always recognize and put together symptoms) and I have never had anything drain that I know of either. \n\nI actually just found a tiny one last night, I did what I usually do when I get acne like that on my face which is take a sewing pin/needle and carefully pop it (no nerves on that part so it does not hurt) and squeezed out any pus then covered it in antibiotic ointment. When I say tiny, this one was like the size of a tip of a Bobby pin and did not go deeper, it was all at the surface. It does not hurt at all today. I usually just take loads of hot baths with Epsom salts to try and get some relief.", "Afraid the family GP will think I am a drugswhore I have many symptoms of Behcet Disease but I do not feel like I can go to the GP . She knows my history (mouth ulcers, joint pain, perianal abscess, weight loss and loose stools) and already suspects crohn's but my symptoms luckely went away with smoking cigarettes so currently I am not in need of a hospital. I have had meningitis as well although this went undiagnosed because I never visited a doctor. Possible TIA's as well. The thing is the ulcers I got everywhere, genitals and nose sores. She knows I have a history of psychosis and psychiatric hospitalization and due to this she may thinks I am a junkwhore with a mental disorder. Is it very common to happen? Most GP\u2019s cannot diagnose it. I would go to the rheumatologist and share your concerns and symptoms Ask for a rheumatologist referral. If you are in the uk ask for professor Robert moots specifically. The psychosis could be related to the neurological symptoms- you need to be seen regardless and if it is not Behcets then the specialist will point you in the right direction.", "COVID-19 and Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease: clinical case series ( \n\nData on patients with systemic autoimmune diseases with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are currently lacking. Data from the first 110 patients included in the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)\u2013COVID-19 Database have been recently published.(\n\nHere we describe, to our knowledge, the first single-centre experience of COVID-19 in patients who fulfilled the international criteria for BD,( including clinical characteristics, antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment, and outcomes. All patients gave informed consent for publishing their clinical data. We used nasopharyngeal swab samples for all diagnoses, amplifying the betacoronavirus E gene and the specific SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene by PCR.\n\nOn 16 April 2020, 2135 consecutive patients with SARSCoV-2 infection had been admitted to Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. We admitted 238 (11%) into intensive care units and we discharged 1481 (67%) with supervised outpatient care. Of all patients, four (0.19%, 95% CI 0.05\u20130.48) had BD (( of whom three were admitted to the hospital. Two of the patients were nurses and have had contact with patients with COVID-19. Only one of the patients with BD had comorbidities, and in all of them, disease activity, measured with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease Activity Index (BDAI)( at the time of first COVID-19 symptoms, was low (BDAI score of &lt;3). Three patients had upper respiratory infection and one had viral pneumonia. No patient required admission to the intensive care unit or invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. In other words, the severity of COVID-19 infection was mild in all cases. I am behcet's patient and got severe covid, it is been almost 3 months and I am still cannot walk much my spo2 drops below 90.\n\nI suspect I got severe covid due to behcet's disease. If this is not the case what else could cause severe covid?? I do not have any other medical condition except behcet's. Since you do not provide any information about your risks, especially age and if you are overweight, it is not possible to say much. Outcomes in COVID are statistical and that means that there are a minority of young, healthy and otherwise low risk people who not only got very sick, but who died. I suspect that the biggest determinants of vulnerability to infection and its virulence in otherwise low risk people are rooted in the genetics of the host. Also important to outcome is the quality of the medical management during severe, acute illness with COVID. Even with excellent acute care one in ten COVID patients who are discharged from both ICU and hospital die within the following 90 days.\n\nThere is growing evidence that many patients who suffered severe disease with accompanying pulmonary fibrosis will not return to their previous state of health or function. Since you are still desaturating with exercise you might want to discuss with your PCP if you are a candidate for chronic oxygen supplementation? While long term damage to the lungs inflicted by COVID is pathologically different than those that cause  COPD (LLRD), the effect is the same in that the surface area of the lungs available for gas exchange  has been greatly reduced due to the destruction of lung tissue (alveoli and small airways). Supplying supplemental oxygen is usually effective at allowing the undamaged lungs to function more effectively. \n\nProviding supplemental O2 in such situations also has the important benefit of preventing the deconditioning that occurs when patients are unable to take exercise. FWIW (which may not be much), I think many post-COVID patients with permanent lung injury will need to be managed similarly to LLRD patients.\n\nI sincerely hope your lung function improves over time and wish you the best. You are making me nervous, you mean I still have chance  of death??\n\nLet me give you more information, that might help you  assess my condition more accurately.\n\nI am 37m. I got covid on November 24, hospitalised on 3rd  December, my CT Severity score was 17/25. My condition worsened and another CT was done which show CT severity score of 49/50.\n\nI barely survived and supported by 15 L O2 but did not need ICU/ventilator.\n\nI became covid -ve on 22nd December, and shifted to normal ward under pulmonologist. Since then I am being treated with steroid and Pirfenidone.\n\nNow after being on these medicines from December 23rd to 22nd February, 2021.\n\nI am off supplimentry oxygen and while resting/seating my spo2 is 95-96 but while I walk it drops below 90 but if I stand and deep breath for a few seconds my spo2 regin to 94+\n\nI am improving week by week. Now I do not use suppliment oxygen and really  I do not like it.\n\nMy steroid dose recently tapered to 10 mg and Pirfenidone dosage increased to 801mg thrice daily.\n\nI really accept that whole this conversation made me very nervous I thought that now I am safe and recovering but now am stressed and nervous again. Almost all patients admitted to ICU require intubation or other less invasive forms of mechanically assisted ventilation. Most are comorbid, older (or elderly) and suffer a great deal of injury from acute COVID. It is this cohort of patients that is experiencing high \\~90 day post-discharge mortality. This nuance is lost on the popular media. I should probably also note that the 1 year post ICU discharge survival rate for *all* ICU patients is similar at 90 days and continues to drop over the following year: \"The 30-day *survival rate after ICU* admission ranged from 86.39% (2010) to 88.71% (2012), while the *1*\\-*year survival rate* ranged from 66.65% (2003) to 64.21% (2010): ( So, this not something that is unique to COVID patients who required ICU care.\n\nYou do not seem to fall into the category of elderly/comorbid patients who required ICU care so I do not think you have to worry about post-COVID mortality. I was speaking generally about the profound, negative long-term effects COVID seems likely to inflict on some segments of the population and on the healthcare system.\n\nSince substantial infection with COVID in the Western world is less than a year old it not yet known what the long-term prognosis is for patients such as yourself who are still experiencing respiratory insufficiency 3 months after discharge from hospital. Many such patients demonstrate extensive pulmonary fibrosis on CT. However, it is unclear to what extent this may resolve over a period of many months. There is also likely a residual inflammatory component compromising lung function that may also resolve over time. In many other forms of acute lung injury (ALI) recovery tends to plateau at 6 months to a year after the initial insult. Not enough is know yet about the effects of COVID-induced ALI. For instance, most non-COVID-ALI results in  a condition know as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which compromises and permanently damages the lungs in ways very different than those that are in play with COVID. A major mistake made early on in treating COVID patients with severe respiratory insufficiency was the early use of intubation and mechanical ventilation, and the use of ventilator settings normally applied to the typical ARDS patient. Similarly,. corticosteroids have proved virtually useless in the management of non-COVID ARDS, whereas they show modest therapeutic benefit in COVID patients who develop respiratory insufficiency. \n\nBeing 37 is not the same as being 27, or 17, for that matter. Susceptibility to infection with COVID and the severity of the resulting disease increases with age (and comorbidities)  and while the most dramatic increases are seen in the elderly (65 and older) there is no shortage of patients who become seriously ill as they approach middle age. As to what role BS plays in increasing susceptibility to infection and virulence of the disease this simply is not known yet and it will probably a long time before it is, if it ever is. \n\nAgain, unfortunately, COVID is so new that structured programs of rehabilitation for patients such as yourself have yet to emerge. Most clinicians are playing it by ear and trying to find the best medical management an respiratory rehabilitation strategies. I suspect that more attention will be paid to this area if/when the pandemic is brought under control and the focus and resource-drain associated with treating acutely ill patients recedes. Hmm yeah I am relieved. I am still recovering and my xray are improving month on month. Hopefully I will recover fully soon. I am so glad to hear that! FWIW, I did some additional research of the literature and I found two papers that noted that in SARS and MERS (two \"cousins of COVID-19) patients with pulmonary scarring continued to improve out to three year post-acute recovery. Resolution of fibrosis, while slow, occurred in most of these patients along with repair of the small airways. The patients who showed the most improvement were those who were younger. Younger being less than age 50. It is not known whether this extended period of recuperation will apply to COVID but it is reason for optimism.\n\nOne thing that is pointed out in most of the literature on this subject is the importance that the patient be very vigilant about other sources of injury during the recuperation period: no smoking (anything), no excess alcohol use, no exposure to damaging particulates or chemicals (spray paints, air pollution, industrial chemicals, etc.). They also noted the increased vulnerability of these patients to other kinds of respiratory infections during this period and urged vigilance and efforts to reduce the risk of such infections. \n\nYour lung CTs should be useful in documenting your progress and there is a gold standard test of pulmonary function, the carbon monoxide diffusion test ( (DLCO), which which provides an index of lung or \u201calveolar\u201d volume.  This should improve over time as your lungs heal. \n\nIt sounds like you are well on your road to recovery. Hey that is great news, as of now I used to think most of recovery should happen in first 3-4 months only. It is been 3 months for me and from a critical state where I was on rebreathable mask with 15L O2 for first 25 days, then over next month I am off oxygen now, my spo2 is 93-95 while resting and during walk it becomes 91. I try to walk as much as possible with breaks to regain spo2 and following a physiotherapist for limb and pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\nAlso, my doctor said all post covid patient who made it through to pulmonologist recovered and I too recover but it may take time for my case. I am having x-rays to check progress, CT is due to next month it would be 3rd CT and I am really apprehensive about radiation exposure. If I could breath properly while walking I would not like to do CT again.\n\nIf you need any report or other information that help you to document or understand covid better I would be happy to share with you.\n\nNow I am on tapered dose of steroid 10mg and 801mg of  pulmofib (pirfenidone).\nIs there any paper that describes pirfenidone role in lung fibrosis due to covid?? The pulmonary rehab is critical. If your exercise tolerance is limited by desaturation you might consult with your doc about using supplemental oxygen during exercise to increase your rate of reconditioning.\n\nAs you may know,  pirfenidone is a drug used primarily to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis which is a progressive and lethal of unknown etiology. It slow the progression of the disease in many patients. \n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nAs near as I have been able to tell from a review of the literature and from conversions with pulmonologists treating post-COVID pulmonary compromise the use of pirfenidone in post-COVID treatment is based solely on theoretical-mechanistic considerations. I can find no clinical data supporting the use of pirfenidone to reduce post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis. This s to be expected given the short experience clinicians currently have with the disease. For a view contrary to the ones expressed in the papers above see:\n\n(\n\n\" Discussion\n\nAn excellent and thought-provoking review by George et al. highlights many nuances related to the care of IPF patients in the context of COVID-19 (( Caring for patients with an underlying fibrotic lung disease is complex. The currently available anti-fibrotics have pleiotropic effects, allowing for many hypotheses related to their potential utility in other disease processes. It is clear that studies will proliferate as commercial interests grow and the pandemic continues in the absence of effective anti-virals and vaccines. The currently approved anti-fibrotics are meant for chronic disease management and by no means are curative nor do they reverse fibrosis. As such, despite the enthusiasm to study these medications, we believe that there is insufficient scientific rationale to do so, given the favorable course and the low prevalence of clinically meaningful scarring in survivors.\n\nThe number of patients suffering from COVID-19 is accumulating and will be millions worldwide. Certainly we must evaluate patients, prospectively and retrospectively, to define the scope and the burden of residual pulmonary deficits and the fibrotic changes to determine their clinical significance. However, we find ourselves asking: Is it worth spending valuable time, resources, and scientific energy studying anti-fibrotic therapies in acutely ill, consent-weary patients that truly need a targeted antiviral treatment or trial? The responsible answer is \u201cno.\u201d Let us keep our focus during the pandemic.\"\n\nThe good news is that based on prior experience with SARS and MERS most young patients experience a return to pre-infection pulmonary functional status. The not so good news is that most of the seriously ill MERS and SARS patients experienced lasting disability due to a wide range of chronic effects of the illness:\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(", "I will die from behcet\u2019s?

The Neuro version of the disease affects about 10% of Behcets patients so it is extremely rare but not impossible.\nYou want to make sure you get stuff like this checked out, occasionally get brain scans to check for lesions and inflammation but usually these symptoms can be managed with medications pretty easily. Personally I am off all my meds now and I manage most things with a strict, healthy lifestyle and short term high dose steroids for emergencies. You will be ok, you just need a little more time to figure things out and get to know the relationship between your illness and your body better. It will come &lt;3 Do not worry, you are lucky you got diagnosed only after a month. It took me 5 years and optic nerve involvement before a doctor thought about Beh\u00e7et's. If you listen to your doctors and keep a healthy lifestyle, you will not have any problems.", "Is forearm and shin pain a symptom of behcets? I was recently diagnosed with behcets (a couple of weeks ago), and I was wondering if forearm and shin pain are also a symptom of behcets, or if it a symptom of steroid medications or colchicine, or if its unrelated. I just started getting it a couple of days and it aches when i walk, but no joint pain. it is predominately my left shin and left forearm, but im feeling some pain in my right shin as well. \n\ni have not changed exercise habits recently enough to warrant this, and i also dont exercise regularily enough to bring about any sort of injury. I was diagnosed recently too, and in the first days of medication I had weird sensations in the body, for example the feeling of a sort of pain/numbness in the left arm and legs.\nBut it went away after... So I dunno. But in any case, what you describe can be nothing, or it could be something, and I am not a doctor and this is the internet, so I think maybe you should at least call your doctor and ask.\nI hear people have different reactions to the medication and it could be your case. But a doctor should tell you.\n\nI hope you manage well, and I wish you good luck and all the health you can have. Stay safe I just dont want to disrupt my doctor for nothing :( Also, have you ever gotten an MRI for behcets (or anything else) before? I got one on Sunday and Im wondering when I will receive a call about the results I understand, but you know, you just got diagnosed and it is normal, we have lots of questions coming to our heads, and we do not remember to ask them all in the \"proper\" moment.\nIt is their job, they are doctors because they care for people. So it is okay for you to ask.\n\nYou might be having a reaction to the medication, or it could be something else... But I struggled with the same, I did not want to bother the doctor, and eventually I got a red rash on the face because of the medication so I had to. And I felt better after he told me it was normal and it would go away.\nSame for the weird sensations.\n\n\nIn my case, I never even got proper sick with anything before in my life. I am 27, and my health was great all my life. I was never in a hospital, I always had light colds (when I had them, rarely).\nThen, I fell last month and I hurt my knee. I had pain, it got worse to the point I could not bend them.\nI went to the orthopedic specialist and he told me it was an inflammation of tendons. I took anti inflammatory, nothing changed. Then I got a blurry vision, cloudy also in one eye. I went to the urgency, they did tests, but te anti inflammatory could do that, so I almost got out of the hospital with just that.\nLast minute they asked: do you have ulcers anywhere?\nAnd I said, yes, I have tiny ones on the mouth. 4.\n\nI did not get out of the hospital that day. I stayed a week eventually. They did a magnetic resonance on the brain, then a lumbar punction - they saw I had the beginning of meningitis.\nNon contagious.\nThen they did a lot of blood tests and they confirmed Behcet. Since I was staying in the hospital because of the meningitis, everything, all the tests, were fast. If not, they told me it would have taken more time for the results, even 3 weeks for some. I am in France btw, so I dunno how it is where you are.\n\nIn any case, I think you need to ask your doctor if you feel anything. Be reasonable of course, but do not be afraid. Right now you need to have some control on your life, you need to feel good as much as possible. To feel comfortable. It is very important I think. I get weird forearm/shin pain when I do steroid bursts for flares, feels almost like the muscle is suddenly too tight, but it only lasts a day or two as I taper the steroids back down. If it is a thing that keeps happening long-term I would def ask your doctor about it. I think this might be what is happening to me (I burst finished my first steroid burst a couple of days ago). Thank you! Alright, if the pain persists for a couple more days I will make sure to ask. Thank you for your words though, it is nice to have someone else with some experience share :) I get shin and forearm pain during flare ups I do not have much at all! I am new on this.\nBut I hope you will manage, good luck ans stay safe!", "Anyone have success on Humira for tongue/mouth ulcers? My 15 year old son was diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s in October. He had constant ulcers on his tongue for over a year.  They last months at a time, and as soon as one goes away another appears. We had one removed before we knew what it was and the oral surgeon said it reached all the way to the skeletal muscle. \n\nRheumatologist started him on colchicine, then doubled it. It did nothing. He was on two Medrol dosepaks. Those helped with existing ulcer (became less deep), but after a few days a new one would start. \n\nHe is now on Humira. It has been almost six weeks (4th injection this Saturday). After second injection there was some improvement, but now significantly worse. He is in so much pain.\n\nI know Humira gives relief for many suffering with other manifestations of the disease, but has anyone here had success on Humira for tongue/mouth ulcers in particular? And if you have found relief on something else, please share. \n\nSo grateful for any advice. His mouth ulcers sound a lot like mine.\nWhen I got diagnosed in summer my cure was Adalimumab and 1mg/kg of body weight a day of Prednisone. My mouth ulcers quickly disappeared. If you say Humira is not working you might want to try with Prednisone, probably at a lower amount (I also had to cure an optic nerve detachment) since either one or the other did work amazingly well for me.\n\nNow I am down to 5mg /day and I still have not had any serious ulcers since the cure started. I might get something that feels similar to an ulcer but is not even imaginably close to the hell it was before and usually lasts only one day.\n\nEdit: on a side note. I hope you manage to find something which works for your son. I myself am just 19 and got diagnosed this summer. If I may I would like to tell you to not stress too much your kid over it. I really can see my mum being way more scared than I am over this disease, asking doctors if the disease will go away and stuff like that. I understand that you, just like my mum do it because you love us children, but I honestly feel worse when I see her like that since I know she is suffering because of me.\nIt is hard, I am sure, but please try and stay calm and just flow along with the situation.\n\nAlso this applies to me. If instead you see your son actually feeling differently you will know what is best for him a billions time more than I could ever.\n\nIf you want to PM and ask further questions go ahead! Thank you so very much for that thoughtful response. That is very encouraging to read!  Did your doctor start you on both medications together right away or did he or she start one and then add the other?\n\nYes us Mom\u2019s love the heck out of our kids and can have the tendency to be overprotective/worry/hover. That is just what a mom does lol. However, in this situation I have not really done that in front of him. He is very depressed about his situation and I am trying to be positive, telling him that I know it is unfair but to hang in there and we will find what works. He has to constantly eat ice to get relief and wants to be alone in his room all the time. I am trying so hard to keep him engaged to not go further into depression. \n\nAgain, I really appreciate your feedback. We have an appointment on Monday with the rheumatologist and I will inquire about to steroid option. Hope all continues to go well for you :-) Otezla is the ticket for me.  Omg I was having mouth sores so bad I could not eat five or six at a time for two or three weeks at a time with maybe a week or so in between flare ups. For years. \n\nStarted taking otezla.  Have had one mouth sore that lasted two days since I started it.  I have not had a break from mouth sores like this since I was in my early teens. That is 20years ago.  Five months and one mild mouth sore.  It is stupid expensive if you do not have insurance though. I have good insurance thank god but without it it is $5800 per month. Omg it breaks my heart to read about people suffering for so long. I am happy you found something that works! Did you also try Humira at any point? I read about Otezla specifically approved for mouth sores and wondered why the doctor did not prescribe that first. How long have you been on it, and have you had any side effects from it (I am sure anything is better than the sores)? Insurance would only pay for otezla after trying everything else first. \n\nOnly side effects were bowel issues for the first week I was diagnosed with Bechets when i was 8, i am currently 32(F). I havent had any symptoms since around 19-20, and I never went on any biologics so i cannot help there. But i just wanted to mention gargling with warm salt water. It burns at first, but after the stinging it takes the overall pain away for a while. I have scar tissue all over the inside of my cheeks and lips from ulcers the size of quarters. I know the struggle, and i hope he finds relief somewhere. That is very promising! Thank you for all the info!! Here to echo the prednisone. I was on Humira for a couple years about a decade or so ago, age 15-6 ish? I tried that, was on enbrel, methotrexate, the whole lot of them. \n\nI was diagnosed @ 10, really ridiculous long diagnosis that sucked, I am 29 now. \n\nHumira was probably the one that gave me the most results at the time but i had a lot of nausea. I have lived the last two decades pretty much dosing prednisone on and off for flare ups in a similar weaning fashion as mentioned. It sucks, and when I first had my diagnosis-bringing flareups, I was kind of the incredible hulk  - always hungry and mean, or really emotional.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe steroids are going to be the short term answer or something in that route. \n\nHumira may help, but my results just were not enough for me to stab myself in the thigh every week for the rest of my life. I hate it. :( lol. \n\nFor immediate relief, I do not know if your doctor can prescribe some topical lidocaine \\ to help to numb/give just something to help him feel less crappy.\n\nand finally, I am so  sorry and sending you guys as much love and care as I can. It is a hard road, and I am lucky to have had my mom through it. I know it is hard to watch him go through as well as a lot on your entire life. It will get better. Oh wow sounds like you have been through a lot as well. I am happy things are better for you now. I can totally relate to the \u201chulk\u201d comment during flares lol. He does use what is called Magic mouthwash that has lidocaine in it and that does give temporary relief. Sounds like we will have to add the steroid or if that does not work switch to Otezla as someone else noted. Thank you so much for the support and kind words!! Wow 8 is so young. The fact that you have not had symptoms in over a decade certainly gives some hope! We will try the salt water. Thanks so much for the advice. Yes, the moment I got diagnosed they started immediately with both.\nTechnically Humira should be for the disease as a whole while steroids for the optic nerve detachment I had, but it might be that the latter was actually what helped the mouth ulcers also given another user's experience with this.\n\nWith this cure I have I have no symptoms other than some fatigue, especially the day of the injection which I instead do not really mind given all the needles I have already had in me due to over 6 years of trying to find out what was going on. This sucks, I am sorry.  Mouth ulcers are just awful.  \n\nI did not have any success with humira.  I got to try most of the current anti tnf drugs and the only one that worked for me is remicaid.  However, my current doctor is mad at my previous doctors because while I was trying all these drugs (had to use these drugs with no relief for 16-24 weeks at a time before moving on to the next one) no one thought to check my drug levels.  So not even sure dosing was effective.  Turns out they probably would not have worked anyway as I metabolize drugs very slowly.  \n\nBut the point is, ensure someone is checking drug levels and that they tell you they did it, or what the value is (just so you know they did it) as it is important before moving onto new drugs. I was basically in total remission on Humira for two years before I had to change treatment Thank you for this feedback! I am seriously taking notes on all of these experiences shared. I agree the 16-week waiting period is ridiculous only to find out it is not going to work and start again. It is easy for someone to say \u201cbe patient and give it time\u201d when not the one in pain. It kills me to see my kid suffering. I hardly ever see him smile anymore since this damn thing started. I will put Remicaid on the list to consider. The doctor is pretty good at doing blood work regularly and did try titrating the colchicine first before moving to Humira. We have an appointment on Monday so we will see what he says. Ironically, it was his Dermatologist who said to consider the diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s and then on last appointment said doctor should consider weekly instead of biweekly injections for Humira as he should be having some relief by now. All great info, thank you! That is promising. I am hoping for any remission! What did you switch over to, and has that been effective for you? I had a major relapse and rather resistant disease. When the neurological issues showed up we had to get more aggressive. I tried six months of Cytoxan snd did well but after stopping I relapsed. Now I am on a lot of pills to manage Behcet\u2019s and the neurological issues, and I get IVIG every month to prevent a neuro relapse. It has worked thus far so I just stay positive about it keeping to work. \n\nWith the Humira and other biological drugs, they believed I have developed antibodies to the biologics. When we tried Remicade my body decided to nearly stop working cardiac wise within 20 minutes of the infusion. \n\nEveryone is different and my Behcet\u2019s has gone particularly hard after my GI system and my nervous system, so my treatments have to get into my body and stabilize my nervous system :/ Mine went away for good after starting humira, and I started when I was 18. Good luck! Oh bless your heart. That is horrible!!  I am so sorry for all you have been through. I read about Neuro Beh\u00e7et\u2019s being difficult to treat. I really hope you find something that works for you long term. No one should go through so much. I also have an autoimmune, Graves Disease, had extensive food and environmental allergy testing, removed those triggers from my diet two years ago, and was able to drastically reduce my meds. Wondering if reducing inflammatory factors might help reduce flares? Thank you so much for sharing your experience, and really hope you are able to get things under control for better quality of life soon!! Thank you again for responding, this helps so much! Thank you so much. Encouraging to read that it at least helped some people with the mouth ulcers. Humira has helped with my ulcers, mouth is full of scars from them before I got treated.\n\nHumira meant I had a few a week, but the big winners for me whilst being on Humira + Mycophenolate have been:\n\n* Reducing sugar intake drastically\n* Regular exercise (I weightlift)\n* Intermittent Fasting (only eat between 12pm-8pm) \n* Good sleep, 7+ hours\n\nIf I slip on any of those I start getting bad ulcers again even on the meds.\n\nIntermittent fasting has been huge for me, been doing it for 18 months now and at most I get one ulcer a fortnight.\n\nCould be a single case and subjective, but I know people with different autoimmune diseases who have benefitted from fasting. Apparently the reduced time your digestive system has to work reduced inflammation markers but the science is young. Thank you so much. Not sure how fasting will go for a teen, but I definitely hear you on reducing sugar - another hard sell for a teen! I do agree there is likely a connection though. The worst instance of ulcers he had occurred two days after eating \u201ca ton of candy\u201d this past Halloween - his brother called him out on it. I will show him your post. I think it helps when he reads this from someone other than mom lol. Appreciate it!! Of all of them, I would recommend the fasting and the reduced sugar the most.\n\nThe fasting I eat all the same foods, just wait til 12. I normally have my breakfast and lunch at the same time which I enjoy, and I eat a lot of food. It is much easier to do on weekdays though with work taking me 9-12.\n\nSugar is a big deal, the only refined sugar I get is alcohol and I usual get either a flair up or really bad ulcers and lumps/inflammations are a drinking weekend. But I have not really had sugary snacks in 5 years or so now. I prefer fatty ones like cheese and nuts!\n\nTakes some getting used to, but being ulcer free is a huge deal for me. Used to go days or weeks at a time when I could not talk or eat due to the pain and now I maybe have one at a time the size of a pinhead. Thank you for the additional info. Very helpful! He does get plenty of exercise, through summer and the school year runs cross country and track. Really need to work with him on the sugar. Might hold off on fasting until he stops growing. Again thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience. I am very grateful :-) Sounds like he eats a lot too!\n\nI will not badger you about it, but do not be put off by the word 'fasting'. I literally just move my calorie intake to 12pm onwards.\n\nStudies show it actually increases growth hormone! But I recommend looking into it and the effect it can have on autoimmune diseases, also recommended if you know anyone with IBS. How about fruit?", "Nervous for specialist appointment Hi guys,\n\nI have recently had my second bout of severe gastro symptoms from my behcets, and have an appointment with a specialist on Wednesday.\n\nI am nervous any time I go to see a new specialist - I have had this thing since I was 11 and over the years have seen probably over 20 specialists (it is Australia, it is not common here) and some of those experiences *sucked*. Even with it listed as my diagnosis (that was about specialist number 13 when I was 14 years old) they all doubt it until they actually see me when I am sick.\n\nI am in Australia and here Behcet's is apparently more common in women and generally not severe. I am female so I have that going for me if they have actually read the right research, otherwise, they say I do not have it because I am not a middle-aged Turkish man and I actually have to explain the research to them.\n\nI have not had a normal bowel movement in 2 months now and have dropped 12 kgs. I feel like I am just going to cry on this specialist and be dismissed as a hysterical woman with IBS.\n\nWhat do I do to not come across as crazy or be dismissed? Since you are in Australia and I am not nearly as familiar with your medical system as my own in the US, this advice might not apply. But here, our doctors work for us. If I meet a doc I do not like, I do not see him/her again. And I always do research before seeing a new provider. With the internet, you can see where someone went to school, read reviews, etc. So if you do not like this doctor, go see another one. Do not stress about it - that will just make your symptoms worse. In Australia, we are small enough that most doctors do not have reviews. It turned out ok in the end - he took me seriously, I had a gastroscope with some minor findings, blood tests and another stool sample. I am waiting on those results now. Our doctors mostly work for us (the government contributes a set amount per procedure or appointment, but most specialists can charge over that amount for private patients). Public patients do not have to pay anything, but they usually have to wait longer for an initial appointment. You can still choose your doctor though.\nI am from Canberra, which has a very bad history in its public and private health systems (likely it originated from a dispute over funding between state governments, rather than the public health system)\nHaving behcets and growing up with that health system I had many horrendous experiences with both specialists as a private patient and the public hospital. I am talking life threatening, abusive, torturous stuff. \nI am in another state now, and each time I go to a doctor or nurse I am astounded at the wonderful quality of care. Whilst sick with gut symptoms \nI passed out in the shower and my housemate carried me - still quite out of it - to the emergency room at our local public hospital in the middle of a snap 5 day coronavirus lockdown. In retrospect we should have called an ambulance, but I \"didnt want them to be mad with me\" if I was not that sick. I was seen within an hour. They took bloods, a very thorough history, contacted my gp (general practitionner) and specialist, gave me warmed blankets, bumped up my blood pressure with fluids and gave me anti nausea drugs. They kept me on a monitor and kept me safe while i recovered from a simple vaso vagal episode. I went home that evening with normal vitals, prescriptions, outpatient appointments for follow up and firm instructions to come back if it came close to happening again - lockdown or not.\nThe problem is not public healthcare. It is misogyny and arrogance in concentrated pockets of the medical industry. And I have run afoul of it before and paid dearly for it. I am glad to hear everything turned out okay. Thank you for informing me about Australia's healthcare system a little bit. There is no shortage of arrogance in American healthcare either.", "New BD treatment on horizon :)  Upadacitinib monotherapy, at 15 or 30 mg daily, significantly improves clinical, radiographic and patient-reported outcomes in\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis, compared with weekly methotrexate, according to data published in\u00a0Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology.\n\n\u201cThe Janus kinase (JAK) enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) are important mediators of multiple cytokine-signaling pathways for normal cellular processes as well as for immune mediated inflammation,\u201d\u00a0Ronald van Vollenhoven, MD,\u00a0of Amsterdam University Medical Centers, in the Netherlands, and colleagues wrote. \u201cOrally administered JAK inhibitors (tsDMARDs) are approved for their established efficacy as monotherapy and combination therapy (with csDMARDs), versus bDMARDs across diverse RA patient populations.\u201d\n\ufffcUpadacitinib monotherapy, at either 15 or 30 mg daily, significantly improves clinical, radiographic and patient-reported outcomes in RA, compared with weekly methotrexate, according to data. Source: Adobe Stock\n\u201cUpadacitinib, a potent, reversible JAK inhibitor, met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in each of the pivotal Phase III trials, both as monotherapy and in combination with csDMARDs, across the spectrum of methotrexate-experienced patients with established RA via the SELECT clinical development program: NEXT, BEYOND, MONOTHERAPY and COMPARE,\u201d they added.\n\nTo analyze the effect of\u00a0upadacitinib (Rinvoq, AbbVie)\u00a0monotherapy among patients with RA who have had little or no exposure to methotrexate, van Vollenhoven and colleagues conducted the SELECT-EARLY trial. A total of 947 patients, recruited from 236 sites across 43 countries, were randomized into one of three groups, with 315 participants receiving weekly methotrexate, 317 receiving 15mg of upadacitinib daily and 315 treated with 30 mg of upadacitinib daily. Treatments continued for 24 weeks.\n\n\ufffc\n\nRonald van Vollenhoven\n\nThe primary endpoints were the proportions of patients achieving 50% or greater response in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria at week 12, as well as the proportion of participants demonstrating a 28joint Disease Activity Score, including Creactive protein (DAS28-CRP), of less than 2.6 at week 24. A total of 840 participants completed 24 weeks of treatment.\n\nAccording to the researchers, both upadacitinib dosages met their primary endpoints, with 52% of participants in the 15 mg group, as well as 56% of those in the 30 mg group, achieving ACR50 at week 12, compared with 28% of those treated with methotrexate (P\u00a0&lt; .001). In addition, 48% of patients in the 15 mg group, along with 50% in the 30 mg group, demonstrated a DAS28-CRP of less than 2.6, compared with 19% of those who received methotrexate (P\u00a0&lt; .001).\nIn addition, participants treated with upadacitinib, regardless of dose, reported statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple outcomes, compared with methotrexate. Overall, 88% of those treated with 15 mg, and 89% of those in the 30 mg group demonstrated no radiographic progression. The frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events, through 24 weeks, was 65% for methotrexate, 64% for 15 mg of upadacitinib and 71% for 30 mg of upadacitinib. A total of six deaths were reported, including two in the 15 mg arm, three in the 30 mg arm and one in the methotrexate group.\n\n\u201cOverall, the study showed that upadacitinib was more effective than methotrexate and had a good benefit-risk profile,\u201d van Vollenhoven told\u00a0Healio Rheumatology. \u201cNote that the FDA approval, and the  approval, for upadacitinib is for patients who have already tried methotrexate where the methotrexate did not work sufficiently well, so what was done in this trial is currently off-label. Moreover, I think it is not likely that any new drug will be used as first-line treatment from the start, and methotrexate is still recommended by all major rheumatology organizations as the first treatment for RA.\u201d\n\u201cI do expect that with time there will be changes in the way we practice, so that we will one day be able to choose the first-line therapy individually for each patient by matching their individual disease profile with the best treatment for them,\u201d he added. \u201cI think this was very much a forward-looking study that suggest a possible future for patient-centered and individualized therapy approaches, which could be applied both in\u00a0RA but also in other autoimmune diseases.\u201d This is interesting.  It does not look like it Behcet's was used in the trials on it.  I wonder what the results for off-label use with Behcet's will be. Behcet's is such an individual disease,  meaning there is a wide range of symptoms and responses to medications. However, since there is cross over treatment from other rheumatologic diseases this is hopeful. Especially since it addresses cytokines. It is also being tried with Lupus patients. Here is an additional resource. \n\n", "Mouth sores Hello everyone. New to the forms.. sorry that most of you are suffering with this but glad to meet people with similar issues. My questions Is if anyone has mouth ulcers but not genital.. I have 10 years horrible sores\u2026 cannot workout hard cuz I get muscle pains/joints\u2026 I also get sores in nose and sometimes elbows and knees but no genitals.\n\nMy doc is thinking BD so I am curious.. just started colchicine so let us see if it helps. Thank you. The academic literature shows that roughly 60% of Behcet\u2019s patients have genital ulcers (( \n\nPersonally, I get the mouth lesions, skin lesions, joint pains, and neurological issues, but have never gotten a genital ulcer! Also - I know folks who take colchicine and it works really well for them. Thank you for that.. I have been reading a lot of you on here talking about neurological symptoms\u2026 can you elaborate.. mood issues or something else? I personally experienced impaired speech, balance issues, disturbed sleep, overwhelming fatigue, memory issues, and cognitive impairment. I was still able to work\u2026but just barely. Thankfully I was able to start immunosuppressive therapy and avoid disability. Thank you.. did you feel many of these over time.. I feel like I have slurred a few times and wondered why.. also felt out of balance a few times and found it weird but it is has not been frequent enough for me to put it together Interesting. I had horrible oral and genital ulcers for about a decade, then they both stopped in my mid-twenties. Have not had either in 15 years. I have a lot of mouth sores but no genital sores yet. I was told it happens for certain people with Beh\u00e7et. I also have them in the nose which is a bit annoying. \nCurrently in the middle of a flare and colchicine and cortisone help a bit. I had to cauterise the big sores in the mouth this time though... Interesting\u2026 I also used debacterol.. had a bad one on tip of tongue and debacterol hurt like a Motherf$&amp;@ on top of tongue but got it done.\nIf you do not mind me asking.. the ones in your nose.. are they something you just feel.. like one or two.. I cannot see them but I will feel them.. always like one or two\u2026 just feel like pain\u2026 and then I usually get in mouth.. just trying to understand it.. have you found things in specific that cause the sores?? Thank you. Also have you tried otezla? I have heard it helps with sores? I think that is what it is called. It is a drug that has recently been approved for mouth sores in people with bechets Never heard of otezla so i might look into that and if it is available where I am. Standard treatment for me is colchicine,  if small flare up cortisone and if big one then i get shot of Anakinra. Thanks for the tip. In the nose i can see them sometimes, like a small cut and then some weird  white bubbling around. One thing helps a loooot for me with those is gomenolated oil 2%. I put a bit on a q-tip and basically coat my nostrils in it. I just started colchicine by itself. Going to try for a month\u2026 that is how my nose feels.. like a hard pimple that I pick then feels like cut. I use muprocin which helps\u2026 Good luck !! Colchicine helped me a lot to space out flares and reduce a bit the intensity. Also I went from having mouth ulcers every day to every other weeks and then once every 2 months. The downside was my liver and my stomach. Got a lot of pain and other stomach related issues. But everyone reacts differently ! How much colchicine were you taking.. I have gone 10-11 months twice in 10 years since this started with only one free day flare.. I was vegan/vegetarian and did lots of meditation and yoga.. so back to that it is because this year I have been having a lot coffee and some foods I should not and I have had 4 flares already .. sucks! Daily base is 1mg a day for the last 7 years. During flares its up to 2mg. I usually have big flares (with full on pain every where etx. )twice a year but since last years i have big ones every 2 months. Small flares last about a week or 2 they are not that intense  in pain compare to the big ones, its mostly burst here and there and mouth ulcers plus fatigue. I used to have that every 3months small ones. Now its kind of like a steady state of pain fatigues and occasional ulcers. And i get big flares every 2-3 months in addition. Since the end of 2019 I feel i did not catch  a break \ud83d\ude05 \nI noticed that gluten, sugar and lactose make them worse. Shit man... how old are you? I have figured out its all about inflammation. Plant based diets really help with that as well as turmeric supplements, meditation, vegan omega supplements, lots of water and cutting the acidic foods.. the standard list of cutting eggs, dairy, tomatoes, strawberries, spicy foods, sugary treats, citrus and chocolate also help. it sucks but better than having a mouth full of sores!! Late 20s but i have been living with it for the last 14 years  so I gave up. I am used to a certain pain levels that now i just eat whatever and when it gets too much I cut it out. I love spicy food, chocolate and veggies. Everything bad i know but i also realized which quantity is the limit for each so I just go on with my life as normal as possible. I cannot  really complain I dont have neurological damages. Just fatigue, general slowness, joint pain. Of course skin, GI issues but its not that bad overall, you just learn to live with it.\n Where I am there is not much support  or help for Beh\u00e7et.  They treat the bigger symptoms and make sure you do not  throw a pulmonary embolism  and that is  about it. Shit man. I feel for you. I am 42, it started at 31 for me. I still have not gotten a formal diagnosis but my doctor is leaning towards Bechets as I have all but the genital sores. even had moments where I am like, wtf, why do I fell off balance. Its not as severe as some of the people I have met here. But it does feel cool to talk to others with the same issue. When you tell people mouth sores they think its no big deal. When I tell doctors they usually give me like a, why are you wasting my time face, then I open my mouth and they all give me the same \"holy shit\" expression! kind of funny at this point because I know what will happen when I go to er to new doc I feel you. My diagnostic was by elimination after 7 years of search and trials. I responded quite well to a derivative of colchicine  so they started  with that hypothesis. They categorized me as Atypical Beh\u00e7et and now it looks like I am getting more entero-behcet symptoms. \nMouth sores are a pain .... and yeah people do not get it when you have them often. It is good to talk to other people  that have similar symptoms and are going through the same thing.\nWhere I am , ER doc do not really what to do and how to treat so usually I am sent home with paracetamol and a request to se another doc within 3 months \ud83e\udd23 I feel you brother! Stay in touch if anything new comes up! Thanks ! Appreciate it. I am on otelza for bd for mouth sores and arthritis I have been taking Otezla since March. The side effects, for me, are awful and I have still had flares of mouth ulcers. They do not last as long but they happen. Thanks for that and sorry to hear the side effects suck! What immunosuppressive if you do not mind me asking?", "So for about four days I was EXTREMELY tired. I have made no major change to my diet, or sleep. I started swim practice again but that was after I started getting really tired. Has this happened to any of you?  It may be a mild flare up. I have been living with behcets for 7 years and I sometimes get unexplained exhaustion, with or without other symptoms presenting themselves. Best thing sometimes is to be aware of it so you do not over exert yourself  Thanks for the help, do you know of any way to mitigate this bedsides unhealthy amounts of caffeine? I think exhaustion can be caused by the adrenal gland being over worked. If you are inflamed, adrenaline can be used by the body to alleviate that, but I think a flare can over work your glands. So if your glands become taxed, your energy levels drop and sometimes blood pressure can drop a little. If that is the case, simple sugars to give you energy and salty foods to raise your blood pressure can make you feel better, but caffeine makes it worse by over stimulating your glands. So if they are already tired, caffeine pushes the body too hard. Do not over do it but I think some sweet tarts and pretzels can do the trick, and take it easy when you can. This may not be what your problem is but I have found it helpful. At least do not go crazy on the caffeine lol Aight, thanks for the advice. Till now I would been going with coffee and power naps. Your advice sounds much healthier.", "Is this a flare up ? I have been feeling a sudden onset of moderate fatigue and achy bones. However I do not have any ulcers present. Could this be from inflammation due to behcets ? Have you had these symptoms without the presence of ulceration ? Yes, you can have a flare without ulcers, they are just one of the symptoms of behcets. I have personally been having a \"good\" month with very little ulcers but a \"bad\" month because I have gotten sick 3 times, had extreme fatigue and aches and had a lot of EN spots. Sometimes my legs and knees just throb for a day or two out of no where  Thank you for your input. I took prednisone today and felt relief from the fatigue. It definitely can be a flare up. I periodically experience fatigue, aches, and mental fog. Sometimes they are hard to distinguish from a hard day's work or a normal cold but over time you generally get to pick up on your body's signals. Since you mentioned prednisone though, it could be withdrawal effects from steroid use. It depends on your dosage and whatnot but generally I know prednisone to be a nasty med to kick and it can play all sorts of nasty tricks on you. Steroids tend to give you a good kick of energy and so your body throws a fit if you reduce/stop use. What are EN spots? I am wondering if I have behcets and I would really appreciate hearing about other's symptoms erythema nodosum, it is a skin condition that presents in behcets. it causes raised red spots (most often on the lower legs) that are hot to touch and incredibly painful.\n", "My BD battle Hi BD warriors :) I have BD and one of the manifestations of my disease is in my GI. I have sever pain on my L side of abdomen,.descending. I have a lot of trouble eating and digesting; over years, I have been able to eat and digest less and less. I have been restricted to only cooked vegatables; I eat gluten free, sugar free, vegan, fruit free and avoid nightshades, nuts and beans. Many meals are just potatoes and/or rice. ;)I have to eat small portions.  My Dr. Mom thinks I may have a stricture. I had a endoscopy and colonoscopy last year and just showed polyps and inflammation. Has anyone had one? Was there a particular procedure that helped diagnosis it? If so, was there a particular solution that helped you? Any information is appreciated. \n#becalmbehcetson I had one a few years ago for IBS symptoms and that just showed some inflammation. I figured out that dairy is my trigger and have been much better since cutting that out. I also try to keep my carb intake down too as that sometimes causes pain. \n\nHope you are doing better. Thanks for your reply. :) Do you have issues with volume? No I do not. Just abdominal inflammation and intense pain. Prednisone nips it within a few hours. Hi, I apparently have Crohns too but I think it is all Behcets. For gastro symptoms I get infliximab which has helped a lot. A capsule endoscopy helped diagnose it as well as the colonoscopy. I followed the low FODMAP diet for 6 months and then gradually reintroduced some foods one at a time to see which caused me the most bother so now I know for example I cannot eat apples, who knew! It is a long process but it helped. Let me know if you would like me to send any more info on it? I am new here on reddit and dont know anyone in real life with Behcets or similar so hope we can help one another :) Thank you for your response.  That is super helpful. Over years,  my diet has become more and more restricted,  maybe considering FODMAP would help. It would be awesome if you could inbox me and info. :) Much appreciated. Yes, it is challenging to find people with BD or even a similar condition. How long have you been diagnosed?", "Got officially diagnosed today! After 7 years. Finally!!! Finally fucking finally. I got genital ulcers first when I was 17. First time in the stirrups, first time ever having a doctor exam my parts, and first  (and thankfully only) time I got shots in my labia. No one had a real diagnosis for me, kept saying maybe a bartholins gland cyst burst but it was not in the right spot for that. It happened again 3 months later and then I went off to college where I visited the women\u2019s health clinic many times hoping every new doctor I saw would know what was wrong. Many years later I finally got my own gynecologist and she had no idea at first too. Then I was unluckily able to see a doctor in a different country on a different continent in an ER who also had no idea. It happened again a year later and my gynecologist managed to get me in for an emergency visit and diagnosed me with Lipschutz ulcers and she added \u201cunless you also get mouth ulcers then it could be behcets\u201d and I said I also got mouth ulcers but since we did not have much time we did not discuss it further until my next regular appointment. Then my pcp said to ask my gyno for rheumatologist recommendations because my pcp had never heard of behcets before. Then I had to visit the gyno again who said she did not know any so I had to go back to my pcp and finally got a referral and then an appointment. I was expecting to have to fight a bit for myself with the rheumatologist and that they might have never heard of behcets before but she heard of it and never questioned my \u201cself\u201d/gyno diagnosis. \n\n\nStarting otezla tonight and worried because known side effects include depression (already have that so this should be fun) and diarrhea which I am already very familiar with. \n\nSide question have any other women in here been diagnosed with vulvodynia/ vestibulodynia? I had an epiphany at my gyno\u2019s office that maybe the ulcers caused mine. Super fun, my period consists of constant vaginal burning at this point. \n\nMan I wrote a novel and this is only the tip of the iceberg on what got me diagnosed. Also my dentist recommended rincinol for my \u201ccanker sores\u201d (before I would heard of behcets) and it really really works for me. It also felt like they healed faster. My dentist lasers my cankers. It is amazing. Pain is gone immediately and they disappear in a day or two.\n\nEdit to add: I am happy you got a diagnosis! Good luck with your meds. Congratulations! Most people probably would not think that congrats are in order for being told you have a chronic illness. But for those of us who spent years searching for the name of our suffering, it is most certainly cause for celebration. Again, congrats! Does it hurt?! Not at all! I need to do this. I wonder if they would. How much do they charge you? About $60 a session and it is covered by my benefit plan. Thank you and congrats is definitely the appropriate response!", "Just avoided my potential death I guess this post will be a cautionary tale and a much needed off my chest moment.\n\nI noticed a lump on my breast. I booked an appointment asap in the medical cabinet I usually go to. The doctor told me that I had a blocked and infected milk duct. No biggie. And he gave me antibiotics for a week.\n\nI take colchicine for Behcet so I asked if this antibiotic was safe with my treatment. The doctors told le that it was okay and that I should be only avoid macrolids. Great. I was on my way to the Pharmacy, got my medication, and took the 1st dose as soon as I arrived home.\n\nThe doctor and the pharmacist warned me that this specific antibiotic was very harsh on the stomach and recommended probiotics. Given that S boulardii cannot be taken with hot beverages, I decided to check the antibiotics as well just to check.\n\nAnd there  it was written, this antibiotic cannot be used woth colchicine. Further research online told me that a woman died recently 48h after taking this antibiotic and her regular colchicine treatment.\n\nI ended up calling the non emergency medical line and the doctor was very clear that continuing both treatment could be fatal.\n\nI am glad this all stopped there, but in the future I will make sure to mention my treatment to the doctor, the pharmacist and to read tje leflet before I take anything.\nEven if the doctor missed it today, maybe the pharmacist could have seen it.\nI am still a bit shocked at the whole thing but at least, I am safe and will pay mote attention in the future Dude, so happy to hear you are ok after that. Exactly what scares me, as lots of drug interactions with colchicine. Great job being vigilant. Same thing happened to me.. the pharmacist did notice however and would not fill the prescription so I had to go back to the doctor to get a different antibiotic. Happy you are okay!! I ended up researching interactions and apparently there could be some issues with grapefruit, liquorice and cannabis as well I am good thank you. I just cannot wait to finish the new antibiotics I think that colchicine + antibio are just killing my stomach.\n\nCrazy! I am glad it was spotted at the pharmacy.", "Undiagnosed 27F self-introduction: I have Behcet or Sjogren's Syndromes? I am 27 years old now. When I was 3/4, I used to suffer from bone and muscles pain on my lower legs but it is gone itself. Then I began to suffer from chronic mouth ulcers (everywhere in my mouth and tongue) since 5 and keratitis (cornea inflammation) since 11. I tried all medicine (and even an eye injection) during these decades but the symptoms just come and go. My mouth ulcers become very severe in the first year of my high school and my doctors (in China) suspect it is immune system so I got injections on my lymphatic (I am not very sure which kind of medicine it is). Before I started college, someone heard of my symptoms in eye and mouth, and he suspects it is Behcet. I also found purpura on my lower legs, and been diagnosed as Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura and after it is cured, it did not come back again. I do not have arthritis or ulcers on my vagina, but it is still scary to me and my family and we realized my two symptoms are related and cannot be treated alone.Then I started 4 years Chinese medicine (for all systematic cure, you know). Ulcers are under controlled but eye symptoms go on (not as severe as in my childhood though so I just leave it there). However, I began to have acnes on my face\u2026 until now. I went to comprehensive eye examination routinely and did not find any problem.\n\nThen I come to the U.S. I still have keratitis so I went to eye doctor routinely and take \u201crestasis\u201d an eye drop for a few years. My eye doctor said it is cornea inflammation caused by dryness. My ulcers become much better in the first year I came here and they came back only when I was in China for summer break. Then I completely got rid of them since almost three years ago, only occasionally one came out and cured itself automatically after 10 days (drinking a lot of water will facilitate the progress). I thought everything was fine. But for a while, I got lower back pain after long-time sitting and I went to chiropractor for that. Nothing more.\n\nHowever, since last October, I start to have eczema on my hand (and it does not go away until now). My ulcers came back again soon, here and there in my mouth and tongue, one cured automatically after 10 days and the other came out right after. Simultaneously since I stopped Restasis, my eye problems became more severe and more frequent (although I never completely got rid of them) and it blurred my vision. I went to cornea consultant and he recommended me to see a rheumatologist. I went to get Moderna Vaccine last Saturday, but until now I sill feel fatigue and bone and muscle pain on my lower legs (I am not sure if it is related). Someone said I may need a rituxan treatment.\n\nI should have autoimmune disease, I used to think it is Behcet, now I feel like it is more likely Sjogrens', and since this one is much more common than Behcet, I think it has a better bet. I should wait for a while of appointment and diagnosis, but I am just wondering is there anyone with me here? this is a late response but you probably have both. I have both :(", "Screening your rheumatologist  \n\n# Screening your rheumatologist\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThis forum is rife with stories of frustration and grief resulting from BS patients interacting with rheumatologists who have insufficient experience treating BS, or worse, are incompetent to do so.\n\nOne of the first questions you should ask the rheumatologist that you have been referred to is:\n\n\"How many patients have you treated for BS and how many are you treating now?\"\n\nIf he has not treated many patients and has not put considerable effort into understanding the disease and keeping appraised of current treatments, then my advice is do not waste your time. Providing, that is, if you have that choice.\n\nBehcet'ssyndrome (BS) is a rare disease, and more importantly, an extraordinarily complex one with protean manifestations and vast variations between how it presents and progresses in individual patients. BS makes the diagnosis of most other autoimmune-hyperinflammatory diseases such as lupus, MS, Goodpasture's, RA, GPA, etc., look like child's play. This not to say that the diagnosis and management of these conditions are easy. Instead, these diseases most often present in more stereotypical ways and the clinicians treating them have had experience with many, many more such patients than they are likely to have with BS patients. BS is the very definition of a disease that requires not just a \"specialist,\" but a highly experienced one.\n\nI can think of many other screening questions to ask your prospective treating physician. However, what I would really like to hear from others here are:\n\n1. What remarks or actions by your (inadequate) treating rheumatologist have you found to serve as red flags that he lacks an adequate experience base, is un- or underinformed, or has insufficient interest in learning more about BS in order to treat you more effectively?\n2. What information about your BS, or BS in general do you consider essential to be communicated to you upon diagnosis or treatment? Here, I am referring not just to verbal interaction, but to referencing or providing print or other educational materials about what you can expect and what you should be vigilant for? I believe that every rheumatologist treating BS patients should provide them with an extensive and reasonably comprehensive handout about the disease or with equivalent online resources.\n3. What incorrect or even potentially harmful advice or guidance have you been given that you would consider as disqualifying a clinician from treating you or any other BS patient?\n\nI think that assembling a compendium of BOTH negative *and positiv*e criteria for selecting a rheumatologist is a crucially important resource that is missing here. I am interested in assembling a \"best practices\" resource for patients to use in screening and selecting their treating rheumatologists and other supporting clinicians. If the Redditors here can provide such a \"database\" I am willing to format these data into a patient-friendly resource tool that, hopefully, can be present here on an ongoing basis in an easy to access way. I ask every specialist I see how many Behcet's patients they do/have seen. My rheumatologist currently has 3 Behcet's patients, me being one of them. And 1 of the 3 has not been \"confirmed\" to be Behcet's. \n\nI am lucky in the rheumy department. My current one works in the same office as my former, who passed away a couple years ago. I would been seeing him for over 20 years. I like my current one so much that I will even name drop him: Raphael Kieval, MD in Massachusetts. \n\nI started seeing a new ophthalmologist last year. As always, I asked her several questions about Behcet's. When I asked how many patients she is seen, she replied, \"I am going to be honest with you because I do not want to lie: You are the first confirmed case I have seen .\" I appreciated that because there have been other physicians in the past I suspect have lied to me about their Behcet's-patient count.\n\nI know I did not adequately answer your question but I wanted to reply an only had a minute to do so. But I am curious to see how others respond. I thought your response was great, Ellis. For one thing, it was realistic in that most rheumatologists are not going to have a lot of experience with BS. Given your long, complicated course with the disease, I am surprised that things have turned out so well for you.\n\nMy own experience has not been terrible largely, I think because I  quickly learned enough about the basics of the disease to be able to exercise some self-defense. Red flags for me were that the rheumatologist I was referred to had only treated three patients with BS, he was not knowledgeable about biologics and wanted to start me on high dose prednisone. I have many years of experience with patients on corticosteroid therapy and I consider it a treatment (Tx) to be avoided or minimized whenever possible. The term \"steroid-sparing\" has not become current in medicine for no reason.\n\nNeither my doc nor his support staff had any idea of just how severe, agonizingly painful, or debilitating the oral ulcers can be. I think this made them insensitive to the magnitude of suffering I was experiencing.  Because of COVID he refuses to see patients in person, so it was not until I sent photos that I got any Tx to manage the pain; lidocaine viscous, and tramadol. He was wholly unaware of the topical Txs such as minocycline mouth rinses, magic mouthwash, etc. The former significantly reduced the severity of the ulcers for me and I was able to make it myself.\n\nThe only three drugs he had ever used on BS patients were corticosteroids, colchicine, and more recently in one patient, apremilast (Otezla). I had a good response to Otezla, but within a few weeks developed stomach pain so severe that were it not for COBID I would have gone to the ED.  Reducing dosage did not help. My BS is unresponsive to corticosteroids both topically and orally -- no response to a Medrol dose pack. Ultimately I was Rxed Otezla. Unfortunately, during the time it took to get the scrip authorized ad the time the drug began to work I developed a roaring recrudescence of the oral ulcers along with skin lesions, leg pain, and profound malaise.  I have no obtained some dapsone and will, in the future, use that as a temporary bridge to control the mouth sores if  I need to change Tx regimes again. \n\nEarly on, when I asked if there was anything I should avoid eating or drinking he seemed surprised by the question and told me no. This was terrible advice that caused an intensification of symptoms that persisted until I learned from other sources that some foods can greatly worsen pain and even the degree of ulceration. In short, I experienced a considerable amount of unnecessary suffering and I am mindful that most patients will not be able to search the literature, consult with physician friends, and otherwise have the resources to know that they are receiving suboptimum care.\n\nWhere things get more serious is that neither he nor his staff had any conception of the incredibly diverse ways BS can present and progress. I developed discoloration on both feet that looked to me much like what I have observed in dying patients and in a condition called as livedo racemosa. I was told that Behcet's does not cause such \"rashes\" and to apply a topical antifungal and when that did not work to use triamcinolone (steroid) cream. After no response to either of these Txs I did punch biopsies of the skin, sent them to a histology processing service, and then sent the slides to a pathologist friend.  His diagnosis was a \"non-specific vasculitis.\" I forwarded those results to my rheumatologist after which there was no further discussion of fungal infections or shoe allergies. To me, knowing that my BS was systemic and affecting the small caliber blood vessels in my feet was important because it indicates that I may be at risk of other, less benign systemic vascular involvement. \n\nSubsequently, I identified a highly experienced and skilled rheumatologist who I paid out of pocket to consult.  This proved valuable not only because of the good advice and information he gave but because he knew a much more competent in-house rheumatologist with more experience with BS patients who is employed by my HMO. I am on a waiting list to switch to him and expect to do so within the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nI was given no information about the serious complications that can and often do occur in BS and there was no discussion of my treatment plan or any alternatives. I understand that most patients cannot absorb large amounts of information at once and that psychologically it may be better to handle some using the \"we will cross that bridge when we come to it.\" However, BS is not a cold sore, a case of athlete's foot, or even a soft tissue skin infection. You cannot or at least should not treat it as such and simply Rx a drug and say, \"I will consult with you in a month. \n\nIt is true that most BS patients will have uncomplicated disease that will respond well to the first simple Tx that is Rxed. But for those who do not they need to be informed of how to respond when signs and symptoms do not resolve and to be treated quickly and compassionately -- even it is only palliative pain relief. I became sufficiently dehydrated that I required 1.5 L of IV fluid in the ED primarily because this entirely foreseeable complication was not anticipated, let alone addressed. The ED doc who treated me in the midst of man ED overrun with COVID patients was less than pleased that I was not instructed on how to stay hydrated and not Rxed topical and systemic pain medication to make swallowing possible. \n\nMike Darwin Hello! I am a rheumatologist (can verify if needed by mods) and also have very mild Beh\u00e7et's (half Middle Eastern). I would like to say that because this is such a rare condition, it is unlikely that you will find a \"specialist\" in BD in private practice. Private practice rheumatology is a lot of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, lab abnormalities (positive ANA), and fibromyalgia. As with most \"rare\" conditions in any field, generally the time, resources, and concentration of patients necessary are only available at major academic centers. For example, a private practice doc would be highly unlikely to have a \"Behcet's clinic\" 1 half day a week whereas an academic center could. What you say is spot-on. What is more, most Behcet's patients will not have severe disease or will respond well and durably to first-line treatments. However, it is also true that many patients will have choices within their HMO, PPO, or other insurance to select among several rheumatologists -- in my case, I have three opportunities to change specialists -- and that some patients will have complex or difficult to manage the disease.\n\nMy first referral was to a rheumatologist who knew virtually nothing about BS and what is more, gave me harmful advice. Since I was rapidly self-educating myself about BS (including at the academic medical level) I pretty quickly realized that this physician put me at risk. What I did in response dovetails with the reality you describe. By looking at the peer-reviewed literature I was able to identify several researcher-clinicians who were arguably experts in BS. I was happy to pay the $350 cash to buy 40 minutes of the expertise of one of these men. By that time I had a reasonable grasp of the pathophysiology, treatment approaches, and various clinical courses of BS. What I lacked was any practical knowledge of how the latter two might apply to me and an expert opinion on what clinical course that I was most likely to follow.\n\nDuring this consult, I got a substantial insight into these issues and very importantly, the doc I consulted was able to point me to an in-house rheumatologist in my HMO who does have considerable experience in managing BS patients. Unfortunately, what I have learned is that many and maybe even most patients suffer prolonged periods of inadequate or even harmful treatment because their rheumatologist is clueless and has no interest in learning more about BS and managing it.  The message I have is to educate yourself as much as possible and not to rely on a doc who is not competent to manage *you*r BS. Do not hesitate to seek secondary opinions, and if you have the resources and are experiencing complicated or unrelieved disease, to seek out the expert clinicians you describe and who reside in big cities and are often university-affiliated. \n\nIn my case, I had a good response to colchicine but went on to develop intolerable adverse effects. Being told to take a proton pump inhibitor (that did not work) in the face of blinding abdominal pain and suggesting that my intolerance might be \"psychological\" was *not* acceptable. I shudder to think how many patients will not know that this is bad medicine or that they should reach out and try to find a more skilled clinician ASAP. \n\nNow that I better understand the pharmacology of colchicine and the likely basis of its gastro-toxicity I will probably try to resume taking it at some point in the hope of suppressing the \"residual\" signs and symptoms of my BS that remain despite treatment with apremilast. Similarly, I have obtained some other potentially useful ancillary drugs. All of these interventions will require oversight and the knowledge and objectivity of a competent physician (he who treats *himself has* a *fool* for a *patient*). If you are a BS patient and are receiving treatment that is ineffective or makes things worse, then I would urge you to try to better.\n\nOne of the great things about this forum is that it provides a resource for patients, new and old, to gain valuable information about the disease and about the rationality of the treatment(s) they are being given. The most out of touch advice I received from a rheumatologist was to be careful that I did not eat too much when I started steroids that my GI had prescribed, or I would regret it- \"a moment on the lips, forever on the hips\".  I had lost 40 pounds (down to about 90 pounds) at that point.  Runner up: had a rheumatologist write down a note of a special medication that would solve all of my problems... it was ibuprofen.  I have found that a dismissive attitude is one thing that instantly demonstrates that a provider is not a good fit.  There are not many physicians in my area that are familiar with Behcets, but I appreciate the ones who are at least willing to take it seriously and give their best effort. Some of my experiences:\n\n\"You cannot have BS because BS does not affect the throat.\"\n\n\"There is no food or drink you should avoid since these things cannot cause exacerbation in BS.\"\n\n\"BS does not cause red feet; use an anti-fungal\"\n\n\" I am only \"seeing\" patients via the phone.\" In fact, he has never seen me in the flesh and he has failed to look at photos documenting severe oral ulceration and skin lesions. I know what you mean- I have also had providers confused about throat ulcers, convinced it was strep even after negative strep cultures.", "Flu Shot Is it possible for a flu shot to trigger a flare? I have never been advised not to get a flu shot with Behcet\u2019s, but I have started developing several mouth ulcers less than 24 hours after getting one. Could be a coincidence, but my flares are usually only triggered by illness or stress. \n\nAnyone else experience flares after taking a flu shot or vaccine? I got my flu shot last week and I got absolutely nothing. So it either might be a you thing or not related to the vaccine itself. I know my mum has had problems with Flu Shots and Behcets. If I remember correctly it was from her cells attacking the bacteria that came with the shot thinking it was bad. I recommend looking into \u2018Live Vaccines\u2019 and the Beh\u00e7et\u2019s immune system. Similar thing is happening with the Covid 19 vaccine where if it is a live vaccine certain people will not be able to take it as their body will actually attack it. I hope I helped you, any more questions then just say :) Thanks for the response! I was under the impression most flu shots were not live vaccines, but I do not really know anything about that stuff. Thanks! I was advised not to take any live vaccine  as they can trigger a bigger immune response than deactivated vaccines. My doctors told me they can trigger a flare but it really depends on the person.  They also advised to take vaccine in a period without flare, basically wait after the last one. The nasal spray is a live one I think. But not the jab. I have not gotten a flu shot in over a decade. Every time I have gotten the shot, it is made me feel awful for days. And the last year I got a flu shot, not only did it make me feel sick for a few days - I got the flu like 2 months later! \n\nAs far as triggering a flare, it is certainly possible. Personally, I just try to keep my immune system strong by getting plenty of exercise and eating well. Plus vitamin C, zinc, and some other stuff. Now I rarely get sick. In the dozen-or-so years since I last got a flu shot, I have only gotten the flu once. I am not saying anyone should or shoudn't get a shot but, for me, it is not worth it. Unless a live vaccine you should be fine :)\nOnly the nasal spray is live I believe. My rheumatologist recommended for me get a handful of non-live vaccine because of humira. \nThat being said I would think it is normal to get a response like that that..unless severe. I always have a mild response from vaccines more so fatigue/joint pain ..I look at it like my kids. They get tired/irritable from them. To young to express anything more. So that is IMO stressful to the body. Not a doctor just my thoughts \u263a\ufe0f hope you are feeling better. Covid vaccine is not live, it is an RNA vaccine that does not have any of the Covid strain in it. Ahh nice! It was just what I heard a while back, thanks for the update :) Still not sure if we can take it but fingers crossed. Thank you!  Thanks for the response! I was completely fine with the flu shot. When I got Rabies vaccinated for my job it gave me Bells Palsy for about 2 months. I am concerned about taking the Covid vaccine though My fiance has Behcets. Can confirm she had her worst flare up ever following a flu shot.  If it makes you feel any better, I have now had both doses of the covid vaccine and experienced no severe symptoms. In fact, I think the side effects from the flu shot were worse for me. Of course, this is all anecdotal, but I do not think it is anything to be too nervous about. I got the first dose in December and felt horrible the next day. So sore I could hardly walk. I get #2 next week. I may just be really sensitive to vaccines. That is not going to stop me from getting it though. Glad you got through with little side effects.", "Very Overwhelmed, Please Advise I am (as previous post stated) brand new to this world, and also currently having the worst symptoms I have ever experienced and I need some insight plz.\n\nI saw my regular dr on the 18th and he prescribed what I assume is what he is allowed to without a diagnosis. He game me Augmentin for the blisters in my groin area, prednisone for obvious reasons, and Celebrex.\n\nAfter reading through these types of groups I was very hopeful, expectant even that these meds would make me feel way better; but I have been taking them for 4 days now and I not only do not feel better but in fact maybe worse.\n\nMy feet and hands are swollen and painful around the joints, veins in the palm of my hand are swollen and itchy nd my body is very flushed. when I touch it its feverish and turns white with pressure. My thumb and pointer finger are \"numb\" but also somehow irritated or tingly. I am sorry, I cannot explain better. Left arm has a small amount of weakness and I woke up with 3-5 bruises this morning. Also I have had bouts of feeling \"spacey\" or confused a couple times today, it only last for 1-3 seconds and Im not sure if that may be coming from the massive stress attack im working myself into.\n\nSo I guess Im freaking out looking at a future of this. Is this normal for the meds to take longer than 4 days to start working? Or is it common for it to get worse before it gets better? And does any one have useful tips about things I can do or take to help get relief? Home remedies.... anything???? Im sorry you are having bad symptoms! Not fun to deal with. I dont know that I can offer any advice but I do hope you can figure it out. I just started celebrex today so I am interested to see how I do on it. \n\nI am curious though, have your original symptoms gotten better since you started the meds 4 days ago? Do you think you could be experiencing unpleasent side effects from the medications?\n\nBest of luck! I hope you can start feeling better soon! I am so sorry to hear that. I have been living with my behcets diagnosis for 18 years now, (diagnosed at 17) once you find a balance it does get better. I am now medication free except for the random flair every few years. \n\nI was on colchine and plaquenil for years for similar symptoms. Prednisone was my go to for extreme flairs and usually could feel a difference within hours of taking it. I did try Celebrex but did not notice any improvement with it. \n\nTry and look further than the meds. Are certain foods making you feel worse, try and reduce stressful situations, etc. \n\nI wish you healing .", "Physical Activity with Behcet\u2019s Disease How has having Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease impacted your physical activity? I am a 26M who was diagnosed  last week after showing symptoms for over a year. I am currently activity duty and I cannot tell if physical training is irrelevant or if it is a trigger to flare ups. Hoping some of you seasoned folks might have some insight. Appreciate the support! Personally I found execise to be a trigger for a flare up, but once I flared up, I continued the exercise and now I think my body is used to maintaining that execise because I have not had a flare up in a while In my experience, consistent exercise has helped keep my flare ups in  the less intense end of the spectrum. my story is more or less the same. When I pick up dumbbells, I wake up with mouth ulcers the next day.  I am 24. But I using prednisone per day 1 pill and half pill. 5 weeks since methotrexate. I do not know what happens once I start to show full effect. I hope not because I have overweight and melting muscles. I find it depends on whether or not I am in a flare. If I have low grade inflammation, exercise will make everything a thousand times worse.", "Question on possible cause of behcet\u2019s (non doctoral opinion) Hello all,\n\nMy girlfriend has recently been possibly diagnosed with behcet\u2019s, she displayed several symptoms and tests for everything that it could be keep coming back negative, planning to see a rheumatologist to confirm.\n\nOne thing I have noticed from posts on here and personal experience is that a lot of people tend to develop symptoms after being in nature on hikes. My girlfriend and I had just been on a hike for the first time in a while when she started developing symptoms, and there are a few posts I saw saying the same. Has there been any research into this? Possibly a bug bite or an allergen response?\n\nKind of a stretch, but the coincidence seemed too strong to ignore. I honestly have no clue and I do not think anyone does.  Mine appeared during a period of extreme stress at work and then losing my job.  I think I accidentally inhaled ant spray because we had a ton of ants in the kitchen and I went overboard.  I think my immune system went into overdrive and that was the main trigger.  But no one knows what causes it, some say it could be genetic but no one truly knows.\n\nIs your girlfriend handling the symptoms okay? (Whatever random symptoms they are) hugs to you all.  It really sucks but know it will get better.  I have not had a flare in nearly three years (knock on wood) Just reread the end of your post and saw the part about bug spray.  I do not know if there has been any research on the subject but it would make sense if some pesticides if inhaled activated our immune systems that were already pre-disposed to flare up bc of Behcets. But I know that I had what I thought was a horrible yeast infection the entire month prior to the ant spray debacle. Guess I always had Behcets but that stress just set it off She is handling symptoms okay. I am holding out hope that this is somehow not behcet\u2019s as she had a slurry of random health events occur within two weeks of the possible diagnosis, not all of which could be explained by behcet\u2019s (specifically, a sharp pain in her lower abdomen). Trying to see a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic for further evaluation Hugs to you as well. What have you done that seems to help mitigate symptoms? Or is it truly random?\n\nI have taken the action of contacting my local parks services to see which pesticides were used in the area in which we hiked.\n\nThinking more on it, Pesticides on food could be a cause as well. I plan to wash all the vegetation she consumes with a spray to help remove all pesticides. I am actually more concerned with organic foods than with non-organic. I have heard that \u201corganic\u201d farmers have been known to make their own pesticides that are not detected in the tests they run to certify foods as organic. Not sure the validity, was told by a farmer I know, but it would make sense to me. At least the pesticides on non-organic food have been studied for some time. It is the most random condition.  My rheumatologist is actually not 100% convinces I have it because there are no blood tests to confirm it. It is simply just diagnosis by elimination.  My first symptoms were the genital ulcers.  I thought I had a yeast infection or an STD.  I was prescribed steroid cream for that which helped. But could not get into see a rheumatologist.  then my hands swelled up big time.  I will see if I can find pics.  I had random pain in my joints and my arm would fall asleep but hurt...which makes sense seeing as Behcets is vasculitis (blood vessels contract). I tested negative for Lupus and R.A. (All of this occurring the month before and during my wedding in May). Finally in November, my vision went cloudy. Everything was foggy. I went to the eye doc and she told me I had uveitis and to see a rhematologist asap.\n\nMy gyno then told me that my \u201cyeast infection\u201d was actually autoimmune ulcers.  If you good search\n\n\u201cUveitis\u201d\n\u201cVaginal ulcers\u201d\n\u201cJoint pain\u201d\n\nBehcets is the only thing that appears. So I actually diagnosed myself the day before my rhematologist did.\n\nShe put me on Colchicine which did wonders for me.  Some people cannot handle the gastro side effects but I handled them like a champ lol and it cleared everything up for the most parts.\n\nI have been off of Colchicine for over a year now because we are trying to get pregnant.  We are actually about to start IVF on Saturday so hopefully I will not have any flare ups associated with it. \n\nSorry to unload my entire diagnosis on you! But remember we do not know what causes Behcets.  But I do not doubt that environmental factors cause flares.\n\nIs having any issues with vision? Ulcers? I definitely could see there being an allergic component. Multiple times when my bf had major flare ups he had recently traveled to Amsterdam and eaten spicy Indian food at the same place and then had a gin based drink at the same bar after.  I will post an update once I learn what pesticides were used near the hiking grounds My first flare was definitely none of that, just straight stress from starting a new job.  I guess I may have technically had a flare (all mouth ulcers, totally different than later flares) a couple years before that, but I do not remember what could have caused it. Doctors at the time blamed my terrible college-student diet.  I had plenty of stressful times between those two incidents though and no flares, so...??\n\nI thought I had a good grip on how the disease worked (it is been 7 years, 5 since diagnosis/starting treatment), but mine's switched it up completely over the past few months and I have been constantly flaring for no apparent reason, so I feel like I am back at square one.\n\nBut before that happened, I used to think I only flared when I got sick (in retrospect I may have just been noticing the flare itself--throat ulcers!) and with my menstrual cycle.  This specifically excluded my allergies, actually--I have awful tree/grass/weed/fruit/nut/animal allergies and am miserable every spring, but none of my allergy symptoms have ever triggered my Behcet's symptoms. I think Mine was caused by a Trumatic experience, yet I am not sure I have bechets. I have realized drinking a lot of water has made my symptoms stop. I sometimes go into these drinking about 5-7 bottles a day and it helps a lot. \n\nTO MY POINT: I have been symptom free for many months thankfully but I went to a pool in a backyard and got bit all over! And I have gotten two ulcers. Feel a little bit of bothering in my eyes (one of my common symptoms Blepheritis) and I truly think all the bug bites is making my body act up a bit.  You could be onto something. I was never much for the words or hiking. But I do remember when I was about 20 I got mono really bad. Most people get over it in a couple months. I ended up with Epstein-Barr virus for almost 5 years. I think that was linked to it", "Eye issues Hey, I had a weird journey lately but my Rheumatologist who I saw for the first time this week believes I have Behcets. (despite being a white girl from NA) \n\nShe suggested we start on humira and formulate a plan after my MRI and x-rays come back. \n\nI have been having increasingly severe cases of uveitis that do not seem to be helped by steroid eye drops. She mentioned Humira would help the eye issues, but she had to run some tests and said she would call it in then. I have not heard back on that, and woke up today with more vision loss and pain. I made an appointment with my opthalmologist (second one this week) and called my Rheum, but I was wondering what I can expect for my Opthalmologist to do or am I wasting his time? Heya -- are your eyes very clearly red and inflamed? or is the vision just impacted? Are you photosensitive?\n\n  \nHow did your eye pressure look? I do not have and never had red eyes. I tend to get panuveitis, but I only ever feel it when it creeps forward. \n\nI have incredible photosensitivity. No fun. \n\nAnd my pressure is consistently over 25 in each eye. I was diagnosed with glaucoma in December before I ever found out I was having recurrent Uveitis. Thanks for the response. I am currently battling a vision issue. Eyes are slightly blurred and very photosensitive. However, while eye pressure was high a few weeks ago (25/27), it is currently 15/17.\n\nWas your optometrist able to immediately see your issue? or did they tell you all looked good (aside from the glaucoma damage that was spotted)?\n\nHow long do your vision symptoms last? Do your eyes return to normal? So I went to the eye doctor for eye pain, got told I had glaucoma but all was well otherwise. Kept following up on glaucoma testing for vision loss, and more issues creeped up, like extremely dry eyes and things like that. I got awful pain one night, went in the next day and had anterior Uveitis. Since then I have had it in both eyes at some point over and over. \n\nTo be honest, I do not know if they missed it, or it is only there during a flare. They are not great doctors and I am going to a specialist in another state next month finally. \n\nHe referred me to rheumatology, which was good, but otherwise seems not concerned by my vision loss. \n\nAnd for the record, I have had \"normal\" eye pressure, but it is always when I am not in a flare. My symptoms go together for sure. \n\nAt first they did not last long, but now I am noticing I am always having eye issues. Similar to the rest of you... 10 years ago I would had iritis grumbling along..  then woke up on a Monday morning with zero sight in my left and my right rapidly reducing...\n\nLots of drugs later I was left with nothing in my left and 15% in my right on the nasal side and cataracts in both (thanks Pred) ...\n\nI have a uveitis specialist in the city I live in (thankfully) so every 4-6 weeks he still checks them over..\n\nI am on CellCept, Prednisalone &amp; Infliximab (plus all the other ones like Sertraline,  Tramadol etc etc) and it is all quite steady right now..\n\nMaybe our ophthalmologists should all have a chat..?? I am on humira now and my eyesight is seemingly better most days, although it still fluctuates. I am hoping that I can get confirmation soon that most of my eyesight has been saved. \n\nI am driving 6 hours in a few weeks for the closest to a Uveitis specialist I can see reasonably so I do not need to go to the doctor in New England, but I have not totally dismissed that idea yet. \n\nMy eye doctors kept telling me it was not that bad, not to worry, that I just needed to figure out what was causing it until one check up he said \"have you made arrangements for low vision living?\" \nLike...no! You told me I was fine!", "Pending diagnosis Hi all! I am still pending an official diagnosis but according to my rheumatologist, I either have behcets or crohns. \n\nI am wondering if anyone else gets smaller, pimple like genital sores. (I also get them in my mouth like that, but they fit the more classical mold). I get them often and painful. They are eventually rupture and form smaller ulcers, but they start as pimple-like. I also get bartholian like cysts. I do not know for sure that is what it is. It sometimes goes away eventually but will sometimes ulcerate. I have gotten 5 or 6 in 2021 already and they are incredibly painful. \n\nI seem to only find really severe cases when I Google, so I also wanted to put this here in case anyone else has similar things. I recently started colchicine, but I have not been on a therapeutic dose long enough to see a difference. \n\nThanks! They look like acne right? I have never had any turn into ulcers, ulcers are in a slightly different area and 100000x more painful but I get little acne/cyst/bump things at least once a month. My rheumatologist says they are just folliculitis and my gynecologist said that some people just get things like this, I recently realized they may be connected to the body acne (I forgot the real term for this) that is related to behcets. \n\nI just started otezla and have a colchine prescription at the pharmacy I need to pick up. I am really not liking the otezla though, I think I am going to call tomorrow and see if I can stop taking it. \n\nI was also kind of diagnosed with Bartholins cysts years ago because the doctors I saw did not have a better guess. I hope something I wrote makes sense or helps you! I get pustules all over my scalp. I get some too. I always assumed I just had weird scalp\u2026. Yes! They do not always turn into open sores - but sometimes. But I get the acne-like ones often. I thought they were folliculitis but I get them where I have no hair too\u2026. Same. I get all kinds of lumps, humps, and bumps all over. I have always got at least one or two somewhere. Most are small and do not bother me. Occasionally, I will get a large cyst somewhere. But they never turn into ulcers. Like you said, those are 100k-times more painful. I think I would not notice if these did not bother me, when I first notice them they tend to feel like my underwear is pinching my skin, so I will readjust but it will not change the feeling so that is when I know I have got one. Then they will typically hurt when I wipe (depending on location) I have some topical lidocaine that I will use on them until they (or if) they grow more of an acne like \u201chead\u201d, then I will try to pop them (if you use a sewing needle or pin and only poke the \u201chead\u201d it will not hurt because there are not nerves there) and squeeze out what I can then cover the area with antibiotic ointment. Yeah I used to\n\nDoes not Crohn\u2019s have a test to diagnose? My doctors diagnosed me with Behcet\u2019s basically by process of elimination and symptoms That is where I am at. Waiting for a colonoscopy for that final rule out. Both can have very similar symptoms :/ good luck. I do not even know which one is better. I guess it does not really matter The devil you kind of know versus the devil we guess about True. Both can be very severe too but I feel like Crohn\u2019s has more treatments That is how I feel too. I do not really want either, but one has more research and more treatment options. Also pending formal diagnosis however my doctor has consistently gone back to behcets\n\nI get genital ulcers every month without fail at least once (even while on prednisone) and I have noticed the smaller pimple like things you have described as well! I also would not notice much like you have said but I get that god awful annoying and slightly painful undies stuck in my crack feeling \n\nBefore being on prednisone full time (been 6 months) I would have very severe flares both genitally and orally.. I would have upwards of 10 giant sores in my mouth that took weeks to heal all while getting one or two new ones a day.. then I would get a few ulcers downstairs and god almighty the pain was insane, I could not even walk or go to the bathroom without tears.. it was that flare that got a doctor to take me seriously! He recognized the intense pain and saw me through my worst flare and thank the lord he kept me on my steroids so I never have to go through that again! \n\nI still get small flares but I am waiting on a few appointments before adjusting meds so I stick it out on my constant prednisone and up the dose at the first sign of ulcers \n\nCrohns has never been mentioned but I will now do some more research and take it up with my physician Yes! The smaller pimple like ones feel like hairs being tugged and get itchy. But I get a few bigger pimple like ones that eventually ulcerate that rub in just the right place to make sitting, walking, anything uncomfortable. Like I bought a bidet and have never made a better choice. \n\nMy doc is considering crohns because I have a family history, I have had IBS symptoms since I was 10, and he is considering the likelihood of crohns with a rare (genital) symptoms or a rare disease that is not seen often in my demographic. I have had a  \u201cprobable behcets\u201d diagnosis for years now. I need one more symptom in a new bodily system for them to confirm it is behcets. I am currently dealing with the fact that I came down with transverse myelitis and the rheum and neuro docs are at odds about whether it was neuro-behcets that caused it.  The neurologist says it was the behcets but the rheum is skeptical.  The rheum believes I have behcets but I do not have quite the criteria to definitively say it is behcets since I do not get genital ulcers.  \n\nIt is the nature of this disease with the relatively small amount of research into it and the rarity of it In the western world. There is not a test for behcets. They rule out everything else and then say maybe it is behcets.\n\nBtw OTEZLA is the most amazing med for oral ulcers. I went from 6-10 ulcers at a time for a week at a time every other week. To not having one ulcer in the last 6 months.", "Persistent headaches and nausea at the same time every afternoon, am I alone? I try not to blame every ache and pain on bechets but I am not sure what to think anymore. At least two full weeks (spread out amongst the last fifty days or so) I have been experiencing a tension headache followed by debilitating nausea. It happens nearly every time around two pm. I also just had an outbreak in my mouth, really deep painful ulcer inside and a very tender hot to the touch lesion on the outside. Does anyone else experience this type of sickness? I have to lay down for several hours until it passes and it is usually just me trying my best to pretend it has. Help What meds are you taking? Any that would cause nausea? \n\nI have also noticed that when I am flaring my water intake requirement is through the roof! I usually have to add a Gatorade or some other type of electrolyte drink along with ~70 Oz of water a day to avoid headaches. \n\nGood luck \ud83c\udf40 Im not on any medication currently. I am waiting to see a rheumatologist because I do not have one locally. I usually drink a little over a gallon a day, funny I  almost put that in the post and changed my mind. I have daily migraine and both rheumy and neuro have agreed it is from BD. I have been dx with neuro bd though and tests have shown damage to my cns. I hope you do not have the same complications but if you have not seen a neuro definitely get one in the mix. Good luck!\n\nEdit: to your comment about drinking a gallon of water a day....try less water and adding in some gatorade in on a regular basis maybe. My doctors had me pull back on just drinking straight water because they thought I might be flushing my system out. So even though you are drinking plenty of fluids you might still be dehydrated and that will also cause the symptoms you are having. Just a possibility from my experience. I will go grab some Gatorades. Thank you for the advice :) This happens to me as well, and I have not been able to find a remedy other than \u201cwaiting it out\u201d in bed until it eventually passes. Please do let me know if you find anything that helps. I was diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s last year but have been dealing with this for quite some time.\n\nHope you feel better soon!! I hope for you too and of course I will share anything that will help. I am sorry youre going through it Close your eyes and massage your face by pinching your nose at the pressure point where your nose and face connect.  Add a drop or 2 of olive oil.  After a while you should feel decongested and blow your nose.  After that you should not have a headache.  Try it and let me know I drink enough water and I sleep at least eight hours so unfortunately it is neither of those things. Did you try the massage?  I think you need to sweat as well.  Have you been exercising/sweating much lately? I get this but they happen at 2am. I used to think it was a bad hangover until it happened when I was not drinking. Mine turned out to be migraines. There is probably something in your diet causing it, Google migraine triggers and see if anything lines up. Once they hit take some aspro clear (dissolvable apsirin) and turn off all the light. Try to sleep through it.\n\nAlso if you smoke, having more than 5 cigarettes in a day increases your chance if getting one. Generally I do rest through them. I am not eating differently than I have in the last several years so I am not sure it is my diet. I will look into it. I hope you can figure it out. I know how unfun they are and would not wish them on anyone. I have this happen but only when I am having a flare up. So like every two or three weeks. I have not yet had this happen during a flare up. I have this on a semi-regular basis. In having this long term chronic and painful disease, we have a lot of stress that other people do not. It sounds weird, but maybe get your neck and shoulders checked for trigger-points and muscle dysfunction by a physio.  These areas are a) prone to inflammation b) where the body stores \"stress and pain\" as tension c) build up a lot of cellular waste products that make you feel hungover when blood flow is restored.\n\nSince treatment with a physio I have learnt self massage and trigger point in this area and about 80% of my headaches (typically referring to around the ear, above the eyes) have gone. When I do get one, I can self treat.\n\nAn easy and relatively safe way to check if this might be involved, is to have someone press (hard!) on your trapezius muscle where you have a knot. It will hurt, but if you suddenly go blind from a headache and can feel the pain there, you have your answer. Thanks for your detailed message. I just recently received an x-ray for neck and shoulder pain. Turns out there is a lack of natural curvature in my neck causing spasms. I hold all of my tension in my shoulders, it often feels like I am carrying cinder blocks I can never put down. I do attempt self massage but its not helping me much. It is interesting that you say the thing about feeling hungover, because that is what it feels like. I feel like I am dehydrated but I drink at least a gallon a day, so I knew that was not it. And yes my headaches are usually around or in my eyes and above my ears and arch to the top of my head.  I will look more into physio treatment, and have my partner help check the muscle you mentioned. Thank you for taking the time to write this!", "Idek wtf is going Okay so basically I have got mouth ulcers, and all the other stuff like joint pain and genital stuff. But I keep getting mucus in my poo. And my pee is cloudy and burned this morning but then stopped burning. Idek if it is bechets or something else. Please help. What is your diet and hydration at? Yea you need to see a doc. The burning and mucus are not behcets things and your sores could be other issues such as an STI. maybe you got herpes and the clap at the same time It could be syphilis and syphilis is one of the most common diseases on earth (after herpes) Whatever it is, go get it checked out. If it is an STD, it will be super easy to treat. if it is autoimmune you want to get the symptoms documented. The only way you get an autoimmune diagnosis is by spending years documenting and testing things over and over again. it is super frustrating.", "First Symptoms to Diagnosis Just wondering about the experience of this disease generally. I may or may not have it and am curious.\n\nI have had oral ulcers for seven years with my other symptoms developing/ getting more severe over the past two years. Only in the past couple months has anyone talked about Behcets. \n\nWhat has your timeline been like? Also, where are you located? My condition hit hard and fast almost 6 years ago. I was in great physical shape after a summer of intense hiking, and when I returned to finish my last semester of college I started with multiple large extremely painful mouth ulcers (all over the tongue, inner cheek and gum line) I started losing weight, nausea, then acne and skin ulcers, and a progressive consistent cough all within the first 4-5 months. I saw multiple doctors with no diagnosis. After about 8 months I saw a pulmonologist for the cough, and the X-ray showed growths in my chest (which later were found to be aneurisms) this led to a full diagnosis of behcets about 10 months after the first symptoms at Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville Tennessee. My worst issue has been those aneurisms, which carry an immense bleeding risk and I nearly bled out several times. Nearly a year after my diagnosis I had surgery on my chest to embolize the last aneurism that had not healed on its own. Since then my medication has kept me mostly symptom free. I get the occasional mouth sore when I get overworked or overstressed. Also, my aneurysms are rare even by behcets standards so I would expect most people to not have that issue. I am also lucky enough to have not experienced any eye problems associated with the condition. Upon first diagnosis I was put on Prednisone and chlorambucil. After about 6 months I was switched from chlorambucil to mycophenolate, a much safer drug, and I successfully got off the Prednisone a little more than a year ago. It is been a hell of a trip. That sounds like a hell of a year. Glad your medicine is doing its job! I started having terrible mouth ulcers when I was 18. These were often accompanied by very high fevers and candida of the mouth. That is a pain I would not wish on my worst enemy. At the time I was having these outbreaks every 2 months or so. Sometimes they included my eyes, sometimes they did not. I was diagnosed (incorretly) with everything from herpes to gluten intolerance. I moved from Texas to New York when I was 20 and the outbreaks slowed down a bit. Somewhere in this time frame I had a cough that lasted nearly 2 years and severe swelling of my ankles over the course of a year. Eventually I ended up on my own insurance and took matters into my own hands. I saw several doctors in NY that all suggested dietary changes, vitamin supplements. I finally saw an immunologist to talk about Sjogren's as I figured that may be an answer. He suggested Behcets and said it would only be the third case he had ever seen but he wanted me to see his colleague to confirm. I saw his buddy, a rheumatologist, and he said that it sounds very likely but there is no real way to confirm. I could do the genetic test, but it may not make sense. They put me on colchicine and now I only take it when I feel like an outbreak is coming on. It has helped tremendously and having a name for my \"mystery disease\" has changed the way I face it. My symptoms change as the years go by - now my body likes to give me itchy ulcer/rash bumps on my back and legs along with the mouth sores but I rarely have eye issues. Who knows what next year will bring......! 11 years post-onset. I had mouth ulcers my whole life (as a young kid my Mom would make me hold alum on them - gross).  I then had a random bout of uveitis in my mid/early 20's.  About 7-8 years after that all hell broke loose over a 4-5 month period. Diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, had uveitis twice, aseptic meningitis and then a CVT (in transverse sinus).  Oh, I was also told I had \"herpes\".  I told my GI Doc (he was my savior) about that, he looked and said \"that is not f'in  herpes\" (I had been crying and lamenting my cheating BF) and dragged me in a gown through the back of the hospital into the GYN department, grabbed about 5 GYN docs and they all crowded around and looked at crotch and agreed I did not have herpes, but my first behcet's genital ulcers (yay super fun). These days I have mostly massive fatigue and skin crap.  Super hyper sensitive skin and lots of skin ulcers. ", "Please help! Feel like my symptoms are pointing to Behcet's Hello everyone,\n\nI am a 30 y.o. F. I have been having been struggling to confirm what it is that is going on with my body in the past 7 months and feel like I have a lot of the symptoms that is described in Behcet's disease. My first symptoms were neurological. I felt like bugs or critters were crawling along my skin from the top of my head  down to the soles of my feet. I thought I was going crazy, brushing my arms and legs like something was there, but there was not. Then the pain in my stomach appeared. It feels like a tight squeeze to the right of my belly button for a few seconds multiple times a day. The crawling sensation eventually went away, but I do experience neuropathy in my hands and feet as well as muscle spasms in my back and sporadic burning/ prickling sensations along my back and legs. I also have involuntary tremors of my left eyelid that began recently. \n\nIn the last month I started feeling a burning sensation in the genital region and thought I had a UTI. I went to the obgyn and when she examined me she told me I have two ulcers that resemble herpes. I also had a oral sore on my lip at the time. I was devastated to hear this news. She took a culture which was incredibly painful and prescribed me antivirals. Well it turned out the culture was negative and I later went for blood work to determine if I had a herpes flare and it was negative for both types. Since then, I have quite a few canker sores in my mouth. The gential ulcers have gone away, but I am left with a tingly, itchy, burning and inflammed sensation down there everyday. It is so uncomfortable. It is taken a tole on my mental health and I just want to know if anyone else has experienced continuous pain and decreased sex drive after experiencing this. It makes me so sad. I am getting married in a few months and I am just not in a very good head space. I am very grateful that my fiance is the most supportive human being and has been my rock through this all. Would love to hear other people's experiences and input. \n\nThanks for reading this. I am very thankful for this subreddit.", "How likely am I to have Beh\u00e7et\u2019s without the genetic marker and eye symptoms? In July (two weeks after my first dose of the Moderna vaccine), I started getting this intense itching inside my vagina. I then ended up with extremely painful internal ulcers. \nI went to a clinic who diagnosed me with herpes (I have had it before) and gave me antivirals and lidocaine. \n\nThe symptoms eventually passed and I thought I would just had a herpes outbreak triggered by the vaccine. Just for context, I would only ever had 1 very mild outbreak in 2016. This was confirmed as HSV2. \n\nA couple weeks later my herpes test came back negative. Fine, I thought, maybe the test just did not pick it up. \n\nAt the beginning of august, I get the exact same symptoms. Intense itching, and then ulcers, both internal and external. Also, since the onset of my first round of ulcers, I have been feeling mildly unwell, similar to a post viral kind of feeling - heavy muscles, aching hands and feet, exercise intolerance. \n\nThis time I also got sores on my fingers, ulcers in my mouth  and a weird round red mark on my legs. \n\nNegative test for herpes again. The nurse suggested it could be Behcet\u2019s. She did the test which looks for the gene and it came back negative. So her theory was that it was a random occurrence of benign ulcers as a response to the vaccine. \n\nSince then, I have still not felt 100%. I was not having any more outbreaks but I have still been getting the other symptoms like joint and muscle pain. \n\nThen just yesterday, I got another flare. Intense itching, a sore on my finger and the red round spot on my thigh again in a similar place. \n\nI am about to speak to my GP and demand a referral to a rheumatologist but it is the U.K. so I am not overly optimistic. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or had a similar experience?", "I am new here. Help! I am still on the quest of trying to figure out what I have. Behcets was just recently suggested again from an immunologist after many years of being told it is not that by several other specialists. \n\nIve had severe clusters of oral ulcers since I was a child and more recently, I now call them flares as they come cyclically with periodic fevers, sore throat and extreme fatigue. They are debilitating. I have no genital ulcers and have only had severe joint pain a couple times so far mid flare. I always have Back pain and inflammatory issues related to other conditions. I have had GI issues since my 20s-I am now 40. All my blood work comes back normal and no signs of Crohns disease or UC so far. I have taken Prednisone for 2 years at the start of a flare and it was great to manage it. But as soon as my body stopped responding to it and it needed a higher dose, I went off it and all hell broke loose. It is been back to back flares for 7 months now. \n\nOther things like RAS, PFAPA and Sutton\u2019s disease have been suggested in the past. I have been on the hunt for 10 years and still nothing. \n\nHow did you all get diagnosed? Looking to find support, support groups and the best of the best specialists so I can finally get a diagnosis/and or treatment. Open to feedback and any or all suggestions! Thanks! I got dx after seeing an ophthalmologist and him telling me I had pan uveitis. I had never heard of uveitis or behcets before then, but he told me to see my doctor who ran some blood work. I was having other weird symptoms, like weight loss, skin lesions, low fevers, joint pain....stuff like that. I actually do not get ulcers very bad in my mouth and I have never had them on my genitals but my first rheumatologist suggested I had behcets based on the severity of everything else. \n\n\nI take immunosuppressants and they mostly work. I am in a flare now but I am still worlds better than I was. \n\nAnd I am split over having gpa or behcets, personally. I have a lot of new hearing loss and ear pain issues too. Hi :) I have BD. Frankly, the diagnosis took a couple years and seeing multiple physicians. Happy to share what has helped me. BD is a diagnosis of exclusion,  meaning they have to eliminate every other condition and you have to meet criteria. Many rheumatological diseases have cross over symptoms such as cancer sores, rashes, etc. I started with my PCP and he ran blood test, referred me out to other specialist based on my symptoms. In all I saw PCP, OB/GYN, Gastrointinterologist, Endocrinologist, Urologist, Hematologist, Neurologist, Opthamalogist and a Rheumatologist. They a mean tests, xrays, procedures  even had a surgery. Meanwhile, I started a health journal and would take note of my symptoms with pics. Doctors like pictures!! My Rheumatologist is amazing and was able to make a diagnosis with all the information. Truly life changing for me, as I was able to get on meds. :) Still use my health journal to track my symptoms and flares in response to meds; working on finding the right combination since I am having trouble with remission. \n\nDiagnosis and treatment is isolating. BD occurence is about 1-5 per 100,000 in the US, higher numbers along Sulk Road countries. However,  I feel comfort with diagnosis, and am hopeful for future treatments. :)\n\nHope this helps. Best to you. Feel better soon. Interesting, thanks! Thank you so much!!! This is Incredibly helpful and 100% relatable. I have now seen three different rounds of every specialist there is over the course of eight years or so. So this is the 3rd time I am back at the drawing board because all my results never turn out alarming enough to get me diagnosed with something. I finally found an amazing immunologist that is connecting me with some researchers and other doctors who are willing to do a more extensive work up with me. What was the final deciding lab work or pattern of symptoms, that brought them to the BD diag? \n\nWhat meds are you on? Or what did you try vs what you are on now? What does remission look like for you? \n\nI have not gotten a formal diagnosis yet but I am en route to gathering all medical records labs etc again to send off to the next round of docs. I love your suggestion re pictures! You are right-docs do love them! And especially Important for people like us that do not always have visible symptoms when needed or with the myriad of unrelated symptoms that are constantly in flux. I keep a journal of various symptoms but it is hard to keep it up daily for all the things. How do you keep track? Handwritten? App? \n\nWishing you feelings of ease and peace today! Happy this information helps. The process of diagnosis can be tedious,  but do not quit. Treatment helps and if you can find a good doctor it is life changing. \nSo I had a number of symptoms for years. I had been diagnosed with Celiac disease at 22 and over the years, it seemed to have progressed or so I thought. Number of misdiagnosis. All these weird episodes of joint pain, fever, fatigue, GI pain. In my late 30s, started to get really sick. That is when I started to go to the PCP to try to figure it out. Did all the blood work under the sun. Every test came back negative. Saw 6 specialist. I had surgery because my OB thought it was severe Endometriosis, but instead she found a cervical ulcer (took a pic and she did a report). OB sent me to Gastroenterologist, because they were sure it was Crohns. Had an endoscopy and colonoscopy, not Crohns. I had been to 9 specialists and I had exhausted all my options. I was so sick I could not eat, walk, I thought I was going to die. Ironically,  both my parents are physicians and my Dr. Mom called a favor into a Rheumatologist. He looked at all my medical history from 18 years old, blood work, surgery report,  procedure reports, xrays. He did a physical exam and reviewed my health log and pictures of my legs, hands, throat, etc. He was able to make a diagnosis from all the information and physical exam. I will never forget when he told me I had BD; I really had no idea what he was really telling me. \nCurrently,  I am still pursuing remission. Some BD patients do well on Otezla, however I did not, as it did not help my throat ulcers. I did see improvement on my face. Right now I am on Aspirin, Colchicine, Methotrexate, and daily Prednisone and each medication has helped. I take  higher steroid burst when I have a flare. Aspirin prevents blood clots. Colchicine helped with, GI, ulcers and joint pain. Methotrexate has resolved my neurological symptoms. I would like to start a biologic in June, as I have heard many BD patients have gotten in to remission on these treatments. I have found that overall I have had to adjust my lifestyle to better take care of myself for the long term. So I try to reduce my stress, rest, take my medication,  light exercise, eat healthy. Flares have continued and some days are quite painful. However,  I psychologically cope by remembering Mother Teresa, \"No one can do everything, but everyone can do something.\" Be calm and live in my moments,  knowing they will pass. \nI do a daily health journal. I do a typed note form in Google docs and take pics with my phone. (Poor soul that ever finds this phone, going to think some weirdo obsessed with their hands and throat! LOL) I prefer to make notes myself, however there are apps out there I have seen. After doing this for years, there is a definite pattern to my flares. Every 6 weeks I flare up and need a steroid burst. Even now, BD will fool me, I will feel good and then I crash and burn. As I have tried different meds, I have been pleased with the health journal because of the feedback I can give to my doctor. :) Wow. Best response ever. THANK YOU. This really sounds beyond similar to me! More than anyone I have ever heard. Saving this post! And yes, what poor fools find our phones. They will be scarred for life. What a journey you have had! And you did not give up. Truly amazing. Your quest, dedication and hope is inspiring.", "I have been diagnosed recently with Behcets but am sceptical. Hello everyone. I (M20) was really excited to find out there is a sub for behcets so I could talk about it.\n\nAs the title says, I was recently diagnosed with behcets. I have had mouth ulcers since I can remember and  I just lived with them as a child. When I was around 17 and I become sexually active with my current gf I started to get genital ulcers. To begin with I was told they were friction sores and I was prescribed an antibacterial anti inflammatory cream. Since then I have not been able to have any type of sex life as any injury causes ulceration and I will randomly get \u201cthe itch\u201d around stressful times which indicates ulcer formation even without sex. I am currently in the middle of my worst outbreak of penile ulceration so far. Thankfully I have a good cream for the inflammation and I think it has a local anaesthetic because it reduces the pain. \n\nWhen I when to my latest doctor he suggested behcets. I went to a rheumatologist who barely even knew what behcets was. He actually spent the whole session googling things about behcets. I do not have eye problems and for some reason I can get a wave of ulcers in my mouth but not genitals and vice versa. I was prescribed colchicine but I do not know how to take. Is it 2 little pills a day or what is it even for. \n\nWhat I mean by I am sceptical is that I do not know if I even have behcets or just another condition that causes mouth ulcers or penile ulcers or both. I live in Ireland and know no one else with behcets. \n\nDo any of you think I have it and if so is there any thing I can do to try have a normal sex life? Also I was curious, does circumcision help? From what you say, it sure sounds like it could be Behcets. I sometimes have one symptom flare up without the others or all of them at same time. Keep checking with rheumatologist, he is willing to learn about it to help you, that is good. Keep in mind, it is rare, so very few doctors are experts. A GI doctor might help too. Do not get discouraged! The colchicine helps some folks, it is usually taken twice a day, am &amp; pm. Never give up, never surrender! It sounds like you *may* have Behcet's, but it is impossible to know for sure without more information. The three trademark symptoms of Behcet's are eye inflammation, genital lesions, and oral ulcers. Sounds like you have got two of the three. However, there are lots of other symptoms that often (but not always) go along with Behcet's. \n\nHave you experienced joint pain, unusual swelling, other skin problems (besides the genital sores), fatigue, brain fog, hot flashes, dizziness, or any other symptoms commonly associated with Behcet's? How about any tests like the pathergy test or genetic tests for genes associated with Behcet's like HLA-B51? A Behcet's diagnosis can only be made after looking at your symptoms, considering the results of these and other tests, and ruling out differential diagnoses (other possible causes). \n\nAs for your sex life, you will likely be able to have a long, healthy one. Throughout my teens and the first half of my twenties, I always had a crotchful of sores. I was super self-conscious about them, though no women seemed to notice. But for the most part I was still able to have lots of fun. Fortunately, for me, the genital ulcers stopped on their own about 15 years ago and never returned. As for circumcision, I doubt that will help. Unless, of course, most/all your sores are around top part that would be removed. Otherwise, I would not recommend chopping part of your dick off. Even thinking about it makes my already-circumcized penis cringe. I hope this helps. Best of luck! Sounds like it could be Behcets. A lot of people with no \u201csilk road\u201d heritage do not have the eye problems more commonly associated with it in countries like Turkey and Japan. The colchicine may help even if it is not behcets so I would give it a try but if you are not sure how to take it ask your doctor or pharmacists. They should give you a slip of paper with any prescription with directions as well, but call them if not. Most doctors are not familiar because it is rare and you are lucky if your doctor is interested to learn more for you. Paying attention to your symptoms and talking to your doctor is important to manage whatever it may be. Thank you :-) Appreciate your answer, thank you :-) Thank you :-) Just be glad your physicians are not dismissive, and quick to give you treatments options! (Even if you feel they may be wrong.) I think based on your symptoms, Behcets definitely seems like the most likely option. Although the fact that friction seems to initiate lesions is interesting to me, as I saw this video about a gentleman who had a condition where his skin structure was weak which led to ulcers and lesions in his groin and armpits, the areas which rub against each other the most. How are your arm pits? I get spots their sometimes but not really anything there I might have had mild uveitis in my eye at some point.. but not really a primary symptom for me.\n\nOral ulcers, mostly on the soft palate, and anywhere on my gums with the slightest injury, ulcers on my scrotum when I am super stressed, and seem to be exercise/heat related. (an hour walking in our summers.. I am going to be miserable for a few weeks. Almost like clockwork), and I get little red pimple looking sores that can just breakout at random on my arms and legs.\n\nI take Imuran, colchicine, and do bouts of prednisone when they get bad.\n\nAS long as I stay on top of the colchicine and Imuran.. I do mostly ok.\n\nI am prescribed colchicine 0.6mg, I take a whole one with breakfast and a half of one at night, because if I take a whole one in the evening, I usually get woken up diarrhea . :\\ Hi!\nI have been on cholchin and very little pred for 2 years now. 2x 0.5mg cholchin one the morning and one in the evening. When I take it regularlly and i mean every single dosage. I get almost no ulcers at all. My doctor told me ot can take up to 6 weeks to take effect. Also I have no side effects. Now for you that could be different. \n\nWhen you take it a couple of things are important. Over long periods your blood values should ne checked regularly. Mine are checked every 1/4 years. Also look out for the mentioned side effects. For example mine says that I have to wait 6 months after taking it before i should try to have children.\n\nFor me it is a live saver! Ah okay thank you Thank you bud. I think I will do a lot more research on the matter. LMFAOOOOOO Hehehe, this the best you can do? I insult your intelligence so you prove me right hahahahaha? I am genuinely laughing right now, thank you for that :-) What strikes me as odd is that you did not start to get the penile ulcers until becoming sexually active, correct? Yes, around 16-17ish. On the other hand I have had mouth ulcers all my life. That is really interesting! I am glad you found a doctor willing to look into it.  \n\nJust out of curiosity, did your doctor ever recommend testing for HSV1 &amp; 2? No, my doctor referred me to some type of specialist and the guy knew next to nothing about it. He just googled almost everything and charged me \u20ac200 (glad I do not live in the US but still a lot for a 19 year old college student). I am not surprised he did not know much though, it is 1 in 300,000 or so people here in Ireland, which means statistically there is only about 15 other people in the entire country that have it. I am sorry to hear that! I would definitely look into ruling out HSV1&amp;2 at some point. Some doctors will not even give you a diagnosis of Bechets until that is ruled out.", "Are vagina ulcers with Behcets extremely itchy? I had what I thought was a herpes flare up and have been on antivirals for 5 days. My symptoms were: \n- feeling tired and achy \n- one ulcer on my labia. It is more like a big swollen bit of skin with a bit of ulceration \n- extremely sore inner vulva and vagina (to the point of bleeding) \n\nI went to the clinic today where they visually examined me. She did a culture then and there and said she did not think it was thrush. She also said herpes was unlikely based on how it looks and also the fact that the anti virals were taking so long to work. \nI have also had some mouth ulcers this week and a random sore on my finger. She suggested it might be Bechets so I am waiting for blood test results. \n\nMy question: does it cause extreme itching on the genitalia? For me this symptom is worse than the pain. It is like a tingly insidious itching around my inner labia and inside my vagina. I had another outbreak earlier this month and both outbreaks started with intense unbearable  itching. This has got better but again today it is starting to increase a bit again. \n\nI was given steroid cream to treat it so I am trying that too. \n\nDo Bechets type ulcers come with intense itching? I am at my wits end trying to figure out what this is so I know when it will stop (blood test will not come back for a couple of weeks). \n\nThanks in advance for your help! I have the same problem. I use Monistat Itch relief. That is the only thing that helps. Find yourself a good Rhumitologist who knows Behcets. Yeah I am waiting for the blood test result then they said they will refer me to one. And thanks for the rec, i am in the U.K. so will try and find an equivalent. :) Personally (26f) I find they get itchy and the best thing to do is resist the urge to scratch, I was also prescribed a topical cream called Oracort and I apply some over the problem area. I find it helps protect the ulcer and allow it to heal properly. \nWishing you all the best. Ok thank you! Did you find you get itching around the whole genital area not necessarily where the ulcer is itself ?  Mostly I find it is in the general area of the ulcer, not just the ulcer but the area surrounding it too. I also get ulcers on my legs and arms and sometimes torso and with those I also experience the itching in the general area. Like a nice large circle area around the ulcer feels itchy, scratching has caused some to grow to alarming sizes in the past so I avoid it big time. \nIf I am really going nuts I will try putting some ice for a few minutes at a time like 3mins of ice and repeat as needed. (obviously being careful of sensitive areas) The can be itchy sometimes. I use dermoplast spray. It helps with pain, burning, and itching. It makes it cooler and number. Also from the UK, there are 3 centres of excellence with multidisciplinary clinics. Basically a morning where you get to see all the docs in one place. There is one in Liverpool, Birmingham and London. Definitely worth checking out if you are even semi-local. Some patients I know travel for 4 hours to come to Liverpool. They really are awesome clinics! Oh great, I am near London so could definitely do that. Just waiting for the blood test results to see if it is Behcet's but if it is positive I will definitely look that up, thank you! Even if the bloods suggest you do not have Beh\u00e7ets, push for a referral anyway, not all Beh\u00e7ets patients have the HLAB51 markers. I do not but fit every other criteria going! X What are the blood tests for? My understanding is that test can only rule out OTHER potential causes for the symptoms and Behcet's can only be diagnosed based on a combination of clinical presentation. Ah... Is there a blood test for HLAB51? I thought a genetic test would be needed for that. Sorry you are experiencing this. I have not really noticed that for me it just feels hot and sharp pain but I also have body aches that are so bad that all I do is sleep for a week or two. I have been given creams to numb the area so that might help to ask your doctor for something because if you scratch it, it will probably slow the healing and make it worse whether it is Behcets or something else. If they perform a particular blood test (anti-coagulated blood sample- ACD) then they can look for the HLAB51 alleles which create the antigens that are linked to Beh\u00e7ets You are correct but many  (not all) behcets patients are carriers of the HLA B51 allele which is associated with behcets. This is found with a blood test. It is not necessary for diagnosis but can point a rheum in the right direction.", "Diving after thrombus in lungs My doctor is in his holidays and I cannot ask him. \n\nI think there should not be any problem diving (it will not be very deep anyway), but I would like to try it this August. I had some thrombus in the lungs, coughing blood and stuff, they treated the bleeding and the cause (Beh\u00e7et) and after that they did not check if there were any thombus left, chances are that they are still there, at least some. Would that be a problem with pressure underwater? I never had any lung issues like that but I have gone diving with no problem and worked as a lifeguard. I always keep some prednisone on hand for odd situations that may cause a flair before it gets bad.", "(22, F) I just got the first dose of the Moderna vaccine and I have been diagnosed with Behcet\u2019s for a year. \nAsk me questions! Did you just get it today? Another fellow posted about getting I think it was the Pfizer one, felt fine the first day and then hit by a train the next. I got it yesterday. I feel totally fine. My arm where I got the shot on feels sore af. Otherwise, no symptoms beyond normal behcet\u2019s stuff. On my way to the gym and then to work! How did you qualify at age 22?  Was it due to Behcets or other? I work in a residential facility and live in Vermont which has been quick to roll out their vaccinations. Glad you are not feeling like a train hit you! Dose one has been a doozy for me. Cannot wait for round two \ud83d\ude44 Oof, sorry to hear that! Are you on any medications for behcets? Were you instructed to stop/pause them while getting vaccinated? Thanks for sharing!! Otezla and colchicine and nope! Second dose was worse. I was bed ridden for one day, but fine after that. :)", "I have been keeping a diary for several years, but until now I have kept it to my self... I have decided to turn my diary into a 'Blog' ... so please can you give it a read and let me know what you think? It is my 1st experience of doing something like this so please be nice! This is me - Thanks xx  How do i read it?  The image shows the website ", "Does anyone here have this type of rash, it is on my lower right abdomen, my skin is very sensitive, is this a symptom of behcet\u2019s  I get more of a red burning rash on my legs and feet. But Rashes are a symptom ..are you having any others? I also get erythema nodosum and knee swelling along with body aches &amp; fever when my rashes come. I also have erythema nodosum, have muscle twitching, nausea, dizzy, numbness in the left hands and feet, recurrent mouth ulcers, stomach ache and diarhea sometimes after eating, cold feet, and flushing, my doctor thinks it is a vasculitis, but it is not clear which one. I have raynauds, so I get the cold hands and feet/numbness as well. And ulcers in my mouth and vulva. I was tested for  hsv (negative) along with a million other tests before finally getting diagnosed. It is so rare that I think it takes them a long time to consider bechets. I also carry the gene as I have fmf and am Palestinian. All the stuff you are talking about I have and a few other things. Abdominal pain could be ulcers there or just issues because of bechets. Have you seen a rheumatologist? I will say take pics of everything ..it is so helpful for the drs as it is a clinical diagnosis. Especially early on \ud83d\ude0a I made an appointment with the rheumatologist on the next Monday. I just went to the gastroenterologist and hematologist, thank you for giving me advice and wish you good health. It could be the beginning of shingles, especially since it is in a line like that. Glad you are going to the doctors. Good luck! Thank you! Yep I get them on my right side during flare ups. Always is gone in the morning then shows up around mid day. Mine is dimmer on the morning and redder in the middle of the day, sorry for asking but are you have any other symptoms? Oh yea. Mouth sores, skin lesions, joint pain, random headaches. Thank you for your help, I really need this valuable information to help me with the diagnosis. I do have something similar but I do not really know if it is related to behcet. It looks just like yours, I usually have it in my legs, around my bellybutton and in some parts of my abdomen.", "Could this be Behcets? Started rapidly like a virus with body aches and fever, then just a mouth explosion - spreading yellow leukoplakia, tongue and mouth ulcers. Swollen, red and bleeding gums. It was incredibly painful - burning and blistering sensations.\n\nI saw 6 specialists who all had high suspicion for autoimmune. Postive ANA with Titer 320 and speckled. The oral stuff cleared up with Magic Mouthwash but even a month later I am still using it cause if I stop it tries to come back and I get dry coughs. I cannot get into Rheum until late November so just wanted to see if *anyone* had this or knows what it is. Second Otolaryngology opinion in early July. Do you have genital ulcers? There are several things that can cause the symptoms you have described. But, as far as I know, the only thing that causes large, open ulcers in the mouth and on the genitals is Behcet's. Without the genital ulcers, Behcet's might not fit. \n\nOnly a doctor can diagnose or rule it out. But in my non-professional opinion, it does not sound like Behcet's - it *almost* sounds like it.  I do not know how I missed it before, but I just looked at the photo you attached. Those look nothing Behcet's ulcers. Behcet's sores tend to be large (up to the size of a quarter), round, open ulcers. If you have not had any genital ulcers, I doubt a doctor would make a Behcet's diagnosis. Especially if you also have not had any severe eye inflammation or other common Behcet's symptoms. \n\nThat being said, your condition very well may be autoimmune. Behcet's is just one of over 100 autoimmune diseases and there is plenty of overlap between illnesses. So I think you are at least barking up the right tree. You might not have found the right branch, but you are likely looking in the right place. \n\nHere is my advice: consult a rheumatologist - maybe two or three if you disagree with/do not like the first. Test, test, and test some more: hormone panel, vitamin and mineral levels, metabolic panel - the more information you can get, the better. Believe me: I know how hard  and frustrating it can be trying to get an accurate diagnosis. But it sounds like you have got a good attitude and know what to do. The fact that you are reaching out online, looking for answers is great. \n\nAgain, only a doc can diagnose Behcet's. But to me, nothing you are describing sounds like it. It DOES, however, certainly sound like it could be autoimmune. Perhaps others here will have a different opinion but, if I were you, I would look in a different direction than Behcet's. Best of luck to you. Be well!  Preface: I am not a doctor, just relying on personal and academic experience. \n\nI will echo EllisMichael - it does not fit quite right with Behcet's in my opinion. It does look like oral thrush / oral candidiasis based entirely on the picture and symptoms. Oral thrush / oral candidiasis is also treated with magic mouthwash, so that also fits with what you have described. \n\nHas a doctor sampled/biopsied your mouth? A quick sample would show them if it is viral, fungal, or immune-mediated. Has a doctor tried putting you on anti-fungals yet?  My Behcets did look like that but also had major ulcers during my first major flare. I am no doc so I have no idea if it is Behcets but you should be seeing a rheumatologist way before November. What country are you in?  Good luck. Be your own advocate. You can make things happen. Can you please update if/when a \"discovery\" is made?  This looks a lot like thrush to me. Have you been tested for HIV? Just as a precaution \u2014 I am just alerted by the viral feeling beginning and now thrush. That looks like oral thrush to me.   Okay good! Interesting. Im officially stumped", "Seems like I am going to start with adamilulab, any experiences? I have read about some nasty risks in internet, and I would take it for a long time, so I would like to know about other people and their experiences with it. I have taken worse things (ciclofosfamida in Spanish), but just for a short period of time. Miracle drug. I have been on it about 2.5 years. Previously I was on Remicade (infliximab) for two years and was off a regular medication for a year before I started Humira. I needed to go for infusions with Remicade but with the Humira i just give myself the shot every two weeks. It has been very effective at suppressing my neuro-Behcet\u2019s, more so than Remicade. No side effects, such as infections, or anything else I have noticed. \n\nInterestingly I developed an allergy to Remicade hence my getting on Humira. Thanks!", "I got ANA negative. I know there is no blood test that can confirm Behcet but do anyone had Behcet but negative ANA titer? ", "Behcets, pregnancy and thyroid issues Has anyone else struggled with obvious thyroid issues but have issues with blood work revealing the issue? \n\nMy thyroid levels are always on the verge of low, my symptoms obvious thyroid involvement. Stumps my doctors everytime and always leaves me with no answers/treatment. Now with my third pregnancy and sure enough my thyroid is giving me issues again.\n\n-pain and swelling in my thyroid area\n-increased asthma\n-27 lbs increase in the last 12 weeks \n-extream fatigue\n-confusion\n-swelling in my face (practicality over night)\n-muscle cramps and joint pain in hands\n-loss of hair \n\nI feel like my doctors do not believe me when I tell them I eat healthy and burn between 2600-2900 calories a day on average. It is so frustrating. I was literally about to whip out my fitbit app to prove my point. My doctor just dismissed me as \"must be eating too much salt then\". \n\nI am over these doctors not bothering to look into Behcet's and vasculitis issues. Anyone else have an idea on what to do next? I developed thyroiditis after delivering my last baby. Hyperthyroidism, but I felt hypo physically, then hypothyroidism with depression. But my blood work showed it. I am sorry you feel like garbage. Do you have a rheumatologist? My inflammation hardly every shows in my blood work. One of the most difficult parts of the disorder for me. They always have to biopsy or ultrasound. Even with my  1 pregnancy when my water broke my amniotic fluid test came back negative after it was witnessed breaking. Stumps everyone every time. My levels are on the verge of low but have not tipped into the red zone. Im seeing my primary today. Rheumatology will not see me until I go to mayo and recommend I go to loyola or rush because they said my condition is \"above their level of practice\" mainly because they think their is another underlined condition to the neuro behcet's. It is a mess. I am rare girl. \n\nI got pregnant when I was sicker than ever. I just started a new med 3 weeks before I conceived. Baby blessing for sure but also still alot of unanswered questions.  Currently 14 weeks So you have had previous confirmation with ultrasound and biopsy and they will not treat you this time? Sounds like you need a new GP.", "Urinary tract problems with behcet\u2019s? I have been dealing with painful urination and something like annoying burning in my uretra for almost 3 weeks that comes and go, along with veeery mild pain on my lower abdomen and back, one side At a time. \n It can be due to behcet\u2019s? Or i might have gravel elimation? I have always suffered with urinary issues, and when my urine is tested it comes back negative for any bacteria. So years of taking unnecessary antibiotics later, I have realised that I do get inflammation of my bladder and/or urethra. I now keep phenazopyridine tablets, which are available over the counter where I am from...and they help ease burning. \n\nI also discovered that my urinary issues were DEFINITELY exacerbated by eating high oxalate foods..such as almonds, potatoes, spinach, okra, tomato paste and/sauce. If you research oxalates you can get a list of foods to avoid. This has dramatically improved my bladder issues and I can really tell the difference when I reintroduce those foods.\n\nIn short- I do believe Behcets can account for bladder issues and discomfort which is often misdiagnosed as urinary tract infections. \nBe careful with lower back pain as that can be a sign of kidney infection.\n\nFeel better!", "99% sure I have got bechets Reoccurring mouth sores (almost never actually leave) eye stuff all that bs. BUT recently I have been drinking an insane amount of water. Not tap water but gallons of bottled water. Swear it is helping. Like I do not want to say anything to sure bc we know how this goes but I am serious Have you been to a doctor? What does s/he have to say about the mouth sores, \"eye stuff,\" and \"all that bs?\" I am not doubting you, just curious if you have talked to a physician about your symptoms. I have. He says it is difficult to diagnose bc the multitude of seemingly random issues it can cause but he wax pretty sure and prescribed \u201ccochine\u201d or something like that. I think it works? I typically have to take prednisone fairly often and respond well to it quickly which made my doctor lean more towards bechets. Colchicine. It is commonly prescribed for Behcet's. Prednisone, too. I would suggest seeing a rheumatologist, if you have not already. But even specialists can have a hard time diagnosing Behcet's for the reason you said. Unfortunately, there is no single test to diagnose it. But there are tests that can support the diagnosis or at least rule out others. When I am in the middle of a hot flareup I absolutely adore alkaline water.\n\nI do not care about any of the other health reasons people go with a high PH water, but any that you can find in a grocery or health store feels like silk and I swear it helps them heal faster.\n\nMeds have been keeping the sores at bay though, and I just drink regular tap/bottled water most of the time. The rheumatologist is who prescribed the medication. I have been dealing with this for years now and only starting to get close to putting a name to whatever this is. But the slclosest me or any doctor have come thus far is bechets. Very strange. I initially thought I was going to have a heart attack because I had high cholesterol (before I suspected I had Behcets)\u2026I stopped drinking literally every drink except water for months and some of my symptoms subsided just from that decision.", "Burned my tongue with toothpaste, any ideas on what to do? My tongue just feels terrible right now. I switched toothpastes and the new one destroyed my tongue, it is numb and it is extremely painful to eat, besides tasting bad. Does anyone have any tips to recover quickly or help with the symptoms? Try swishing with Manuka honey OR try swishing with children\u2019s Benadryl \nSpit out whichever you choose to do. Obviously, it will not cure it, but it will help heal maybe a little faster. \n\nI also take dissolvable zinc tablets. Try those. They help heal faster too Thank you so much! I will definitely try it. L-lysine helps heal the skin. I have been taking it for years, I see a difference in my symptoms when I do not use it. I get tongue numbness after using toothpaste  sometimes that lasts a little while i dunno if its behcet specific  tho. I was scared it was neuro but yall are right could just be skin surtace I use something called gengigel here in the UK. Its hyaluronic acid which speeds up the healing process. Perhaps try a more gentle toothpaste. I use Kingfisher fennel flavour which is SLS free. My dentist said do not use toothpaste at all. She recommended baking soda mixed with rubbed sage. It is not bad and no more sore tongue!", "Peptide therapy Anyone try peptide therapy?  42f  Thank you", "Does anyone get neck pain? The past few days I have had pretty bad pain in my neck. It is mostly at the top by my throat. It is worse when I bend my neck or turn to one side. I get pain at random places throughout my body so it is not super unusual but I always manage to convince myself of the worst. Everything seems to be blamed on Behcet\u2019s but it is hard to tell when it could be something concerning. A few months back I was having chest pain so I ended up going to the doctor and they could not find a cause so they just said it was Behcet\u2019s. Does anyone get neck pain? I hope it is nothing but I am worried about it", "How was your experience with Humira Hello everyone I hope you are doing well ,and you are in a remission or at least having the least pain and suffering possible . \n\nI am about to start my humira treatment tomorrow ( am 21 male and it started a year ago ) and I am slightly nervous from the horror stories I saw in the main site reviews. \n\nMy question is for those who took it in all honesty how was it ? How was your first few weeks ? Did it help ? And if someone is using it for at least 5 years  did you notice anything or any side effects? \n\nAs with any immunosuppressive treatment, how did you manage your lifestyle ( like did you started to wear masks frequently, go to the gym more often , eat a specific diet , etc..) ? \n\nThank you and have a good day :) I was on Humira for about a year, and I had no major issues with it. I did not wear a mask anywhere (this was pre-COVID) and I did not really change my diet. At the time I worked with children and I did not notice I got sick more often, but I eventually started to get sinus issues which were not caused by infection. Recurrent sinus issues is a listed side-effect of Humira, so I swapped to Remicade and I think it works even better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did notice a huge difference within a few injections after starting, and I noticed that I felt great the day of and day after, normal for about a week, and sick for a week and then I did my next injection and it started again. I liked that I could do it at home because Remicade is an infusion I have to go get and it takes half a day to do. When you mentioned \u201csick\u201d did you mean the sinus issues or the typical symptoms of bechets? Sinus symptoms. My main Behcets issues were uveitis &amp; arthritis pain and it helped both immensely Thank you for sharing and am glad for your improvement , have a good day . I took it for 2.5 years and I did so well. I was symptom free until it randomly stopped working. I do not do well on biologic drugs anymore but that is kind of my body being stupid. So what is your treatment now if I may ask ? I did six months of Cytoxan infusions and now I am on IVIG, meds for seizures and colchicine for ulcers. I periodically do steroids though I hate them. My disease impacted my gut and nervous system quite significantly so this is sort of where we are. I do not want people to be afraid because we are all different in how our bodies react to Behcet\u2019s. I was unlucky but I am still happy with my life or at least trying my best to be. I am so sorry to hear that  , I hope it gets better for you every day , and I agree being depressed about it will not solving anything, it will just make it worse . Thank you for sharing your honest experience I started back in November. Lost some of my appetite when i first started, but that is seem to go away. it does burn so INCREDIBLY bad no matter what and where I seem to try the injection. I have settled into doing it at night, in my leg and cursing for 20 minutes, and then just relaxing the rest of the night. Have you tried the citrate-free version of Humira? I have heard it is night &amp; day in terms of pain. I have only ever tried this version of the injection and do not experience any pain personally.\n\nI also inject myself monthly with Emgality for migraines, and that one burns SO much so I understand your pain. I was pleasantly surprised with the Humira. it was a nightmare to get my medicaid insurance to even cover this one and i just started it so i have been sucking it up the past 3 months in hopes to ask my doctor at my appointment in march if he can switch it to the citrate free one", "Remission? Has anyone who has Behcets gone into remission? I know from years of research and reading that it is entirely possible. I am on the more healthy side, fortunately. Through years of therapy, treatment and research I have been able to *mostly* get a handle on Behcets. \nLast year around November I cut back on my Colcrys prescription to once a day, from twice, because it was giving me such awful upset stomach. I missed my regular apt in January to check up and get all of my refills &amp; actually ran out of my Colcrys 3+ weeks ago. I had an apt last week which got changed to a \u201cTeleconference\u201d but my doctor never called me. So fast forward to today, here I am, no medication but also no flare up &amp; no major issues. I think I might be in remission. Diagnosed at 18, I was on plaquenil and colchine daily from the time I was 18-25. Was always really sick, rashes and sores, everything. One day it just pretty much stopped. I have not taken immune suppressants since 2011 and just take prednisone now for the occasional brief flair. The only thing that has never really gone away is the oral ulcers but i find that to be pretty manageable after all I have been through. So yes, it is very possible. Thank you for the feedback. How wonderful for you! I usually keep a Prescription of prednisone on me at all times.\nWhat type of toothpaste are you using? I have been 99% oral ulcer free for 3 years now after switching my toothpaste - it is been life changing.  I now use Thieves toothpaste from Young Living but I have also heard reports of Berts Bees providing the same relief. I was diagnosed with Bechets at 8 years old, but I would had symptoms since I was a toddler. Around 18/19 I stopped having any of the symptoms that originally led to the diagnosis. I am 31 now and I have had maybe 2 or 3 ulcers since, but none bigger than a grain of rice. On the surface, it seems to be fully in remission. I have not taken any medication for it in years. \n\nI am concerned however, that I am growing into some of the other aspects of the disease. I have got arthritis pretty bad in some joints, and my vision has steadily gotten worse each year. (I am only 31, lol) I also have chronic GI issues and headaches. That could also just be aging, stress or issues related with the other auto immune stuff I have. I was diagnosed with Psoriasis and Lyme disease somewhere in the mix of all that too. Before covid I was getting close with remicade. I never thought about the toothpaste. I just get normal brands. My issue with the oral ulcers is I guess more \u201ctrauma\u201d based. Like even if I sleep on my side and a tooth puts too much pressure on my lip or something I will get an ulcer. If my dog bumps my face, ulcer. If I bite my lip or tongue it is an automatic ulcer. Very similar to you! Symptoms since I was a toddler, dx at 14. I had my worst flare at 16 to the point of eye ulcers and the was in remission from 22-27 and my doc took me off all meds. I was also the healthiest and most active at that time (minus drinking). 27 hit hard along with a lot of life changing events that lead to stress and I have been getting mini flare ups for the last four years with a major one a year ago that put me back on long term prednisone and otzela. I started getting Behcet\u2019s mouth ulcers at 18 years old and am now 27. Also had rectal ulcers. My Behcet\u2019s is in \u201cremission\u201d or \u201cdormant\u201d I would say. Mouth ulcers have \u201csolidified\u201d in one area of my gums but almost no new ulcers for many years now. No pain. Rare days with rectal pain. \n\nMedications (pharma): none \n\nHerbs/Supplements: high quality herbal supplements and vitamins and minerals to support immune system and deficiencies.  \n\nDiet: 100% real foods. Fruits, veggies, organic and grass fed meat/chicken, eggs, wild fish, beans if you tolerate. I will throw in cheese and crackers or ice cream like 1-2 meals a week. \n\nMental health: therapy, decreasing your stress levels, meditation for four years, spirituality, self development, mindset. \n\nLifestyle: moving my body, walking, some form of movement daily. \n\nStress is the #1 cause of flare ups. Diet, too. Dx at 16 y.o., sxs since 11/12 y.o. Off meds 2010, asymptomatic since 2009. Pretty wild ride, involving major vascular surgery and aggressive meds, but now I am 29 and straight chillin' (knock on wood). I know I am lucky. If you want to talk shoot a direct message :)", "Hello I have behcet's syndrome, mostly through out year I have mouth ulcers, and other symptoms are very in frequent. I tried various diet changes but no matter my mouth ulcers come back.\n\nIs there any way to systematically narrow down causes like type of food, sleep, stress etc so we can improve out quality of life?\n\nAny test, like food allergy or something else help? My CRP and ESR is always very high, does that increase my chances of cardiovascular diseases?\n\nAny other useful tip to know BD better? It hard.  Many of those things are just not the cause.  See a primary care doctor and then get a referral to a rheumatologist.  I did that for 2 years and best thing I did was get to a rheumatologist.  \n\nPlus if left un treated it Can start impacting other parts of your body like eye. I am living with this for past 10 years, I visited lot of doctors but not very helpful, mostly they prescribe steroid as I am mainly affected with mouth ulcers I generally apply locally betnesol tab with glycerine to ulcers it give me immediate results and no need to take steroid shots. I have not visited any doctor and I treat myself, eyes are ok I will go for yearly checkup and it is normal so far. I believe no doctor can help me more now, I read more about this disease from internet only. Nope, tried pretty much everything from creams to uv treatment, it seemed whatever worked did not work the 2nd time around. All I did was look at Something to numb them so you can actully enjoy your life You have not found the correct doctor yet then. Keep looking for one tho, my eye involvement did NOT come up gradually, I just woke up one day blind in my left eye. I did manage to partially recover my sight but not completely. A doctor that is ready to answer a phone call at any moment helps a lot.\n\nAs for the ulcers, since I have been on Humira + Prednisone I have not had any. Any kind of local medication did not work for me at all, I would just live with the horrible pain. It is sad to know about your experience but I am apprehensive about you saying \"I just woke up one day blind in my left eye\", did you not face any symptoms like blur vision, eye pain etc?\nBtw your medicine one is immunosuppressant and other is corticosteroid and that is what I said doctor does not have any medicine except steroid and/or immunosuppressant. I keep reading new medical journals but nothing so far that can treat BD.\n\nSo, how long you took these medicines? Does that fix your problems or any relapse? your BD seems to be aggressive than mines. I find that my ulcers are worse when I am overtired or stressed. I find a great way of quickly helping the situation is Bonjella teething gel for babies. Yes, even tho the oculist said it is impossible that it just happened, I did not feel any symptoms like blurred vision before that morning, I just woke up and could not see.\nThe diagnosis was an edema of the optic nerve that was treated with Prednisone. \nThe thing about Beh\u00e7et's is that there is no cure: we can only cure the symptoms (for example my eye problem with Prednisone or the mouth ulcers with other things like Colchicine) but not the disease. This is why immunosuppressants are the usual prescription: they are able to make your disease \"dormant\" and decrease the frequency and severity of the symptoms.\n\nMy experience with Adalimumab has been very positive: just one injection every two weeks and then I am done. It does cause some severe fatigue the day of the injection, but I would rather take one day of being tired over weeks of feeling that excruciating mouth ulcer pain. Thanks for descriptive writing, definitely stress must be common cause to all of BD patients.\n\nBut I would also suggest you should avoid taking too much steroid, these can lead to another issue in long run, rather take rest and wait for some time so symptoms suppresses itself, if pain is too much then go for steroid. My one doctor advised me 80mg injection and there of to take maintenance doses  over a month while tapering quantity of medicine till end of the month.\n\nThen I was not aware about that these medicine is steroid, later I try to avoid as much as possible until it become too much to take.\n\nAlso, for me changing toothpaste to SLS free helped, but I do not have courage to use SLS toothpaste to prove my point but I assume now it helped me.\n\nI had done food allergy test, found that i am allergic to Almond, egg and etc. I felt egg does not cause much problem to me but eating almond result in ulcers in nest 2-4 days.\n\nAnd I would also suggest do not entirely depend upon doctor to know this disease, know it yourself too so you also know what you need to do next if your symptoms worsens.", "New diagnosis, figuring things out Despite there not being a lot of activity here I thought it might still be a useful community to know.\n\nI am a fit and active 26-yr old female. A short time ago, after developing some frighteningly severe ulcers following a 97-mile hike, I received a tentative diagnosis for Behcets, contingent upon recurrence. Well, things have just started feeling recur-y. It is rather disheartening since I have only just recovered last week from my inaugural episode. My only consolation is that I am now equipped with a fast-pass to the front of the clinic queue and that we can jump straight to treatment, instead of dicking around with various testing. I will be going in tomorrow.\n\nAs a side note, I am a trained immunologist (the aforementioned hike was to celebrate defending my PhD). My specialty is T cells, but you can be sure I have started doing my reading on Behcets! I received my first symptoms of behcets following a 3 month internship with a national park. My job was hiking in the wilderness for those three months so I was misdiagnosed with random infections due to me wilderness-ness, which I had to correct every time I saw a new doctor. \"So I hear you were in caves?\" \"No! For the last time that forest had no caves!\"&lt;-- me for like 6 months of stupid doctors. Congrats on the PhD, I am sure you are a smart immunologist Ah yes, the process of eliminating every possible confounding infection, no matter how implausible. It is a fun one! \n\nI was impressed by the communication between my doctors. I was on a short business trip in another city when things became bad enough to get myself looked at, and they gave me a physical copy of their (very thorough) notes from that day to bring home, and my home doc was able to use them and what he saw a week later to put together a diagnosis in what seems to be record time (based on some of the horror stories I have heard!) Lol. This made my laugh. I do not know how many times I had to tell them that I would already been tested for HIV and that I had not been to any 3rd world countries. Yes, I have two cats but it is not cat scratch fever!", "Otezla side effects - how long do they last? Hi everyone! I have been on Otezla for about a month and a half now - I finished the 30 day starter pack of tapering on the medication and am now taking the 30mg dose twice daily. It is drastically decreased the number of oral ulcers I get, but I am having many of the typical side effects  -- GI distress/nausea for a few hours each time I take it, general appetite decrease, and persistent post-nasal drip.\n\nI am inclined to stick it out given how much it is helped with the ulcers, which have always been my most frequent Behcet's symptom, but these side effects are a lot to handle if they do not eventually go away. For those of you who have taken it long-term and had these side effects, how long did they last? I had the same experience. The nausea and stomach discomfort got better over time but never went away completely. I found it helps if I take it alone (started taking it at noon so it was not at the same time as my morning pills), and drinking a full glass of water each time. On the whole though Otezla has worked really well for me, and the side effects at this point (~6 months later) are relatively minor compared to the benefits. I get really nauseous after i take a dose for an hour or two to the point that i stopped taking it before work. It does get better than ramp up but I still have nausea and gi symptoms. You may want to experiment with timea and food no food. I take mine with food in the morning and Pepcid in the evening, which has seemed to help a lot with gastric pain and nausea. As for the other side effects, I cannot say if mine have ever worn off or if I have just gotten better acclimated to them. I know for sure I stopped noticing after 2-3 months. Having tried a few therapies for Behcets, I would say the Otezla has been the most convenient and effective therapy so far, with the fewest side effects overall. Stick with the therapy for as long as you can! It is worth it. For me the side effects of otezla started harsh and in a few months became negligible. I also take cholcris daily and have zophran when I am feeling especially nauseous, but it is not often and if it happens it is probably because of how I choose to eat. Drink lots of water. I did not even realize folliculitis was something Otezla could help with, but mine has gone away since, too... Pepcid is a good idea, especially as I already am naturally quite acidic/have acid reflux. Thank you! Still in the early stages of the experiment, but yesterday I started taking a ginger supplement (helps with nausea) an hour or so before Otezla, and my nausea is definitely much less substantial today. Thank you so much for your responses! Really good to hear the side effects subsided after a few months! It is such a game-changer not to have a mouth full of ulcers that if there is any chance the nausea can improve longterm I will try to stick it out There is no official study confirming this. Only oral ulcers are confirmed to be treated but it is thought that otezla may help with disease course and reduce inflammation  long term. Lets hope. I had great luck, no major ulsers for about 8 months, wearing a mask constantly for work does seem to make it comme back from time to time, but prednisone clears it right up.", "Am I alone/crazy? Skin issues So, I think I have Behcet's (ba dum tsss). I guess I havent gotten an official diagnosis yet, but my doctor is basically waiting on another biopsy to come back negative and has already started treating me. What I am saying is, we are pretty sure. \n\nI am in my mid twenties now. I have had mouth ulcers on/off for as long as I can remember. The obvious first symptom. I had multiple issues with other body parts throughout my life, but they were always ultimately undiagnosed with symptoms treated by specialists of whatever realm, and then forgotten. Until it happened again. You know the cycle. It was always attributed to something else or nothing/anything at all. It is finally all just coming together. \n\nI am not entirely sure of the point of this post except to maybe just hear if anyone has dealt with something similar. How I have come to finally getting a doctor to look deeper into this is through my skin presentation.\n\n I have read about multiple rashes being a symptom of Behcet's, but I get e x t r e m e blisters. I was convinced I had bullous pemphigoid for a while (negative). But that is basically exactly what it looks like. It started on my feet. Minor trauma would cause a blister. A blister that basically festers and continues to spread wider until it finally bursts (usually due to another accidental trauma). It spread around my feet; you can seriously follow the trail. Then it started appearing on my lower legs. And finally, my inner thighs and mainly, hips. (Actually kind of forgot I would get blisters/trauma on my hands a lot as an earlier-presenting symptom). \n\nI have been very lucky with my symptoms and doctors relatively speaking thus far, but this particular symptom is driving me INSANE and makes me feel pretty gross and even more unusual, seeing as I cannot find any account of the same in someone else. I have paper thin skin. ANY thing will rip my skin open and it heals poorly. And now, my hip are ALWAYS itching and burning like HELL, breaking out in a ton of blisters and open sores, and unfortunately never wearing clothes is not an option. \n\nHas anyone been driving this wild by their outside \"protective\" layer? I have done everything to ease it What else can I do?\n\nTL;DR: Extreme blistering skin. CRAZY itchy hip with very large blisters. How can I manage this pain and discomfort outside of wearing loose dresses all the time? It is impossible with my work but work is becoming unbearable. Just want to know I am not alone.", "Anyone have any reactions to the Covid vaccine while on Humira? So afraid of a flare in oral ulcers for my 15 yo kid.  He has only been on Humira for 4 months and without suffering with oral ulcers the last 2 months. Rheum now wants him to get the Covid vaccine but initially told us he is not to get any vaccine while on Humira. He had Covid back in February before he went on Humira but new Delta strain has me worried\u2026 another flare of his Beh\u00e7et\u2019s also has me worried (first time he has been out of depression - socializing, happy, smiling - in the last two years). Any experiences shared are appreciated. I am on Infliximab/ Remicade which is close cousin to Humira and I had no issues No issues on Simponi Aria and Otezla. Did you stop your medication to take the vaccines? Did you have to stop your medication? No they said for mine, which is administered every 8 weeks should have been administered at least a week earlier. Also not to take steroids. Have you talked to your doctor about this? The current vaccine has not been updated for the Delta variant, though it does provide some protection.\n\nI was on Imuran for the first two doses, Otezla for my \"booster.\" On both medications I had a rough night, chills and arm pain, but Tylenol really helped. Anecdotally, I am a teacher in my 30s and most of my coworkers had very few symptoms. The kids meanwhile said it did not bother them at all, just their arm was a little sore.\n\nI think a big part of this is what your son thinks. No necessarily having the final say but his experience will be much different if he does/does not want to get the vaccine.\n\nIf/when he does get it, bring out some special treats to look forward to: icecream, a paid video, video game credits, a new toy he collects. That will make any suffering much easier to deal with or he will just have a really great day feeling fine! I did not. I got the Pfizer vaccine and the only issue I had was a very sore arm after the second vaccine. Thank you so much for all the information. Yes, the doctor is the one pushing for him to get the vaccine, and my son wants to get the vaccine. I am just worried about stopping the Humira for him to get it as it has taken soooo long to get these oral ulcers to go away. I am afraid for this to cause a flare in his Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. Until the Humira kicked in he was getting so withdrawn and depressed I was scared for him. The last few months he has been so happy, engaged in life, joined cross country, made some friends, and just positive. I do not want the vaccine to bring the symptoms back but I do not want to risk him getting this Delta variant if his immune system is lowered on Humira. I can totally understand the worry but now he has all those good things in his life to look forward to.\n\nThe relief I felt after getting vaccinated made me so much more confident. Hi! Please read this\u2014- do not stop Humira. Other rheum drugs need to be held. Guidelines attached:  Thank you. The rheumatologist contacted us after that post and said he did not have to hold the Humira, but thank you so much for providing that additional info!! He just got his first dose today so fingers crossed there is no reaction. Great!! Hope he does well- I am sure he will! And yes, that chart is SUPER helpful!!", "Mouth Ulcer Pathergy Do you have pathergy if you develop mouth ulcers after a dentist touches your mouth area with a pinlike thing to check for scale/caries? I had mouth ulcers my whole life but I only discovered they could be caused mechanically as well . I have other troublesome health problems as well so Beh\u00e7et would not be a surprise. Thank you in advance. Many people with or without behcets develop ulcers from any sort of mouth trauma, it is just one of the triggers of aphthous ulcers/canker sores", "Prednisone taper I have been tapering from 10mg Prednisone and now I am at 4 mg for the past two days. Today I felt sudden intense pain in my genitals and it went all the way down my left leg. My leg is swollen and painful to walk on with livedo reticularis rash. My left butt cheek is swollen as well and painful. No genital ulcers right now though thank goodness. I am wondering if anyone has either had this due to behcets or tapering off Prednisone? I would be very appreciative if someone told me what they did for this as well. I have a CAT scan ordered for me also and Tylenol/ my diclofenac and gabapentin spray is not helping. Prednisone would not do anything like that as far as I am aware. Check with your doctor of course. I do not know if you are diagnosed with behcets yet or not,  but if you are prescribed gabapentin, they at least think whatever is bugging you is neuropathic in nature (which would include behcets) The thing with neuropathic pain is, it can cause any sort of crazy pain, itch, hot, cold, you name it, sensation you can think of. So if you have got neuropathic issues,  behcets or no, then yea... they could totally cause what you are describing. Thank you for answering this, yes I have been diagnosed with Behcets and now that I think of it I had this pain last year as well just not this bad.  Man I really need to figure out what triggers my flares if anything does. I will ask about the Prednisone too.", "Does anyone here not respond to Prednisone? I have been told I may have Behcet's and am trying to find out if it is worth it to try to find a new rheum and get evaluated for it.\n\nOne confusion is, I did a Prednisone taper last year (3 days, 40/20/10 mgs and I am 95 lbs) that did not help AT ALL. I was feeling quite sick at the time and did not feel an ounce different except for being very snacky. \n\nI have been told that autoimmune disease would respond rapidly and dramatically to 40 mgs of Prednisone. I had assumed the same would be true of Behcet's, although it was not under consideration at the time. \n\nSo anyway, curious if anyone here does not respond to steroids and/or not to a short course? Thanks for the info! It depends on what symptoms you are referring to? \n\nPred helps with a lot but not all of them, especially mouth ulcers. I use liquid steroid mouth washes for those A three day taper sounds like it just might not have been enough time on the medication? Prednisone worked for me, but I only felt relief starting on the 3rd day at 40 mg straight for 7 days.  I would not write it off yet. When I got diagnosed I took 1mg/kg of body weight. Which was at the time 50mg a day. Took it for a month or so, then it got cut to 37.5mg then 25mg then 12.5mg and now I am keeping 6.25mg a day. Has been going on since the start of July.\n\nYes prednisone did actually have an immediate effect: 3 days later already no mouth sores and have not had one since. That is a very weird taper - my rheum put me on a 6-day standard Medrol taper pack during the diagnosis process (~30mg pred equivalent, tapering 5mg daily) - and I did not feel better until the third day or so. My symptoms were returning by the fifth day (10mg) on this taper schedule without any other treatments. \n\nSo yeah, ask for a standard Medrol pack if possible. I really do not understand why rheumatologists try and deviate from the cookie cutter solutions that are known to work. Been on and off of Prednisone for 20 years now. Never seen such a short taper when being taking for Behcet's. If you are comfortable with it could you tell us what symptoms are you dealing with? Pred barely helps my mouth sores as well. Couple things that have helped me there are using a toothpaste and oral hygiene products that do not contain sodium lauryl sulfate and drastically reducing tomatoes and tomato based products from my diet. \n\nSodium lauryl sulfate is found in a lot of hygiene products. I do short tapers like that (usually 4-day 40-30-20-10) and respond immediately, like symptoms improve the first day. I did 10-10-10 for years with similar effects. That is good to know! I only get them when I have flare ups these days so I will check out changing my oral hygiene products! That seems like a super short taper. I think my shortest one for prednisolone was 5 days. It usually helps. FWIW during my very worst flare, after my first Rheumatologist visit, I took 80mg for 3 days, 40mg for 10, 20mg for 10, then 10mg for a month.\n\nFlares kept coming back 5-14 days after finishing, so now I am on 5mg for maintenance.\n\nSide effects are brutal but nothing compared to that last flare... (ALL the sores and I could barely walk)   I did for a while than it started doing nothing ", "Behcets and transverse myelitis Anyone else diagnosed with NeroBehcets induced Transverse Myelitis? What is it  ( Yes I looked it up and yes for sure I have those and behcets My legs have been asleep for 127 days. Nothing but pins and needles Oh my... Maybe, yes? When I was younger, my legs would go to sleep all the way up to my hips just from briefly sitting cross-legged. In college I started having sciatica. I have been in an out of PT for 20 years. I recently had bilateral steroid injections and I feel like they have given me a second chance at life. The Dr said it must be from an old injury.  They did find tears in the part around the cord... Never linked it to behcets though. I used to think it was restless leg syndrome. This is completely new to me, but I experienced a \u201cnew symptom\u201d the other night, and my quick research while waiting on dr\u2019s response actually pointed me to myelitis. I stood up and out of nowhere felt like my whole legs were being electrocuted but from the inside. It kept happening for about 10 hours, sitting, standing, laying down, until I had to take a sleeping pill to fall asleep. It has not happened since so of course it could have just been a one off thing, but I am interested in your stories.\n\nHas anyone ever heard of Lhermitte\u2019s sign? And if so, what is its relationship to transverse myelitis? \n\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s is listed here as a condition it is associated with:\n\n\nFor context: 27F diagnosed just over a year ago", "Help with genital ulcer while waiting for rheum appointment I was diagnosed with Behcets about 5 years ago. I would had recurrent mouth ulcers for at least 15 years  prior, and which no doctor or dentist I saw in that time could treat other than telling me to use OTC lidocaine. When genital ulcers popped up, and I tested negative for STDs by my PCP, I was referred to a rheumatologist who diagnosed me with BD presumably because I had both oral and genital ulcers and was positive for HLA B51. He put me on colchicine and prescribed Medrol packs for flares. After about 2 years the genital flares stopped and I felt I could handle the oral breakouts without the terrible side effects of the colchicine. Until 7 weeks ago. I began to feel a genital ulcer forming and called the rheumatologist for an appt. First available appt is 1/31 because I am considered a new patient since I have not seen him in 3 years. I made a same day appt with at my OBGYNs office.  By the time I saw her the ulcer was 1.5cm and incredibly painful (and this particular OBGYN was awful and demeaning, told me I looked like I got burned by a cigarette and walked me down to labs for STD testing which I would explained I DID NOT HAVE). I eventually reached out to another Dr in the practice who prescribed triamacinolone cream and lidocaine gel, neither of which did much help. Two weeks later, the 2+cm ulcer now preventing me from walking, peeing or sitting without pain (and the thought of sex is terrifying)  I asked her for a medrol pack, which I took and which worked to shrink the ulcer but not completely heal it. It is now increasing in size again, is exquisitely painful and I also have a mouth full of ulcers. The nurse at the rheumatologist says she cannot do anything to get me in sooner, the OBGYN is at a loss, and I am waiting for my PCP to call me back, though I am certain she will not know what to do since it was her who referred me to the rheumatologist in the first place after throwing up her hands on treatment. I just NEED RELIEF and at this point, I do not know where to turn or even what to tell this PCP on how to treat this ulcer since i have never had one this large and deep and  getting worse after steroids. I am asking this group for help on potential medicines that may work while I am waiting for 1/31 to get here.", "Genital ulcer not healing Hi friends. A little background. I have ehlers danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder which is very commonly comorbid with a variety of autoimmune conditions. I have never struggled with any of the common ones like POTS or MCAS. But now I suspect I have Behcet's. I have had mouth ulcers all my life--though these did improve massively when I switched to a sulfate-free, baking soda-free toothpaste, so I did not think much of it. \n\nFast forward to May 2020. I developed a genital lesion that I felt pretty sure was herpes. I had a past partner who had a positive contact though I was celibate for over a year before this lesion appeared. I saw a public health doctor who said it may or may not be consistent with herpes, swabbed it, and told me I would get a letter with results some time in July. She gave me valcyclovir, which spoiler alert, did not help. Fast forward to July. The lesion has not healed. I managed to get in to see my primary care provider (who is fantastic and I love her) and she and an infectious disease doctor took a look and said that it does appear most consistent with herpes, swabbed it again, and got my results back just yesterday: negative. They told me that in the event the result was negative, they would treat it as an apthous ulcer-and possibly explore conditions like Behcet's, given my past history, but unfortunately we were all thinking herpes so did not get to talk much about this avenue of treatment. \n\nAfter doing some research I do believe it is most consistent with Behcet's. I attribute most of my joint pain to my connective tissue disorder but it is there. I also have issues with my eyes- random pain, vision that has been gradually worsening since my childhood, and every time I blow my nose I burst blood vessels in them. \n\nSo I am seeking advice- have you ever had a genital ulcer that did not want to heal? What have your providers advised? Did you use any over the counter products? Were you advised to avoid any particular products? I read on the foundation website that betamethasone cream can be helpful so I picked some up last night and we will see, but I am very very very over this entire experience and want to expedite it as much as humanly possible. \n\nThank you, I hope you all are well. Yes I have had a large one that would not go away.  I have steroid cream but what helped the most was a manuka honey patch. I left it on for as long as possible and put a new one on when it wore out. It finally went away. I have had one (or multiple combined ones) for 4 years straight. I have been put on so many different meds, none of which have made it go away completely. The only thing that made a significant dent is a short course of high dose steroids (not the regular taper pack). But the effects do not last. I am on Humira and Azathioprine for the past year and it is def the most effective long term med combo for me, they are still very much there. I will add I have never been offered anything topical. I am a lady and they are mostly inside, so not sure what my options are for topical. Basically - I am still desperate to find something that works to make them go away. All my other symptoms are 90% managed. Apparently this symptom is extremely stubborn. If anyone has any success stories please let me know. It really takes a toll on personal relationships :( What kind of steroid cream? Also, M or F? If F, can you apply either the steroid cream or honey patch inside? Unfortunately I find that nothing topical helps, but when I started on biologic drugs I noticed a huge difference. \n\nThat said, I lost a ton of vision from Behcets so you definitely want to check that out. I think your vision worsening from childhood is pretty average. No one gets better vision naturally, really. The first time I had uveitis that is got dx I was in so much pain I could not open my eye, but other times I have been told there is a flare going and I did not really feel it so it is definitely worth checking out It is triamcinalone ointment actually. I am female. The patch would not work inside. But you can buy  little packets of manuka honey to spread on. The triamcinalone you can definitely use inside on the lesion. I have also heard that folks in the UK use a brown inhaler on genital lesions. I do not know which one that is but maybe you could query some UK folks. I tried one of my steroid inhalers I had for asthma once and omg! Burned like fire. Obviously not the right one!!  Also if you are post menopausal and have any vaginal atrophy be very careful using steroids inside the labia as steroids can thin out the tissue over time and then you have a new issue to deal with! Good luck!! Thanks for the info! Do you know why the honey works? I have never heard of that. Do either the honey or topical steroids need to be used long term to keep them away? I am young, and did not know atrophy was a thing. Also, ouch......... Apparently honey has an antibacterial and antiviral property.  But I think there is more to it that I cant explain. For example, my step son evidently chopped off his finger at the top knuckle. It was reattached. He soaked the finger in a cup of honey (not sure how often) and it healed really well. It was strange because at first it truned black. And then it was fine.\n\nAs far as the steroid ointment is concerned, you should use it just during a flare. If you have to use it daily then you need to see your doc about some other med to control your flares.  Like I mentioned,  any steroid topical prep will thin out the tissues if it is used for too long. 2 weeks is long enough. I would not use it longer than that. I am a nurse btw.  We used to tell patients 2 weeks and then stop for 2 weeks and then u can use it again if necessary. If it doesnt help see your doc. Here is a link with some info about the honey. \n So I just looked up OTC products available (US) for triamcinalone acetonide and the only one I have found is Nasacort (nasal spray). It has 55 mcg and is the only active ingredient. No alcohol or anything. Can I spray that on them? Once a day for 2 weeks? Since it is already intended for use on mucosal membrane? Echoing that biologics are the only long term drugs that have made a significant impact on them for me, but never got rid of them fully. Sorry about your vision :( The ointment is prescription. I cannot reccomend spraying the nasal spray on it. That is your call.  Have you tried an over the counter cortisone ointment?  Have you reached out to your doc? I would send them a message. Maybe they would call in something for you. I think I had a doctor recommend orajel just for numbing but it did not do much. Systemic steroids are the only thing that have ever cleared them up for me, and immunosuppressants (I am on imuran and plaquenil) have prevented later flares from being as severe (and I still keep prednisone on hand in case they are). I have seen people in other groups swear by beclomethasone inhalers as a topical treatment, but that is also prescription-only. Yeah sadly they are the most stubborn Bhecets manifestation.  Apparently Plaquenil works well for oral ulcers but not genital.  Even when I was on 32 mg of methylprednisolone, which is equal to 80mg of straight prednisolone, I still got them. I mean WTH??  I have also used a numbing spray that Is used for poison ivy for the pain but not inside the labia.  Only outside. I would try the manuka honey mixed with vaseline or some other ointment.  Multiple times a day. Right after using the bathroom rinse the area well and apply. I was thinking u could use a panty liner and spread  it on there and put it against the area and then put snug panties on to keep it in place.  There are squirt bottles you can buy specifically for rinsing this area of the body. They make them for post partum moms to rinse the episiotomy at home. I would be wary of wipes with scent or alcohol or other ingredients with long chemical names. Use warm water. Blot dry.  If you have a bee allergy I would be very cautious about using the honey though.  I feel your pain girl. I hope th is helps. I have been on Otezla for a little over a year now. It is been a miracle drug for me. It is FDA approved for behcets related oral ulcers, but for me it works for all ulcers. It does have downsides though, including headaches and nausea. But for me, the benefits out way the downsides; unfortunately it is not that way for everyone. Also, it is mega expensive. I am currently on a zero co-pay program, but if that expires or I lose eligibility, I do not know what I will do. It is $4000 a month with no insurance, $1500 a month with my health insurance. \n\n\nBut it is 100% worth talking to your doctor. I went from basically incapacitated to pretty much fine (ulcer wise at least, I still have GI and joint issues but I tolerate those much better) within 2 weeks of starting it. I am from the Caribbean and we love Epsom salts. \"Sitz baths\" with very warm water and epsom salts, 2 or 3 times a day.. they help them heal I find. \n\nMy gynaecologist also recommended using an antibiotic ointment (before I was diagnosed with Behcets she thought it might have been a bacterial infection) and I use them when I have ulcers on both sides. These are the worst because they kind of stick together.\n\nSo after the sitz bath with salts, I use ointments like antibacterial or even lidocaine ointments for numbing but primarily to keep things gliding and sliding.. avoid friction which expedites healing. \n\nFWIW I am on colchicine and at the moment short course of prednisone for a bad flare up. Good luck and feel better ! Thanks so much for sharing your experience! I tried otezla for a while without much relief, but I am so happy it worked for you! I had mouth ulcers for a long time and then genital ulcers started. I was freaked out and went to three doctors. Two of them was certain that was herpes and one said that was nothing like herpes.\n\nMy results were negative as well. This last doctor told me to see a rheumatologist and I was diagnosed with Behcet's.\n\nMy first treatment was colchicine and prednisone and I was ulcer free in like days.\n\nNow I am changing treatment because prednisone is not good long term. This sounds way more like the stories I hear of Beh\u00e7ets folks and what I am learning via the insane amount of research I have been doing for myself over many years. It is taken me 20 YEARS to finally get a BD dx. It is crazy wild to me how long people are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed w negative herpes lab results and/or are given herpes meds that do not help. It takes the average BD person 5-20 years to get a proper dx. \n\nYou sound like you know your body and you are on the right track. Reality is, doctors do not know more than we do sometimes and certainly they do not know our bodies more than we do! See a GOOD rheumatologist to see if it is BD. Mind you, it took me 3 rounds of specialists over 12-20 years to finally get more answers. Do not give up. Keep a journal, take photos, and listen to your gut!", "Today in covid and beh\u00e7ets Today results came back that I am positive for Covid 19. Not too surprised, but hard to differentiate between covid and beh\u00e7ets. Day three of intense fever, headaches, full body arthritis (I am talking PAIN), loss of smell/taste, and so many sores all down my throat that I cannot swallow without pain, Along with some lovely genital sores. Today also marks day one of a bloody butthole. Woo hoo! Oh, I have also shat the bed twice since this lovely outbreak. I feel like I am losing control of my Entire body. Many people with beh\u00e7ets seem to have more localized pain/areas of affliction. Does anyone else have this full body reaction every time you get a flare up? I have been told I can tolerate pain like a champ, but this bout has brought a few tears to my eyes. Anyone with any auto immune: be careful out there. Covid seems to amplify the worst. Sorry to hear about your suffering, God gives you strength. I had once faced similar pain but nowadays it is just localised to mouth sores.\nTake care. I get full-body flares and often end up admitted for pain control. I will be thinking of you and sending love and light! Full body flares are the worst... Wish you all the best! I got full body flares when I had covid. Otherwise It is usually half or quarter body during normal flare ups. Been down the same road with the bleeding arse thing as well but it happened without other symptoms apart from extreme fatigue. When I had covid I felt relaxation activities really helped like feldenkrais or hypnosis. I do not know why but it felt like a huge surge of adrenaline caused all the pain over and over so I did relaxing things to diminish the adrenaline surge. Also used ice packs non stop. I hope you get through it ok. Thank you for your support! I have been listening to a lot of meditative music while resting, and it has seemed to help. Fingers crossed it is up from here.", "Methotrexate experiences? Hello everyone, 23/F and diagnosed. Long-time lurker and first time poster! Colchicine has been pretty decent for controlling my ulcers, however, joint pain has gotten progressively worse. I have had steroidal injections, but now my rheumatologist has recommended I start methotrexate. \n\nHas anyone experienced significant relief with methotrexate? Any awful side effects? As vain as it sounds the hair loss side effect has panicked me a little, I would of course rather not be in pain but I also would not mind keeping my hair. \n\nThanks in advance and hope everyone is doing ok!", "Referrals in DC Area ", "Anyone not taking any medication and doing fine? I refused to take medication because I felt the flare up was gone or less. I still have constant fatigue and body aches/joint pain but no ulcers (for me ulcers are usually what happens when I flare ) I am wondering if there is anyone with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s and not taking any medication? My partner is newly diagnosed &amp; refusing treatment due to upcoming treatment for metastisized prostate cancer. We are treating lesions with blue light &amp; hydrogen peroxide, as well as coconut oil, olive oil &amp; anti-fungal as needed. From our research, treatments seem to be effective for only so long, and we are not willing to risk any issues standard BD treatment may cause &amp; possibly interfere with his cancer treatment. He is pretty miserable, but we are getting through, figuring out his triggers....so far- alcohol, gluten &amp; dairy. Hydrogen peroxide is making a huge difference!  We only use food grade. No, I used to be on no treatment before discovering BD and that was absolutely horrible. Now that I finally have my meds, I still have the fatigue but atleast I do not have constant ulcers, arthritis and uveitis. If you have a very mild case of BD then go ahead but for me I would rather inject myself with meds once every fortnight than go blind. When the ulcers get so bad l cannot eat, drink or talk, l take Otezla for a couple weeks until they are under control which is about two weeks. I have to do this a couple times a year. Me I got dx because of severe uveitis and I would 100% rather be on medication for life than go blind. I already lost some vision and I refuse to lose anymore. I have only ever taken meds during flares. Talk frankly to your doctor about risks vs benefits. It can flare and remit so it is up to you when the benefits of meds may outweigh the potential risks. There is nothing wrong with being cautious about what meds you take. I hope you have access to a good doc to help you make that decision. What meds are you on if you do not mind me asking? Adalimumab 40mg once every 14 days (I keep it on alternating Thursdays) and 5mg Prednisone every day.", "Diagnosis help? I am sorry this is a bit long but I appreciate if you take the one to read to the end anyway!\n\nHi everyone! I am a 27 year old, white/Canadian, female. \n\nMy mom was diagnosed with Behcets when she was in her late 20\u2019s as well IgA deficiency. She suffered from oral/esophageal ulcers for years, chronic joint pain/frozen joints, ibs, ect. for years until they finally settled down with minimal flares now. \n\nI am working my self up to talk to my Dr. about all my symptoms and the possibility of me also having Behcets. I have a very difficult time advocating for myself medically so a lot has slipped through the cracks over the years but I am trying really hard to take better care of myself lately. \n\nThis past month I got really sick for the first time since Covid started (nearly 2 years) and it seems to have triggered a flare up. I got a genital ulcer for the first time in nearly 8-10 years and with it being the holidays I could only see a walk in Dr and my gynecologist is booked until mid January.. they swabbed to rule out herpes (which came back negative as I already knew) Last time I had them I was a teenager and never been sexually active before. I never got them checked then however (some medical neglect and the my difficulty advocating for myself) my family said it was likely the start of a Behcets flare since my mom also has it and if I started a diagnosis process I would never be able to afford/get approved for health/life insurance \ud83e\udd72\n\n\nOther symptoms I have I think fit Behcets are:\n- I also have constantly unexplained achy joints which have gotten worse with this flare. \n\n-Fairly regularly ligaments/tendons with get so inflamed and painful I cannot even touch the skin above it without feeling like being stabbed, this is mostly in my hands/wrists but sometimes feet too. \n\n-Mild-moderate ibs. As well as a sharp/stabbing intestinal pain that comes as goes, I have had this since childhood \n\n-I have experienced Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon since childhood (only recently found out the name and that it was not \u2018normal\u2019 \ud83d\ude05) mostly in my toes but occasionally in my fingers\n\n-Not officially tested but I also get a a mild pathergy reaction to minor abrasions, injections, ect\n\nI do not however think I experience the mouth sores/ulcers or at least severe enough to be able to tell. From what I can tell they are pretty much a must for an official diagnosis? My mouth is pretty sensitive, I get swollen taste buds all the time and, like I cannot have too much say salt and ginger chips for example or my whole mouth feels raw for days and a layer of dead skin peels off my cheeks/gums sometimes, but I am unsure if that counts.. I used to get canker sores regularly as a kid but not really as an adult. \n\n\nI am aware that a lot of my symptoms overlap with other conditions/disorders and that Behcets itself is rare in my ethnicity and where I live but considering I do have an immediate relative with a diagnosis I think it is worth looking into? \n\nAny suggestions on what or how to bring this up with my Dr are appreciated! I would also welcome advice on how to advocate for any specific tests to be done to confirm or rule out anything else. Also suggestions of other possibilities to look into if it is not Behcets since I know most people here have had to rule out similar conditions. \ud83e\udd17", "Behcets or something else? Hi, guys! For the past 8 months I have having these odd symptoms. I wanted to know if anyone else has similar symptoms? \n\nTimeline:\nFebruary - Ulcers under tongue (lasted for a month)\nMay - Ulcers on gums and lips (lasted for 3 weeks)\nMay -  Folliculitis like lesions on legs (present u still today)\nJune - New ulcers and lacerations under tongue.

Hello, I have Behcets. This is exactly how mine flares up. Like someone else said, you should book an appointment asap. I am not a doctor, but my sores look the exact same as yours, and my flare ups always start with the same looking sores in my mouth, throat and on my tongue. I even get the same sores you have on your arm. Could be. You should book an appointment with a rheum, but beware since very few know about this disease. Unlike another message, I would not rush things: took me 5 years of not understanding anything before my beh\u00e7et symptoms got serious, but still do it as soon as you can. Echoing the above comments. It is most difficult to diagnose Behcets without symptoms. As you are seeing these, please continue to capture them and write down as much of your symptoms as you can. Be wary of any doctor not showing interest in knowing about these symptoms. The right doc will not only listen but ask you more questions. There is no test to confirm Behcets as of today and that leaves the process of elimination. For many it takes years and they have to live with the flares. Better start ASAP. It *could* be, but probably not. That does not mean you do not have some illness though. The problem with these weird rare things like Bechet's is they present very similarly and what is difficult about them is figuring out what they are. Everyone with behcet's will recognize your symptoms, but do well other folks with a dozen other diseases. I have an as of yet, unlabeled illness that is clearly autoimmune and similar to behcet's. But I went to the top behcet's rheumatologist in the country and he told me I had *something* but all he knew for sure was that it was not behcet's. We even found several autoantibodies confirming it, but could not pin it down. After that I chased down half a dozen other rare illnesses but all were dead ends. Finally I had a long talk with a doctor at mayo and came to the conclusion that my hyper focus on a diagnosis was not doing me any good. Autoimmunity is my disease... Behcet's, sarcoidosis, myasthenia gravis? It does not matter... They are all treated basically the same way. Immune suppression, steroids, symptom management, etc... Eventually the key symptom that aids the diagnosis will pop up and there you go. But that diagnosis is unlikely to change your treatment plan so it is a bit irrelevant. Even if they know exactly what you have, the meds they put you on can vary wildly from individual to individual. All the diagnosis does is give them a hint at which immune suppressant or steroids to start with. But in a large percentage of cases the standard treatment does not work and you end up on some totally different treatment plan. That is just how poorly understood autoimmunity is.\n\nSo schedule and appointment with a rheumatologist. Do not *tell* them what you have, that will immediately get you off on a bad foot with them. Explain your symptoms, do not try and lead them to a diagnosis, they will see that right away (they see it every day) it may look like you have behcet's to you because you have read all about it, but the rheumatologist is going to know about 100 other diseases that might be a better match that you have never heard of. You do not want to waste your time arguing pointlessly. You are in their house, you need their help. If they want to put you on some basic meds to start and wait and see, let them. That is standard. Remember, immune suppressants and steroids will **definately** shorten your life. You do not want to get on them perminently without ample reason to. If you are miserable and they are they only way to get your life back, then losing a few years is probably worth it. But you do not want to get on a bunch of steroids now, only to find out in 5 years they were only making your symptoms dns what your really had was cancer or some nonsense. You lose valuable time, and the treatment only does harm in those situations. I agree with u/John_Barleycorn. Autoimmune disorders exist on a continuum of symptoms. Mouth ulcers and skin lesions occur in lupus as well. Diagnosis can be a huge relief and guide treatment, but you do not want some of your symptoms ignored just because they do not fit the diagnostic criteria. I would document your symptoms, including photos, along with a food diary. Make sure to bring in any family medical history to your appointment too. I would prompt a conversation about differential diagnosis and not suggest just one. Something like, \u201cI know google is not a qualified physician but when I was looking for behavioral strategies to improve my symptoms a few things caught my eye. How can you tell if this is Behcets or some type of lupus or something else?\u201d That way you are: 1. Separating yourself from people who diagnose themselves from webmd 2. Avoiding looking like a \u201chypochondriac\u201d (pretty much one of the worst things that can happen) 3. Demonstrating you are willing to make changes to improve your symptoms and 4. Adding Behcets as one of many options. That way s/he will consider it but not pigeon hole you. The power of an idea is huge in medicine. All you need is one dr to decide you have something, document it and if he is wrong it will keep coming back like a bad penny. Agreed about the hypochondriac thing. The modern word for it is \"functional neurological disorder\" and the second a doctor puts that in your chart you are fucked as every doctor that you see can blame all your symptoms on it and ignore you. In years past it was called \"hysteria\" and a dozen other taboo names but it is always been the same thing. It is all in your head, you are making it up, the reason the doctor cannot figure it out is you. Not them. It is a whole psychological phenomenon that afflicts the entire medical profession. They spend their entire lives studying, learning and become experts, geniuses even, in medicine. Then someone comes along with some oddball rare disease they cannot figure out and it calls into question their entire identity. So they blame the patient. It is a really unfortunate phenomenon but we are not going to fix it on reddit. You just have to be aware it exists and that you are at their mercy and just roll with it and play their game. Exactly! I am a mental health therapist and I cannot tell you how many people I had referred to me by their physicians with a general \u201cpsychosomatic disorder\u201d label. I never bit off on it though, and would help my clients get the right tests done, cope with the stress of the disease, and navigate the medicinal system. I was lucky to work with a great psychiatrist who would order the blood tests I asked for: people with vitamin d deficiency, hypothyroidism that required the more detailed blood work to find, and falling one point outside of the laboratory\u2019s diagnostic range...I had a list of the ranges used from all the area labs for common disorders. Your blood goes one place you have lupus, goes some place else you are a hypochondriac. To me, even if you did somehow suppress a trauma and now you have \u201cphysical\u201d symptoms YOU STILL HAVE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS! So I never saw any harm in believing people. It is sad because there are certain diagnosis/chart annotations that drs use to \u201ctip each other off\u201d that someone is a drug addict (another terrible thing to be labeled as if you have a pain disorder)/malingering/psychosomatic: \u201cpoor historian\u201d = drug addict, fibromyalgia = \u201cattention seeking\u201d (fibromyalgia is debated by clinicians as not being \u201creal\u201d), etc. In these situations, the first thing we have to do as clinicians is BELIEVE what our clients are telling us. The archaic notions handed down at teaching hospitals have killed countless people. It is sick.", "Anybody been on Kevzara for Behcets treatment? I have been on enbrel and humera in the past. I cant take either right now so the doctor is putting me on Kevzara. Anybody used this drug?  Nope. Never heard of it either, but I hope it works for you Does it go by another name? Never heard of it, and I was sure I would heard them all.  Yeah never heard of it. I am on Colchicine.  Yeah it is also called sarilumab.  Thank u!  I was on colchicine for about 6 months. Really did not work for me but I hope it is making you feel better!  I just started it about 5 weeks ago and the last 2 weeks have been hell with flare up pain. So it is not really working for me either. Doc wants me to give it 3 months! I do not think so.  No, have not heard of that, either. Looked it up, even, and it is not something I remember being discussed in any Beh\u00e7ets groups. Sorry I could not help. I really hope it goes well for you. I have done Plaquenil/Humira/Imuran/Cellcept. Cellcept helped me the most, especially at a relatively high dose, with few side effects, but everyone is different. (Had to go off of it when I developed a other health issues that took priority.) Best of luck.  I have never heard of it before, but I would love to know if it works.

I am so sorry this is long, once I started typing I just could not stop.\n\nI am 24F and I have been having canker sores since the earliest I can remember, usually 1 or 2 at a time, lasting a whole month, disappearing for a day or two and then restarting for the next month. My mom has had canker sores her whole life too, so I assumed it was normal/not important to being up to a doctor. I mentioned it offhand to my GP in 2020 and she sent me to get tested for Celiac's and Crohn's (including CT and colonoscopy) all negative. So her 2 ideas were proved incorrect and no follow through happened.\n\nIn 2021 I suddenly had 5 or 6 oral sores at the exact same time for 3 months, with few to none days of peace in the middle. I decided maybe this is not normal and I went to an ENT. He did not believe me. So I went to another ENT. She believed me and referred me to a rheumatologist. I went to the rheum today and she asked me all these questions, oral sores, the occasion vaginal sore, joint/muscle ache, fatigue, gastrointestinal issues, all things I experience but never thought connected. She has diagnosed me with a hesitant diagnosis of BD.\n\nI have been reading up on what I can about it all day, and stumbled upon this sub. Reading everyone is experiences here, my question is: do mild cases of BD exist? I see people describing mouthfuls of sores not just a handful. And I have never shown a sore to my OBGYN bc I assumed it was like tearing from not enough lubrication down south, so I have no idea if those are the sores you all are describing. I do not want to compare what I experience with what you experience, bc mine seems so much more minimal. Like I know canker sores are painful and awful, but I do not want to say I have BD and minimize everyone else's condition when mine is very annoying but (currently) pretty manageable.\n\nSorry, I guess I am just suffering from some sort of BD imposters syndrome, like maybe I do not have it but just happen to experience the separate symptoms of BD to a degree? Hope that makes sense...I would love to hear what you all think about this.", "Anyone noticed food/liquid trigger? Have you noticed any food or drink triggers? \n\n I am wondering if I have an allergy that triggers my mouth ulcers. \n\nWhat foods trigger your ulcers?", "Can Behcets cause raised vaginal PH and itching? I was diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s, but the doctors were decided between Crohn\u2019s and Behcets because I also presented with mouth and vaginal ulcers. \n\nMost recently I have have a very inflamed vagina, but no ulcers, but also itching. I went to the gynecologist and she said I had a high PH so is treating me for bacterial vaginitis. However I am almost done with my course of antibiotics and have no relief. I am still super inflamed and experiencing itching. I wonder if this could possibly be linked to autoimmune since I am currently in a flare. \n\nDoes anyone know if a Behcets flare can raise your vaginal PH and cause itching? Do you ever get really inflamed right before you break out with ulcers? I am on a ton of immune modulators and suppressors so I guess I am somewhat controlled which may be why I am not full blown into ulcers unless this really is an infection. Unfortunately since Behcets or vaginal Crohn\u2019s, so many doctors will not know what to look for. \n\nAnyone experience anything similar? I am a guy but yes, I have that exact equivalent experience. I cannot speak for pH but my scrotum gets inflamed and becomes extremely itchy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my experience, \"indulging\" in the itch perpetuates it, you just got to ignore it and apply whatever topical remedy you use I am also guy so not sure about your condition but you should watch this video ( see at time 9:46, it shows difference between behcet's and crohn's syndrome. Genital ulcers are pretty common in Behcet's. Thanks for sharing. What type of topicals do you use and how long does it take to go away? It is so uncomfortable, but yeah, \u201cindulging\u201d for sure makes it worse. I get this and they did say that my Beh\u00e7et\u2019s creates issues in my vagina that basically are equivalent to having a vaginal autoimmune. The itching and swelling is awful but it goes away between flares. I treat mine with a coconut oil/cbd topical oil mix. Makes all the difference in the world. Thanks. If it is not too much info, do you also have discharge? I cannot tell what is going on for sure. In the past I never had itching, only pain, but I am flaring with my gut and CRP is high so autoimmune is acting up, and antibiotics have not worked, so I am not sure if it is autoimmune or infection, I guess it could be both. \n\nDo you take any meds for your flares or do yours go away? I have tried coconut oil, but it does not seem to help. I do have some CBD oil but was not sure if it is ok to put in on that area. Thanks for the link. Based on that it probably is Crohn\u2019s but vaginal Crohn\u2019s is so rare that most doctors do not know about it. Most of the meds are the and to treat except for the one that is also used for gout. I wonder if that one may help me if I cannot get this under control, but I am on so many other meds. \n\nDo they ever give topical steroid for genital ulcers/inflammation? Not sure about your case, but I did use topical steroid it is fast, effective and lesser steroid you take.\n\nGenerally rest, lot of sleep, keep calm and take no tension to ease these flares. Thanks for sharing your experience. Yes, I also get discharge. I am getting ready to switch from Colchicine for my Beh\u00e7et\u2019s to Remicade. I was treated for bacterial vaginitis coinciding with my first few flares with ulcers, and usually got a yeast infection after taking the antibiotics. It was really a frustrating vicious cycle! I have fewer genital flares since intensifying my treatment, and have not had the PH issue since, but it did seem to be a matter of being lucky enough to break that cycle more than any particular thing working. So did you improve at all, even PH-wise after you took the antibiotics? I guess hard to tell if you had yeast infections then. I took antibiotics, PH was still high and had a culture done and I have no bacterial or yeast infections, so now I am wondering if just inflammation can somehow raise your vaginal PH. I am at a loss as what else to do since I am highly medicated for Crohn\u2019s.", "Adalimumab to Hulio. I guess the name \"Hulio\" is only funny in Spanish.

I thought it would help control my flares more, but I could very well be wrong!\n\nThanks in advance and thank you to whoever started this group! It helps more than you will ever know! I have been off antidepressants for more than a decade, but was on them for more than a decade and never noticed any link between them and flares. And over that decade+ I was on several different antidepressants, probably close to a half dozen. \n\nWhile it is possible the antidepressant played a role in your flare, I think it is unlikely. I am guessing you are on an SSRI, SNRI, or one of the newer types of antidepressant. They should not cause your immune system to go crazy. But again, it is not impossible. \n\nOh, and you are welcome by the way. I created this subreddit in 2015 :) Thank you!\nI was on antidepressants the majority of my life and then stopped shortly after getting diagnosed with behcets. I have not taken them in about 4-5ish years but just recently started again. A slight flare began when I doubled my dose a week into starting them up again, so I thought maybe my body was like, \u201cwhoa! Slow down here!\u201d and flared up.\n\nI have looked around on google and there is no conclusive answer one way or another, so that is why I asked here :)\n\nThank you again for your help and for this subreddit! Maybe cut back to the original dose and titrate up very slowly? That is what I would do. But what YOU should do is talk to your doctor. :) Best of luck. Be well!", "Does anyone have just nose ulcers? If not, do you have Both nose and mouth ulcers?  So my medicine has controlled most of my ulcers but I do get nose ulcers still. It is annoying and they make me stuffy/cause nose bleeds. I ise to get them all the time along with mouth, but only have lip and eye problems on the meds im on. Ill take it I used to only have mouth ulcers. I started getting nose ulcers as an adult. With my medication my mouth ulcers are mostly under control unless I bite myself by mistake, but I do still get nose ulcers especially when my nose is very dry. Fortunately, I have not had any mouth or genital ulcers in years. But for more than a decade, I used to always have at least a few of each. During that time, every once in a while, I would also get one on the inside of my nose. They were much-less common than the oral and genital ulcers, but I did get them.", "Choosing the right pcp Hi all, I have been battling health issues over the past year and after having 3+ canker sores in my mouth for 3 consecutive months I did a Google search and came across behcet's disease. I am 99% sure I have this with always getting canker sores and having these super itchy nodules on my legs, along with vision problems and swelling of my optic nerve when I went to the eye doctors. I am also from South Korea where I read the disease is more common? \n\nI need to find a primary care doctor but the hospital network I am currently connected with through my health insurance does not look like they have anyone or any departments that really specialize in autoimmune/rare diseases. I could switch to a different hospital network around the Boston area, but it would most likely be a longer wait to see a doctor. \n\nI guess my question is how hard/long did it take to get your diagnosis, and would you suggest going to a more \"prestigious\" hospital network or do you think a small city hospital network will know how to treat it. I got a referral to a rheumatologist via my eye doctor. So, I would start there Ok thanks, I have an appointment with an opthamologist in June, hopefully it will not get postponed again. I will talk to him about getting a referral. I am not from that area but there is a great uveitis clinic in Massachusetts I think...somewhere up there. Probably worth checking them out, too. \n\nGood luck! I lost vision because of uveitis and because I did not know to take it seriously. Thank you! I will have to look that up... Yes I was reading that uveitis can cause some serious problems. Good luck to you, I hope the doctors were able to stop any further vision loss for you. I think the head specialist is named Dr Stephen Foster. Good luck!", "Disability and behcets? Lately I have been having a lot of trouble with my behcets. Erythema, ulcers, numbness in my legs and arms, major anxiety issues. Constant fever and fatigue. \n\nSo much that I have missed a considerable amount of work the last year. I am lucky that I am on salary but with the way things are going I am not sure how much longer I will be able to keep my job.\n\nDoes anyone receive disability for behcets? And how hard was it to get? The fever really makes it sound more like FMF. I have always thought that too. Colchicine only partially helped with that. Otezla completely did away with it unless I over exert myself. Then I will run a temp and have a erythema flare. I think what Region/Country you reside in is a major factor in what is available.\n\nI personally was able to get support for having Behcet's in the UK, but it was a difficult process. Here they focus on how the condition affects you, rather than what the condition is. But I had to jump through a lot of hoops so to speak!\n\nI would recommend ringing a local health advisor service or charity for advice :) \n\nKind regards", "Annual full body inflammation For the most part, my Behcet\u2019s is pretty under control. I get minor symptoms and ulcers year round, usually triggered by stress or illness, but being on colchicine helps. However, once a year for about four years now I will get a full body flare up that knocks me off my feet. I get hit with everything at once - mouth/genital ulcers, rashes, uveitis, joint pain and swelling, GI issues, even a couple blood clots and one bout of aseptic meningitis. I was actually diagnosed fairly quickly since all these symptoms showed up at the same time in the beginning. Prednisone helps with some of this, but it still usually lasts a few weeks and totally turns my world upside down.\n\nThe weirdest part is that these episodes are almost exactly a year apart each time - always late August for some reason. Last year\u2019s started on August 21st, and I started feeling the onset of one yesterday on the 24th that is progressively getting worse. I am hoping this one is not as catastrophic, as I have not experienced any of the more serious symptoms since getting on medication like colchicine full time. \n\nI am amazed at how precise the timing has been, and I cannot think of anything seasonally-specific that might trigger it. Anyone else get full body inflammation like this at the same time of year for no apparent reason? Allergy season where you live? Histamine overload maybe? Might be, although I do not typically suffer from allergies. You can be completely asymptomatic of typical allergy symptoms and still have a huge histamine overload! Try antihistamines in august to see if that prevents the flare maybe? Thank you! I will definitely try that. I deal with something similar actually! Every summer I get an outbreak. I always just assumed it was the heat and just general other discomfort of the summer. This year was actually shockingly tame. I only got a breakout of a few bad ulcers. One year I could not even count how many there were under my tongue and around my mouth. I lost count around 40. They were literally popping up if I took a 20 minute nap (and I was taking a ton of naps cause I could not sleep because of the pain, and my body was just exhausted). Prednisone finally calmed stuff down. Anyways, my comment is pretty unhelpful, but I just wanted to say I have the same weird summer flare up yearly, usually around July. I had this but in the spring, I think it might be related to allergies or deep stress that is specific to that time of year.\n\nEdit: at the time the doctor's thought it was mono (Epstein Barr) syndrome. I wondered about the heat as well. I am in Arkansas and around August it gets pretty miserable. The mouth ulcers are absolutely horrible. I have never dealt with that many at once. I think a dozen is probably as many as I have had in one episode but they take weeks to heal. 40 sounds like literal torture.  Allergies may just be the culprit. Luckily it did not take my doctor too long to figure out what was going on. Trying to make it through this kind of inflammation without treatment is just the worst.", "That time of the month- for the ladies Sorry gentleman, but this is a question geared to ladies.  \n\n\nI recently got my iud removed and have finally gotten my period.  When I was diagnosed I already had a contraceptive that made it so I did not have a period. That being said, I am incredibly swollen and inserting and removing a tampon is painful.  I have stopped using and have an alternative and am taking ibuprofen.  \n\nI was wondering if this is something any of you have experienced or if this is a reaction to getting back into my cycle. I flare with every period, mostly joint pain and usually one or two genital ulcers. When I had an IUD it actually kept happening once a month; even if I was not bleeding I would have cramps and a mini-flare for at least a few days. When I had the IUD taken out, the first period afterward was quite bad and lasted a long time, so it also could be that that is all you are experiencing. Thank you so much.  I did get a sore and since the iud was removed I have gotten some lesions on my arms My flares are closely linked to my cycle. Any time I get my period, inflammation takes over - everywhere! My docs worked out a continuous birth control plan for me where I now only get periods 4x / year but it is still tough. Sometimes they give me prednisone to manage the inflammation while I am on the cycle. \n\nCannot use IUDs but taking the pill daily (skipping the placebo weeks) seems to work well for me right now That is what I did before the iud which worked well for me.  We want to try to get pregnant but it is good to know that this is \u201cnormal\u201d in the sense that it is related to Behcets (most likely) and not another thing! \n\nSo another personal question - do you just use pads then? I typically use a small tampon with a pad or liner. My situation is tricky because I also have uterine didelphys (2 uteruses) so tampons are not super effective, and cannot use IUDs. Finally found the right pill that minimizes the flow and cramps (it is called viorele if anyone is interested) so usually a liner and tampon will do the trick Thank you!! So helpful :) My flares are very closely lined up to my cycle, I got the Nexplanon arm bar which helped - hope it all works out, I am prescribed prednisone for during flares I got an IUD because my periods give me such a bad flairup. I have only had it in for a few months and even when I am not bleeding, I am still getting the inflammation and genital ulcers. I know they are linked but I am at the point of giving up trying to manage them both.\n\nI realize this was not super helpful,  but just know you are not alone! Thank you so much.  I would not have even taken it out but we are wanting to get pregnant. The good news is that most autoimmune diseases go into remission during pregnancy so your Behcets should be better! I wish you the best of luck getting pregnant! I started using CBD infused tampons and find them very effective (except when I have a nasty flare-up). My friends recommended the specially made period pants so will be giving those a go! Anything to make a period less horrible! I did just order period underwear.  I am hoping that is helps with this transition to no tampons. \ud83d\ude12", "'Crohn's' patient for over 17 years, turns out I might have Behcets. So, funny story. (TL;DR at the end)\n\nMy girlfriend and I were watching the new remake of \"Flatliners\". It was not terrible, but it also was not great, but I digress. In the movie, a patient is described as seeing the color red differently in both eyes. This immediately piqued my interest, and I went searching online, and what I found threw me for a loop.\n\nA little background on my life: I have been sick ever since I was a little kid. I started around 5 with allergies, asthma, and the odd seizure now and then. I also randomly blacked out a few times. A few years later, I suddenly started having extreme joint pain, with a strange red rash on the joints that hurt. Sometimes the rash would be so pronounced that it would almost look like raised legions or some kind of burn. To this day I still get an odd red rash over painful areas. My knees would also lock up for a period of time when I was 11. The immunologist I ended up seeing have the final word and called it \"Post streptococal rheumatoid juvenile arthritis\". Mouthful, huh?\n\nSo thus ended my 'pre-crohn's phase', as soon after, during my 14th year, I started having intense abdominal pain. The bouts of pain wrecked me, and I could not do anything to make it better except wait it out. It just got worse and worse, as my wonderful local GI continued to enthusiastically treat me for \"constipation\". Eventually, I wound up in the ER for appendicitis. The surgeon removed my perfectly healthy appendix and discovered a severely inflamed and scarred terminal ileum and cecum. I started going to a better GI who was awesome, and she put me on Pentasa, 6mp, and nexium. She also tried to put me on TPN, but 2 months into it my liver started to fail, so the super fun period of time where I did not eat (so I just drew the food I wanted and filled sketchbooks with cheeseburgers and chicken parm) had to end.\n\nA year later, I had my first bowel resection at 15. It went so well I thought I would have another one about 8 years later. But before that could happen, in 2007, I had strange fistulas pop up in my rear-area, or at least that is what they were called because hey, I had Crohn's right? Not some weird disease no one's apparently ever heard of in NJ that could cause ulcers just about anywhere on the body. The only problem was that the fistulas never led anywhere, so they closed them up and that was the end of that party. A couple years later, in 2009, I had bleeding and pain behind my navel. A surgeon said it was an ulcer, guessed it was the Crohn's, and removed it. The surgery was not enough fun, though. So the wound decided to get infected and I had to spend the rest of my senior year of college stabbing it open twice a day and changing the packing because it became soaked and would start to go through my shirt in the middle of class, which was awesome. I almost did not finish college because of this. This was also the last time I would feel normal, or like my life was still on track.\n\nA year later, in 2010, I started having those dreaded abdominal pains again, but the doctors said the anastomosis just showed severe ulceration. They told me I could either get it removed and start again, or go on Humira, which I was deathly afraid of due to horror stories of a 100% fatal lymphoma that mostly shows up in young males under the age of 25. I chose the surgery, again. The surgeons, in their infinite wisdom, decided to go through the only part of my abdomen that I asked them not to go anywhere near: you guessed it! The navel. And surprise! It got infected again! Gee who could possibly have known that would happen??\n\nSo it got infected, I had a fever of 106, and had to have a mainline put in my neck as I was moved to the scenic Mount Sinai ICU, where I would spend several days fighting for my life and hallucinating as I went through my first near death experience. A year after that, another surgery. This time by a different surgeon, thank God, who knew what he was doing. Only problem was, he did a side to side anastomosis, which is apparently a no-no for people like me, who just that year was diagnosed with the hyperflexible and stretchy form of Ehlers Danlos syndrome. This made sense, since I was 6'5\" and could bend every joint backwards about twice over. Anyway, the side to side anastomosis caused my intestines to get stretchy and create a painful balloon of death. With ulcers in it.\n\nSo I dealt with that for a few years, because in the meantime I went to the Mayo clinic. By this time. My family and I had seen so many 'Crohn's specialists' that we were beginning to lose our minds. So many of them had said that I was not in as much pain as I said I was, or that I should be in some kind of pain rehab program (I had just started painkillers as a way to deal with the pain, plus it also helped my CONSTANT, NEVERENDING STREAM OF DIARRHEA THAT NEVER, EVER, EVER STOPPED), or that I was making symptoms up. We were naturally slightly miffed and exhausted by this time, so the Mayo clinic seemed like the right choice. While I was there, they discovered that my celiac artery had some kind of inflammation thing going on because a ligament was pressing on it or something, and as a result I only had about 30% blood flow to the rest of my abdomen. Luckily I found a surgeon who knew how to do this extremely rare surgery right next to our house.\n\nA year later, the worst years of my life continued with another surgery. This one would be another resection to fix the side to side anastomosis and change it to an end to end anastomosis. This way, the balloon of death would no longer be an issue. This GI doc had the new theory that I was still having pain because of the balloon of death, and he thought this surgery would be the end. We all hoped this would be the case. I even finally went off painkillers after 2 years. I was also finally tapering off of the insanely high levels of prednisone I had been on for 2 years as well.\n\nThen the true hell that has been my life for the past 3 years began. 2 months after I stopped painkillers and prednisone, I had an adrenal crash due to my body not making cortisol on it is own, and I wound up back on painkillers and prednisone yet again. Over the next 2 years, I would keep trying to slowly taper off prednisone. I was diagnosed with PTSD. I started Entyvio. And the pain continued to get worse. I was continuing to get ulcers everywhere, in my throat, mouth, intestines, stomach, esophagus, colon, and I had bad foliculitis and was also bleeding out of my penis. I was tested for lupus and shogrins syndrome, given IGG treatments, had a herniated disc in my lower back, horrible migraines, and my bloodwork was so crazy that no one could tell me what the hell was going on. My CRP in particular was insanely high, with no apparent reason why. Eye problems, vascular problems, the list goes on.\n\nAnd this leads me to today. With everything that is happened, when I read about Behcets I nearly started bawling. It was like everything I had been experiencing my entire life had a true name, and it was like I had been lied to for 17 years. I am now almost 31, with no life. No career. I am disabled, still on painkillers, which I hate. I am dealing with PTSD flashbacks and nightmares. I am unable to be independent. Its been really hard. But for once I feel like I am close to having a real answer to the worlds cruel riddle for my life. I was referred to NYU, and I will be making an appointment there soon for the final word.\n\nThank you to anyone who read the whole thing, I just felt like venting. It is been a long, harrowing road. Maybe soon I will actually be able to start the rest of my life.\n\nTL;DR: Was told I had Crohn's for 17 years, had crazy symptoms that made no sense and doctors thought I was nuts, it basically ruined my life, but now i found out it might be Behcets.\n\nAll thanks to the Flatliners remake. Thanks Ellen Page and Keifer Sutherland! 25/f/nj I have had symptoms since age 2, officially diagnosed around age 16, I am also disabled legally.\n\n\nWhere in NJ are you from? I was officially diagnosed at the NYU behcets clinic by Dr. Yazici (I believe he left to go back to turkey shortly after though) I also see an amazing rheumatologist at Cooper health system, her name is Hala Eid, she works at a few offices, maybe you can find one that is close to you. I am from the Pennington area, near pa. That is amazing. I used to see a GI in cooper, but I saw a Rheumatologist in Hamilton, and she just referred me to see Dr. Yazici at NYU also, so maybe he is back? Or at least maybe someone there carried on in his stead  hopefully. That would be great if he is back, I saw him years ago and he was leaving to do more research so he totally could be back! He looked at me and right away said I definitely had behcets, he is a very nice guy, good luck! That would be great. It would be good to have a final word for once after all this. Thanks, and you too. I am sorry you are disabled, I gather there are not many treatment options for behcets yet? I am on Entyvio still for Crohns and it is still doing some good, like making it so I am no longer allergic to animals and antibiotics. But I am worried I will not be able to live without insurance if I started working.\n\nAlso are you close to Cooper? Do you mind me asking if you have any mental health issues as a result of what you have been through? I have tried PTSD clinics, but they are mostly for victims of violence or veterans, so I kind felt like the odd man out there.\n\nThanks again for answering, I really appreciate it. In the last 24 hours I have heard from 2 other people who were diagnosed with Behcets, and have similar stories to mine. It is been nice to know I am not alone. I have tried about a dozen treatments (there are not any specifically for behcets yet so they are all trials mostly of RA medications) and I did not respond to any of them\nSome people have success with humira, my insurance flat out refuses to let me try it though. And otezla is in like the third round of testing to treat the behcets ulcers, but it is currently only approved for psoriatic arthritis. \n\nI do not live near cooper, I am all the way in south jersey so I drive over an hour to get to my dr appointments unfortunately. \n\nAs far as mental issues, I have OCD and GAD but there is no way of knowing if my behcets is what caused either of them, they both started around 2011 which is around the time I was dealing with being diagnosed but I also went through a traumatic breakup at that time. \nI used to get very panicky and depressed about my situation being sick and disabled at a young age but things have gone really well for me since I won my disability case so I mostly try to stay positive and take each day as it comes\nAfter all, this life is \u201cnormal\u201d for me, I am used to all the pain and symptoms because I cannot remember what it ever felt like not to be sick. \n\nI have talked to tons of people with similar cases as mine and felt so relieved that I am not alone, The Internet has been a great help! Behcet's is so frikking hard to diagnose! My doctors have not confirmed the diagnosis for me even though I am SURE it is Behcet's and they are pretty convinced it is. They just call it \"pyoderma gangrenosum\" to allow me to get treatment. \n\nI was originally diagnosed as Chrons myself - but this was probably somewhat influenced by the fact that my Mum has chronic Chrons (never been in remission, had major bowel surgery pretty much every two years while I was growing up - not fun). \n\nI am glad you finally have a proper diagnosis. What meds are you on how? \n\nI have not been able to work for two years as I have been so unwell and it is VERY hard financially. \n", "Cannot wait to play \u201cis this from the vaccine or my behcets\u201d this week I have already been playing the, \u201cdo I have COVID or is this my Behcets flaring\u201d game for the last 11 months. \n\nTomorrow I will be getting my first (Pfizer) vaccine (hopefully)\n\nThen I will make the slow transition from \u201cis this covid or my Behcets\u201d to \u201cis this from the vaccine or my Behcets\u201d Honestly, as someone who has had both vaccines, it is a piece of cake if you are on immunosuppressants (aza, etc). I felt fine because my immune system could not mount a response. Best of luck! Hahah well I am not on any immunosuppressants! :( Only a sore arm for the first round (so far)! Woohoo! Yayyyy!!! Hope it stays that way! I had the first Pfizer shot and I got flair up after with ulcers and my whole body hurting. I had headaches, but I usually get 3-4 migraines and several headaches a month (not related to behcets). I did not have a sore arm. \n\nEveryone has a different reaction!!\n\nIt is a fun game. I have had ulcers non stop since last March, so if I got a new one, I would not assume it was from the vaccine. I also get 3-4 migraines a month! Have you been prescribed anything for it? \n\nStupid disease My neuro (use for epilepsy but a nice bonus if there are behcets issues) had me try sumatriptan but I had a terrible reaction. Like the one you have to go to the hospital for.  She was working on getting approval for Botox but the approval through Tricare did not come through until we moved (PCs). Now my new neuro will not go along with the plan. \n\nI am going to try a physical therapist for something a little different.  At our previous location I had one that did the strain-counter strain method and it helped with headaches, pain management, and anxiety/stress (which commonly comes with these medical issues). \n\nI can update once I see what this physical therapist does and method.  No one here does the strain-counter strain method.  It is very specialized.", "Out of my mind with leg pain I began a course of prednisone yesterday morning, starting at 60 mg, due to an active flare that began back in October or so. Symptoms this round included headache, meningitis, panuveitis, folliculitis and ulcers. Add to that: debilitating pain in the lower extremities, pretty much from my hips down. \n\nThis has been a feature of my Behcet\u2019s for nearly as long as I have had it, but I am not sure why. I have had RLS most of my life, but this is different. It is a burning/cramping sort of sensation that is unresponsive to ibuprofin, heat or rest, shows up any time of day it pleases, and is especially present for days after exercise, though not always, and not only then. \n\nDoes anyone else experience this? What have your doctors said about it or done to treat it if so? And what works for pain management for you?\n\nThanks friends. I have exactly the same symptoms! My doctor says the burning pain the my legs/feet is an inflammation, they come and go, especially after excercise. I used to take naproxen, which would work pretty good if I lied down. I still have this when I am tired. You also need to keep your legs warm. There is actually not really anything I can do about it, it is almost daily but at some point you just have to accept it.  You could also talk with your doctor about Sulfasalazine, Azathioprine (Imuran) and a bit of Paracetamol. I have a lot of foot, leg and joint pain, and cbd applied topically ( either in a bath or lotion) works shockingly well. YMMV but it def helps me. I am with you there.  Pro-acceptance, but I am a lot more anti-acceptance without new or all possible information and efforts applied these days. \n\nI was on Naproxen once upon a time before I had a diagnosis and I cannot remember if it did anything for any of my other inflammation. That was 11 years ago though and there is no way I would be able to recall my exact symptoms at the time.  Thanks! I will look into these as well.  Thanks for the tip!  Sorry to hear that. For me the heating pad works well. Good luck! Do you take colchicine? It seemed to be alot more effective on my joint pain compared to steroids. Still not perfect but better by far. I am also still waiting for immunosuppression and hoping this will help more, but I would imagine colchicine would be prescribed sooner (this is the case for me) \n\nI hope you manage to find something that helps \n Hey, Lookingyoung, just a quick heads-up:  \n**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**.

Hi! Hope everyone is feeling well. Had a few random questions that I wanted some insight from people like me. :)\n\nSaw my rheumatologist today for regular follow up. I had a bad flare in between seeing him and was given steroids ..but I thought it was partly from having biopsies from colonoscopy/endoscopy as my primary assumed that was probably cause. My rheumatologist did not agree and said it may be time to consider one of the tnf inhibitors along with Otezla.\n\nFor my bechets I am currently taking 1.8mg colcrys and 100mg imuran. \nI was originally told I could go up to 150mg as it is based on weight. \nI am 5\u20198\u2019 129lbs. Very active when feeling well and healthy (within reason lol)  lifestyle. I have GI complications so my weight fluctuates ten pounds (125-135) That is just what it was today. \n\nAnyway he told me he does not see benefit in increase as he thinks I would have higher chance of in side effects, &amp; we can either switch now or wait until I see him in two months for next follow up. \nI have been losing hair too..I would compare it to postpartum hair loss. Which he noted.\n\nI also had higher blood pressure even though I take procardia xl for it. Not too high for me 135/90. I have HBP issues that they think is related to my disease or genetics since I am 29 and do not drink/smoke and am active. Sorry this is long. But my blood pressure always has my doctors on high alert. I had a mini stroke which is when I discovered I had HBP which is what led me down this long road to bechets. \nIt is honesty my fault I have two young toddlers and just did not make time for the doctors, because I did not think my issues were a big deal. I was also still nursing ..I gave that up when I started meds. But it is okay my son was 2 1/2 so was ready. But I just ignored many signs. And I have never had HBP even when pregnant. \n\nAfter that very long intro ..anyone have experience on tnf inhibitors vs imuran? Or Otezla? Or any combo. I also wish steroids were not so bad for you..I feel my best on them which I always tell him.\n\nHe also wants me to get shingles vaccine, but I have never had chicken pox &amp; had that vaccine when I was a baby. My husband is in pharmacy and was surprised by that request. Anyone else told they should do that?\nI have to get pneumonia vaccine but I am asthmatic so makes sense. \n\nThanks so much for always giving me insight and support !xo sorry so long. TNF-Inhibitors are generally regarded as some of the safer and more effective treatment options for Behcet\u2019s. The use of TNF-Inhibitors for BD only started in the early 2000s, but there have been dozens of studies done that prove that they can induce + maintain a drug free remission in even the worst of Behcet\u2019s cases. The problem is that they are generally very expensive and insurance may fight you on coverage. Doctors typically need to fail you out on one other treatment (azathioprine is the easiest to \u201cfail out\u201d on) before they can justify a TNF drug for insurance purposes. All of the immunosuppressive drugs increase your risk of infections and some cancers - including the TNF drugs - but their side effect profiles are usually non-existent compared to the anti-metabolites (azathioprine / methotrexate) or prednisone. \n\nI fell ill in 2018, was diagnosed this year, and will be starting Remicade this week! I was started on 10mg prednisone, then I failed out on azathioprine (got fevers/aches). I started methotrexate 10mg a couple weeks ago to improve the efficacy of Remicade. I am already feeling quite a bit better (despite the prednisone / methotrexate side effects), but should be in remission by the end of the year on Remicade. The nice thing is that I should be able to taper off the prednisone + lower my methotrexate dose by early next year, which is awesome. Thank you so much for all this info! It was written out so well. I truly appreciate..makes me less anxious seeing the logic behind how the drs think. The more I reflect on my appointment..the more I realize he wants to prepare me to go down this new route. \nNice to hear your treatment is working and you are doing better !! Good luck &amp; be well :) hope you get to full remission soon. \ud83d\ude42 Thanks!! Likewise for you - hopefully this new treatment route works for you!\n\nAnd anytime - the Behcet's community is very small - so we got to look out for each other :) \u2764\ufe0f I have had excellent luck on remicade too! I am on imuran remicade and otezla as of now, and it is the only combo that is slowed my active flares. Humira, colchicine/imuran combo, and methotrexate just did not work for me :(\n\nGood luck! \ud83d\udc9b", "Diet! I have just started experimenting with cutting out dairy and (most!) gluten (there is at least one paper with a more-than-tentative link between cow's-milk protein(s) and higher sensitivity in Beh\u00e7et's patients), but just before that I also had a flare up in my eye, so on high-dose pred again but thankfully not for as long as my first flare-up (a 4-week vs a 6-ish month tail-off).\n\nI am also experimenting with having powdered food (think something like Soylent) for breakfast and lunch, in the hope that my diet will be a little bit more balanced. Quite liking it so far.\n\nCannot say I have noticed any major changes yet apart from being in less of a food-coma after eating, which I mainly put down to the powered food thing.\n\nI will update if I notice any changes over the next few months.\n\nAs a little aside: Since Beh\u00e7et's is found primarily on/around the old silk trading routes in the Middle East, I had a look at the prevalent food groups in diets there - they seem to be quite heavy on wheats, grains, etc. No idea if it has any causal link whatsoever, but was interesting to find out.\n\n**TL;DR:** I have been doing some reading around Beh\u00e7et's and diet, and I am wondering if anyone here has found any benefits to excluding certain foods/food groups, or has been diagnosed with being intolerant to certain foods?\n", "otezla for symptoms besides ulcers? I just had my first appointment with the rheumatologist who will be managing my treatment moving forward, after about a year of waiting to be seen and having my pcp prescribe prednisone on and off. I have been on colchicine for about a year, and have not had many ulcers anywhere since starting it. I have not noticed a difference in my stomach issues from colchicine, but I had pretty bad GI issues before starting it. I am also on twice daily omeprazole. However, no painkillers or steroids help with my overall body aches, migraine, or vision problems. The rheumatologist said that if I switch to otezla, it will treat the ulcers, but also treat the other symptoms and pain. I am worried that if it does not actually help, the side effects could be worse and I might be better off staying on colchicine. Has anyone experienced relief from pain and eye symptoms from otezla?", "\"Behcet's block\"? Hello, I am new here. \n\nI (26F) just met with my pain management doc about my ongoing (10 year) low back/SI joint pain/arthritis, and (unless I misheard him) he said we might try a \"Behcets block\", which I gathered would be a particular low back nerve block that would last for 3-6 months. However, I cannot find anything with this name online, so I am not sure if it is doctor speak or just a normal steroid injection that is often done for Behcet's. Have any of you had steroid injections for spinal or SI arthritis? Did it help? \n\nfyi, I am not diagnosed with Behcet's, and I am not sure my doc was even suggesting I have it, although it would explain a lot lol. My diagnoses - fibromyalgia (age 12), psoriasis (since forever), arthritis (probably for a long time, or off and on, but diagnosed a few months ago), dysautonomia. My neuro kept thinking myasthenia gravis for its weird ocular symptoms, but we have ruled that out a bunch of ways. Ruled out lupus and RA as well. All my blood tests are usually normal, except for low positive ANA.", "Do Behcet's patients have or not a weaker immune system? I did not quite understand if that is the case or not yet, can someone help me? Naturally, no. But the main treatments are immunosuppressants so if you are on those the answer is yes. Do you have a study or other resource on hand? It would be really handy for me to easily have irrefutable source backing it up. Just had a quick search and could not find anything. I do not have \u201cirrefutable\u201d proof like you are asking for but I am not really sure you will find anyone in a science journal discussing it because it is just not how the immune system works, so it is not really up for debate. Plus the disease is rare and it is challenging to find any information at all about it Thanks. I work as a hospital porter (no patients, just equipment and supplies) and would like to go back to work, my preferred site is the designated covid hospital, but I think we have 4 current cases for the entire Island Health authority and none are currently hospitalized. But at the moment I live at my parents and mum is a bit over protective of me thanks to BD. I understand wanting to be safe, and underlying condition or not you should be safe! Having Behcets may not naturally lower your immune system but it may leave you at higher risk (depending on severity/what organ(s) are affected, etc) and you should be careful, but 4 cases is super low so that sounds promising 4 cases across all of Vancouver Island (and surrounding islands). In my particular case with Beh\u00e7et's I get inflammation in my calves (not being able to walk makes portering kind of difficult), and I am only taking colchicine for oral ulcers and turmeric in general. Jealous, I live in the middle of a hot-spot area where there are no longer available beds in hospitals. Stay safe! It is a blessing and a curse being on am island. We are isolated for the most part but if it gets out of control here it is going to swamp us because there is no where to escape to. The fact that there is a lot of outdoors, 'wilderness' vacation destinations here makes it bringing people here, and there is a lot of overlap between those areas and remote indigenous communities that would be decimated is a recipe for disaster. My understanding is Beh\u00e7et\u2019s is related to an over-active immune response. Treatment with immunosuppressants make the immune system more \u2018normal\u2019. So... my guess is the immune system is not \u2018weaker\u2019 compared to the average person. Just weaker to what is normal for you. Hmm but I feel like this is a complex answer if you are referring to covid. Depending on severity of your disease. Anyone on immunosuppressive medications has a weaker immune system. \n\nAnd I can only speak for myself but my Mom is my babysitter for any appointments and things I have for my kids..my doctor wrote a letter saying I have a disease and am on medication that makes me more susceptible to covid complications. And she was able to stay working from home for my safety. So I do not know if it is that black and white. \n\nnew research with covid shows that it is not pneumonia related complications it is blood clots forming in the blood vessels of the lungs and other areas of the body. Which was why ventilators were not best. And they use steroids and aspirin and a lot of other things not originally recommended. Also colchicine is being used for certain complications that can happen. \n\nI guess my point is this clearly has a vascular effect to our body ..so to me having bechets would complicate that? And I wonder when you are already taking all these life saving medications how helpful they end up being for people like me lol.\n\n\nI think it is case by case. I also have asthma so am on Spiriva &amp; Flovent. And HBP from bechets so there is procardia. Along with my immunosuppressive medications and colchicine. And maybe that plays a part for my doctors considering me higher risk. Bechets is so different for everyone though. Hope all are safe and well \u2764\ufe0f and just pray for better days! It is absolutely weakened ..it is a known side effect of any immunosuppressant and any doctor prescribing one would let you know. Just because it is making you better does not mean you are \u201cnormal\u201d. Does not work that way. \ud83d\ude4f I am on the immunosuppressant azathioprine 100mg/day. I asked my rheumatologist if I am more vulnerable and he says theoretically yes but the science does not show extra vulnerability. And my latest blood work shows my neutrophils (white blood cells) have recovered to normal levels. Sorry I do not have any links to share. How is your white blood cell count?\n\nAnd remember, stress does weaken the immune system. So ( Not sure if anyone has said this yet but... the trait of Behcets is an overactive immune system. The symptoms are because your immune system is attacking your body.", "Quick one question poll for the readers of /r/behcets/  I nearly fought my GP over it.\n\nHe told me it could not possibly be Behcets because I told him I had not been sexually active in almost a decade and I was clear of all STDs.\n\nI told him he did not know what he was talking about, and I wanted to see a RA. He told me I needed to stop reading web MD.\n\n8 hours later at 11pm he called me, and apologized, and set me up with an amazing RA and eye doc who figured out it quick.\n\nI had been suffering for 20 years. I asked a doctor on one of those internet sites and she actually knew heaps about it and said she thought that was the diagnosis. I had wondered but then thought that only certain races tended to get it, not Celtic females, so left it alone until I talked to her. I went to my doctor who sent me to a rheumatologist who then diagnosed me. I had been diagnosed with herpes on and off for years which I did not have. A very frustrating time, and a scary one. There should be an option for \u201cphysician treating me as if I have behcets but has not yet made an official diagnosis\u201d because that is where I am at... I do not think it is fair to say I have self-diagnosed, as I am on medication for it. My gastroenterologist diagnosed Behcet's. Bases on the mouth ulcers and rectal ulcers! Do not give up!", "Does this look like a Behcet\u2019s-related sore? ", "Behcets and Breathing Do any of you experience breathing difficulty related to Behcets? If so, what is it like and do you take medication for it? \n\n\n\nI have been struggling with my breathing for a while and I am curious if it is related to Behcets. My GP seemed pretty stumped by my symptoms and I am skeptical of how she is treating it. My GYN is the one who diagnosed me with Behcets, so I may go back to him and ask for a referral. I am curious to hear others\u2019 experiences. \n\n\n\nThank you! I will get random sharp pains in my chest while breathing, no idea why, but I take prednisone which has helped a bit. The pain only lasts a few seconds. Pulmonary (lung) involvement in Behcet's Disease can occur in up to 10% of patients. It will look a lot like other pulmonary vasculitis disorders - cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath. You will want to see a rheumatologist sooner than later if this is pulmonary Behcet's - it is a bit higher risk for complications if not treated early, so they take these cases a bit more seriously. \n\nI had a dry cough when I was going through active flares, but this stopped since starting treatment. My rheum had me get some chest xrays just to check to see if there was any lung damage/inflammation, but thankfully it came back clean :) When I was a kid I got diagnosed with SVT. I just got diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s few days ago. My whole life I felt I have panic attacks, shortness of breath and feeling heart palpitations. I feel heart palpitations now and out of breath. I have no insurance and seeing a cardiologist is like going homeless so I have to wait until I get married so I can get insurance. I think you should go to a cardiologist and tell them everything. I heard the heart and arteries can be inflamed \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14 I wish u the best I do ..I also have asthma so that may make mine different. But with a flare I sometimes feel like I am breathing in like cigarettes or smoke through each breath. It is painful. My drs have stated they cannot know for sure if it is directly from a flare itself or stress from the flare \ud83e\udd2a when it happens I am put on steroids. But since being put on Spiriva and Flovent It is been more manageable. I have had asthma since I was a kid so they did recent PFT tests ..and my asthma is considered mild. Not sure how to describe that other than from those results they could tell I still have asthma but it is not advancing and do not have copd. unless I was having an active attack while being tested they cannot say what is triggering it.\n\nNot a dr so of course ask yours. But I recommend steroids to hold you over as they helped me and still do :) good luck!\n\nEdit: do you also get chest pain (I do). And have you had your BP looked at. I have HBP from all my complications. Or maybe a stress test? One thing I learned throughout this process is something\u2019a are hard to identify unless actively sick. As the damage is not permanent which is good. As it is fixable. But the bad is certain things can be missed until there is damage. it is important to pinpoint it. The heart and lungs are connected in ways I never realized. :) I get chest pain. An inhaler helps but it is always worse when I am run down. Spent a while worrying that it was heart trouble before doc calmed me down. I get these too! I always assumed they are heartburn but I will start paying more attention. \n\n\nI asked my GP for prednisone but she did not want to prescribe it - I took it back in June and it helped tremendously. That is great news that your xrays were good! \n\n\nI was referred for a CT scan, and we are going to go from there. :) Thank you! I hope that you are able to find relief without breaking the bank. I get chest pains but was told to take Prilosec for heartburn - it did not really help. My BP is pretty normal. I have gotten really good at managing my stress. :) \n\n\nI asked my GP for steroids and she prescribed Singulair instead. I have never had asthma and my lungs sound okay so, Behcets aside, it just does not quite fit. Since my GP was not involved in my Behcets diagnosis, I wanted to make sure I am advocating for my health to the best of my abilities. I appreciate your insight! I am glad to hear you found something that helps! I have a much harder time when I am tired, too. I am actually allergic to singular..i am curious why theyd put you on that without history of respiratory issues. And not give you a rescue inhaler if they did not want to give you steroids..It takes months to really work and has lots of side effects. And for bechets steroids work quickly just not ideal long term. But that is just my random uneducated thoughts lol. Good luck :) hope you figure it out. I have seen my GP with respiratory complaints several times this year and I have had a long string of infections. She prescribed singular for the anti-inflammatory properties. I made this post after reading more about it, for all the reasons you listed. I got a second opinion late yesterday and was given a few OTC options to tide me over to my CT scan, and I am not filling the Singulair script. Your comment helps me feel like I did the right thing!", "I believe I have Behcets. My long story of being undiagnosed and largely underestimated by doctors and finally figuring out all the connections. About 2 years ago, something hit me like a ton of bricks. Out of nowhere, my 29 year old self, had a strange headache after work one night. I began pressing into my sinuses and at one point, my eye began to twitch uncontrollably. The only difference was, it never stopped. It twitched for months afterwards. This was the first of my baffling symptoms and my long journey with an undiagnosed illness. \n\nThe following weeks started to become gradually worse and the symptoms became stranger and stranger. The twitching had progressed to my other eye as well and I developed a severe burning sensation behind both of my eyes (it felt like eyelashes in my eyes 24/7!). Constantly had floaters in my vision. I started to get dizzy spells at night, and even had these horrifying audio dropouts in my hearing\u2026followed by ringing in my ears. I had gone to quite a few emergency rooms at this point, and doctors tested me for many infectious diseases and other problems\u2026but none of them could piece together my strange list of symptoms. Even my girlfriend was beginning to question my symptoms because every doctors visit was futile.\n\nOddly, I noticed a strange bump on my left calf shortly after many of my initial symptoms\u2026it looked like a medium sized pimple\u2026except it never went away (I still have this strange bump, nearly 3 years later\u2026it has not disappeared). As weeks turned into months, I was certain I might die which was thankfully an over reaction to my frightening symptoms. My eyes were on fire, they twitched, I had strange headaches, and finally one of my most frightening symptoms began to manifest. I had a throbbing blood clot/pulsating type feeling in each of my temples at random times. The closest thing I could find to this type of disorder was \u201ctemporal arteritis\u201d which was very strange because I did not even come close to the age group for that type of disease. Regardless, when I felt a pulsating feeling in my temple, my body would have random muscle spasms associated with the throbbing sensation. Sometimes my leg might have tiny spasms\u2026other times my shoulder\u2026even my arms would have this feeling when I felt this strange sensation in my temple. The inside of my sinuses were on fire at this point as well. It was as if someone poured acid into my eyes and up my nose\u2026\n\nI documented a lot of my symptoms around this time. I felt certain I was about to have a stroke. I eventually had trouble focusing on conversations\u2026almost like a brain fog. I had this strange tingling feeling down the back of my head and neck on many occasions which followed with dizzy spells and confusion. These were very frightening! \n\nThe last symptom which I saved for last\u2026because of the irony\u2026is apthous ulcers (canker sores). I have had these sores my whole life in my mouth. I never thought much of them before. They came and went as I grew up\u2026but I never knew they could be linked to something like the terrifying symptoms I was having. Usually, the minute I bite my lip or cheek, I am destined to get one of these ulcers\u2026it is became pretty routine for me and I never though much of it. However, In the past 30 days or so, I have specifically tried to count the number of times I have had these types of ulcers. So far, the number of ulcers has been exactly 3 (1 on my tongue, and 2 on my inner lip).\n\nAnother reason why I am rather certain that I must have Behcets is because I have always had strange joint pains. Once when I was younger, I woke up and my legs were so week I could not walk\u2026I look back at that and realize how serious this was\u2026and how I never really though much of it because they worked fine the next day. This happened again to me near the end of my initial storm of symptoms! My knee began to randomly jolt with severe pain which was crippling. It popped and I nearly fell a few times when my leg just spontaneously would give out. I though I had torn a muscle\u2026but my doctor suspected arthritis.\n\nThe arthritis diagnoses may have saved my life! I was battling a storm of worsening symptoms around this point\u2026eyes always on fire\u2026I thought I might go blind or have a stroke and lose my vision. I could almost tell that something was up with my arteries because of all the strange things happening with my body at this point. Finally, the doctor prescribed me a week of Prednisone for what he suspected was arthritis. \n\nMy year long nightmare of symptoms faded rather quickly upon being prescribed Prednisone. My eyes stopped burning, the throbbing in my temples went away, my dizzy spells became less frequent\u2026nearly all my symptoms went away after just a week of Prednisone. \n\nTo this day, most of my symptoms have been easy to maintain and the storm-like deterioration of my health has thankfully subsided. I cannot promise that I have Behcets\u2026because I went to every doctor/specialist I could find and none of them ever even seemed to suspect anything of the sort\u2026even if they did, upon my research, it is quite difficult to diagnose. \n\nIf you have Behcets and can relate to any of the symptoms I have listed, please feel free to comment. I believe I will discuss this illness with my new doctor at our next visit because it almost certainly resembles everything I have experienced thus far. I am reaching out here because if my illness is in fact Behcets, then I strongly sympathize for anyone else who is had to deal with this in their life. I had many of those symptoms myself. The brain fog, ulcers on my legs, genitals, mouth, and nose. The ulcers looked like chicken pocs at first then grew in size and number until they became open sores. The headaches and dizziness were a factor as well. I have had what I imagine arthritis feels like in my hands and legs. At times I could not even make a fist, hold a coffee mug, etc. I would even get the shakes in my hands for no apparent reason. I had been in and out of the hospital. Three week stay at one point. Another week and a half stay another time with no resolution and only more questions. It took a new rheumatologist to look into this. Had my blood pressure around 43/32 so I was almost dead.  My advice is find a reputable rheumatologist and work with them. It will take sometime and plenty of blood tests but from my experience it sounds very familiar to symptoms I have had. Have you seen an eye doctor? I think the dx of Behcets is trickier if you do not have uveitis, since it is a diagnostic criteria. When I am in a flare and having bad mouth ulcers I have 4 or 5 at a time, but I have read stories of people with both. \n\nPrednisone can fix a very wide range of disorders, nut at least you found something that helps in the short term! It is not a great long term treatment, but it is always nice to know something works. I went to 2 different eye doctors and neither of them noticed anything out of the normal. It was a tremendous let down\u2026because both times my eyes were severely in pain. I might eventually try to go back\u2026but my eye symptoms have faded away at this point for the most part.  \n\nI was literally sleeping with an eye mask ice pack at one point because the redness and itchy feeling was so severe. I was baffled that my eyes hurt so bad and neither eye doctor did anything but tell me to buy OTC eye drops. \n\nThe fact that Behcets is so tricky to diagnose is a big reason I had lost hope in most of my doctors. I have recently had my first appointment with a rheumatologist and hope that maybe I do not run into another issue of being doubted with my symptoms. The only thing that was apparent from my myriad of tests and doctor visits for me was that my cholesterol was through the roof. After finding this out, I stopped drinking soda and only had a diet of white meat and water for quite a while. It was around this time that I was prescribed Prednisone for my knee giving out and most of my other symptoms faded away simultaneously.\n\nI just visited a rheumatologist a few weeks ago and plan to discuss Behcets with him on my next visit. I have only recently realized that my mouth ulcers which I have had since I was a kid could very well be linked to all these other frightening symptoms.  art thee 32, 31, 'r 29? thy post history is a mess\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` I have Behchets and I have Papilledema and have had a case of uevitis. Try an ophthalmologist instead of an optometrist. Also the \u201ceye pain\u201d you describe could be severe sinus pain. I get severe sinus pain. Remember, Behchets is an inflammatory disease and sinuses can get inflamed. What is your height and weight? Height 5\u201910\u201d\nWeight 165 lbs Are you still taking prednisone? No, the doctor only prescribed me about 1-2 weeks worth. I still find it fascinating that shortly after the treatment with prednisone, most of the scary and concerning symptoms faded away. &gt;It took a new rheumatologist to look into this. Had my blood pressure around 43/32 so I was almost dead.\n\nAnd you were diagnosed, right?\n\nI was confirmed with vasculitis this morning, presumably Behcet's with more testing. My low blood pressure (mine's a bit higher than yours -- 75/48 is my normal number) is the one thing that consistently upsets me that we cannot solve, because it on its own brings a fuck ton of other symptoms. \n\nI will be relieved to hear if you had it as part of your Behcet's.", "My Story. Hi all, I am stoked to see this is a sub, Beh\u00e7ets its quite rare and there is not really much out there in terms of support, that is partly why I feel the need to share my story, I might be able to help someone in some way, I dont know, but feel free to message me, I would love to talk to you, i have never met or spoke to anyone with Beh\u00e7ets before. \n\nEvery doctor I see, has no idea what Beh\u00e7ets even is which means I have to explain what it is a lot, not just to doctors but people in general, which i am sure the majority of people here have to do too. It sucks, I would love to raise awareness for this disease, but do not know where to even start, any ideas?\n\nGrowing up, I had always suffered badly with mouth ulcers but other than that I was relatively healthy, had asthma that seemed to go away after a couple months of steroids and a year or two on asthma pumps. In hindsight, I can see my Beh\u00e7ets symptoms now, big weight loss/gains, mouth ulcers, I had a genital ulcer at one point, at twelve I had to have my tonsils removed because I was getting tonsilitus on a regular basis, probably had something to do with my asthma too if I ever even had asthma, i am not sure about that.\n\nI was diagnosed in 2015, when I was 18, I had it quite rough, I was coughing up blood for months as it progessively got worse, I seen many doctors in the beginning, I was mis-diagnosed as having a bad chest infection, I felt at the time I was not being taken seriously, I was a young man, healthy as can be on the outside, so doctors would take a quick look and send me on my way with some meds (not the ones I actually needed), not only the doctors but my family did not take me seriously either. As I said, I was coughing up bits of blood to begin with, then it got worse and worse, to the point where blood was literally pouring out of my mouth. It was a nightmare come true for me as I am really bad when it comes to blood, I get dizzy and I have fainted in the past because of it.\n\nNovember 2015, I had been in and out of the doctors several times and I was given Prednisolone and told to rest up, so I took my meds and stayed in bed for the majority of the time, in hindsight this was a big mistake, as I had clots all over my legs that I did not know about yet, staying sedentary was only making it worse. So, one night at around 10pm, I was laying in bed watching TV with my girlfriend and I start cough again, the coughing did not stop and I was starting to bleed really heavily, blood was everywhere, like I said it was a nightmare come true, it was even on the ceiling, had to throw out all the bedding and re-paint the walls, I fully believed I was going to die that night, I can remember asking my girlfriend if I was going to die and she assured me that I was not going to but I did not believe her, it must have been so frightening for her, we were both quite young but she has always been the strongest one out of us both, she called an ambulance, I lost a lot of blood and needed to be rushed into hospital, the ambulance guy was amazing and I wish I could thank him, he done a brilliant job keeping my mind off of what was happening which is incredible when you think of the circumstances.\n\nI ended up in A&amp;E, sat waiting to be seen on those cold hard metal benches in the waiting room while filling those cardboard bed pans full of blood because they had nothing else for me to use, an hour or two go by and I finally get called in to be seen, the doctors were very confused, which only made my worst fears worse, now at this point things get a little blurry as I was very weak at this stage, I had lost pints of blood and I was still bleeding, so I cannot remember too much, but what I do remember is the coughing coming to a stop and I could finally go to sleep, then come early morning I was being woke up by the nurses because I was being moved to a ward, after getting to the ward I started to feel better, to the point where I was able to relax.\n\nThe next night I was relaxing in the hospital bed watching some TV and I feel that tickle in my throat, I knew instantly I was about to start coughing blood up again, I called for the nurse and pressed my buzzer, the nurse came around and she was mortified at the sight of me, I did not even need to cough anymore, blood was just pouring out of my mouth, the nurse had no idea what to do, so she went to get help, next thing I know I am surrounded by doctors, nurses and medical equipment, asking me loads of questions trying to figure out what exactly was happening to me, they had no idea at all, I look at my heart rate monitor and its in the 200's, I was going into respiratory arrest, at this point I was sure I was not going to survive this, I started thinking about my life and all the people in it, what im going to miss ect, it was truly the most terrifying experience of my life.\n\nThis is where my memory gets really muddy, because all I can remember from that point on is going through the cold corridors of the hospital on my way to the emergency room, on the way I see my brother and my father making their way through the hospital trying to find the ward I was on, they did not notice me at first and I tried my best to call them and raise my hand so they would see me, they seen me and followed me down to the emergency room, where my mother was waiting for me.\n\nThen I am surrounded by surgeons and doctors again, one doctor was asking my family some questions and reassuring me I was in good hands, I can remember feeling hopeless because my girlfriend was not there, she has always had my back through thick and thin and had been caring for me the entire time I was ill, where as my mother, father and brother did nothing for me, they never have. The surgeon told me he was going to put me to sleep as I needed emergency surgery and to count down from 10, I fell asleep looking at my family looking over me crying, I thought this was the last thing I was going to see.\n\nI wake up a couple of days later surrounded by my family after having emergency surgery to remove the clots from my lungs, I had a lot of them, but there was one really big one that was blocking something vital, they were worried about removing it because it could have been the only thing stopping me from bleeding out in less than a minute, they had told my family it was 50/50. I could not speak as I had a big tube going down my throat to help my lung work because one half of my lungs completely shut down, so they gave me a pen and some paper so I could ask some questions, they had put me into an induced coma to keep me stable, according to family and my girlfriend, I could hear people in my coma and would sometimes respond by moving my hand or my girlfriend tells me that I would squeeze her hand 3 times, which is our way of saying I love you whenever we cannot say it out loud, we are quite shy people so we do not like to be all lovey and soppy around people. I do not remember a thing though, just waking up.\n\nThat Is when I asked what was happening to me, and they told me the doctors think it is Beh\u00e7ets, they had called and spoken to several doctors all over the country until they came across a doctor in Birmingham who suggested it might be Beh\u00e7ets, he got a flight the next day over to Wales where I live to come and confirm it.\n\nSo a week later and i am home again, taking Humira once a fortnight and after a little while I was comepletely back to normal, felt like nothing was even wrong with me, this is where I messed up, I stopped taking my Humira regularly and would miss it sometimes, I learnt the hard way so if you are reading this and you have Beh\u00e7ets or know someone with it, TAKE THE MEDS, do not make the same mistake as me, please.\n\nLast year, close to Christmas time, I started getting headaches, thinking nothing of it (please, if you get even a small cold, go to your doctor to be checked, its worth it), I carry on with things and take pain killers, the headaches get worse as the days go by, dizzy spells, sensitivity to light, vision loss and fatigue get worse and worse, so then one night it finally hits me, this is bad I need to see a doctor, so I call out of hours and they suggest I go to hospital as it sounds really serious, so I go the next day, a nuerologist comes to see me after waiting for hours, and she checks the discs in my eyes and she says that they are swollen and inflamed, which is a bad sign, so after a couple of days of tests and speaking to different doctors it turns out I have a clot in one of the main veins to my brain.\n\nSo currently i am on Clexane to thin my blood (looking at alternatives with haemotology at the moment), Acetazolomide to reduce swelling in my brain and Humira to help with the immune system side of things, I am back on my feet now and have just got a new job, I was lucky to survive both of these journeys and I am terrified of it happening again, I have a daughter on the way and I fear for how its going to effect me in the future when it comes to her, I want to be able to provide for her and be there for her, i am also scared because noone seems to know anything about if Beh\u00e7ets can be passed down, I would hate for her to have to go through any of this.\n\nThank you for taking time to read this, I really appreciate it, I apologise for the length, its been a crazy couple of years and I have never been able to fully get it off my chest. You are more than welcome to message me if you have any questions, advice or would just like someone else with Beh\u00e7ets to talk to. Every time I read people talking about their symptoms they look very different from mine, but well, finally, I have found another one whose main problem is the clots. Welcome to the club XD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a clot that increased pressure in my vein, and now I am perfectly fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeh\u00e7et is an autoinmune disease, there are many debates about what causes autoinmune diseases, but the more accepted theory (and the one that I think is true) is that there is a genetic component that can be \"activated\" by some things. Many viruses get in the body forever once you get them, but they are controlled, in any way, even if there are no viruses, the body generates a response to them and it keeps memory of what happens, so if you have something wrong in your body, it may keep attacking things that it should not. (I am not a doctor but I have read a lot about it). So, your girlfriend has no risk at all of becoming ill, and if you have children, they may (it is not even sure) have a bigger chance of having problems with that than the average person, but that means: \n\nPassing the gen/genes (50% chance)xThe gen being dominat or your girlfriend having it too (? chance)xEnviroment triggers whatever can cause Beh\u00e7et, wich can be for example catching mononucleosis(I do not know, let us say 30%chance)x(the disease causing \"real problems\", I am sure there are many people with \"Beh\u00e7et, or if you want, something similar, that is just a smaller response of the body, but still a wrong response). So, in the end, I think the genetical risks are not a high reason to not having children (Now, if the disease is making your life hard and you cannot be there for them, that is another thing... and I think that women can have problems during pregnacy, but I do not know a lot about that, I am not sure). Funny thing, being in the hospital I got some treatment that can make me sterile, so they asked me to save some sperm, thinking in the posibility of having children in the future.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout anticoagulants, I think there is controversy about the use of them with Beh\u00e7et, our clots are caused not by something in the blood, but in the pipes, something that as you probably know very well, can make the pipes broke too, and when you bleed, it is not good at all taking anticoagulants. But what you said about exercise seems to be very important for us, it is extremely good against clots... that is is difficult for me, I have been always very lazy to that kind of things. Let us try to change that. Wow, thank you so much! So much useful information! Its great to hear from you.\n\nI need to excercise a lot more than I do, me and my cousin are going to take up boxing training (not sparring because of the blood thinners, could be dangerous), so hopefully that helps to keep me healthy. As you know, clots can be very dangerous and can show up anywhere in your body so its best to take preventive action.\n\nI was told that the medicine i am on can cause infertillity, a couple months later my girlfriend got pregnant. Which was amazing news for us.\n\nThe anticoagulants specifically Warfarin, that is what I was put on in the beginning, that is what caused me to bleed so heavily when I had the clots on my lungs, I see what you mean by how they can be controversial, is there any alternative medicine other than anticoagulants? \n\nI had pneumonia, that is what caused my Beh\u00e7ets to show itself, I was sedentary a lot of the time as I was suffering from depression and anxiety, I would only leave my bed to get food or go to the toilet, the house I was living in had a lot of mould growing around the windows and I stupidly would leave the window open all night, Beh\u00e7ets is known to make you struggle with regulating body temperature right? They say that depression and anxiety are also linked to Beh\u00e7ets, any idea if that is true?\n\nThank you for the information on passing down Beh\u00e7ets, that was really helpful, I will make sure to keep an eye out for it when it comes to my daughters health, and mention it at every doctor appointment.\n\nYou said you had a clot that increased the pressure, did you have lumbar punctures? They are so uncomfortable :( Also, did you get any problems with your vision like I did? Its like when you stand up to quickly and everything starts to fade and go black but it used to happen even if I was sat down.\n\nHow are you now? How long has it been since your last hospital visit? Also, what medication do you take if you do not mind me asking? I am curious to see if there are alernatives to what I am currently taking. As I said I do not really feel like doctors know what they are actually doing when it comes to my health, it all feels like guesswork. The use of anticoagulants in our disease is controversial cause it may not stop clots from forming, it may even cause more clots. English is not my main language, so I cannot get into details, going deeply in what is more my opinion than science, but I have talked about this with my doctors and well, some things can be found in the internet. \n\nOur blood is fine. The way that thrombus are usually formed is having \"clots\" in the legs, that then goes to smaller pipes were they cannot pass, specially if the blood has a bigger viscosity, more clots get in the thrombus as blood slowly passes through there and there you have it... but small clots are formed all the time in the body, exercising is very good because well, you move the blood better, it breaks the clots, and with time, your body adapting to exercise makes bigger and better pipes. What causes clots for us is the inflamation of arteries, it is like having a pipe that get streched or with worse bigger walls, so the viscosity of the fluid passing trhough them is not very important, sometimes, when the pipe has this problems, an aneurism can happen, something that I, with my limited knowledge, being an engineer, understand as, well, the walls get bigger, and it can broke. If it brokes, you bleed, and depending in the place, it can be very dangerous, specially if you are going to bleed more because of antociagulants. Well, if the pipe gets smaller because of the walls, a clot may happen more easily, but at least for me, that clots did not  come from other parts of the body, they were formed in situ... so, are anticoagulants really helpful? is the risk worth taking? (that is with limited knowledge and without going deeply). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took anticoagulants for maybe two years, or more, I am not sure. And the alternative is simple, not taking them. Now, you still have that clot in a vein in the brain, if the pressure is high, at least until you solve that problem, it is a good idea (as far as I know), but once solved, I would talk about the treatment in the long run with your doctors, that is where there is bigger controversy. And if you want to know my opinion, talk about it with a doctor that is not going to give you the meds. Why? because some doctors play \"defensive medicine\", wich is \"trying to do the thing that makes me less responsible of what happens\", what is usually done, giving anticoagulants? then give them, because if I do not give them and something happens, they may even sue me, but if I do it and something bad happens, I only followed the procedure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStress is very related with autoinmune diseases, it is related with hormons, if you have taken prednisone or things like that, well, stress affect a lot in what your body produces of what we take as medicine, so that is one example of how much it can affect us. I have a lot of anxiety and I have noticed that I had more problems during exams, so yeah, it is probably related with that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I am bad, I feel cold to a level that make me stop doing anything, I cannot even text with the phone because my hands are trembling too much. And then there is fever and I sweat a lot at night (only when I am bad), so what you say about body temperature is true, but I guess it depends in the person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had three lumbar punctions, the first one I was nervous, I cannot relax my muscles so it was a bit painful, but well, not bad. The second one was better. And the third one was the day before leaving the hospital, and I was dumb enough to get up after it, thinking \"well, the first ones were fine\": Do not move for an hour or two after that shit. I started puking and having a terrible headache and was not good for days. \n\nWhen I had that problems in my jugular, the thing that made me go to the doctor was seeing bad with one eye. I even took at home the Amler test before going to the hospital. But I did not see things darker, I just could not focus with one eye, everything was fuzzy (that was not my only symptom, but it was the only symptom in the eye and the biggest one). At that time they did not know it was Beh\u00e7et. The optical nerve was having damage due to pressure and my eye with it. The thing with this is that  longer time of higher pressure in your brain cause more damage, and then the body can heals, but a little, nerves are not good at that. So until you end your time there, you will not know how you will end. \n\nWhen doctors see at my eye, they still can see a scar, but I can see perfectly fine. With what I saw about your case, the worst case for you would be to lose some vision in the eye, maybe see things a little darker in the extremes... but that is not even sure and in any case I do not think it would affect you at all in your daily life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust now I am fine. My last visit to the hospital is close though, a month ago. I am going to start with humira as soon as they give it to me, they approved it a month ago but burocracy is slow XD. I went there only because of fever this time, I think I caught it on time. I am taking 15mg prednisone (wich should be 10 mg in two days... I would like to take less of it, because it is very bad in the long run, but every time I take less, my symptoms appear, let us hope it changes this time), 150 mg of inmurel (that will be changed for the humira) and 1 mg of colchicine. Thank you so much for making the effort to talk with me, i really do appreciate it, especially considering english is not your first language, you write it very well just to let you know.\n\nOpinion or science, I am very thankful for the information, I did not know a lot of what you have been telling me and it has really opened my mind to what this disease really is, as I said there is not much support for me where I live, so any information is good information. I feel like I have a much better understanding of the disease after talking with you.\n\nI do find that stress can cause me to flare up, but I have to be very stressed. \nThe temperature is a nightmare to deal with, I am constantly struggling to keep a healthy temperature, just like you I can get very cold, very easily, especially my hands and feet, I too have had it where I cannot hold my phone because of the shaking, I also have the bad sweats during the nights, I can wake up in the morning and my sheets will be soaking wet with my sweat, especially during times when I am ill, excercise can be very tough because I sweat a lot, it can also be quite embarrassing. \nI have struggled with my weight for my whole life, losing too much or gaining too much, there is times where I dont want to eat at all and theres times where I want to eat too much, do you experience this?\n\nNow thanks to you and this sub I can have a more detailed discussion with my doctors about what is best for me. I also feel like my doctors do the defensive medicine thing.\n\nMy anxiety has come and gone over the years but at one point I felt like I could not even leave my house without having a panic attack. I read a lot about helping myself with my anxiety and now thanks to meditation, mindfullness and excercise I finally feel like I am in control.\n\nI had 3 or 4 lumbar punctures myself, the doctor performing them missed one time and really hurt my back, I had back pain for weeks after, I never experienced puking or headaches though as I stayed in the hospital bed for a long time after it was done, that sounds really awful.\n\nI think you might benefit from Humira, I believe I have, I do not seem to get as many flare ups these days, hopefully you can get started on that and will not have to see the hospital for a while, hospitals are a pain, especially when you have a rare disease like this.\n\nGlad to hear you are doing well, I have been in good health for a while now, but that only makes me fear another visit soon, fingers crossed though. We can do this! All of us are strong individuals for coping with such a disease, we cannot let it have a negative impact on our lives.\n\nYour an engineer? That Is cool, I was into construction myself but I am avoiding that work at the moment due to risk of injuries and have debated getting into engineering as I like to work with my hands, does Beh\u00e7ets have any impact on your career? If so, how does it effect you? Do you struggle with work? I find it difficult to find work suitable for me. There is no need to say thanks, sharing what we know is good for all of us and it takes no effort, in fact it serves me to practice my English XD. (thanks for the compliment, I had an exam not so long ago and I will know if I pass on august, so lets see if you are right). \n\nI have been skinny most of my life. And in the latest years, when I started with this disease, I was geting really thin and I usually did not have hunger. But prednisone makes you want to eat a lot (maybe that is why your apetite has changed too. The change from very thin to normal was very quick for me, I gained like 10 kg or more in a month, but well, nothing to worry about, and luckily enough I have never had any real problems with my weight, I eat till I feel satisfied and that is all. \n\nI think my anxiety, nerves, stress... are partly in mi genes, my father and his mother are both very nervous, of course I should be able to handle things better, but it is difficult for me. And I have thought that this has damaged my body. sometimes I think that I would be healthy if my mind were healthier, but who knows, I do not have any proof, it is just a feeling. You say that you have to be very stressed to have a flare, but stress is worse if you are a little stressed for a big period of time than being under a lot of stress during some days. Try to not worry about going soon to the hospital, it could take you there XD. \n\nIn my country (Spain) at least hospitals are \"free\", so it is not so much pain.\n\nWell, I am a computer engineer (to be honest, I am not one yet, I will be one in september, when I give my final project), so you surely know more about construction than me, but when I asked my doctors (I am always asking them things, they get bored of me XD), they asked me \"You are an engineer are not you?\" I said \"Yes\" and they were like \"I knew it, you all tend to understand the body like if it was some sort of building or machine and solve problems that way when it is not\", I found that funny. \n\nWhen I do not have flares I am as healthy as anybody, so I could work in anything, the problem would be that I could get a flare and depending in how it is, I would probably have problems to work, but well, so far I have never had a \"serious\" job, I have only worked as a teacher in shcools and houses but just 3-4 hours each day, now that I am ending my time in college I think I will look for a job as a programmer, wich should not be very bad with this disease unless I get very ill. When I am bad I have fever and I am really tired, but I guess I can program too. Let us see. I think it is better to not worry about it, let us just try and see what comes, and if something does not work, try to look for other thing. In my country finding a good (or just not bad) job is not easy for anybody, if you see US unemployment vs Spain unemployment it is something like 3% against 21%, salaries are not very good, etc.. oof, better not think about it, i may get ill XD.  \n\nI do not know how this disease will affect me, I am relatively young and I have been diagnosed not so long ago, so I cannot know, I think I am starting to know how to deal with it better and I think (and hope) that I did not have very bad luck with my symptoms (so far at least), I am good now and that is good for now. I am glad that you are good ok :) I think the best we can do is trying to live a healthy life, you know, helathy food, exercise, not stress... but it sounds easier than it is XD. Best wishes :) Well best of luck for your exam bud. Hope all goes well.\n\nPrednisone definitely affected me, I ballooned and swelled up quite big and was eating non stop as I never felt satisfied, I do not take it any more though, my doctors stopped that a while ago, was the right decision? I dont know.\n\nI also have bad genes for anxiety, both of my parents have it, maybe its more to do with that than the Beh\u00e7ets but I do think Beh\u00e7ets does not help at all, especially because it can knock your confidence right down. A healthy mind always helps keep a healthy body! If you think positive, positivity will come to you more often, 100%. And yes, I will try my best to stay positive and not think about the hospital XD\n\nHealthcare is also free in the UK, thank god, I would not be able to afford to live otherwise.\n\nThat is funny though, you must be such a nightmare for the doctors lol, oh here he comes with his 101 questions again XD.\nI need to ask more questions I think, and be a bit more demanding for information when I see these doctors, I do not think I ask enough.\n\nJobs are extremely difficult to find where I live, the unemployment in my town is the highest in the entire country, so at the moment i am trying my best to find something suitable,  im just starting a bin collection job, so will be doing a lot of walking and I hope that is not going to effect me in a bad way, I hope that it will give me the excercise I need and keep me healthy. \n\nI wish I knew what I was doing when it comes to computers but im really bad lol a job like yours would be much better for my health, but I didnt do very well in school so I dont really have many opportunities. Im not stupid though, I can get good at anything, just takes me some time, I also suffer from ADHD or ADD see so its been quite tough for me.\n\nIts all about staying positive though you are right my friend, hopefully we can all stay in touch with each other using this sub so we can get the support we deserve. Its been a pleasure speaking to you, best wishes to you too buddy :) Hear me out, it is never too late to learn how to program. And you can use it for almost anything. Searching for a job this is the field were a degree is more useless. But in reality something with walking sounds good, while being in a desk all day can be very bad for health. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have remembered this song talking to you XD:\n\n ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a good day :) Loool that made me laugh.\n\nThanks man, have a good day too, stay positive, stay healthy. What a story, man. I am glad you are doing ok now. Stay healthy! Thanks bud! You too!", "Has anybody been prescribed otezla? My doctor gave me colchicine for a long time and it does nothing but destroy my stomach. He said Otezla might work but the side effects are severe and it costs a LOT of money. How was your experience? Did it work for mouth ulcers? I went from having 5-10 oral ulcers for two weeks at a time with a week of in between flare ups. To having two ulcers over the last year.   Luckily for me my insurance covers it. And the upset stomach only lasted a few weeks then I got used to it.   In my opinion it is a miracle drug.   I went from not being able to eat to my number one symptom of behcets gone I use Otezla prn, when my mouth ulcers are so bad l cannot eat or drink. It has some side effects, but it is worth it! I only take it for a couple weeks at a time then stop til it is necessary again. Depending on where you live there are programs that help with expensive meds. Check with your doctor for ideas of who to contact. I tried colchicine and it also destroyed my stomach and made me nauseous constantly. I was then prescribed Otezla and had similar issues including really severe joint pain and brain fog. I tried to push through and continue taking it but after speaking with my rheumatologist, he believed it would not be the answer to my problems. We have since discontinued it. I have started methotrexate and will be starting Remicade infusions shortly. Otezla has an incredible assistance plan. I get three months of Otezla delivered to my door at NO COST. Check their website and give them a call. They are very helpful and friendly. Oh wow, so its actually marketed specifically for Behcets mouth ulcers! Interesting!\n\n&gt;GoodRx coupon price $4,202.65\n\n-expletive-expletive-expletive-expletive-expletive-\n\nI mean you can ( so I guess that is something.\n\nI am so fucking sick of these stupid rx pricing games.\n\nThe side effects seem comparable to half of everything I already take, I would love to get away from the prednisone and colchicine but it feels like I would eventually get stuck with a **~$4000 COPAY**\n\nSorry, I know this is not anything you asked, but I just discovered this in real time. I have been on it for well over a year and have not paid a dime for it.  It is helped a lot with the mouth sores. But I do notice more stomach issues then before. \n\nBetween the mouth sores and the stomach issues occasionally I will gladly deal with the stomach issues What kind of stomach issues, specifically?\n\nI mean I know we are all different, but if i take my colchicine as prescribed, I am running for the toilet a few hours before my morning alarm goes off, and If I am honest, I do not always totally make it in time..\n\nI am usually fine during the day with my morning dose, but the evening dose.. boy. I have taken to only taking a half pill in the evenings because I just cannot stomach more.\n\nI do not need the prednisone if I take the full pill morning and night, but at a hefty cost.\n\nI could handle temporary nausea, bloating, anything but that super urgent wakeup.. I have to say everyone I have heard going from colchicine to otezla due to stomach issues has had it 10x worse on otezla, myself included. It is worth trying though for sure, just be prepared for possible SEs. My s/o gets Remicade infusions. It is the only thing that helps him. He has been denied by insurance and is suffering. I am trying to find a solution. \ud83d\udc94", "Do you all get random itchy spots (arm, leg, abdomen) where you check and find one puffy/swollen hair follicle? Then it either goes away or forms a pustule? Trying to see if this is Behcets or something else. It is always a hair follicle, though, and in random spots one or two at a time! Yep - I have an angry one on my arm right now. It starts out hot/itchy/irritating, then usually forms a pustule, but it can also just disappear. Yup and i noticee they were reduced when on otezla.

I cannot eat cold things either, unless with a straw as my teeth are so damn sensitive. \n\nI have a dietician but I need advice from people who live with this bullshit. What do you avoid?", "Telling people about diagnosis How do you guys go about telling people about your diagnosis? For the first few people I have told, I say the word \u201cimmune\u201d and they say \u201cyou have hiv? AIDS?\u201d It is just frustrating trying to explain your situation to people. Any advice on how to best explain behcets to people?  I just say I have autoimmune disorder that affects my blood vessels.  If they want more I will go into that it can manifest in many ways wherever there is blood, so it just depends.  Currently I am facing  &lt;insert symptoms here&gt;.  That is usually enough for them to go on and on about their friend of a friend who has Crohn's or celiac or something else and say at least you do not have that.  Then give you advice to fix it.  I normally start with \"it is like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, but different symptoms.\" Explaining a rare issue like this to people gets rather frustrating so I often begin the explanation as simple as I can, because people are stupid Ok I like the blood vessel line that probably makes more sense to people  This is so hilariously relatable. It is funny to finally see someone else who goes through this. Also it sucks, cause you have behcets too, but you know what I mean.  &gt; That is usually enough for them to go on and on about their friend of a friend who has Crohn's or celiac or something else and say at least you do not have that.

Like Crohn's is worse than Behcet or vice versa.", "Might have Behcet\u2019s, not sure So last year around this time I had genital sores pop up ( which I thought was herpes. I have had 3 IgG tests that have come back negative but I have had flare ups (very minor). I get the whole tingle feeling when I got stressed. \n\nAlso I have had canker sores when I was younger (\n\n(\n\nI am not sure if I am freaking out or maybe realized something is up. \n\nI also have gotten pink eye in my adult life but could have been from touching money then my eye. \n\nIdk. Am I freaking out? Is someone going to answer me???? I would say it does not quite sound like behcets.  But honestly behcets can be different in everyone.  Generally the things you describe can be symptoms, but it does not seem like it happens in such quantity or life altering ways for it to be something like behcets.  That is just my take.   However, I usually am only familiar with bad cases as I am always reading about those who are in dire straights with their disease, so not really the general response on how mist people feel. Remember though, it is pretty rare, more so for those not along the silk road. \n\nHave you had herpes ruled out? I ask as sores around the outside of the mouth are more likely to be herpes than canker sores.  If it is been ruled out, then maybe pursue seeing a rhumatologist to get an opinion there.  Behcets is difficult to diagnose, and the drugs that suppress it come with nasty if not worse side effects at times (cancer, bone loss, other autoimmune issues, etc) so if you are not at the point of it being life altering, I would personally keep an eye on my symptoms, get an opinion, and go with whatever mild treatments that can be suggested to help some of your sores.  Obviously if that does not work and it becomes more and more life changing or inhibiting, then keep on your doctor for other suggestions.  \n\nIn the end, only you know how you feel, so if you think something is wrong, keep a symptom tracker. Behcets can build.over time, so knowing how it builds.can be helpful in diagnosis, even if it is years later. First, while this is a \"medical\" sub, its laypeople. A warning before sharing a picture of your junk is always warranted. Please, for the future...\n\nThose look annoying, and similar to what I get before an ulcer erupts. I get/got (its been over a year!) ulcers mainly on my scrotum, never the shaft. They would start out little sore dots, like an infected hair, but within a day or two would be dime to nickel sized , white centered, ulcers. Underwear, tp, whatever, would stick to them. Excruciatingly painful, and hard to walk.\n\nOne time, I had one the size of a quarter, with another a little larger. That is what sent me over the edge and drove me to see every goddamn doctor I could until I found someone who would listen to my wild and unfounded Bechet's hypothesis. I am 100% non-violent, but I nearly fought my GP who kept saying I could not have it because I did not have any STIs\n\nI also had, and still sometimes get, large canker sores / oral ulcers. These are all behind the lips, and effect the mucous membrane if I remember correctly. Specifically, and absolutely NOT on the outside of the face. Rarely, and sometimes in the nose, but not on the outside. This distinction was drilled into and thoroughly questioned during my diagnoses with my current RA doc.\n\nPink eye / conjunctivitis is not a symptom. That is a bacterial (maybe viral? idk) infection.  Anterior uveitis (inflammation in the front of the eye) or posterior uveitis (inflammation in the back of the eye) are primary symptoms though. My RA sent me to an ophthalmologist that specializes in only uveitis to check for any existing damage, and so he would have a baseline should I get any further eye involvement (none so far!)\n\nExcellent reference if you have not read it yet, you will notice the very specific locations of mouth and genital sores:\n\n\n\nbut please, no more pictures of your junk without warning. Most of us will probably check it out, but its just.. rude without a warning.\n\nGood luck. Angrily demanding answers from a small support community of people who are not doctors, but are suffering from a disease you want information on is maybe not the best way to start things. If you are freaking out this hard about it you should make an appointment with a rheumatologist. Those mouth ulcers look similar to mine, but I did not click on your junk picture.", "Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease: You are not alone! Facebook page They do not approve any of my questions on that group. The admin is far too controlling. Then they blame it on Facebook having rules. That is BS because I am part of a lupus page and they post everything on there. I just wanted to rant. It is a huge shame because it is the largest group of people with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s and I cannot even see who share similar experiences because control freaks are running the show. May I ask what sort of questions are they disapproving? \nI must say I have Facebook but I seldomly use it now. It has become chaotic. I did not even know there was a group there. I literally asked if anyone else had night terrors and if anyone knew what kind of doctor to go to! \n\nThey will not approve ANYTHING Covid related. They go through and delete comments if Covid is mentioned. I am telling you, it is so controlled. \n\nI get there needs to be some order, but it is a group of 7000 people. We should be able to share our experiences because our doctors do not have access to 7000 of us That is really weird! \nSpecially since Covid is having such a huge impact on everyone is life anyway... \n\nI have night terrors sometimes, my bf says so. I do not remember really. I also sleep walk. And I have nightmares very very often - I would dare saying each night almost. But I have been diagnosed with anxiety. General anxiety and social anxiety. \nI would try to see a psychologist for that, because maybe you have something going on in your head, like me! Beh\u00e7et, and all this sort of things, and now Covid, this all has big impacts in our heads, and sometimes we do not realise it. I was in Mexico and had them every night. Then I got back from Mexico and had one too. I am not sure if they are night terrors because I remember them. They are hallucinations. I always see bugs in my bed! The last one, I woke up and had no clue where I was and it sent me into freak out mode! \n\nI definitely have anxiety. I would be surprised if there was someone with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s that did not have anxiety! It is untreated, though \n:( the medicines kill me I am far from being an expert, but I think you would not remember night terrors. I never do. I think we are supposed to be sleeping with those.\nBut maybe you have something similar, like, you are having a nightmare and you wake up but not entirely, so for a short (?) moment you end up mixing the nightmare with reality. This also already happened to me!  Many weird things can happen when we find ourselves in-between: sleeping-awake. Our bodies and minds kind of bug. It is +- the same principle of sleep paralysis, which is also horrible I must add.\n\nBut you should seek help for that then. If you feel this way and are experiencing all this, you ought to get some proper help. I would start with the psychologist, because on top of everything, it might truly help with the dealing of Beh\u00e7et itself...\nIt is normal to struggle and have anxiety, specially with Behcet. But it is not so normal what you experience you see? \n\nYou could also try some infusions to help with better sleep - lavender works quite well for me. But it is not a replacement for proper help.\nI also do acupressure. It is like acupuncture, but you stimulate the points by pressing them firmly. I do not usually do it on a regular basis, but if I find myself having crisis to sleep and even other stuff, it helps. \nOthers might disagree and say it is placebo effect, maybe it is X) but for me works, and that is what matters. Still, I cannot stress this enough: go see a psychologist. I did. \nI do not anymore, because I found some inner balance and I achieved ways to deal with all my issues. But I worked on those solutions with proper help. \nAnd I recommend you do it, because whatever is causing those \"hallucinations\", it is not normal.\n\nBut maybe you are from the USA? You mention Mexico and getting back, so I assume. Perhaps it is difficult for you because of the health system there? :/\nWhere I come from, those things are not a problem, so it is easy for us to say: go see 1000000 different doctors. I am not sure about the night terrors but due to misinformation circulating the group did have to stop any mention of covid or the vaccine. I think it became too hard for the mods to manage covid misinformation so they asked for the focus to remain on Behcet\u2019s itself.\n\nI am not sure if non-members could see the message but it was pretty clear why covid could no longer be discussed on the forum. \n\nSleep terrors I had as a child but not anymore. You would talk to your PCM about it and they would decide if you would need to see a sleep specialist or possibly psych if the cause is underlying anxiety. Agreed. I tried asking how many people spent a lot of time with horses. It seemed like a lot of us have horses and I was wondering about a chemical link of some kind. They would not post it. I do not, if that helps. I am sorry you do. How awful. this sounds more like hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations; i get them as well, like 90% sure it is due to hydroxychloroquine for me. most of the time it is bugs for me too, but usually it only happens a few times a year. my rheum or my primary (i forget; it is been years) sent me to get an MRI and see a neurologist, but the neuro was thoroughly unconcerned.\n\ni think hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations generally are supposed to be pretty common/not dangerous, but if it continues to disrupt your sleep you might want to check with your doctor (i guess primary or psych). That is what I think it is too. I had them a bit in high school. And it would happen maybe once every 6ish months as I got older. Now it is several times a week/month!\nI see my PCP tomorrow and I am going to mention it. I am also going to mention it to my neurologist I also think is so weird when she posts her selfies and is like \u201cit is me, YOUR GOD\u201d \nIdk just strange vibes from the group all around Yes!!! Exactly Yeah, I will be going to the doctor. It is not exactly night terrors, but I did not know the exact name. There is someone who said what it is called. I honestly think it is probably just stress induced It is frustrating! I get the COVID thing, but at the same time, we should be able to share our experiences with Covid and the vaccine! My wife used to be a big part of that Facebook group back in the day around 10-14 years ago when it was a lot smaller. \n\nEven then she left because she found it so toxic.\n\nYou could post about your issues and the comment threads would be full of people saying how your symptoms are not that bad and how THEY suffer so much worse. If interested, I just started a new Facebook group called Behcet's Disease Uncensored for a very similar reason. Here it is if you are interested (any of you):  Oof, yeah, occasionally they are not so bad, but it would be really frustrating to have them that frequently. I think they are worse when you dwell on them; after I posted this last night I went to sleep and apparently woke my husband up in the middle of the night screaming about a spider (which I do not remember in the slightest lol, guess I never fully woke up), for the first time in months. So good sleep hygiene, either relaxation or just distraction from thinking about it right before sleep, might help too lol.\n\nGood luck! I hope your doctors can help space them back out at the very least. That is exactly what I do!! I think I remember them because I wake myself! I turn on all the lights and my poor fianc\u00e9 is so done with it \ud83d\ude02", "Hi you all! Just saw a rheumatologist and starting treatment And I am not happy about it. \n\nMy body is so sensitive to everything. I never take any medicine because I have crappy reactions to everything \n\nShe wanted a CT scan of everything to go over my vascular system. Nope. Cannot do that. Severely allergic to CT contrast. \n\nAnyway, I have always had mouth ulcers. Maybe 2-3 times a year. They were super bad when I had braces. \n\nThen in April, I was in a car accident and 2 weeks later, I had uncontrollable diarrhea. ~17 times a day. \n\nAfter a CT scan (showed inflammation of the colon) and a colonoscopy (showed inflammation of the terminal ileum, but biopsies were normal) the GI said IBS. ok. All my blood work is flawless (except I have high copper and high iron), so at this point, no one knows what is wrong with me. I then cut out all foods. Diarrhea improved slightly. \n\nThen the mouth sores came. I am talking like 5-6 at a time. I have not been sore free since May. In this time, I have had a few genital sores, too. They are like zits. Super painful. I pop them (I know. Cannot help it though)\n\nI got a UTI in September and the antibiotic helped my belly a little (even though I would been tested for every kind of infection in the world). I also eat a very plain diet of like 5 things. I have lost 50 pounds since April. \n\nThe rheumatologist believes it is behcets. So does my gyno and PCP. They believed it was Behcets before I even had the GI problems. \n\nToday, she took 14 vials of blood. \n\nNow I am on prednisone (ugh I want to cry) and she said to look into different medications, but her favorite is otezla. \n\nI am mortified to be on anything that suppresses my immune system. I work with 400 children every week in person. I am so scared to catch something from them. \nMy immune system is pretty decent. My fianc\u00e9 got COVID a month ago and I never got it. I am hoping this does not wreck it. \n\n\nUGHHHHHHH So Otezla is a biologic and it will not wreck your immune system. While it is an immunosuppressive medicine it will not make you sick like you might be expecting. I have not taken Otezla, but I was on Humira and now Remicade and I have been on MTX and AZA while on those. I work with kids and I honestly did not notice an increase in getting sick. What I noticed was that if I got sick (like a sinus infection) it took maybe 25% more time to feel \"normal\" and that If I get a cut it takes longer to heal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPredinsone is awful, I think biologics are so much easier. Thank you for that info! Makes me feel a little better. \n\nI am hoping the prednisone will not be a huge deal. It is only 7.5mg for week 1, 5mg for week 2, then 2.5 for week 3. I think that is because she and I went to war and agreed upon a super low dose LOL \n\nPrednisone makes my whole body feel bruised. I told her that and she said it might be water retention. Do you have that problem? I was on prednisone for 14 months so I have a different experience, but I still deal with edema and stuff from it. One taper will not be noticeable though! \n\nI hope Otezla treats you well, I hear from people that are on it that it works super well and I think its the only one that is a pill which is super nice! Hey, you do seem to have behcets. I also have a lot of GI issues and my doctor eventually concluded that it was a symptom of BD and not IBD. \nI have been on Otezla for almost a year and it did not make me more vulnerable for infections and I think that is what most people experienced. \nI hope otezla helps you \u2764\ufe0f Otezla is not a biologic. \nIt is in a new class of drugs (PDE4) inhibitor.\nWhile it does suppress the immune system it is not supposed to be as aggressive as biologics.\nOtezla does have pretty intense stomach side effects.\nI would say the biggest limitation is it does not treat organ manifestation. I have never used it as I have GI complications. Along with depression.\nSo humira/colchicine/trental is my treatment for my bechets.\nI hope you feel better soon :) Welcome. I was in denial for yeaaaaars after being diagnosed with Behcet's, so I get it. Simply admitting it to yourself is a big step. I know it is all scary right now. But you will be alright. Just coming here and talking about it is a step in the right direction. Connecting with others with the disease and educating yourself are the best things you can do. Here and FB groups are great for meeting others with Behcet's. Best of luck to you. Be well! I get the same feeling from prednisone, and the doctor is right about water retention. I changed my diet to a low-salt, high potassium diet and it fixed up most of the body symptoms of the prednisone. It is hard to do since pred causes salt cravings, but it has been worthwhile. Why did you change from humaira ? I kept getting sinus infections, but remicade has not given me that issue", "Helpful plants Hi, so i was researching plants/herbs that have immunosuppressive activity which could help autoimmune disease.  I do not understand the technical terms at all so Im hoping someone clever will be able to help decipher which mechanism would provide benefits for people with Behcets......\n\nPlant 1 - decreases T and B cell numbers\n\nPlant 2 - Inhibits the proliferation and activation of T cells\n\nPlant 3 - Inhibits arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 production\n\nPlant 4 - Inhibits mitogen induced splenocyte proliferation\n\nPlant 5 - Inhibits lymphocyte proliferation\n\nPlant 6 - Inhibition of calcineurin activity and T cell proliferation\n\nPlant 7 - Suppresses IL-17 production\n\nPlant 8 - Inhibits IL-2 production\n\nI am Happy to share the plant names if anyone is interested. Great question - here are a couple thoughts:\n\n* To answer your question directly in the context of Behcet's, ( is a paper that discusses the immunopathology of the disease. These images (( ( provide a visual map of how these immune system cells relate to the disease. \n* The immune system is INCREDIBLY complex. It is arguably the most complex system in the body behind the brain and the microbiome, which will take another century of research to fully understand. We have had many large breakthroughs around understanding the immune system and autoimmunity in the last decade but the research is still trying to explain foundational topics.\n* Because this system is so complex, and herbal supplements are non-specific (they often will decrease one part while increasing another), it is a crapshoot whether they will work. Red Reishi is an example - the mycellium can be mildly immunosuppressive (good for BD), while the spores are highly immunostimulatory (very bad for BD). There are no regulations on how pure supplements should be...so even within a bottle of the supplement you will get different effects.\n* Herbal supplements can help - I plan on creating some resources on this topic for the sub on this topic. HOWEVER herbal supplements should always be considered as mild adjuncts to treatment if used at all. I have tried nearly everything out there before being diagnosed - some helped, most did not help - but none of them could even come close to traditional pharmaceutical treatments. I take a couple of them to this day and they still continue to mildly help. \n\n\nFeel free to send me the list of herbs via PM and I can compare against my research, notes, and experiences :) Thanks so much for your detailed reply! You have provided much food for thought!  Im going to PM you a link to where i was reading about these plants.", "Anyone have tried Kineret (anakinra)? Hi all, \n\nI have been diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et years ago and kind of always managed with colchicine and cortisone. I had recent flares very close to one another and quitee painful. I had to start a new treatment, on recommendation of my reumatolog, called Kineret . I was wondering if anyone have tried before? If so did you see an improvement  quickly? Did you had any side effects? \nThanks for reading and I hope everyone is staying safe !", "I think i m experiencing my first ep. Of uveitis I wear daily contact lenses and yesterday i Felt like i see different with my right eye. I thought maybe is just the Lens, maybe got dirty because of my make-up. Today i woke up , put on my lenses and went outside . I Felt like i was having something in my eye and i started to rub it hard. I feel like i have sand in my eye and Now i m sure i loss some of my vision in my right eye.  Do you think i have uveitis? My mother is Triumf to get me an appoiment for tomorrow , i hope she would get it. Interested to see responses. I have pigment glaucoma and the ophthalmologist mentioned if I ever had uveitis. I said nothing that I know of but I have Behcets and she said, they were completely unrelated? I have not been diagnosed yet but highly suspect that what I have is Behcets. I can comfortably say that eye symptoms were the absolute bane of my existence during my initial storm of symptoms. \n\nIt felt like sand in my eyes or eyelashes in my eyes\u2026rubbing them just made it worse. Eye drops did nothing to help. I noticed floaters especially in sunlight\u2026and there were moments where I felt like a white film was over my eye for very short periods of time. I also noticed a constant headache like pressure behind my eyes at some points. \n\nUnfortunately, I went to 2 different eye doctors and neither of them noticed anything out of the ordinary. I even explained to them that my eyes had burned for nearly a year straight. \n\nKeep us updated on your eye doctor findings though and do not get discouraged if they do not find anything. Be persistent and always seek second opinions. =]", "Low hemoglobin Hi Zebras :) Anyone experience low hemoglobin? My blood work came back yesterday with a hemoglobin of 9.2; have to see my PCP doctor today. \n#becalmbehcetson Zebras? lol\n\nAnd no. Not an issue I have had that I know of. Yep Zebras. ;) Explanation: Doctors are trained with the saying, \"When you hear hoof beats, think horses, not zebras.\" We are rare disease zebras. ;)\n\nWell, saw my PCP my sudden drop in hemoglobin could be a result of: azathioprine, GI bleed or something else. Running tests. Jury is out.\n\nJust be calm and Behcet's on until they figure it out. I like it.\n\nGood luck with your results! So... you might find this crazy... but folks with Ehlers-Danlos also consider themselves Zebras.\n\nHere is the crazy part: My wife has classical EDS, confirmed by genetic test AND we are working on a diagnosis of Neuro-Behcets.  The Behcet's part is not official yet, but right now it is the best guess that the neurologists have. Yep they are rare disease patients as well. In fact, I know 2 people on my Neuro BD support group that have Neuro BD and ED diagnosis. I have BD with neurological features. :) I also have low hemoglobin. I am not anemic, but almost. My mother was anemic, I do not know if it is related to my low hemoglobin. \nBtw, I loved \"zebras\"!! Ack...got my results back. PCP called me back and said my hemoglobin dropped to 8.2. Azathioprine is suppressing my bone marrow. Coming off it immediately. Just wanted to pass info on. \nThanks all! Appreciate the support.", "Joint pain in behcet\u2019s How is your joint pain like? \nIn my case, it comes and goes, lately i have more than 3 weeks without it and Now is back. I m feeling aches in my wrists, elbows, knees and ankles and my right knee is painful when i bend it to the maximum. I Also noticed that joint pain is usually accompanied by Sore throat or it Could be just a coincidence. Bad lol. Worse in winter. I get it in my knees and wrists. All the way up my left arm. My erythema nodosum is on my legs and left arm when it comes so that is why I have the pain/nerve pain there. I just started getting steroid injections in my knees now. I cannot really take steroid pills often because of my HBP so this was safer. I was told I could do it in my hand too if if I need it. And yes to sore throat although I Also get ulcers there so not sure if that is part of it.  I always sound like a smoker with my flares. But it is gotten better. But with the cold weather approaching I am not excited lol. Be well! \ud83d\ude0a I was not officially diagnosed, as Having just one episode of genital ulcers and joint pain that started in july, some nose ulcers and not So bad mouth ulcers . \nAnd every time the joint pain comes, i m terrified, it makes me think it Could be smth like leukemia or cancer. My blood work is fine. During my flare ups I have bad pain in my elbows wrists and hands. Also I have constant pain in my back due to inflammation, the Mobic helps but not that much. Joints: In about half of affected people, the knees and other large joints become painful. This relatively mild inflammation (arthritis) does not progress or damage tissue.\n\nIf it can not be helped with anti inflammatory medication you should seek help from a pcp or RA. Joint pain is not an indication of Bechets, just a shared autoimmune symptom. Yep, this became a pretty consistent symptom for me during flares. I was hobbling around like an old man, haha, despite being a healthy-looking 28 year old!! Non-deforming joint pain in the hands, elbows, knees, and ankles is typically a pretty good indicator that the underlying cause is rheumatological, with Behcet's coming into the discussion when you have oral/genital ulcers alongside it. \n\nThe joint pain largely went away when I started 10mg of prednisone daily. It would still creep up on me at night, but otherwise was OK. It is completely gone now that I have started Remicade treatment - I can tell when the drug wears off (usually the week leading up to the infusion) since the joint pain starts coming back in the evenings. I see. Have they treated you with anything yet? I had a lot of \u201cminor\u201d symptoms that I related to my period as that would coincide with flare for about a year and a half before getting help. Did not know mouth ulcers were anything to be worried about &amp; my vaginal ulcers ended up being all internal with scarring. Bad headaches. And I had what would be called erythema nodosum but I thought I was \u201canemic\u201d when my period come. Along with fatigue. (Silly looking back lol) Joint pain but i work out so again dismissed it. I get fevers whenever stressed so dismissed that too. And contraction like pains during my periods. By the time I got help I had some organ complications &amp; episodic hypertension along with secondary raynauds. So better to get treatment early :) I think you are doing better than I did. Good for you taking care of your body and not Dismissing it. As for labs my labs were only off with flares. When I was feeling good they would be normal.\n\n\nAssuming you are a woman based on your nam?lol Looking back I was on birth control for years then had my two kids and nursed them. I was planning to go back on BC once I finished nursing because my periods were so bad and getting worse. Never knew how big hormones/period play with bechet flares but I was told it is very common. And so it made sense the timing of sickness and the way it played out. Best of luck. My advice is listen to your body..little things turn to big things and that is never fun \ud83e\udde1 They did not treat me, they told me they want to Look after me to see if the genital ulcers will appear again. It is not an 100% sure diagnosis, But as my blood work is totally fine, no signs of lupus or anything else, they think it Could be behcet\u2019s But is too early for a diagnosis as the symptoms started 3-4 months ago I Also observed that symptoms start around my period and then dissapear until the NexT one. Or it Could be just a coincidence Thank you for sharing your story! Have a wonderful life ! Of course! It takes time to get the diagnosis which I think is good..I truly hope you do not have it. Either way be well \ud83e\udde1", "Asking for prayers&amp;advice Hi I am hannah. Im 19years old and was diagnosed with behcets after reacting to the Covid vaccine.

It is now December and unfortunately I am just now getting home from my second flare up. It just does not feel fair. It started in November, again lasted over a month with the same symptoms. I have yet to recover from the first flare up and now this happens. I was just starting to get my life back, got a job I love, got an offer to coach a junior high boys basketball team, and then this happens\u2026lost it all. and as if that is not enough, I am a victim of assault and having hundreds of nurses and doctors look between your legs every half an hour gets pretty traumatizing. It has ruined my relationship with my boyfriend, I feel sick at the thought of being touched right now and I am hurting him. Not just him but my family too, my parents who I still live with have been through it all with me. My heart breaks for them and I just feel like my world is falling apart right now. My doctors will not give me an exemption even after all of this and I just feel defeated. I cant even feel comfortable without being looked at like a drug addict. I just spent the past month f up on  Dilaudid  and then they send me home on naproxen like it is supposed to do something. I am suffering.I am in pain. \u201cBe patient\u201d they said. I have given the past 7 years of my life. I want to live. I see my friends, my little cousins all moving away and making something of themselves. I was not even given that option.

My father is from the Mediterranean and he has struggled his whole life with GI problems, chronic fatigue, GERD, and also anxiety. He has had bacterial overgrowth in his stomach and took antibiotics but it gave him ulcer. I also have a lot of the same problems he has. Like almost exactly. The reason I think I may have Behcets is because my mother told me that she thinks that he has it but he refuses to think that because there is no cure for it. I struggle daily with fatigue, some days I cant even walk straight without wanting to faint but this only happens when I dont eat the right foods. I also struggle with anxiety all the time and have had very bad reflux. I would suggest going to see a rheumatologist. The only way to diagnose Behcet's is based on symptoms. Everything you are describing sounds like secondary symptoms of Behcet's, but none of its trademark symptoms (oral and genital ulcers, etc). I would also go see an ophthalmologist to get your eyes checked. Okay thanks i will. Do you ever get arthritis, rashes or ulcers in your mouth or nose? No but I just was not sure if the other symptoms I have been having may be related to the development of the disease. I just do not know if the more worse symptoms like what you said, may develop when I get older. Behcets commonly gets better actually. You should definitely talk to a doctor about your symptoms, whether it is behcets or not, they can help diagnose or at least treat your symptoms so you can function better.", "Behcet's and its impact on sexuality? Sexual activity is generally recognized as a critical component of healthy adult life. \n\nIf for no other reason, the amount of psychological distress and overt depression reported by members of this subreddit could reasonably be attributed to the impact of Behcet's on patients' sexuality. I realize that this is a sensitive topic and that there may be underage people subscribed here. So, I am not sure what the right forum is to discuss such concerns. For myself, Behcet's has effectively ended my sex life and this has had a huge impact on the quality of my life, in addition to its direct, grotesque, and painful physical manifestations. \n\nAs a gay man, it is easy for me to believe that it may be worse for me than for others, but I suspect the added misery is an equal opportunity assailant. In addition to the physical stigmata and pain, I also have (unanswered) concerns about the increased risk that mouth ulcers may present in terms of increased susceptibility to STDs. I would be very interested to hear how others here deal with the sex-related problems that Behcet's creates? If this is not the appropriate venue to discuss these concerns does anyone know where there is one? I am sure there must coping strategies and practical ways of dealing with these obstacles that other longer-suffering people have developed. Well as a woman, it ended my sex life. Have not had nookie since 2008 \ud83d\ude22. \nMicrophone drop. \nStopped looking for relationships cos I cannot see finding one without sex that would be satisfying for both parties. I do not know, it is a problem, but then I am 58, so I guess it is time I rolled over and gave up anyway lol I remember looking into it a bit ago and I think that the ulcers we get are not contagious. Sure if you have a mouth full of sores you will want to rethink kissing someone because you will be in pain and then have godawful breath, but as far as I could tell, they are not a risk of having to deal with that aspect of this hell. I am a 27yo F, straight, and without ulcers. I had tiny ones last year, in the mouth, and before I only had one big flare of ulcers down there (but then, I had not been diagnosed yet).\n2018 I opted for a copper IUD, since I have a stable durable relationship... By then, I believe I started to have the first flares, but I did not know... So I dunno of it is the IUD or the Beh\u00e7et's, but I definitely noticed an impact.\nBoth the gynecologist and the rheumatologist tell me that either things has an impact, but I have noticed a decrease in the \"apetite\". The copper IUD has no hormones, but right now it is been half year I am on Prednisone (currently 10mg) and Imuran (100mg). Dunno if it is maybe the Prednisone, I noticed for sure since I take the pills... But I think already before I started to notice something... Perhaps it is just the body reacting to Beh\u00e7et, or the IUD, and then it all got worse with medication...\nHopefully this did not cause impact in the relationship! We still have a sexual life, but I must say, wayyyyy less. 30yoSWFhomosexual : I use bacitracin to prevent staph for nasal lesions. I assume this implies much the same for other areas, and other pathogens. Boo :( You are right that the oral ulcers (OUs) of Behcet's and that BS itself is not communicable. However, that is not the issue I am concerned with. The OUs represent a breach in the mucosal defense barrier against infections -- both bacterial and viral. The OUs are also heavily infiltrated with a diverse array of immune cells, such as dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, and less significantly neutrophils and other polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (PMNLs). The dendritic, T, and B cells are susceptible to infection with viruses such as HIV CMV and EBV. In the case of the last two, it is possible to be infected by multiple strains, and this superinfection, which is more common in sexually promiscuous individuals and IV drug users appears to be associated with immune dysfunction, increased risk of some cancers, cardiovascular disease, and even dementia. These are only the viruses that we recurrently know about that are associated with long-term illness. There may well be others. For instance, it was only relatively recently that it was discovered that the human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes genital warts, also infects the mouth and throat and is responsible for a significant percentage of head and neck cancers -- most of those that occur in non-smokers. Increased susceptibility to hepatitis C is also a concern. I would say the same for Hepatitis B (HBV) in people who have not already had it, or who have not been vaccinated against it. HBV is now and has been a routine part of childhood vaccinations.\n\nDamage to the oral and pharyngeal mucosal defense barriers markedly increases the risk for bacterial infection and this why halitosis and bacterial infections occur more frequently in people with Behcet's. The whitish tissue that is seen over the OUs is dead (necrotic) tissue which, when it sloughs (desquamates), exposes the cherry red ulcerated tissue underneath it. The constant presence of this necrotic tissue in the mouth provides a substrate for bacterial growth and this bacterial overgrowth further compromises oral immunity. This is one of the reasons that antibacterial mouthwashes such as those containing chlorhexidine or peroxide, or antibiotic-containing mouth rinses, such as tetracycline, minocycline, and so on are sometimes helpful in decreasing the inflammation and tissue damage due to OUs. The tetracycline family of drugs also act to inhibit a tissue destroying class of enzymes released by neutrophils, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).\n\nChlamydia, which is an intracellular parasite STD and which infects tens of millions of Americans is also more easily contracted when the mucosa is damaged. So, the concern is that the OUs may significantly increase the risk of STD infection in oral sex. It is also true that different people carry different species of oral bacteria, some of which can cause disease when they are introduced into the mouths of people with damaged oral mucosa, especially in the setting of immunosuppression. Yes. See my response above. I am currently trying to determine if the use of topical oral antibiotics may decrease the risk of STD infection. Ditto the use of chlorhexidine containing mouthwash.\n\nIn countries with a high incidence of Behcet's the use of antiseptic and tetracycline type mouth rinses appear to be much more used as adjunctive therapies to reduce the severity and duration of oral ulcers and decreases halitosis and the accelerated tooth decay seen in some people with Behcet's. I am not sure why these are not more used in the US. Chlorhexidine is OTC in most of Europe despite the fact that it can cause permanent tooth discoloration with chronic use. Behcet's definitely caused a lot of sex-related problems in my teens and twenties when the disease was most active. In my late teens and early twenties, I played guitar in a nationally touring rock band. Every night in every city we played, women would throw themselves at us. While I would be lying if I said I did not take advantage of this a few times, I was usually too self-conscious about my genital ulcers and other skin-related issues. As a guy - especially at that age - having access to lots of eager, attractive women but not being able to have fun was torturous. \n\nBy the time I got into my 30's, that self-consciousness was gone. I have had a healthy sex life for the past decade. I am no longer embarrassed by the scars on my balls and have no problem explaining their cause to the women who have asked about them. \n\nLastly, I will mention that I had a fling with a woman who also has Behcet's a couple years ago. We met in a FB group. Being with someone who also has the disease was great. I did not have to explain the scars on my genitals because she already knew what caused them - the same thing that caused hers. I am only mentioning this (I tell the full story in my ( if you are interested) for those of you who want an active sex life but find it hard or impossible with Behcet's. Maybe look for someone who also has a chronic illness - maybe even Behcet's, though it is a small dating pool. It will take a lot of the embarrassment and shame out of things. First, thanks for your honest and detailed comments and especially for your personal experiences. There was a discussion here earlier on creating a reference gallery of photos of BS' various manifestations (which I think is a good idea). This paper provides some high-quality color photos of oral, cutaneous, and genital lesions,  \"Beh\u00e7et's disease: review with emphasis on dermatological aspects:\" ( although most show images of early or of omparatively mild disease. A single genital scar is not the same as extensive scarring after recurrent ulcers. Still, both the photos and the article may be helpful.\n\nThe fact is that MOST people, well or ill, are self-conscious or concerned about the cosmetic shortcomings of some aspect(s) of their bodies -- real or imagined. While open sores or ulcers are a good reason  to refrain from casual hookups, scarring and other signs of long term disease relate more to self confidence, self acceptance and the willingness to see \"rejection,\" when and if it occurs, in the proper context, which is as irrelevant. As a promiscuous gay man I have had sex with countless different partners and I think many heterosexuals would be surprised at how common disfiguring, or otherwise \"abnormal\" body features, including those affecting the genitals are. This does not stop many men with such issues from putting themselves out there and having fulfilling or even exciting sex lives. \n\nWhile I am in no way suggesting, let alone recommending a promiscuous life style (that would be akin to advocating that people take up smoking) I can tell you that being \"turned down\" in a sexual encounter is no big deal and it happens all the time for many reasons. Not even \"beautiful people\" are what everyone is looking for\\* and it is not a cliche to say that self confidence, having a good personality and outlook and genuine enthusiasm and joy in sex overcome a lot of cosmetic obstacles. At its best, sex requires sensitivity to your partner's needs and desires and enthusiasm and competence. Those things trump loooks more often than most people think. I know this because I have seen it first hand and experienced it first hand in my choice of sexual partners. Many people of both sexes have burn, surgical or other scars or have had colostomies and they do not let these things stop them from having satisyfing sex lives. \n\nSimilarly, many men have genital abnormalities such as hypospadias, or unusual anatomical variations and they do not let this stand in the way of a very active and satisfying casual sex of life. Offering a matter of fact explanation explanation to their prospective partners is typically all that is required. And if the answer is no, *then that is only a big as a deal as you make it*. Guys turn other guys down in casual sexual encounters in gay saunas for countless reasons; too big, to small, cut, uncut, or most often because you just are not what they are looking for. And the that can change from one night to another and is function of what is on offer, the kind of sex the other person wants at that particular time, and on and on. The reality is, *and it is the reality*, is that rejection is no big deal *and it happens to everyone frequently*. *The important thing is the times you do not get rejected and have a great time*.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that stunningly good looking people often choose to have sex only with other stunningly good looking people and there is more exclusivity and pickyness at the top, and it is often expressed more rudely and cruelly than the rest of us \"mere mortals\" can imagine. People who see sex as a competitive exercise in cosmetic perfection have their own miseries and humiliations and I would argue that hey are worse by far than those experienced by people with cosmetic issues who are looking to have a good time and meet people who can enrich their lives momentarily,or for years to come. Some of my best and most enduring friendships began with a casual sexual encounter. \n\nHaving said this, it is also true that the presence of open sores or lesions is a strong contraindication to finding a sexual partner -- and there are sound reasons for this. In my case, I have no idea what a Behecet's \"flare\" is like because I have had severe oral ulcers without remit since the onset of the disease 7 months ago. Eating and drinking are major obstacles, so sex is unthinkable.\n\n\\*Many, and maybe even most people of average looks are too intimidated to have sex with super good looking people or find they cannot perform because of their own self consciousness. 31 Male.\n\nI do not have genital sores or ulcers but I have struggled with severe erectile dysfunction for a long time and suspect that I might have epididymitis due to the vascular issues that Behcets causes. My sex life suffered greatly for a long time. I do however get mouth sores a lot\u2026and it feels like oral sex with my girlfriend certainly makes them feel worse and heal slower. \n\nI have even had some scary numbness sensations in my testicles and penis. One week it felt like my genitals were completely numb and my libido was just gone!\n\nThankfully, my doctor prescribed me Viagra and it truly worked like a miracle for me. It gives me a pretty bad headache sometimes\u2026but it is a fair trade off for saving my sex life. It works (almost) every time.", "How you diagnosed as a Behcets' Disease? \n Had a an attack that disabled me followed by continuous mouth lesions and weird CT scans of my lungs.  You do not have a specific diagnostic test for Behcet\u2019s, though the closest you might get is a pathergy test. (Needle prick and subsequent cutaneous reaction.)  Thanks Thanks", "Are my plans for the future over? I went to a rheumatologist and they say I might have Behcet\u2019s. I am waiting for the blood test results and to see if I react well to the steroids they gave me. Everything I have read so far scares the living hell out of me. \n\nI am a sophomore in undergrad and I would really like to go to medical school. I have not found anyone with Behcet\u2019s who is a doctor or works in the medical field. I know it is a rare disease, so that could be why, but I am scared that if I have this (which I most likely do), I will have to replan my entire future. \n\nI hope this sub is not dead. Thanks, guys.  I am sorry you are going through this! Do not panic! Behcet's is not going to make your life any easier, but if you can get the symptoms under control your life may not necessarily be too much different than it was before.  And just because you have some symptoms associated with Behcet's does not mean you will have all of them.  So do not freak out too much about the stuff you are reading and assume it is all going to happen if it is not already.\n\nUnfortunately a lot of figuring out that stuff is just waiting to see how your body reacts to the meds, how bad your symptoms typically are, what triggers them, etc. and that is different for everyone.  Eating well, exercising as much as you can, keeping stress levels down, getting enough sleep, wearing sunscreen, etc. are all always good (and are things you may need to allot more time for than you did before).\n\nAs far as working in the medical field, I imagine the worst thing day to day with Behcet's would be either dealing with contagious patients if you are immune suppressed (due to meds) or actively experiencing some kind of painful symptoms.  My husband is a resident and says the med school/hospital sick day policy is something that varies from place to place, but obviously it stays fast-paced so you would have to keep up with the work.  These kinds of circumstances might vary by specialty as well.  Thank you! I either want to be an obgyn or a pediatrician. I am guessing I should pick the former.  I would think you would have to stand more for OB, lol; I feel like I would avoid operating rooms as much as possible (but that is just my personal experience; joint pain is typically my worst issue day to day, and I have not had to take immune suppressing meds long-term before... this month). You could always wear a mask while examining folks if you need to. \n\nEither way you have to rotate through both before you decide, and it is very possible that you will change your mind in med school! I do not think any of my doctor friends stuck with the specialty they would planned when they started, just because they unexpectedly liked a different rotation so much.  \n\nAnd even before that, I am sure you will get a good feel for what Behcet's + stress feels like for you in the rest of undergrad. The future is never over it may just have to be tweaked a little bit I know you posted this a month ago, but I am new to reddit and answering now, sorry. \nI have had Behcets symptoms since I was 12 and was diagnosed properly (process of elemination diagnoses are so rough) when I was 19/20. When I was diagnosed, the doctor immediately told me not to read stuff online. It is all really scary. \nIf it helps ease your mind at all, I generally have a pretty mild to medium case. I have a lot of joint pain and sciatica daily, but other than that, nothing really. My flare ups are usually fairly manageable and if they get bad, I just have to call up my doc for a prednisone prescription and it all works out. I cannot stand or walk for long periods of time (think concerts or amusement parks) without being sore the next day, but generally, no one would know I am sick. \nI hope you continue with your degree. Having someone out there in the medical field who personally knows about such a weird, rare disease is so badass. \n\n", "Is Enbrel safe if used for an extended period of time? My original med was not cutting it so my doctor suggested Enbrel. I agreed, and we agreed to try it for one year, but I was wondering if in case I had to use it longer, if there are any long term side effects, or  how my daily life might be affected. The thought of an autoimmune suppressant is a bit scary to me, so I wanted to see what you guys have to say about it. Hmm I would say it is depends on severity of your bechets. Risk vs benefit. I am on Humira which is similar. Although we did not talk about a timeline as I am not sure anyone really can. So much unknown. \nIt is takes a few injections to see if it is working and then from there see where your health is. I agree long term affects are scary but I am hoping for remission for myself &amp; hopefully you. The only positive outlet I can put out there is there a lot of success with tnf inhibitors use in bechets :) be well! All medications are dangerous, that is why they are prescribed. How dangerous really depends on you, your genetics and your disorder. That is why you need to have doctor involved. If you would feel better with a second opinion, that is totally reasonable. Explain your concern and your doctor should have no problem with it. It is your life after all.", "Cosentyx for Behcet's? (IL-17 inhibitor) Has anyone had success with Cosentyx (or even Taltz) for controlling Behcet's?\n\nI have been on Cosentyx for about a year and a half for ankylosing spondylitis. I have only just been diagnosed with Behcet's, so obviously Cosentyx is not doing a great job of controlling it. I have had mild signs for awhile, but it went crazy beginning in August, after I was told to pause Cosentyx due to inflamed lymph nodes. One possibility is that pausing Cosentyx set it off. Another is that the lymph node swelling was a sign of the Behcet's flare to come, and Cosentyx did not matter.\n\nMy rheumatologist thinks the Cosentyx should be able to control it, and my dose has been increased. I see that there is ( but if it were working for me, why have I had continuous Behcet's activity since August?\n\nI have already been on Humira, Enbrel, and Xeljanz for my AS. None of them worked more than a year, so Cosentyx is the first that is really stuck.\n\nI just want to be able to eat food for the holidays!", "Might have Behcet's? Fellow Redditors,\n\nSince I was a child I would always get canker sores. For about a year now, I have gotten 3+ every month. When one heals, one starts up. In November I saw a dermatologist who mentioned Behcet's but did not want to go that route yet and started me on Valtrex.\n\nFast forward to now, canker sores are more prevalent than ever and then I researched Behcet's and think I fit more symptoms than I wish for. There would be days I get an ocular migraine, some days a random headache, and now recently really bad neck/joint pain. I have not had any ulcers on the genitals, an occasional pimple which feels like it takes forever to heal, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I can maybe take out the neck pain due to now having a dog sleeping in the bed and he are not a small dog, which I never had. I also do run 12+ miles a week and hope to increase that. But these cankersores will not quit. (I have changed from SLS toothpaste, done all the home remedies, etc)\n\nThoughts?\n\nSorry for the ramble.... Get to a rheumatologist.   You will need to be referred. Hi there! I did not tick all the boxes until my mid 30s, but my symptoms began with the mouth ulcers and headaches in childhood.\nMy advice is to journal and take lots of photos. Absolutely ask for a referral to see a Rheumatologist, they are the experts where Beh\u00e7ets management is concerned, however it is often the case that many see multiple specialists (depending on how they are affected).\nThe route my GP sent me was to first rule out Chron's via Endoscopy/Colonoscopy as it is much more common. With that ruled out and lots of blood work to exclude other conditions, then it is down to a thorough exam, consideration of symptoms and evidence. You may be placed on a medication first to manage oral ulcers or joint inflammation in the meantime while you specialist observes how you are doing, or a Beh\u00e7ets diagnosis may be clear. Good luck! Thank you for this write up! I turn 30 in March so it might slowly be coming on. I scheduled an appointment with my primary and then it is just the waiting game. Thank you! I got ulcers in my mouth pretty regularly, mine came in flairs though.  I could go a few weeks without any then suddenly 2 to 3 would pop up at the same time and they would last about 2 weeks.  I never thought much of it, did not even know what Behcets was.  It was not until I turned 30 and started losing vision in my left eye that I did anything about it.  Learned the two were connected and am now on Humira.  So yeah my advice is to push as hard as you can to figure it out as soon as possible.  The ocular migraines worry me a bit, as that is something I have and relates to my retinitis, which is why I now have a blind spot in my central vision.  Also... is the pimple... ya know... down there?  Because it may be a sore that just is not opening up.  Used to get those too when I was mid-20s.  Keep in mind I am not a doctor and reddit has a tendency to overdo things, so do not let this fearmonger you, but at the same time sooner is better than later. I have started the process. My primary wants me to see an ophthalmologist next week, and then a dermatologist the week after. Cankersores are my number one symptoms...had 2-3 for a year plus now and then recently is seemed joint/lower back pain started.\n\nThere have also been instances, 3 over the past year, of brain fog, mental fatigue. I thought it was covid but always tested negative.\n\nI do not have any sores down there, and never have, hopefully do not get that part? Lol You need to be seen by a rheumatologist ASAP. Any joint or eye pain in the presence of recurrent mouth ulcers increases the urgency for a proper evaluation and prompt treatment. Please do not rely on the opinion of your GP or internist about whether you should pursue a diagnosis. Young males often have an aggressive and destructive course of illness. The absence of genital ulcers does not preclude a diagnosis of Behcet's. You may never have them or they may develop much later in the course of Behcet's. MY Primary first wanted me to see an ophthalmologist and said a rheumatologist only helps with symptoms, not diagnosis. I went Thursday and they said everything was normal in my eyes. \nI got another dermatologist appointment first week of February..\n\nI have heard of hard to get into a rheumatologist... Maybe I should get a second opinion? Your PCP is obviously out of his depth with respect to Behcet's. Unless you are experiencing uveitis or other eye problems you do not need to see an ophthalmologist. In fact, only \\~17%  of patients with Behcet's ever experience eye involvement.  Rheumatologists are the medical specialists who are best equipped to diagnose and treat Behcet's. The notion of a GP, internist, or other typical PCP attempting to diagnose, and especially treat Behcet's is terrifying. This is a complex illness with protean manifestations that is more often than not progressively damaging and that has a large burden or morbidity and no small amount of mortality. \n\nWhile there are formal diagnostic criteria for Behcet's ( it can take years for these clinical signs to emerge and in some patients, the disease is confined to oral aphthous ulcers.  In many such cases a rap\\[id response to colchicine or other drug treatments used in Behcet's help with diagnosis. This is particularly true in cases where the oral ulcers have persisted for months with no remission and where subsequent withdrawal of drug treatment results in prompt recurrence of oral ulcers. \n\nUnfortunately, there are currently no definitive diagnostic tests for Behcet's. The skin pathergy test which is very simple to do is suggestive if it is positive, but even in patients with unequivocal Behcet's who have oral and genital aphthosis and skin and eye lesions, the pathergy test may be negative. This situation may change in the foreseeable future if ongoing research demonstrates that certain chemokine and cytokine profiles are highly diagnostic and as more is learned about the underlying patterns of T cell dysfunction that are thought to be causative are better understood. It is also likely that clinical signs, biochemical abnormalities, and the presence of genetic variations that are strongly associated with the disease will be used in combination to more rapidly reach a diagnosis. \n\nIt is also important to understand that there is no single \"cause\" of Behcet's. What we call Behcet's disease is really a conglomeration of clinical signs and symptoms that can and do result from different causes at the molecular and cellular level. In this respect, Behcet's is similar to cancer in that cancer is not a disease of single causation but instead results from many different inciting events; genetic, genomic, metabolic environmental, and combinations of these, This fact is increasingly reflected in the diverse targeted molecular therapies that are being used to treat it, both alone and in combination. Indeed, there is growing evidence that, like HIV, effective and durable control of cancer may well require the simultaneous use of multiple targeted drugs. This may prove to be the case in the more aggressive forms of Behcet's where a single treatment proves effective only for a limited period of time until the diseased cells adapt and escape the single treatment being used. In such cases, it may be necessary to inhibit multiple pathways at the same time in order to avoid the emergence of cells that are resistant to single, or even dual-dug therapy. This is certainly proving to be the case in some other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis where combinations of therapies that inhibit different molecular pathways are increasingly being used.\n\nA good question to ask any rheumatologist you are referred to is how many patients with Behcet's has he treated? The more complex/serious the disease is the more important it becomes to be treated by a rheumatologist who has a large base of experience and who is skilled in the use of the full range of therapies; immunosuppressive, biological and combinations that may be indicated for eye involvement, large blood vessel disease and end-organ involvement. Severe disease requires expert management and the skilled use of other specialist physicians to adequately manage specific organ involvement, such as ophthalmologists, gastroenterologists, and vascular surgeons. Thank you for typing this up. It is greatly appreciated and helps explain this disease a tad more in depth.\n\nI will go find another PCP for a second opinion and await for my dermatologist appointment. I have had this rash on my chest that seems to get activated when I run (as well as a continuing study of my cankersores). Hopefully she can recommend me to a rheumatologist to get that process started. It sucks having to be referred to one due to their specialization and lack of them around...\n\nThanks again.", "Hello Behceters. Have you vaccineted? Hello from Turkey I have bahcet diase for 2 years I m using colchicin and \u0130muran dailiy. I ve covid in January. It passed me eaisly. I only loose my smell for a week.  Now its better then ever i cant eat eggs it smells terrible to me.\n\nI wonder if you guys get vaccineted? How it works on you How you feel? I\u2019m also on the same medication + otezla and got vaccinated last month. Sadly for a couple of days had fever and chills, but happy nonetheless to finally be vaccinated. Haven\u2019t really changed how I feel but just did as a precaution I got two shots of Pfizer over the last six weeks - no issues outside of some moderate fatigue and arm pain a couple days after each shot. I'm on remicade and methotrexate for treatments - only thing I had to do was halve my methotrexate dosage each week I got the vaccine. Same meds + Prednisone\n\nI actually dropped my prednisone dose to absolute minimum to (hopefully) get a better immune response.\n\nI had my last Pfizer dose March 28th.\n\nFirst shot left me a little achy, and the injection site hurt a bit more than usual for a vaccine.\n\nSecond shot gave me a mild fever, and I had trouble sleeping the day of, but was more or less 100% within 48 hours.\n\nNo big deal, would absolutely recommend and would do it again. I got my second dose Thursday! Pfizer. I got really bad body aches and fever for 1 day but I\u2019m fine now. I\u2019ve had both shots from Pfizer. Only take colchicine. Didn\u2019t feel great for a day after both but came through just fine all things considered. I\u2019ll be getting it in May. I had Covid in January so my doctor asked me to wait until April. Well, then I stepped on rusty metal and needed a tetanus shot which means I have to wait two more weeks! (I have terrible luck.) I see rheumatology on Monday and I\u2019ll be asking if they have a vaccine preference, then scheduling my appointment for May! I am on Colchicine for Beh\u00e7ets, Mavenclad for MS (took last dose July 2020). I got the Pfizer on April 1st (one dose only so far) and apart from slight wooziness and a bit of a sore arm, I was fine. I\u2019m on Infliximab now. I had Covid in November. Pretty mild too. I just had my first shot of Pfizer two weeks ago. The first day wasn\u2019t too bad but then I had a bad couple of days then good for a few and now I\u2019ve been nauseous for a week. \n\nPlease know that if you are on immunosuppressants then the vaccine may not be as effective. I vaxxed. I had zero side effects. I\u2019m currently on Humira and Colcrys. I\u2019m on Otezla and have had both of my Pfizer shots. Mild symptoms after both that were gone in 48 hours. Even if I had bad symptoms for a couple days after the shots, I would still do it again. Totally worth it. I had covid in April 2020 and it was awful. Please get vaccinated and stay safe, everyone.

Honestly ask your general doctor, they will know best, but in the meantime you might want to take a general antinflammatory med like Ibuprophen or similar. I do not really have snot! I do not really have any other sinus issues! \n\nThe sneeze/cough/nose blowing is like once a day Sounds like sinus issues. I get a very similar headache/sinus pain when it is very, very dry.\n\nIf you are in part of the country running the furnace 24/7 your indoor humidity is probably uncomfortably low. I am going to try to run a humidifier tonight to see if it helps!", "Just diagnosed a few days ago, hi everybody. *waves* So, I just received a diagnosis of Behcet's this week, after about a decade of variegate unpleasantness.  I am a bit out of sorts on this, but really stoked that treatment is already lined up and I have a plan going forward.  So, um.. hi, folks, how are we doing, eh?  ", "Encouraging words Hi all, I barley post on here since I try to stay off social media but I wanted to tell you all your on my mind during thing holiday season! As fellow Behcets plagued person I hope all your flares halt for the holidays and the rest of the year is filled with good and not bad. Cheers!", "Colchincine? That is the second time my doctors tells me to take colchicine pills and years after the last time I still did not see differences from colchicine vs no colchicine. Does anyone else have a similar experience? I have seen quite a few people with success with colchicine but I have also heard stories where patients have not had any change with it. I would ask your doc what the direct result is they are going for, like are they trying to reduce ulcers, joint inflammation, fatigue? I was out on otzela to reduce my mouth ulcers and I have not had an outbreak for over a year (except when I missed a few doses but it quickly healed up). For me colchicine works better than any immunosuppressant out there. I am sorry it does not work for you. I believe in most cases it works though \ud83d\ude15 For me, it reduces the number of ulcers I get and any that I do get, are there for a much shorter time. It makes managing symptoms easier. i initially took colchicine by itself and noticed an improvement for a while. eventually i started getting flare ups again and my doc added hydroxychloroquine in addition to the colchicine. that worked well for me for about 5 years until i started getting bad flare ups yet again. now i am using humira with my colchicine which seems to work well for me. best of luck to you. My doctor told me it takes at least 6 weeks until it shows improvement. I was on steroids and cholcine for that time and am now fading out the steroids. I have seen decent improvement. Nope - colchicine has helped me tremendously She said it is to try to control the amount of crisis I have in a month (in those cases my symptomsare mainly flares), but I was not given much information on it. I took colchicine when I first found out I had behcet (2017) but neither my mom or I noticed a difference  on the disease pattern. It is the same now... I took it for at least 3 months and I stopped 2 weeks ago. Maybe I will try to take it again making a day by the day tracking, because without notes I did not really notice a change. Got ya! So how colchicine was explained to me was that it an anti-inflammatory medication. Our mouth ulcers are caused by inflammation in our cheeks and gums so the meds are supposed to reduce the inflammation thus the amount of flare ups. \n\nHave you tried other treatments including magic mouth wash or medicated ulcer pastes to help increase healing speed? If your main concern is just mouth flare ups (for the moment) I would picture track and measure them everyday to see if they are helped at all with the meds.  Good luck!! \ud83c\udf40 The only thing it seemed to do at first was give me horrifyingly loose bowels...\n\nBut it does help with ulcers it seems. Not a cure. I still get them, but they are smaller, and heal in a day or 3 instead of weeks/months. No improvement for my son or I, only undesirable GI side effects for me I am on a combo of colchicine and an immune suppressant now but it was just colchicine for a while before my official behcets diagnosis. Colchicine works well for me when it comes to minimizing the inflammation but I see zero impact of the colchicine on mouth ulcers. Does not do anything for me For years, I took colchicine only when I had a flare, because it gave me GI side effects. I had an exceptionally bad flare a few months ago and so tried taking once daily instead, and have seen general improvement in GI and oral ulcers once I got over the side effects, which went away on their own after a couple of weeks.", "My doctor raised the possibility of behcets but did not refer me to anyone or help me in any way? I have been presenting with genital, throat and mouth lesions, urinary symptoms, eye irritation, and widespread burning/tingling and facial pain intermittently for about a year now. Initially I thought I was having herpes simplex outbreaks but to my knowledge did not have the virus. Over the past year I have had over 13 HSV tests, bloodwork &amp; swabbed, all came back negative for HSV. My doctor told me \u201cwe might have a zebra where we usually have a horse\u201d and suggested I may have behcets and said I should get a pathergy test but made no referrals. What is the best kind of physician to see to get a diagnosis? Trying to continue school and work full time has been so difficult. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Find a rheumatologist that has experience treating Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. Depending on where you live, you may have access to a Beh\u00e7et\u2019s specialist. \nUnfortunately, you have to do the research and find the doctor that can help you and get a referral for that specific doctor. Not all rheumatologists are the same. Ask if they have treated people with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. I finally found a specialist in 2018 in the big city where I now live and it has dramatically improved my quality of life. No one else could help me for 15 years and I suffered. NYU Langone has specialists in NYC. \nI wish you luck! Okay I live in Philly so I am likely in luck with Penn here. Thank you for the advice.", "I am sick of this I am 20f and recently diagnosed with behcets. After years of constantly getting sick and presenting with many autoimmune-like symptoms I finally got a name after a bad flare up this past year. I am tired. I am tired of the meds I am tired of having to explain what is wrong I am tired of feeling different. When I first got my diagnosis I was made to feel like it was special to have such a thing. All I wanted to do was make homemade mochi yesterday and body feels like I got into a fight. I feel beat up I feel beat I feel embarrassed. My muscles and joints ache like I lifted weights. My hands feel cramped and tired. I finally understand what this stupid condition means. It means I will live the rest of my life burdened with knowing there is something off. Something that is not obvious enough to be seen but only felt. A body ache is a small complaint I realize this but it is one of the many tolls this silly disease has. I am tired of being tired &amp; feeling so alone. It took me 44 years to get a diagnosis. It is a small blessing to at least know what it is you have and to have doctors that believe you. At one point I had a surgeon seriously trying to evaluate me to try and get me committed because he thought I was delusional. I am very sorry to hear it took so long &amp; you had to experience that. As a younger female most problems were attributed to my emotions/hormones. Once I got enough ulcers they tested for a million std\u2019s. It was not until things got complicated a rheumatologist came to see me. There is nothing worse than almost feeling delusional. The alone part is probably less related to the Illness than you think. I see what you mean, I wanted to clarify alone in the sense of having something so rare. Not many people my age I know in college have any autoimmune disease let alone a rare one. It is harder to find people to communicate with that understand the annoyance. Rare diseases are rare if you take them alone, but if you take all rare diseases, they are very common. If you take autoinmune diseases then it is very common, and if you talk about having \"something\" in your body, the extremely rare is not having anything. \n\nMaybe you will not find anyone with bechets in your college, but crohns, lupus, etc... Surely. And if you go to diabetes, allergies, astma... In the end, specially as years pass, there are very few people Who do not have (or do not know It) something. I think your feeling how most of us felt after being diagnosed. It does get better, you will find the right meds and you will find ways to help you get through flare ups. I was also made to feel special when I was diagnosed, I was told the disease is pretty rare and had all kinds of doctors poking and prodding me but I promise it does get easier with time. Your not alone, there is plenty of us around and we can all help each other. With the aches and pains, try hot water bottles, it really helps. It is a hard journey but its not one you have to do alone That is why this forum is a powerful tool. We all understand how that feels. I know you cannot see us but I am sittin here nodding my head as I read your post. I really understand where your coming from. And I am sure the rest of us are too. We are all sick of it. But you lift your head up and soldier on. I am so hungry right now. I have not been able to eat normal food in days. I just want a damn cheeseburger. My joints hurt I want to feel normal I want to be able to hold my baby without pain. But you press through day by day. I document all my symptoms, and my moods. I do it so maybe one day some doc somewhere will look at it and gain a deeper understanding of this disease. I do it for my own sanity, so that I can vent about it like a journal. I do it so I can show others this is what it is like. The app I use even charts the days on a scale from one to five and I can add notes and pictures if I want. I can sort by symptoms. I highly recommend it it is called moody and it is only available on iOS right now.  Not an ad but I really do recommend it. \n\nKeep the faith... we are all in this together. You might not know us but we all share in this shitty disease. I thank you for your kind words &amp; advice. Agreed, thank you for this. Wow, gaslighting  It is good that you are expressing yourself and in so doing seeking social support. That is one of the most powerful coping mechanisms. I exercise and meditate a lot and yet I still get depressed. I think what would help me the most is more connection and social support. Have you considered a (disability) counsellor/therapist?\n\nI hope it is not stopping you from all physical activity. IIRC exercise and counselling are 2 of the best things against depression.\n\n&gt;I am tired of having to explain what is wrong  \n\nI feel you. Maybe you could tell people, short story: fibromyalgia. My short story is brain damage because it permanently damaged my vision, hearing, and balance. I do not share your symptoms.\n\nEveryone is got their own struggles. Some have it (un)luckier than others. Even lucky people can be depressed and unlucky people can still be happy. I try not to think about it. Thank you! I have been thinking about getting more serious with improving my relaxation techniques as you stress should be managed. Which medicines di you take? this pain sucks. it is our new normal. i constantly think about it. but i have learned to navigate my best around it. i am not going to let this control me. i do as much as i can to remind myself i am stronger than this. you are too. Thanks for your words, the control thing is something I need to get under control. azathioprine, prednisone a few others, it is just I was never really used to meds and suddenly I was flooded with them. if you ever need someone to talk to, i am here I appreciate you. 30f here. I was diagnosed at 21 based on oral and genital sores and flu-like symptoms that did not go away. First I had a very hard time running around to many docs and clinics that could not imagine what was wrong. One doc misdiagnosed me with herpes after seeing the genital sores, but a blood test then proved that to be incorrect. \n\nNow at 30, for me it is in remission almost entirely. My doctor's regimen for me was colchicine 2x/day, then later 1x/day, then in later years he recommended I attempt to taper off. I still get an oral sore now and then but it is nothing like it was.\n\nWhile I cannot say how your case will progress, it is possible for the disease to become more mild with time for some cases. Getting on meds that help is essential.\n\nI really relate to your feeling of being tired, alone and embarrassed. I felt like that too at 21, it was hard. You are not alone and it is good that you reached out online. Life can definitely get better with time, and there is hope. You just got to make it through this difficult time. Good luck and hang in there &lt;3", "Interesting interview with Neil Melanson on coaching, life before grappling &amp; living with Bechet\u2019s disease  Thanks for posting! I do MMA/BJJ myself but had no idea Melanson had Behcet's disease. Dude's a legend - and even more of a beast than I thought!", "Moderna First Dose Reading people's COVID vaccine experience posts was super helpful (thank you!), so I thought I would leave one as well. I will leave a follow-up if there is anything else to add.\n\nI had my first Moderna shot on Tuesday. It was painless and I did not have an immediate reaction. Hours later I began to have some swelling, soreness, and stiffness in my bicep, comparable to what I get with the flu shot. It was not painful enough to take anything for it, though the nurse who gave me the shot said I could take Tylenol or Advil if needed. The soreness and swelling got worse the day after I got the shot (yesterday), but started to get better today (day 3). So far I have not had anything by way of a flare-up, but I do not usually have issues with vaccinations., I am keeping an eye out for the delayed arm rash that sometimes happens with the Moderna shot, since my skin reacts to stuff easily.\n\nI am 40 and female. I have had a Behcet's diagnosis for almost a decade now, though my first flare-up was probably 7 years before that (and mouth sores on and off basically forever). I have a mild case, so I am not regularly medicated for it. I do get sick easily, so every few years I will end up with bronchitis or pneumonia, and then I will have what I think of as a full-on flare-up. I have been extra careful about COVID because my Behcet's does not seem to play well with lower respiratory infections. I am sorry about the endless mouth ulcers and eye inflammation. I am not an expert, but based on my experience, I feel like your best bet is to see a specialist who is familiar with the condition or has had other patients with it. In an ideal world you would be able to see a rheumatologist during a flare-up, but I have not had much luck with that even though I am in a city with a bajillion doctors. You can try seeing a rheumatologist anyway, or could try to see other specialists who are familiar with the condition. The eye doctors I have seen have been more familiar with Behcet's than non-specialists, so they might be able to say whether your keratitis is related or to refer you to a specialist who can help with the diagnosis. And gynecologists and urologists seem to be more familiar with the condition than the average doctor since genital ulceration is pretty common.\n\nIt took six years for me to get a consistent diagnosis. My flare-ups are infrequent and when I had trouble getting appointments with specialists on short notice, so I was usually being observed by general practitioners who had no idea what was going on. Prior to Behcet's, I had been diagnosed with \"dunno,\" and, briefly, with \"the world's worst case of herpes,\" even though I have consistently tested negative for it. At one point, I had a phone call with a doctor in which I could literally hear them getting a giant book down off of a shelf and frantically flipping pages, which did not inspire confidence. It was pretty frustrating, so as long as I was not having major symptoms, I did not try hard to pursue a diagnosis.\n\nFinally, I was lucky to be seen by a general practitioner who recognized the genital ulceration during a flare-up. The clinic happened to have a gynecologist on site that day who agreed with the diagnosis and performed a biopsy, and the GP ordered a bunch of blood tests. I got a second opinion from a gynecologist at a different institution later that week. On observing the ulcers she immediately said \"Behcet's,\" without my having mentioned it. Months later, I was finally able to see a rheumatologist. It was too late for the ulcers to be observed, but he looked at the previous case notes and biopsy results, conducted more blood tests (no pathergy test, though), and confirmed the diagnosis. I saw a GI doctor around the same time because Crohn's and ulcerative colitis are on the differential, but he seemed to think I have Behcet's (no testing was performed, though, and I sometimes wonder if I could have one of those conditions instead).\n\nI have since seen another rheumatologist, and he confirmed the diagnosis based on the case notes and test results and my description. I wonder sometimes if it is the right diagnosis given the infrequency of my flare-ups, and the fact that people in my family have been diagnosed with what feels like every other rheumatological condition (rheumatoid arthritis, Raynaud's, SLE, Sjogren's, scleroderma, Hashimoto's, psoriasis, etc.), but I am somehow the only person with Behcet's.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you can get some relief from your symptoms. Thank you so much I really appreciate these! I am actually in a flare-up right now and I am trying to reach out. I highly doubt that I have it but let us see. Thanks and hope your symptoms are under controlled for good!!", "exercising with behcets So, I have gained some weight during quarantine and have being eating a lot coping with stress and anxiety. I wanted to exercise at home, but due the fadigue part of the disease I just cannot. I get super tired after some minutes, and ADHD doens't help because I get bored easily while doing it. \nI have been stretching (and some of the stretching exercises still are tough to me) but I do not think it is enough.\nDoes anybody have tips? Start by going on short walks and work on building up your stamina. I know it is august so being outside is not ideal, my next suggestion would be Yoga. Short 10 minute sessions - you can easily find a good video online. Start there and build up your stamina. I know how hard it being active can be but one of the best things I did for myself was get active. A body in motion stays in motion. Sit and be fit! I am in a current long term flare and also have RA. I still teach fitness classes but my most successful ones are seated bodies in Motion class similar  to the  Sit and be fit program. HAS fit and More Life Health life health on YouTube have amazing videos. Start there and you can always expand to water aerobics and low impact training! Yoga ..power yoga on my better days and slow flow on my not so good days. And on my really bad days nothing lol. But You get stronger everytime :) that has been the best thing for me personally. I do not like walking or running anymore as it triggers my knees to act up and flares in general. But on my best days I bike. I love being active but understand modifying for better quality of life. My advice is do what makes you happy first though \u2764\ufe0f", "What works best for your mouth ulcers? Hey everyone, I am having a flare up that is gone from bad to worse. I am really trying to avoid going to ER but if I cannot do fluids or eat I know I am going to end up there within the week. \n\nI have the pink wash, I am on colchicine, I have some painkillers and I am awaiting start methotrexate and Remicade. \n\nHas anyone tried a steroidal gel like Fluocinonide or something like triamcinolone acetonide?? Any luck?", "Did anyone else react to the vaccine with severe body pain the next day? I had Pfizer yesterday. I am not sick per se but my whole body is in immense pain. I have fibro and behcets and I am wondering if anyone else had this and how they deal with it. My only relief is being in a hot bath. I hope you are better now!! Im on Otezla had bad body pain after my second Pfizer shot. My friend who is on zero meds for anything had it much worse than I did. The good news? We are vaccinated! Woot woot! I am all better now! I am so glad to be vaccinated too!", "What are your symptoms? I was diagnosed with Behcet\u2019s when I was about 8 years old. What symptoms do you get? I used to have horrible pain and canker sores. I still get bad canker sores but not as much pain. \n\nOn another note, if anyone has found a way to control canker sores let me know. Mine come and go but when I get one I usually get many I find that certain foods bring on the mouth sores. Breads in particular, and many other things including any thing crunchy. Can I ask where you live? I have had canker sores my whole life. The first ones I remember I was under 5 years old. I have had gastric issues since my teens and chronic pain since my 20s. I have had genital ulcers. I am 35 years old and I still do not have an official diagnosis. I also have an aunt that had Behcets. \n\nSorry. My baby will not sleep and I am having a pity party. \n\nAsk your dentist about laser treatment for your ulcers. It is honestly the best thing I have ever done. I live in Pennsylvania. I know Behcet\u2019s is supposed to run in Middle Eastern families but my family is not from there and nobody in my family has ever had it that I know of. It is a huge mystery why I have it.  \n\nI have had canker sores since before I can remember but I only remember being in the hospital when I was 8 with a blood clot which is what triggered the diagnosis. I had genital ulcers when I was younger. The canker sores continued. Why do you not have a diagnosis? When I was in the hospital for about a week they did a lot of tests and tested for every disorder possible everything came back negative. I believe because my symptoms lined up with Behcet\u2019s and there was no other cause that is what they said it is. I still sometimes wonder if it was a misdiagnosis \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI have never heard of laser treatment for canker sores! I will look into that. I have been having so many dental problems lately so I will ask once everything else is taken care of. I often wonder if my dental problems are related to the Behcet\u2019s too \ud83d\ude44 or the canker sores That is interesting. Do you think bread has to do with the gluten? I have heard rumors that gluten can bring them on but who knows. It is so hard to eat anything crunchy when I have them, or eat anything for that matter I live in a smaller center in Canada. I have a rheumatologist, but I saw her for the first time when I was 3 months post partum and dealing with thyroiditis. She said there was \u201ctoo much noise\u201d to make a diagnosis. But it took me years to get a family dr to even refer me. \n\nI have huge dental issues too. But I know that I did not take care of my teeth when I had oral ulcers cuz it hurt so much. Since I started lasering my outbreaks I have had considerably fewer ulcers and my oral health is better overall. I was diagnosed at 20, but I started getting canker sores around 3. Canker sores are the symptom I dealt with for the longest and were easily the most painful. Stress aggravated mine most of the time. My worst flare was in college right before finals one year and was led to finally getting diagnosed. I have tried many medications, gels, foods, and more with hit and miss success. The only thing that stopped them was Prednisone for bad flares and Otzela every day. Since I started Otzela, I have not had one (I also only take 30mg a day instead of 60mg because it upset my stomach). \n\nI have finally found a pretty reasonable balance of meds that seem to help: Cimzia injection once a month and daily Otzela and Plaquenil. Took about 10 years to get to this point, but it does get more manageable. Ugh that stinks. I wish you luck. The diagnosis is not imperative especially when there is not a cure but it is nice to know what is going on. I am sure that is probably what happened with me too...it is so hard to be diligent with brushing when you have canker sores throughout your mouth Interesting, I have never heard of laser but I have heard there is a prescription mouthwash that can help the cankers and also a pill if you get them very frequently. For me, oral ulcers come in episodes every 2-3 months I will get a few and then they go away in a week or two so I have never tried treatment but probably should since I do also stop brushing or flossing when they are so bad I just cannot open my mouth and bear it. I believe I was on prednisone at some point but it is not a long term fix. I actually did try Otezla my rheumatologist hyped it up but I had side effects that would not go away. The worst stomach pain and nausea. I was taking one in the morning and in the evening not sure of the mg and she told me I could go down to once a day but it did not help. I eventually just stopped. I still have it I could try again but it would need to be during a time I do not have much going on. I was on that and colchicine together. Not sure if the colchicine was working I did not think it was but I have not seen her in a while. I am so bad at continuing to go see my rheumatologist. I have tried so many medications too I never have either and I used a mouthwash for mouth sores but never the prescription. I have tried so many medications. I usually always have at least one but then there might be a time there is none or very few then all of a sudden 10 at once! It is nice there are other people that understand the pain I have never even been officially diagnosed but several doctors now have told me they believe it is behcets that causes my oral and genital ulcers. It can only be diagnosed clinically (based on symptoms) and since there is no test that will clearly tell you it is Behcets, you are supposed to have three symptoms. I have always wondered if it is under-diagnosed in the States because I have read that people who do not have Middle Eastern or silk-road descent tend to have different symptoms and often may not have the THREE separate symptoms that are required to diagnose it. I wonder how many people out there have it and just do not have that third thing. I did not know about the three symptoms but that would make sense because I did not get diagnosed until my first blood clot even though I had bad pain and canker sores long before that. It sucks there is no test. It was really just process of elimination :(  it is weird doctors always ask me if I have middle eastern family nope...it probably is that then especially if you have been tested for other things. Many doctors do not even know what it is! I was in college when it was first suggested and had access to a lot of peer-reviewed journal databases and took a few deep dives. I have found it very helpful to educate myself about this because it is so rare, especially in the United States, doctors just do not usually know much. The better I have got at describing it, the more serious they have been and often will ask to pull in other doctors to consult and I have even had them call back after an appointment and say they talked to some other doctor and changed the treatment and sent a new prescription to help manage. My flares are severe but few and far between, so I have caused a stink sometimes just to get in immediately, always hoping that if they could see me in a flare, they would be able to do something or at least give me some clues or answers. I get a fever and body pain that is the worst thing I have ever felt each time, it leaves me depressed and battling for my mental health for months after each flare. Yep. I get them in weird places too like my gums or tongue or between my teeth. Last time I got one it was a huge one where my top and bottom lip meet. I thought it might be a cold sore for a while but when it broke it was definitely a canker. Took so long to heal and hurt so bad the first time opened my mouth every morning! I used lots of Vaseline, which helped me be able to talk on the phone for work. Ugh, I am sorry. The Otzela really messed with my stomach for the first month or so, but once I got in a rhythm it was better. Did you get the starter pack when you took it? My doctor actual had me do two starter packs to spread out the dosage more while I got used to it. It might be worth having another conversation with your rheum to see if you can try a more gradual approach. I have not had a canker sore since I started it (which is amazing as the stress of my job this year would have surely caused many before I took it). \n\nMy rheum also said there is something she called \u201cAmerican Behcet\u2019s\u201d where there is less of the neurological symptoms and more of the joint pain and canker sores. She thinks that is what I have, since I also have zero middle eastern/Silk Road ancestry. \n\nAlso, in case you have not tried this, check your toothpaste! Anything with sodium laurel sulfate can make canker sores worse too. Mine improved when I switched to something without that. I found out I had a sulfa allergy to go with my behcets. I still get periodic mouth ulcers now but after switching away from toothpaste with sulfates in it and entirely avoiding things grown in California, I do not have them constantly anymore. Are you male or female? (I only ask because I have heard that it can go into remission during pregnancy and I am super intrigued by this) Oral and genital ulcers- especially bad when I am on my period. Arthritis in most of my joints is also pretty bad. I am 29 but some days I wake up feeling 129..... any slight trauma to my mouth will result in a flairup. Dreading going to the dentist to get 2 cavities filled and a deep cleaning because I know I will be in hell the following days.... I am female and have not been pregnant so I am not sure about that. That is very interesting. 9 months without a canker sores would be great lol. Are you a female as well? I did have a starter pack. I should probably go back to see her. That is amazing I am glad it works for you. It would be great to find something that works. \n\nThat sounds like something I could have too. I know how bad Behcet\u2019s can be so im thankful it is mostly just pain and canker sores for me. The blood clots scare me. I am just glad I have no eye problems like some people get.\n\nI do use a SLS free toothpaste but thanks for the suggestion! I was told to do that years ago I am not sure if it helps but it does not harm and it is a lot more natural Aw I am sorry it gets bad for you. I always have some pain and canker sores but blood clots occur during a flare for me. That is really interesting you get fevers with it. It really does mess with your mental health. It is depressing. Good for you for educating yourself I agree it is so important because it is not well known. I have often suggested things to my doctors. We have to advocate for ourselves! I am female. I actually got an IUD put in because my cramps and flairups were so bad. I have never wanted to have kids but I can only dream of 9 months without feeling like shit! I use toothpaste without SLS because I was told it can bring on canker sores. Were you diagnosed with that allergy by an allergist? I did not know that\u2018s something that happens. Good to know. What do you think it is about things that are grown in California? I have the Nexplanon implant. Although it is been longer than three years so I really need to get it taken out lol. I have not decided yet if I want kids but if I do I will pay attention to if I get any canker sores in that time \ud83d\ude02 You sound just like me. I have been told I have arthritis too. My joints always hurt. The pain was unbearable when I was younger which was one factor to getting diagnosed. I know exactly how you feel with going to the dentist. Every single time I get work done at the dentist the next day I break out in so many canker sores. Something else I have noticed is whenever I go to the beach and I am outside for a long period of time the next day I have a lot too. Which is so annoying because I even use the Chapstick that has SPF in it. There is no winning * Multiple blood clots in both legs, back, abdomen, and inferior vena cava (vein going to heart). \n* Severe retinitis/uveitis in left eye. \n* Constant oral and genital ulcers for over a decade. \n* Arthritis/joint pain. \n* A million different skin problems including cystic acne, regular acne, folliculitis, and many more.\n\nI was diagnosed at 16. I am 40 now. The worst of those symptoms happened in my late teens. The genital and oral sores were relentless from about the age of 15-25, then they stopped. Clots happened when I was 18, 35, and 38. Now I am on blood thinners for life. There is a lot more to it, but that just about sums it up. Not by an allergist no. I was prescribed sulfa antibiotics and had a horrific allergic reaction. Horrific including my throat ulcerating and bleeding from my mouth. It was awful. \n\nCalifornia commonly uses a type of organic fertilizer that is super high in sulfates/sulfites. It makes things grown in it grow great and spoil less quickly. It took me a while to figure out its why I could not drink wine without getting sick. I just needed to drink wine from places other than California or Australia. \n\nFun fact there is also an artificial sweetener named asulfame potassium that I just immediately throw up if I drink it. Sulfa everything allergies are lame. I did not have ulcers when pregnant, but I had bad morning sickness. I think it is related to my gastric issues. I actually threw up so hard I had a Mallory Weiss tear (esophageal tear and bleeding) at 38 weeks. My symptoms are not all \"usual\", which I found out later is actually common amongst behcet's. \n\nI get vasculitis type inflammation in my hands. Causing extreme red flushing. Skin ulcers on my legs that take months to heal. Joint pain in hands, feet, ankles, elbows and sometimes hips. Sores in my mouth and nose. Confusion, difficulty focusing. When I am in a bad flare I get histamine intolerance and urticaria. Extreme headaches, racing heart rate and anxiety/depression. I get terrible muscle weakness and fatigue. I also have frequent eye pain and very poor vision. \n\nIn my teens I had a mystery aneurysmal bone cyst in my left leg above my ankle in my tibia bone. \n\nThey also think there may be neuro involvement but I am am still waiting on my appointment to confirm. \n\nMy family has had a history of MS. My aunt specifically had red hand Flushing like me but she is no longer here to investigate if she also had beh\u00e7et's. My Nana suffers from genital ulcers, depression joint issues but she refuses to seek treatment because she hates doctors lol. \n\nDermatologist confirmed beh\u00e7et's in skin biopsy. Oh and I am heat sensitive. Lol I am in my late 30s. I have had painful cankersores all my life. Like others here, they are brought on my stress, or menstrual cycle. Also would get skin lesions that look like acne, face and also neck and chest and back. A few years ago, started getting genital ulcers. After a few years, and more tests, docs diagnosed behcets. I am on colchicine, which has helped tremendously with all symptoms. I am not totally great at remembering to take my meds....and my body totally tells me when I do not (with a flareup of some sort).\n\nAs for cankersores, for relief, I would gargle with mouthwash (which sometimes makes it hurt so much it just temporarily numbs it) or if very bad, will apply a numbing agent like orajel. Wow it sounds like you have it pretty severely. Are you doing ok? The blood clots scare me...I am always worried about them. I have only ever had them in my legs so far. I go see an eye specialist yearly and so far there is never been inflammation but I worry about that too. I have acne too :/ I figured it probably had to do with the Behcet\u2019s because it is inflammation I am doing well, all things considered. No new clots since staying on the blood thinners. Like I said, my teen and early 20s were the worst. So it is been all uphill from there. The only permanent disability I have is that I cannot climb for very far. I can walk fine on level ground (or a slight incline) and can even run. But I cannot go up - no more mountain climbing for me. My legs get stiff and sore after 3-500 ft. And vision in my left eye, when I close my right, is a bit blurry. But other than that, I am good. If you have had clots before, my advice is this: do not be me and wait until your leg (or whatever) is so swollen you cannot move it before going to the doctor. If you think you may be developing new clots, seek treatment right away. Other than that, I would not worry about it much :) That is good that you are doing well. That is too bad it affected your ability to climb. At least you can walk and run! I usually go to the doctor once I see swelling because both times my leg has gotten swollen it is been a blood clot. I actually have been having chest pain the past two days and am considering going to the hospital. I hate having to run to the hospital at every sight of pain but urgent care sends me there because they do not want to deal with it. I think they were considering putting me on blood thinners for the rest of my life too but I was too young and I have only had two blood clots so far Now that drugs like Eliquis (the one I am on) are available, being on a blood thinner is not a big deal. No blood work or regular monitoring. It is something to be considered. That is great. If I end up getting another they would probably consider that. It is not ideal but it would prevent future blood clots If you do, I would recommend one of the newer generation of blood thinners. I am on Eliquis and it is great: no blood work, no problems. Much better than coumadin. Hopefully you will not have any more clots though. That is exactly which one I was on in the past. Coumadin. I remember being on two. That one then one I needed to get a needle twice a day. Not sure if they were the same or if that was a different one. That really sucked. I really hope I do not get any more. They come randomly. I hope you do not get any more either! I have the canker sores frequently too. Sometimes I feel like they are brought on by stress and other times it does not seem like there is a cause. I tried colchicine and I am not sure if it was helping but I ran out and did not go back to my rheumatologist :/ not only am I not the best at taking meds but I am not the best at going to my doctor. I am so busy and they are not that close to me. I need to start going back though because I have been feeling poorly lately. What did you do about the skin lesions? I get acne and I always wonder if it is related to the behcet\u2019s. It seems everything is \ud83d\ude44 Ugh I can relate to the joint pain. Mine is so bad lately for some reason. It hurts all over my body. What do you do for it? The headaches and heart rate would freak me out. Sorry you are going through that. I did not realize a dermatologist could diagnose it I was just wondering because I have been told to avoid it but never had an allergy test for it. I just avoid it because it does not hurt to. That is really interesting about California. Strange It is a pain in the butt to avoid. That stuff is in everything. Have you ever tried something called magic mouthwash? I really only avoid it in things that go in my mouth. I.e. toothpaste because for me it is not an actual allergy that I am aware of. I tend to buy shampoo without it too just because it seems more natural\n\nOh I was specifically talking about SLS that I try to avoid. I do not avoid sulfates. Do you avoid it in foods too? Yes I avoid sulfates in everything if possible, but some stuff its naturally occurring in small amounts. I used to break out around my hairline, so I switched to sulfate free shampoo. No more hairline breakouts. That is really interesting. I did not consider it in foods too. What kind of foods is it in lol sounds like everything. Maybe I should have been avoiding it too Lol I mean food goes in your mouth. If you avoid it in things that go in your mouth, it is probably going to do the same thing to the rest of your digestive tract, unfortunately. Its in bottled juices and all sorts of other things. It is a natural preservative and there is a type of sugar free sweetener that is sulfa derived.  It makes sense I wonder why doctors only say to avoid SLS specifically then and not sulfates. It sounds like the same type of thing SLS is a lot easier to spot probably. It is an obvious culprit. It is very possible doctors are unaware of how pervasive sulfates in general are in food in the US. Have you tried Colchicine? It is an absolute game-changer for me with ulcers :) I have but I stopped when I ran out. I was taking that and Otezla and the Otezla was giving me horrible side effects so I stopped them together. I really should go back to my rheumatologist Hey odd question but what do you do for your headaches? I am not sure why I am just seeing this now. I have not tried that. Is it good? I have tried the mouthwash for canker sores but it does not seem to help It requires a prescription but it is relatively effective.   As you know, nothing truly makes the pain go away long term until the sores are in their dying stages.  I manage mine now with Colchicine.  I still have them pretty much non stop, but they never reach the acute pain stage. Yes sadly I do know :( I will ask about that when I see my rheumatologist next. I am going in a few weeks and I wish it was sooner because I have been feeling really poorly lately I live in PA too and am undergoing the diagnosis process! Do you mind if I ask where you were diagnosed?", "Hughes stovin syndrome High all, only now finding this site. I was diagnosed with behcets disease around 6 years ago at the age of 24. I was then later diagnosed with an extremely rare form of it called hughes stovin syndrome, i was just wondering if theres anyone else that has had this aswell as the behcets?  What sort of drugs are you taking for your condition?  I take.. azathioprine, prednisone, omeprazole, alendronic acid, clexane injections and humira injections. Are you worried about this shit? I am extensively reading about it and it seems to have a very high mortality rate. Also, have you tried the drug infliximab?  Well the way i look at it is what will be will be, theres no point living your life worrying about what could be.. but ye i do sometimes think about it and get worried but i try to live each day as it comes. I did die once a few years back but luckily enough they saved me just in time lol yes i have tried that drug before but it didnt work. Iv tried a load of different drugs and failed but this combo seems to work great for me. What Is your issue then if u dont mind me asking? I do not suffer from Bechet's or Hughes. I just like reading up extensively on random rare diseases that most people do not care much about. \n\nSince you are quite young  do most people with your condition get to live into their old age? Is it theoretically possible with the continuous course of right treatment?  Ah that is cool. And to be honest with you it is so rare theres very little known about the condition. Im 1 of 2 people in uk currently living with this condition so theres not much known about it. Iv been told my life expectancy is around on average 55 years old so not long but again on the other hand o could live a long normal life so again not really sure. ", "New pain everyday. How to tell myself I am not dying?! Literally have a new pain everyday. Whether it is a pain in my head I have never felt or a pain in my back or abdomen. \n\nThe pains always give me anxiety because I always think something is severely wrong! \n\nHow do you all manage this?! I already cried to my rheumatologist. She said we need to wait it out to see if anything is chronic and not acute. \n\nThe pain is constantly moving around my whole freaking body, so while it is technically acute, it is technically chronic, too. \n\nUgh how do you all manage this?! Do not want to be on another freakin pill. Already having a hard enough time keeping track of taking what I am on. This is a struggle &amp; something I have been thinking about a lot this week. Personally I have become hypersensitive to my body bc I was diagnosed in 2014, so I have spent the last 7 years worrying that something was going to happen. \n\nWhat I have learned is that makes things so much worse. I am also 32 now so I have to remember that some of these pains are related to being old lol. I have a 3-day rule, I just assume it is a random pain unless it lasts longer than 3 days.\n\nYou are not dying \ud83d\udc9c I have become hypersensitive too. Things that did not use to bother me, do. I would have NEVER even thought about some of the pains I have now. It is so frustrating and annoying. \n\nIt is extra annoying because I know I am fine. I know what to tell myself, and my brain just does what it wants. \n\nI think a lot of it is frustration. I just want a new body. I am so done with all of this. I am only 26. I am not sure how I am going to survive like this. I just want to scream! I also struggle with this. It is the battle between the logical mind and the emotional, frustrated sense of self. Sigh.\n\nIf this helps, it is worth sharing what I do:\n\nBasically meditation that I began after my most massive flare last year. I have started visualizing the part(s) of my body that are affected. I say positive affirmations about my body and zone in on those like:\n\" every cell/muscle/organ in my body is working  exactly as it should. I am strong. I am healthy.\" \nIf it is my eyes giving trouble I would then try to imagine the cells in my eyes repairing themselves like a little factory of busy workers..lol obviously you would do this for whichever parts are hurting.\n\nI know that positive affirmations are all part of the whole spiritual \"woke\" thing and that is not normally my vibe but I DO believe that when we suffer chronically with our bodies, our frustration can build up resentment towards these bodies we have been given. If we are not careful we can begin to hate these \"faulty\" bodies. I think maybe, it is worth trying to love them.\n\nSo sometimes at night I will run thoughts through from head to toe..and I will think about all the parts that are feeling well. Haha sometimes I laugh out loud because it is so ridiculous. \"Thank you FEET for moving me around effortlessly and comfortably\" but hey! If they are the only part that is NOT hurting.. I will go with it.  You get my point though.. the age old adage of trying to focus on the positive.\n\nThat is the spiritual/self side of my approach.\nThe logical/mind side does a checklist of the basics:\n\n1. Did I eat like shit yesterday? Diet is huge.\n2. Am I getting enough sleep? I am going to sleep early tonight.\n3. Have I been drinking a lot of water? I tend to get dehydrated and find that affects my symptoms.\nEtc etc.\n\nOnce I have gone through the basics, I can usually (if I am honest with myself) find at LEAST one of those that I can say I did not do well enough..and from there I say... OK I am probably NOT dying...this is probably NOT A STROKE. Hahaha because I do get panicked by  new symptoms and then it is scary to know if to wait... or call a doctor etc.\n\nSo, tackle both the logical and the emotional. Take both practical steps, and self-loving steps. When new pains come..you can usually find a way from there on to convince yourself you are not having some brain clot/stroke etc. \n\nYou are doing ok. \ud83d\ude0a Yeah, I understand that for sure. I try to focus on shifting my thoughts and energy to the good stuff in my life. So recently I was hospitalized for cluster headaches &amp; I was really angry/down about it bc my body has been falling apart since Christmas. Then I decided to refocus on gratitude &amp; it really helps. It takes practice, &amp; sometimes it is as simple as \u201cwow my head hurts less than yesterday that is really great\u201d instead of \u201cwtf I have a headache again today.\u201d\n\nAlso there are guided meditations on YouTube for pain that legitimately help. \n\nYour brain is in overdrive bc having a body you cannot trust is traumatizing. But you can choose your thoughts more deliberately with practice &amp; time I have the opposite problem. I am afraid I am going to have a heart attack or a stroke or something and just be like, \"I do not need to go to the hospital. It is probably just Behcet's related. I have been having weird mystery pain for decades.\" \n\nI have had so many strange pains all over my body that I assume any new pain is Behcet's related. But sometimes I have to remind myself that not everything is Behcet's. But I feel your pain (no pun intended). It can be a real struggle.", "Welcome To /r/Behcets! ", "Newly diagnosed 47 yo male from Texas diagnosed this week with Beh\u00e7et. Any information would be greatly appreciated. I am an electrician with 30+ years in the field. I am finding it harder and harder to keep up with the day to day grind. The biggest problem I face is joint pain spinal stiffness and uveitis. What is out there that will help outside of medications. I am being started on Azathioprine next week. And I would also like to know anyone\u2019s experience with this medication. I do not like to take anything so I am kind of apprehensive about it by what I read about it. \n\nThanks  Hi there. Sorry to hear about your diagnosis. \n\nI also take azathiaprine (Imuran).  I have been on and off it a few times over the years, and I have had the dosage changed a few times as well. I always have stomach problems during transitions with this one. As in, I should stay near a bathroom if I try to eat anything. You might even want to ask for a prescription to help with nausea if it gets too bad, like zofran. That is the only physical symptom I experience with it as far as I can tell. I believe it can effect liver function, so your doctor will want regular bloodwork to make sure your liver is handling the medication. \n\nI have never been able to find a medication combo that completely eliminates flare ups or outbreaks. So once something acts up, prednisone or methylprednisolone (corticosteroids) are required to get me back to \u2018normal\u2019. I take naproxen for pain and inflammation, Tylenol and ibuprofen. Cbd oil seems to help with pain and duration of mouth ulcers. I am not sure if it does anything to prevent flares, but it does not hurt anything so I take it daily just in case. My doctor agrees. I have never tried the cbd creams or lotions for joint pain, so I do not know if those help or not. \n\nIf your symptoms are mostly joint related, you could talk to your doctor about trying a newer rheumatoid arthritis drug...the name escapes me at the moment. If I think of it, I will edit this comment. It is not currently indicated for behcets, so your insurance company might not approve it. But it does not hurt to ask I guess. \n\nRest and stress reduction are always recommended. Also, for some reason heat seems to trigger flare ups (like working outside when its really hot, or taking hot baths). That could definitely be all in my head, but I try to avoid those things just in case. \n\nHopefully, you will be able to get this under control quickly and can start feeling good again soon \ud83d\ude42 AZT caused my blood to throw some unfavourable results so my rheumatologist took me off it. Then I had a really bad relapse and now I cannot walk. They started me on cyclophosphamide now and it sucks and I have not improved at all. Hopefully you do not go my route. Im a 34 yr old male who was very active and now I cannot do shit.  I started on Cellcept and Cyclosporine. When that failed, I tried Cytoxan. That made me terribly sick and eventually it failed as well. I have been on Remicade since 2010 and it has worked for me. I have very few side effects and very few symptoms. My biggest problem was uveitis. Now they tell me I have no inflammation in my eyes (hurrah) but I have glaucoma in both eyes.  I have been on azathioprine for years with no issues. For joint pain I use Volteren gel and tablets both work well. Really, it is going to be trial and error for a while to see what combination of things work for you. I also use a lot of essential oils, there is one for everything that ails you.  Good luck, hope you get some relief soon. Hi, I am a 34 yr f, diagnosed at age 25- and have been cycled on and off a laundry list of medications, AZ included on that list.\nPersonally for my body, I did not tolerate that particular drug. I felt much worse opposed to better, and began needing to keep a mop bucket near by at all times due vomiting daily and unpredictability. Over the years my doctors and I have tried different medications to see what would help the symptoms as well as maintain as close to flare-free as possible. \nFor me and my body what is worked best is a combination of methotrexate (taken once per week along with folic acid) and colchicine once per day, unless I am flaring then I increase to twice per day. When I experience more intensive flares I have prednisone on hand to rapidly reduce the state and inflammation in case I cannot get into my doctor quickly enough. I tend to get oral and intestinal ulcers, swollen joints and lymph nodes most frequently. \nIt is been trial and error for sure over the past decade. Truly it is been hard and isolating at times, overwhelming by all the doctors and appointments and medications, but finding communities like this, doing my research, and learning to listen to my body has really helped. Diet and exercise have been what I have found to be most critical as to how much pain I experience day to day as well as how frequently I flare.\nFeel free to reach out if you have any other questions or just need some support from someone else whos been there! Good luck!  I have no information about azathioprine but I will tell you that Beh\u00e7et\u2019s is tough and I am sorry you are joining the club. I was dx\u2019d 9 years ago. The meningitis and joint/body pain in general has been exceedingly difficult at times. What has helped me cope is colchicine, even though it was primarily for treating ulcers. My old rheumie told me it might be a stone that kills two birds and she was right. \n\nFor neck stiffness and joint pain, she also prescribed me lidocaine patches. Seemed strange at first but they worked wonders in a jiffy.  I have been on this,didnt work that well.Im on Methotraxate now 10 pills a week along with mirapex.Im now able to work 20 hours a week .But this drug has helped me feel a little better then all the stuff I have tried.I think that drug your going to try is for mouthsores and eye inflammation. Its all live and learn kind of thing,and learning how to deal with living everyday is a challenge and you might have to try different meds. But theres something that will help,its all in time.It took me ten years to to beable to walk again and stand some at work.But I can say it has cut down on the flares in eyes and mouth more then  anything. The problems with the rest of my body are always there and hurting but a little easier to deal with.I wish you well my friend in your travels. If you can, travel to see a Beh\u00e7et\u2019s specialist. I am seeing one in NYC and am finally getting real help. ", "Short, interesting article that mentions Behcet's specifically. Talks about the genetic origins of autoimmune diseases.  This explains a lot. As an archaeologist with Beh\u00e7et, I am not surprised :v Can you elaborate? I am not particularly surprised either, but my background is in clinical psychology so I am curious to know what insights archeology has given you into this. I am not an expert either since my field of study is hunter gatherers of western europe.\nHowever, I follow +- the new findings about neanderthals X sapiens. And recently, the scientific community has come to an agreement about this whole thing of the two species having indeed mixed. There is still debate of course, but the current line of investigations points to that.\nIn a very simple way: neanderthals had a number of phisical adaptations to their environment; cold climates influenced everything in their life, from their bodies to their culture, their preys etc. Some of those adaptations include broad thoracic chests that point to bigger lung capacity (I am sorry if this is not the correct word, english is not my native language), a thin nasal tunnel to prevent cold from entering the body. It is likely they had bigger hearts too, since overall they seem to have been more capable in terms of athletics. \nIf we are logic, we can extrapolate that, likely, they had to have stronger (or let us say different) immune systems. Because this is something that is linked to our body, ideally it functions in a certain way because our bodies work in a certain way too.\nMore even, other studies have already linked other things to the genome of neanderthals: red/copper hair, diabetes... \nSo, assuming we got mixed, I think it is very natural that once in a while there are \"errors\" occurring. Because we only have leftovers from them, but if one of those leftovers is supposed to depend or work with a certain trait that we, as modern humans, no longer possess, it is doomed to cause issues. \nAnd since only some of us have neanderthal genes, only some of us have rare things too. \nThe more neanderthal one might have, the bigger the chance to have certain disorders like diabetes, Alzheimer, autoimunes. \n\nNeanderthals had adaptations that worked for them in their bodies. By mixing with us, we got bits and pieces, but without the rest, sometimes it causes errors. \nFor us with Behcet, let us imagine we are back in time:\n\nWe are in Eurasia, it is cold. Very cold. We need to hunt megafauna to survive. We live in small groups, but we are not less humans than our cousin sapiens in Africa- we have just as good tools, we catch fish and seafood if given the chance, we take care of our elders and disabled. But it is a very difficult life. Our bodies developed a very very strong immune system due to constant need of \"reparing\" ourselves. We (probably) process fat and sugars in a different way too, because we need to keep them stored + we can really use that boost of energy to hunt and keep warm.\n\n\"Suddenly\" (not at all, it took a lot of time) our cousins from Africa arrive. Maybe we fought for resources, but since we are not that different, we ended up making peace and mixing because anyway we need to avoid consanguinity (something even animals are aware they must). \n\nDue to differences in the minimum number of individuals accounted (this is still under debate), neanderthals are less numerous. So in time, sapiens have a bigger genetic prevalence in the hybrids. \nThere is also the chance, like wolfxdog or horsexdonkey, that our hybrids were not usually fertile. Maybe some rare cases were, and those ended up crossing with sapiens, diluting even more the neanderthal gene. (This is all theory so far, there are many studies agreeing and disagreeing).\n\nIn any case, our hybrids eventually are more sapien like. But still, some, have very strong immune systems. That we no longer need because the climate changed, the landscape, the fauna and flora. But it is still here for some of us. \n\nAs someone with Beh\u00e7et, I also read some articles that point to a connection between the beginning of flares and stress situations. \nCertain prehistoric adaptations were triggered by stress, and this seems to happen in animals too. The lack of food, just to give an example.\nIt makes sense to me, that for some of us, a sudden stress in life can trigger a response from our body that used to be a survival mechanism (that we no longer need). \n\nThis last part is really my opinion after discussing all this that I wrote with some of my friends/colleagues btw. It is just some dot-connecting very theoretical of course. Plus, we still need to know much more about Beh\u00e7et.\n\nOne thing is sure: denisovans and neanderthals also most likely mixed, and Behcet seems to come from the east. \nNeanderthals and sapiens mixed.\nSapiens mixed with denisovans.\nModern humans have different % of neanderthal or denisovan genome, and modern humans, once in a while, have rare stuff going on. And there is still much we do not know or understand about ourselves.\nI think one day, we will find many answers in those ancestors. Thank you for the detailed, thoughtful answer. Though medical/clinical psych is my formal background, evolutionary psychology (and biology, as the two go hand-in-hand) has been a major interest of mine for many years. And everything you have written is consistent with everything I know about the subject. \n\nIf our distant ancestors were anything like us, they stuck their you-know-what is in anything they could. It is not a stretch to believe they mated with other bipeds. After all, modern humans (few, but certainly not zero) like to hump quadrupeds, innanimate objects, and whatever else they come in contact with. \n\nLastly, from my experience/training, I can tell you without a doubt that stressors (of certain types) absolutely can not only increase the severity of existing medical conditions, but in some cases cause them. As an undergrad, my concentration was in medical psychology and I took a class about psychoneuroimmunology - the connection between the mind, nervous system, and immune system. There is plenty of evidence to suggest stress worsens a variety of autoimmune conditions from Crohn's to Lupus to many others. So your theory is absolutely valid. \n\nAgain, thank you for the rapid, detailed response. Be well! Thank you also for your own insight! \nIt is always fascinating to see different sciences combined I think. That is what is great about multidisciplinary approaches.\n\nThank you, and you too be well!", "A new flare or just a cold?     Like i Said in my previous post, my symptoms dissaperead since October. Today, after a day out at the mountain on Saturday I feel like I m catching a cold. I have a headache, my tonsils hurt, my nose is runny and also I have some body aches, mostly on my elbows. This is what I felt when my first behcets type flare began last summer. I do not want my behcets symptoms to come back. Do you think it s just a cold ? If you have mouth or genital ulcers too then it might be an flare, but the runny nose really is not a BD symptom, nor are headaches, but this last one is just based on personal experience.\n\nI think it might just be a common cold or influenza. \n\nAlso did your symptoms disappear after a TNF-alpha inhibitor or steroid treatment? Cause as far as I know those are the only things that can keep BD symptoms under control. I got no treatment, my symptoms lasted from July till the start of october and then dissapered. Genital ulcers lasted just 3 days in July then never happened again. No mouth ulcers, just small nose ulcers once in a while and body aches, knee pain, elbow, wrists, ankles aches and a bad headache that lasted 1 week. Then in September everything started suddenly to fade. A single dr thought I might have behcets, but told me to wait. What scares me is that during those months I had sometimes the feeling in my body of a cold that is about to start. This is what I m feeling now. From my personal experience BD is not just some body aches, it is barely being able to walk due to ankle arthritis, barely being able to eat or talk due to ulcers in the mouth or throat, barely being able to sleep due to epididymitis, almost passing out any time I did a heavier physical activity and then what made me discover it, almost going permanently blind in one eye: it wasnt just a general ache like when you are about to get a cold.\n\nHonestly this does not sound like BD to me, especially since it disappeared like that. As far as I know BD, can stay dormant for many years (in my case I had nothing apart from ulcers for 15 years): some people live up to their 50 with knowing nothing, but then one day something happens that makes it wake up, it might be a strong inflammation like a polmunitis or in women's case maybe giving birth, but once it starts it goes on unless treated.\nTreatments cannot cure from BD they can only keep the symptoms under control and this is why every BD patient is checked up regularly.\n\nTry and get some rest, contact your doctor if symptoms get worse. Not saying that you are fine and should ignore all of it, because if you are feeling unwell then there is something wrong, but your case does not really sound like BD to me. &gt;Also did your symptoms disappear after a TNF-alpha inhibitor or steroid treatment? Cause as far as I know those are the only things that can keep BD symptoms under control.\n\nDo not forget colchicine. It is one of the most effective BS Tx drugs and it acts by multiple means independent of TNF-alpha inhibition. A rapid and pronounced improvement in aphthous oral ulcers (if it happens)  is strongly suggestive of Behcet's. Sure, but while Colchicine is specifically used to treat ulcers, TNF-alpha inhibitors and steroids give a more general effect. You might want to check out these three papers:\n\n Liantinioti G, Argyris AA, Protogerou AD, Vlachoyiannopoulos P. The Role of Colchicine in the Treatment of Autoinflammatory Diseases.

The paper by  Liantinioti et al. provides a nice review of the pharmacology of colchicine in Behcet's. Its therapeutic effects extend beyond oral aphthous ulcers in some patients. The \"in some patients\" qualification,\" unfortunately, also extends to corticosteroids and TNF-alpha inhibitors.

It hurts to sit, walk, eat, etc. Any tips on how to ease the pain or quicken the healing process? Much appreciated \ud83d\udc95 I am so so sorry, I have been there.  It is so awful. I used to have to full the tub up with water and sit in it to pee because it hurt too bad on the toilet depending where the sores are. Trimcinolone, a steroid cream is great topically and does help to ease the pain if you do not already have a prescription. Prednisone has always been my savior. Unfortunately, you will just probably have to get a lot of rest and wait it out \ud83d\ude22 Lots of vasaline downstairs to help with friction. I spread myself when peeing so that there is no contact from urine to ulcers. Ice and heating pad rotating between your legs. I am so sorry :( Idk if it is still prescribed, but I used to use a paste called Apthasol. It was a godsend on all ulcers I had. It did not sting going on and numbed everything for at least 30 minutes. Long enough to eat and pee, however delicately. Thank you so much \ud83d\udc95  No problem! I hope you can get your hands on some, or find relief in some other way. I know it is hell. :( As other mentioned, topical steroids are good. Colchicine pill I think is the main treatment for ulcers but it is better to see a doctor.\n\n\nAs we know every case is diferent.\n\n\n*For me* (male 30) colchicine alone does not help with my ulcers. Only a combination of colchicine and prednisone solves most of my inflamatory and ulcers problems (even genital).\n\n\n( mentions pimecrolimus cream but I never tried and the article is kind of old (2011 with 2009 sources)\n\n( also mention colchicine and pimecrolimus. I finally got refills for every strength of prednisode from 40mg down to 5mg so I can set up a series on my own during really bad flareups.\n\nDepending on your relationships with your doc, that might be an option?\n\nI am on all the usual immune suppresants, but this covid stress, along with all the other stresses that are going on with THAT.. \n\nI had a massive flareup on 10mg of prednisone. That has never happened before. I usually only get them a week to a few months after stopping my 5mg daily dose. Idk if this will be enough if it is really bad, I am also a male, but I use dermaplast for pain and non adhesive gauze to prevent rubbing. Both are on the shelf and relatively cheap. Might give some relief until you can get a better solution. I use Epsom salts dissolved in hot water to sit in..water really quite hot.. twice a day for 20 mins...as well as Lidocaine ointment to help numb..but any kind of ointment to stop the friction. Topical steroids", "Dentists \ud83e\uddb7 What do you guys do about going to the dentist? Every time I go I have to explain Behcets to them and even then it seems hard for them to understand quite how bad it is. When I say that any laceration in my mouth will result in an ulcer I mean it. I was told today that I might need my wisdom teeth out and a root canal and I was wondering if anyone else had experienced this or something similar? What was your healing time like? Any tips? Dental stuff did not bother as much when I was younger, I did not ALWAYS get ulcers back then, today though at 40, every scrape or tiny slip of a tool...\n\nI had to have tooth pulled a little over a year ago, and I ended up with 3 huge ulcers around the socket.\n\nRoot canal, aside from the procedure itself being long, annoying, and nerve wracking, did not cause any kind of flare or anything. That is good to know, thanks!\n\nMy gums are so swollen, and from where the dentist was pulling at my cheek it is swollen up a little :( \nWhat worries me is the injection, because while it does numb the pain during the procedure its so likely to cause a flare afterwards! \nIt sucks so bad because I do not think anyone (apart from those of us with behcets) understands how traumatic it is. I have had no problem with dental work either. If the Behcet\u2019s thing is confusing them maybe you can spell/write it out for them and they can look it up on their own time. But you can simplify it by just talking about the symptoms you experience in your mouth especially the size, number and frequency of your oral ulcers.\nI have personally never had a problem with dental procedures either because it is supposed to be a sterile environment and so I find my body is able to cope. I hate going to the dentist for this reason. I had to have some dental work done a few years back and had to space it out because it caused flares. My dentist was as understanding as she could be, but the techs did not really get it and were not as careful. She did give me something that helped with the swelling of my gums.  I think when I went today the main dentist heard what I said and then immediately looked it up in his office or something because he came back and was like \u201cis this exacerbated by stress\u201d and I was like \u201cboy howdy is it!\u201d \nSometimes it is extra hard to be like \u201cno dude, a new mouthwash is not going to help this problem.\u201d Trying to get people to understand that this is a real medical issue and not just regular canker sores. I will probably have a more in depth discussion with him when I go back for my first filling. Thanks &lt;3 That is what they have told me we will probably have to do. Just space things out because of the healing time.\nToday they said that the scar tissue in my mouth was probably from me grinding my teeth and I had to explain to them that it is from my sores lol \nJust makes me so anxious to go that I usually work myself up into some sort of anxiety attack which does not help with the stress :/ \nThanks for the heads up though! Find a dentist that understands Behcet's. Call around, l finally found a great one , she is younger and up to date on these things. I had three pre-made root canal treated teeth. I had them all taken apart, except for one. because the root canal was chronically inflamed and all my teeth were aching. There was a large source of inflammation. If it were me, I would not make a canal treatment again, I must tell everyone here. I will have the last tooth removed shortly. Take care of your teeth, do not neglect them.", "I am attempting another brain MRI tomorrow. Hopefully I can get through it this time 3 weeks ago, I tried and I felt calm. My heart was not racing and I was not breathing fast, but my eyes started twitching like crazy as soon as the machine started. She told me to take a Xanax and come back. \n\nI have never taken Xanax before. I am nervous to even take it! Ugh I hate this You have got this! For my longer MRIs, I ask for Xanax now. (I have had to get 2.5 hour ones and I just cannot.) for some people it is not the confined space that triggers weirdness, it is the sound. My face and I both insist we feel like our hair is standing on end during ours haha. Yes!!! As soon as the sound started, my body I guess said heck no! My eyes felt like they were going 1000mph! Haha\n\nI hate taking medicine. I am seriously considering rescheduling. I just got my first COVID vaccine on Tuesday and I have got several ulcers now. I am scared the contrast will mess with me! I have had it before, but I have developed a ton of allergies since then. \n\nHahah too much anxiety! The contrast for MRI\u2019s is less likely to cause allergic reactions than the ones for CT\u2019s. I did fine with the MRI dye but not the CT dye. It is weird how the body acts with tongue disease. I cannot wait to get the Covid vaccine. My state is putting me into the category for March 15th...but I actually just got over covid at the end of January so I may have to wait depending on what rheumatology says. \n\nI take 20-25 pills per day. It sucks but it has gotten me used to having to take medicine. Xanax really is not bad. You just get relaxed and sleepy. I take it when I fly or if I have to have a long MRI. What happened to you with the CT contrast?! I had a bad reaction with it too! I wonder if it is got something to do with BD? So many hives haha. I had some throat itching, too so now they do not want to risk it again. I have idiopathic urticaria which is a fancy way of saying my body acts like it needs to get hives and hot red skin that also itches. I take an antihistamine and it does not flare up much anymore. It would sometimes make my lips swell and it happened with strong emotions. I got nervous during a job interview while on antibiotics and my body was like, \u201cswell the lips!\u201d I did not want to explain I had a medical condition and it was before I knew I had the urticaria issue, so I acted like nothing was wrong. By the end of the interview I looked like o had gone and gotten bad fillers, and it was making me kind of lisp. I did not get the job but it is a funny story haha. Yikes!! At least the treatment for that is easy! \n\nWhen I had my contrast, I started dry heaving violently for about 30 seconds. Then I stopped. \n\nLater, I developed a full body rash and fever that lasted a week! It was a total nightmare I do not know if you usually meditate but something that helps me when doing MRIs is meditating, it helps me stay grounded and calm. \nI hope your next experience is better ! I did an MRI yesterday. And a spinal tap. The MRI was nothing, just lots of loud beeping that reminded me of Star Wars. I slept through most of it. \n\nThe spinal tap gave me CRAZY anxiety &amp; I cried before/during/after. \n\nI am a therapist, and any time I have a client struggling with anxiety, I have them ask themselves, \u201cwhat is my fear trying to manipulate me into believing?\u201d, and \u201care my thoughts helpful to me?\u201d \n\nWhat is your concern with the MRI? Like what is the fear Did anything good come of your test results? I suspect I have Behcets and got an MRI and Spinal Tap as well. Neither test seemed to find anything wrong with me\u2026but my condolences for your spinal tap experience\u2026mine was equally horrifying and uncomfortable. 0/10 would never do that test again \ud83d\ude35 Nope everything was normal.

Not sure if it is related to something else or if it is one of the dumb things Behcet\u2019s does. My Dr. did not mention anything when I told her about it either.  If I get any cuts or irritations they may get infected or inflamed easily especially if I do not clean them and keep them dry.  The edges of my fingernails get inflamed really easily.

It was like a miracle drug for the first few months. But it is spiraled down hill since then.\nLast week I began having problems. And bloodwork revealed extremely low vitamin d. When I started taking the vitamins I had a pretty bad flare up. And when I returned to my rheumatologist He added imuran. \n\nThis week I have started having problems breathing. Almost feels like my body is forgetting to breath during the day. Then I gasp for air. A few days of this and now I am having extreme anxiety/panick attacks. 24/7 one after another. Non stop.

They all have just said my breathing problems is hyperventilating and put me on celexa and vistaril as needed.\n\nNow I know celexa takes a while to work. But the vistaril is not doing anything except making me sleepy. Then when I try to sleep I keep waking up gasping for air and then the panic sets in again.\nI am beginning to wonder if the behcets has not affected my brain somehow and they just do not want to accept it or do a brain scan.\n\nAnd the unknown makes it worse. I am debilitated. I need help and feel like I am just getting dismissed.", "Partners suspected behcets Hi! I will try make this as short as I can but may be hard.\n\nDid anyone have a bloody hard time getting diagnosed with this? My partner got diagnosed with arthritis at the age of 14. He had suffered with mouth ulcers on top of that, and he was always told that the mouth ulcers were an allergy to all foods and that there was nothing they could do apart from give him mouthwashes and sprays, which have ultimately resulted in his teeth discolouring etc. Anyway, fast forward a couple years, and at the age of 16/17 he still has the mouth ulcers, still has the arthritis, but now he is suffering from genital ulcers, which they test for herpes etc, with negative result and he is left with the doctors unable to figure out what it is again. So by this time he is suffering with arthritis, mouth ulcers, genital ulcers, inflammation and skin lesions. He is now 24, and he is never been without mouth ulcers, they are not just small ones either, they are huge - his tongue is very badly scarred from this and recently his genitals have flared up badly.\n\nSo me being me, I am research mad, I searched all his symptoms and came up with behcets and I done my load in research. And contacted his GP. He is suffering, so bad, especially when he cannot eat and barely sleep because he is in that much pain. After speaking with 2 GPs, someone eventually takes an interest and is willing to help. I sent him all the information I had gathered and he said he wanted it as he lacked knowledge. He contacted my partners Rheumatologist (who he maybe sees for 5 mins a year) to explain my partners concerns and also the GP himselfs concerns as he is seeing the same red flags! The Rheumatologist is uninterested, said it cannot be this, blah blah blah but when asked to explain how and why, he told my partner to get a second opinion cause he is not interested. (he got his secretary to do this BTW, and he is also been my partners rheumatologist since he was 14 and we think he does not want to admit he is wrong)\nBUT..... He wanted to prescribe him a medication that is commonly used in behcets, like cmon. \n\nSo we did, we asked for a second opinion. We asked for him to be sent to the centre of excellence (we live in Scotland) and we were told that it is not funded for us and that he would have to wait for a new rheumatologist to refer him - he is currently on the waiting list for rheumatology but can take up to a year to 1 year and a half.\n\nI feel so defeated, defeated that I am fighting for him and no one helps, no one is caring about the torture he is going through. Does this sound like behcets?\n\nSorry for the massive post I am 37 and only last year was Bechets brought up. Now I am a year into my 2 year wait for a rheumatologist. But that was pre covid and I expect longer now. Unfortunately this seems to be the way for everyone. Your partner needs to have their GP put them on prednisone either for short term followed by something like colchicine or on prednisone permanently. I am currently taking colchicine and ut is a huge help with the ulcers. But your partner sounds like he needs prednisone right now. I am sorry he is suffering and I am sorry for the helpless feeling you must be having. It has been a nightmare really. Yeah he is already on prednisone and has been on this for many years. The rhuematologist was placing him on colchicine, but when we asked for a second opinion he stopped the prescription. It is a lack of care of their part! He is now on an injection for inflammation he takes once weekly, but he was on this before and did not really help, but he is willing to try anything now! We heard the colchicine has been a lifesaver for most, but when we asked his GP for this prescription we were told no, because he needs to see rheumatologist again. Thank you for replying! It sounds EXACTLY like Behcet. Wtf is going on with his doctors, I had colchicine prescribed to me just because I had mouth ulcers, and I did not even had them permanently, let alone scars because of them. \n\nI suggest you try every GP you can and ask them to prescribe colchicine to him, explain what is going on with the rheumatologist and show the former prescription. Even if they refuse, they might recommand him to a proper specialist, and delays are usually shorter this way (at least in France they are).\n\nIf it can help, I never saw a rheumatologist. I first was prescribed colchicine - and prednisone in case I still had a flare up - at the oral surgery service of a public hospital (which is apparently the same of a stomatology service), where I got an appointment after having recommandation letters by an otorhinolaryngologist and a dentist. The dentist also gave me some numbing cream for my mouth, so at the very least I could eat a bit. I then got prescriptions by a private doctor specialized in internal medicine, and I am now monitored at the internal medecine service of another public hospital.\n\nIn the mean time, tell your partner to stop eating cheese, avoid grease and oil, and to not consume any alcohol ; I noticed it tend to make my ulcers worst, even when I am under colchicine. Also, sparkling water help to relieve the pain. You could try to look for some anti-inflammatory diet, I tend to switch to the WFPB diet whenever I am feeling off.\n\nI can not express how sorry I am he had to endure so much suffering. You are a great partner, and he is very lucky to have you. I am so sorry! That sounds awful and very much like behcets. I started getting genital ulcers at 12 and have had the mouth ulcers my whole life. It took until I was 33 to get a confirmed behcets diagnosis. :( They have given him oral sprays and mouth washes, which btw burns his mouth! Its awful. The pictures I have of the ulcers are horrendous, and I have honestly started taking pictures all the time because it is like they do not believe him. He phoned up the other day because he had ran out of his prednisone and the doctor that was on the other end (who has never dealt with him) told him that his rheumatologist said he did not have behcets. But if the idiot had taken some time out to actually read his notes, he would have seen that his colleagues (another 2 doctors) had written to his rheumatologist (which is no longer his practitioner) saying they have seen the ulcers and they think it is, but still the rheumatologist is uninterested and that is why he is getting a second opinion. The lack of compassionate care kills me!! He has bits missing from his tongue and cheeks because the ulcers get that bad and have scarred awfully. His mouth and tongue are basically disformed and really struggles to talk pretty much everyday and he is living on a soup diet. He has lost so much weight, and they are not doing anything. I have bought him orajel? And that seems to work, short term, but he goes through about 8 bottles very quickly and it is not a long term solution when he is still suffering.\n\nI was considering going private, but for 1 consultation we were told it will be around \u00a3200 - and here in Scotland, there is no specialists unless we go to England. I know it does not seem a lot of money, but when I am a student and he can not work due to all this, the low income really kicks us!\n\nThank you for the advice on the foods etc - we will definitely try this! What is WFPB diet?\n\nThat is so lovely, thank you for saying that. Sometimes I feel like a pest with the doctors etc, but I cannot take the rudeness and lack of compassion towards him. That is so awful. I honestly feel for anyone who is going through this! If he had a diagnosis I just hope that they would then take it serious.\n\nMy partner said his heart goes out to you, would not wish it on anyone. I think when it is such a rare condition, it is a lonely world when there is hardly anyone out there going through the same thing! (or there is and just very under diagnosed) Thank you! I think its both rare and under-diagnosed. There are not very many of us! Its a frustrating illness. I have a prednisolone mouthwash that helps a lot. But be careful, I once was prescribed one called \" fungizone \", and it made it so much worst (like 5 becoming 50 ulcers). This, or they were supposed to help me cicatrized faster, which did not even happen but hurted a lot. \n\n&gt;The lack of compassionate care kills me!!\n\nIt makes me sick too, I cannot even get how they just choose to just... let the patient suffer? Because nothing?! Do not feel bad, you can never be mean enough towards such doctors.\n\nYou could try to contact ( for advices, go to a Behcet facebook's group and ask if anyone have a good doctor to recommand. Or maybe try to find a social health center - this is usually cheaper - to get some guidance, because 200\u00a3 is actually A LOT of money. \n\n( gives lots of information on the WFPB, and recipes. Basically it is avoiding processed food, refined sugar, salt and oil. But you can PM me anytime if you need advices on how and what to eat while having ulcers, I will be happy to help! Was not even aware there was a prednisilone mouthwash! Yeah do not want that! That must have been so painful.\n\nYeah I know. If they took the time to emphasise with you to at least try understand, I would have a lot more respect, but it feels like it is a social power relationship with the doctor - they are the doctor and you are the patient, so they know best! Well, I am sorry to say, he is lived in HIS body for 24 years, and he is the expert on him.\n\nI had contacted behcets UK, and they were very helpful in giving me factsheets etc, which I sent to the doctor and read through. But unfortunately, there was not much else they could do. I did not know about the Facebook groups though, I will look into that.\n\nThat website looks fantastic, I will have a good look through it tomorrow with my partner.\n\nWe honestly appreciate the time and effort you have taken to message back and the offer of PMing you. Its very refreshing to know that you are happy to share your knowledge and I am greatful to individuals like yourself. This is exactly Behcets. So I live in Canada and got my first symptoms around 21 starting with mouth ulcers then genital ulcers, stomach issues, and occasional eye inflammation but more like pink eye. So in my case I did not have a family doctor and would go to the walk in clinic all the time and see a different doc each time. I finally found one who was willing to actually help me and they referred me to the clinics rheumatologist. Unfortunately the guy was a wacko and told me to use peptobismal for my mouth ulcers... like wtf. Anyways that same doctor who referred me gave me some corticosteroid dental paste called Oracort. It is a godsend. Takes away my huge ulcers in 3-4 days instead of a week plus without it. There are also spray versions, is that what your partner was prescribed? So after that I bounced from specialist to specialist, even saw a team of doctors at a Toronto hospital that literally just sat around me in a circle saying they have no idea how to help. Even tried naturopathic doctors, Chinese medicine doctors, you name it. I gave up for a couple years and just researched on my own and was convinced it was Behcets. \n\nThe nice doctor from that clinic that actually helped eventually had his own practice and I managed to get him to be my family doctor so he would keep trying to help and even research things for me, it was really nice. He did not want to say it was Behcets but you could tell he thought it was. Eventually he had an assistant doctor or doctor learning under him (whatever they are called) and she suggested this rheumatologist she knew that had recently graduated and started his own practice. So I got referred there and holy shit finally a guy who understands and takes shit seriously. Finally got diagnosed with Behcets by him and he mentioned some interesting genetic test to take. It does not definitively tell you if you have Behcets but it does point to it if you have the specific gene. It was called HLA-B51. If he could get that test that would be awesome and can help with a diagnosis if the gene is present. However in my case it was not present but looking at all my symptoms my doctor said there is no doubt I have Behcets, especially since I am originally from the Mediterranean area where Behcets is very common. \n\nSo basically what I am trying to say is that if you told my rheumatologist you have all the symptoms your partner has then he would say he no doubt has Behcets. Now with my symptoms I mostly suffer from mouth ulcers and actually never had arthritis so I was given medication that mostly targets that. I have tried colchicine but it did nothing for my symptoms and then my doc tried Dapsone which surprisingly has lessened the severity and healing time of my mouth ulcers. But yeah it took years for someone to actually look into it seriously and what I have noticed is older doctor's do not give a shit. Everyone who did not give a shit or do much were all older, been doing this for decades, type doctors. The only ones who helped are the younger ones who actually look into research and are eager to help people. Sorry this is so long just wanted to share my experience.

I have had Beh\u00e7et\u2019s for over 17 years. In December of 2019 I had to stop Remicade and Methotrexate because my liver enzymes spiked. I have been on prednisone only since then while we wait for my liver enzymes to return to normal. \n\nNaturally I have been pretty much in a huge flare since January. With new symptoms coming up and worsening symptoms I had to see a neurologist who did an MRI and confirmed Neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. \n\nMy problem is how to treat it. A conference with my rheumatologist and gastroenterologist brought me back to Remicade which I just started again after 7 months. Rhuemy decide against loading doses and I am still in this crazy flare that I feel is getting worse. My neuro symptoms feel out of control. \n\nNeurology was just \u201cimpressed\u201d as I am the first patient to have Neuro-Beh\u00e7et and they all treat it like it is a nifty diagnosis.  All my docs belong to a large university associated practice and my rhuemy was with the Vasculitis Clinic at John Hopkins. So on some level they know what they are doing, but once I step out of the rheumatological world the docs all lose their  shit when they see a patient with something this rare. \n\nMy question is what treatments have you been on for the Neuro-Beh\u00e7et? What worked for you, what did not?\n\nMy symptoms for neuro are:\noccipital neuralgia (new)\nMovement disorder (chorea-like)\nAphasia\n\nI have all the typical stuff and cutaneous vasculitis but the neuro symptoms are damn well killing me.  The vasculitis hurts so much and docs are all so scared to give pain meds. I feel like I will go crazy some days with the pain. I am just frustrated. Hello there. I m behcet patient from Turkey. In here we have well experienced doctors. I recommended you contact one of Capa Tip Fakultesi (write like this in google you find) doctors. They will guide u and your doctors as well. God helps us. Thank you. This is so frustrating at times and docs here know nothing (I am in the USA). I also have neuro-behcets - diagnosed 20+ years ago. I feel you - I understand how hard getting the right treatment can be and I am so sorry you are having to face this right now.\n\nTreatments shifted depending on my doctors\u2019 preference - I moved a lot so had to switch doctors a great deal -  but I had excellent results from a combo of leukeran and methotrexate.  It put me into an almost complete remission for many years and got me off the prednisone hamster wheel I was on for years and years.\n\nI had to go through several other drug regimes to find what worked though - and I think it is pretty individual - what worked for me might not be what is right for you .  Just know here are alternatives out there.\n\nI hope you find what works for you - you can reach out to me at any time. Unfortunately, TNF-Alpha inhibitors are the best-researched treatment for neuro-BD (with _excellent_ remission rates). It sounds like it was working for you until your liver tests started getting crazy too. \n\nMethotrexate is notorious for causing liver enzyme abnormalities over time (remember, it is a fairly hardcore chemo drug), while Remicade is much safer for the liver all around. Remicade _does_ have documented cases of liver damage/failure, but it is typically due to hepatitis, infections, or drug-drug interactions. \n\nThere are two major ways to combat methotrexate-induced liver toxicity:\n\n* Folic Acid supplementation ((\n* NAC supplementation ((\n\nAlso, anecdotally, my liver enzymes were trending in the wrong direction on methotrexate+Remicade. My rheumatologist prescribed 1mg daily folic acid + I take 1500mg NAC daily (3 x 500mg) and now my liver enzymes are back to normal. The NAC (n-acetyl-cysteine) is really the lynchpin here - Methotrexate depletes hepatic glutathione reserves over time (creating ROS buildup, leading to cirrhosis), which NAC counteracts without decreasing the efficacy of methotrexate. \n\nI would press your rheumatologist on one of three options: 1) loading dose of Remicade + lower dose methotrexate + including the two supplements above, 2) loading dose of Remicade + switching to azathioprine, or 3) Humira + azathioprine/methotrexate. The options of last resort would be pulsed corticosteroids or interferon treatment. I have noticed most doctors get _very weird_ about spiking liver numbers, despite most hepatologists having fairly easy mitigation strategies for drug-induced liver issues. Thank you! I am creating a list of points to discuss with my team so we can move forward. This is great information. \n\nRemicade never actually put me in remission it just lowered the intensity of my symptoms and prevented new ones. The overall pain was much more manageable and the vasculitis outbreaks were minimal, but still occurring. Hello!\n\nActually I live in Missouri and was diagnosed with Neuro-Behcet\u2019s back in 2013. This all started for me when I was 16 years old in 2006! My condition is VERY severe and my team of physicians at Barnes Jewish Hospital &amp; Washington University School of Medicine Doctor\u2019s, also, have NOT seen anything like this and my current Rheumatologist at MOBAP in STL, is from John Hopkins as well. I have been all over the place and even the Mayo Clinic cannot and will not even pursue helping me because my case is so rare and they do not really know how to treat or what to actually do for me. Remicade did not work for you but Humira has been a godsend. PM me if you want to talk. Humira gave me an intussusception. I warn people about it. Had to have a Small bowel resection after an injection.", "Ethnicity? Does anyone know much about how ethnicity and Behcet\u2019s related? I am mixed (native, black, Irish, Mongolian, Turkish Jewish). It is a long story, but even during slavery and the forced removal of native Americans my white side did not care and just hid their marriages from authorities. So it is very difficult to sort through everything. I am trying to figure out if I need to warn one family line or others, just in case. Beh\u00e7et's disease has a much higher prevalence in people with the allele HLA-B51, which is WAY more present in the areas around the Silk Road. The disease most likely comes from the \"Turkish Jewish\" part of your family. I agree, if someone has it in your family, it is more likely to be those in the Mongolian, Turkish Jewish side!\nWhat you do, like I did, is to warn the family that you have it.\nI left a message on both sides (mom and dad families) explaining what it is etc, so, they know it exists and they are attentive. In my case I am portuguese, so both sides are just as likely to carry the HLA B51. I have it, they checked. All of what has been said is true. So my doctors always sit and have long discussions with me about my heritage. I am white Puerto Rican. I can trace my lineage directly back to Spain around 6 generations ago) and intermixed with Taino. That is it. Still, I am HLA-b51 positive. I have not had the blood test done yet. My mother was diagnosed with it a few years back too. My line is the Turkish Jews that passed through Portugal and then came to the America\u2019s. It is complicated. But my doctors think that in hindsight I may have had Mediterranean fever as a little girl. I was very sick then. I have a genetic heart condition as well that I already had to warn them about and I do not want to scare the family needlessly. But I think I will just warn everyone just in case. I see... Well, I would warn them, just in case. It is still a rare thing after all, and having the HLA B51 does not mean Beh\u00e7et either so... It is more of a precaution really, so they are attentive to possible symptoms. And even, if by chance they end up in the hospital one day with something a bit weird, they tell the doctors that someone of the family has Beh\u00e7et and it might speed up any diagnosis.\nIt is the first thing they asked me when I entered the urgency some weeks ago, and I had never even heard about it. They asked if someone in the family had. So I said no, and in the end I have it. \n\nIn any case, I hope you get better!! Stay safe and happy cake day \ud83c\udf89 It is kind of crazy that we all may be able to link ourselves to a similar group of people. My father is white and I definitely took after him. So the doctors did not consider Behcets because they assumed I was not mixed. Complicated. I do not know where my dad is from, but my mom has Scottish/Irish/British ancestry, and I was born here in Canada. I am assuming my dad who I only met once as a kid had the genes that got me it. That had to be hard as a kid. I am sorry you did not have a good dad around. Do you think he might have been a Turkish? Or did he look \u201cwhite?\u201d It definitely was! He did look \"white\" from what I remember, and I definitely look really white. I am curious now on where his ancestry lies. Oh, I am 1/4 Puerto Rican, and white. My dr was also confused about my heritage.", "I am scheduling an MLD Phalloplasty (FtM) but I experience genital sores I was wondering if there is anyone here who is transgender and has had bottom surgery.

I am very worried myself, the second I go off any meds my sores are back, and theyre definitely in places not conducive to successful phalloplasty I imagine. \n\nFrom my extensive research on the complications of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, I have learned that small wounds have a tendency to ulcerate/indurrate if a Beh\u00e7et\u2019s sufferer has a positive pathergy reaction. (Like myself\u2026 of course \ud83e\udd2c) No wonder my drain sites would not calm down and were super fucking irritated but suspiciously not infected, after my top surgery. However, large wounds are not known to cause problems in Beh\u00e7et\u2019s patients; there is a different immune response to wounds in BD than in other ulcerative diseases, such as Pyoderma gangrenosum, which can cause large and small surgical (and other) wounds to become ulcerated nightmares. \n\nI can provide citations if needed, but I would have to go back through the articles I have found lol So glad to have a brother here. Let us make a super niche yet amazing FtM Behcets bros club \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0f I can only attest to what is been said about large wounds.  I had an open small bowel resection where it feels like they cut me in half. Scar is about 6 inches down my abdomen fully healed. That baby healed smooth and pretty and no problems.

We definitely need more doctors with first hand experience being a patient.", "Severe pain during flare: How do you take care of all-over muscle &amp; joint pain? Standard otc drugs are not helping. I have to be careful with too many corticosteroids due to adverse reactions (severe anger outbursts &amp; memory lapses) I took combination of Tylenol and Advil (liquid bc mentally I felt it worked better). Studies we are done to show these two in combo are as affective as opiods. But I was not able to take them long term (more than a few weeks in a row) so I had to switch to Percocet and asked to up the dose to 7.5 mg /500mg Have you taken Colchicine?  Some people cannot take it due to gastric side affects but I tend to be constitpated a lot so I did not mind it.  Some cannot tolerate it,,,but it helped me IMMENSELY Oh and I also took Celebrex with the Colchicine.   I just started Colchicine and it is already starting to work. Pain level down to a 4 from a 6-7. I also take Cymbalta. I am allergic to opioids/narcotics and Celebrex. I use a combo of heat and a thc medicinal rub at night when it is worse. You can probably try a Hemp based rub with cbd. I also use non-psychoactive cbd in high quantities during a flair and up my vitamin C intake to a minimum 3,000 mg daily. I took the combo of Advil/Tylenol for 8 months (6 months too long) and it worked but I have inflammation in my stomach and esophagus, so do not use that combo long term. Short term can work very well but you have to be consistent in taking it as soon as the next dose is due (I.e every 6 or 8 hours I believe).  Yes colchicine was good to me for a while, about 3 years. I began to flare through over time, and then they tried Imuran. Could not tolerate the nausea and dizziness.\n\nI am on colchicine again now (1.2mg), as a buffer between meds. Not working like it used to. Shame\u2014great drug. \n\n\n\n  Colchicine is great. Unfortunately, the flares became resistant to it. I am on it again now after a few months as a buffer until my TNF inhibitor arrives in the mail. \n\nI have a cannabis oil cartridge on me almost all of the time. Kind Of tight on finances right now, but I am hoping to acquire more asap. \n\n\nI will definitely try the Advil/Tylenol combo. I totally agree with you on the liquid meds! Soo many pills. It becomes worrisome for long-term side effects. \n\nDid it affect your GI tract? I am prone to ibs-like problems.  Not really that I could tell.  The Percocet was probably good because I am super prone to ibs stuff (some of my doctor's still are on the Crohn's boat).  Colchicine was something I also took, but I had trouble getting anything to work, so I just did hot baths a lot, and a lot.  And the pain meds... For months.  Luckily I was able to stop them when it was over without issues. What state do you live in?  Meloxicam is a perscription NSAID that works way better for me than ibuprofen/ otc stuff ever has.\n\nAlso heat/ ice. And getting stoned and watching stand-up comedy, if you are into those things. New York  Yes to all of those things, hahah I take hydrochloroquinine because I could not deal with colchicine. It has helped-- my blood work numbers got better, I have not had many ulcers, overall inflammation is improved. Sometimes I still randomly get horrible joint pain. Celebrex, heat, and rest. What else can you do? I second the stand up comedy recommendation. ", "Has anyone who is currently on Imuran (Azathioprine) tested positive for Covid? Been on Imuran for almost a year now, and have never really had any side effects. Curious as to how the virus and medication interact with one another.

Dont get me wrong iv felt like pure crap but no worse than what a flu would feel like. How are you doing with Imuran? \n\nI have been on it for 47 days now along with 10mg of methotrexate. \n\nCannot really tell if it is working for me yet although it has made me really sensitive to the sun.\n\nAlso, I have not gotten the virus, but it has really made it difficult for me to go out more often :(", "Text below ", "Rising From The Illness - Behcet's Podcast I just wanted to let you all know that I was on a recently episode of Rising From The Illness, a podcast created by a wonderful woman with Behcet's disease. We chat about our mutual diagnosis, the challenges of living with Behcet's, and discuss my Behcet's disease memoir. I will add links below.\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(", "Recent Diagnosis My obgyn referred me to a dermatologist and once they saw me they referred me to rheumatology. Rheumatology said that it is behcets and told me they would review my labs and scheduled me for three weeks from now. They did not prescribe anything and basically told me that nothing will help my oral and vaginal ulcers. I guess I am kind of confused because I have read a lot about people getting prescribed steroids and immunosuppressants but I was not given anything. Has anyone else had an experience like this? If you just had labs done you need a baseline for the inflammation and possibly to see if you are a candidate for immunosuppressants. Otzela is the only meds approved for Bechets and ulcers and that takes a lot of lab work and diagnosis to get approved for insurance. Sadly chronic and rare diseases are a long road of trial and error and testing. Good luck!! Definitely follow up in 3weeks with the rheumatologist after they have had a chance to review your labs.\n\nI would say if your symptoms are recurring then yes you should go on medication.. lots of people start with Colchicine which isnt a steroid nor an immunosuppressant but just an anti inflammatory. From then, monitor symptoms and see if immunosuppressants are necessary. \n\nSteroids can be prescribed in large doses to help ease active flares, and some people have success with long term low dosages of steroids also. \n\nIt is a journey and it takes time to figure out what will work for you... but I would say your rheumatologist would be best to advise and if they say there is nothing you can take for ulcers then I would try to get a second opinion and start looking to build a new team of doctors to help you. \n\nGood luck finding what works for you! I have been given immunosuppressants and steroids and they help a lot! That is strange. Find a new rheumatologist. Or, since this is a rare condition, explain to them what you know. Many do not have experience with this. In the mean time buy Dermaplast from CVS for the ulcers down below. I use that and it helps a lot! I am a male btw. But my wife used it after child birth. Should ease some pain. I do not know your other symptoms &amp; that plays a big part. but I met my rheumatologist on 40mg steroids a day..&amp; he wanted me off them to better diagnose me. It took months of waiting to get an appointment with him which was why by the time he met me I was sick enough that I needed the high dose steroids. He said Steroids mask a lot symptoms. And immunosuppressants (like imuran) were not put on the table until lots a lots of testing as side effects are something to consider. He first prescribed colchicine and uses steroids as needed once I was properly diagnosed. Still on colchicine 1.8mg along with imuran and steroids to help bad flares. Just takes time unfortunately . Be well :) but now all I have to do is send a message to my nurse (she is an angel) and they refill my steroids right away.  I think it is good for them to be thorough since it is a very rare and hard disease to diagnose. Made me feel more comfortable when all was said and done.\n\nEdit:\nI will say I find it odd to diagnose you and not offer meds. My rheumatologist made it clear it was on the table but he was not labeling me with it until he did all the necessary work up. My other drs suspected it like by primary and obgyn but they said that is not their specialty. i was put on colchicine at first which helped but became less effective over time. my doc then added hydroxychloroquine to take with the colchicine. that worked well for about 5 few years until my behcets started getting more aggressive. when i would have bad flare ups over that time i would be put on a tapered dose of prednisone, but tried to avoid using steroids because while they can work wonders, they are not great for you. i am currently on Humira, which is an injection, along with colchicine and i am doing pretty well. i now have very few oral ulcer flare ups and luckily have not had genital ones for about a year now. if you are experiencing pain from genital ulcers i would absolutely suggest asking your doc about lidocaine 2% jelly or lidocaine/prilocaine cream (this one stings a bit but i find it numbs the area better) to apply to the sores. it helps me immensely during flare ups. i find that there is not a whole lot to do to help with oral ulcers because saliva will wash it away but i personally use maximum strength liquid Anbesol so i can eat. I have tried oral lidocaine viscous but was not crazy about it, although it may work better for you. if you are suffering from this and your doc continues to refuse to give you anything i would also suggest getting a second opinion. unfortunately many doctors are not too familiar with this disease and finding a knowledgeable doctor can make all the difference. best of luck!!", "Numb legs I am in the middle of a crisis and almost my entire left leg plus part of my right leg feels numb. Should I worry?", "Beh\u00e7et Tracking App Hi everybody,\n\nI am a software engineer taking online coursers, and I need to make a digital solution (webpage, app). I was thinking of doing an app that helps you track your symptoms, just like those Menstruation apps. I was wondering if this is something beh\u00e7et patients would use? I would like to know your opinion. I definitely would use to help my doctors understand my symptoms with regard to medication. I can see this being especially useful when changing/altering meds and/or documenting when a regimen stops working. \n\nAs for medications, i would need an area that allows for infusions vs just daily meds. Plus the occasional prednisone bolus. Hospitalizations, urgent care, and doc appointments would be helpful. \n\nAlso, an area to list all of my doctors and their information. An area for procedures done and when. I do not know how in-depth this app would be but this is some of my wish list. It is really interesting your wish list. I really want to know what Beh\u00e7et patients need, because it is for all of us, so thank you for your input! It helps me a lot ! :) If use it. My symptoms are cyclical with my treatment (ivig) and it would help me know how to schedule events around my good days and bad days. I can also check random bad days and good days against my good app. They have health tracking apps but having Behcet\u2019s is sort of complicated, and having neurological issues with it is even more frustrating. I think this is a great idea. I have been using Google Forms to log any random pains that comes up since it will log my date time, but an app can add so much more capabilities and make it much easier to do so. Yes for infusion tracking! It is so hard tracking monthly infusions against symptoms or explaining my meds sometimes because I get infusions two consecutive days each month. I have been looking for this! It would be really cool. This would be great. Not sure how feasible..but perhaps a way to note diet changes so we can find triggers related to diet and symptoms that may crop up.  E.g. if I note I have woken up to ulcers or any other symptom.. I should be able to \"go back\" a few days and input notable dietary changes..\n\nPerhaps if there were just drop down menus that you could select whether you ate something different like sugars, gluten, dairy, etc. Would be interesting to be able to note? \n\nOther variants like exercise or sleep tracking could also be useful for us to see where correlations might exist over time. Just an idea! As for symptom tracking the standard Beh\u00e7et Symptoms being hot buttons but being able to add or pick more rare symptoms. Ex  I have neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s so symptom tracking for this would not normally be listed. \n\nPlus severity of symptoms. Being able to identify mild oral sores vs a severe breakout. \n\nAnd THANK YOU! Anything that helps is always appreciated. I currently use FlareDown on iOS for symptom tracking. While it has all of the features I want, it is a bit cumbersome to navigate and use. It would be great to have a tracking solution that is more intuitive and easier to use; better/cleaner user interface. I am sorry, I don\u00b4t know what you mean for infusions? \n\nI have only known Colchicine... So, I would like to know more about infusions so I can consider this and know how to display it It would be nice to add more symptoms that the ones listed? \n\nAnd to be able to capture if it was mild or severe, it is really important ! \n\nThank you for your comment :) How do you keep track of your sleep? Through a smart watch or just how many hours of sleep you get?\n\nIn my experience, diet is a major trigger.. \n\nThanks for the input What is the name of the app you currently use? is it \"my good app\"? Yes, I know, I did not find an app related to tracking symptoms :( :o what do you usually register on your forms?\n\nand yes, it would be more practical I did not know about this app, let me see more in depth its functions.. so, not so user friendly On my google form, it has:\n \n* Where am i hurting with mutli-select checkboxes of different areas of my body. \n* How long it is been hurting \n* Short description of pain\n* If i was doing anything specific before the pain occurred \n* and if so, what i was doing.\n\nThis was just information for me to help collect to see if there was anything specific that was triggering to the pains that I would get. \n\nAfter a few days, it got VERY cumbersome to open up Chrome in my phone and fill this out :( oh okay.. a lot of detailed information\nThanks for telling me, yes, chrome on phones can be very unpractical I do not use an app anymore I just track calories with \u201cLose It.\u201d I used to track my period and note symptoms there but I started birth control and do not worry about it anymore haha. Some people get chemo infusions, or other drugs like methotrexate, etc. I am personally receiving IVIG and I know another patient who does plasma exchange. I go in two days per month and get drugs through a port in my chest. oh, okay, I understand now.. thanks for explaining oh, I see, thank you ! I dont use a device for tracking but I can tell when I have slept poorly or not enough (I have children). \n\nDiet is huge! oh okay, so you would like to register the quality of sleep? So I am thinking it is not that you would use this app for sleep tracking so much as generally being able to go back a day or two and insert some sort of note (perhaps from a drop down menu..or maybe one can just type it in oneself) where you say to yourself  \"hmm I woke up with X symptoms today...what was different over the past couple of days? Diet..alcohol...sleep...mood..Oh yeah! I only got 4 hours the other night..let me make a note of that here\" so more of a way to NOTE (with prompts) all possible relevant triggers for flare ups than actually expecting the software to track it specifically. \n\nDiet - you could select the diet option and specify what you ate differently\n\nSleep - you could select the sleep option and specify quality of sleep, or hours, on specific days\n\nExercise - you could select the exercise option and specify if you worked out that day (or tried a different workout)\n\nMedication - you might select this if you changed medications, forgot a dose, got sick for non BD related illness and are on antibiotics for example..\n\nI guess just options in a calendar that allow you keep track of changes to your normal routine that might help us visualize breaks in the pattern and correlate those to the appearance of flare up symptoms. Over time, we might be better able to notice how certain disruptions in a routine can adversely affect us. Great idea, I have been looking for one I like for a while and just go back to notes. As well as the check box approach to symptoms, could you also have a note mode (maybe with some presuggested symptoms as a extra :p) where it will just accept a note for that day without any checkboxes or extra input. It is just on my worse days I do not have the energy to spent the time going through everything the current apps ask for. But with a little note I will usually go back when I am feeling better to add more details. Good luck as well! A good app to use would be notion , very practical Also a combination of notion with excel would help , I would ask the questions ( how long did the flare stayed , scale the pain , how long did it heal , etc... ) and put them in notion and divide them by each month the same way , and in excel I only have to write when a specific symptom appears and disappears, and model them with a basic graph and look for patterns", "Which location of oral ulcers is THE WORST in your personal opinion?

Please just leave my poor lil tongue alone! :\u2019-( I will take the tongue ones any day compared to what i have going right now, deep on my upper soft pallet on the right side of my throat. I cannot see it, but i know its huge.\n\nSoft pallet ones though.. any surface thing involved in the mechanical action of swallowing. The tongue ones are annoying as hell, but back of the throat ones make my soul cry. For me it would be on the uvula, its an extremely sensitive part of the mouth/throat. Sneezing with one genuinely felt like being stabbed in my throat, like legit 10/10 pain. Just under the tongue. Same, side of the tongue. I have had one in my throat, tip of the tongue pallet, pretty much anywhere, but none was as bad as the side of the tongue. Absolute nightmare. I remember pre-diagnosis/meds having quite a few back there pretty regularly... always felt like intense strep or like I was swallowing shards of glass. \n\nI am with you, that is a horrible location! Ones under the back of your tongue that rest where you swallow :') This..I cannot eat anything when those happen. And even talking hurts \ud83d\ude29 nothing compares places that throat tongue starting point. that is the real pain. Agreed, though I have one on my molar currently that is messing with the nerves in my teeth something fierce. Oh... that is so unfortunate The one I hated the most so far is behind the lips. I have braces, so everytime I open and close my mouth (smiling, eating, talking) they rub in the ulcers and it is so painful. Nooooo not braces. Oh, I really feel for you! Oh my goodness. That might be the ONLY spot I have never be graced with an ulcer. Same. Agreed. 10/10. It is my worst. Just breathing made the uvula move n me shutter in pain. And that is not even the swallow part. Evil. 11/10 Uvula all the way. I could show you the pic but it is horrifying. I am glad I am not alone on that, not many people are going to understand the straight up misery of basically having an open wound on one of the most sensitive and unavoidable parts of your mouth/throat lol", "Imuran causing insect bites to react more? I was wondering if any of you experienced an increase of allergic reactions, in particular, to insect bites?\nIt is been one year now that I take imuran each day. I take 100mg.\nI never had issues with it so far.\nAnd, I never never in my life had allergies. In fact, I used to be proud of the fact that no bug (from where I live at least) could do anything. Mosquito, flea (always had lots of pets), even bees. I was very exposed to those as a young kid, and over time I simply stopped having reactions. No itching, nothing.\nSuddenly now, I noticed it is not the case anymore.\nI have big reactions, to the point of mosquito bites getting big and even a somehow hard on touch. And then it bruises just slightly, because of course I scratch. They have texture and all.... For a moment I even though it was bedbugs, but it is not, I checked very well and in any case I usually vaccum the mattress once per month, plus change the bedsheets often. We are full of mosquitos, I have seen them on me, so it really is that.\nBut I searched on the net and did not find anything about this.\nDoes anyone notice similar stuff? Even to other things maybe?\n\nStay safe! I am not on imuran nor have I ever been. However I can tell you I react quite differently then I used to when I get mosquito bites. Possibly its a behcets symptom rather then a drug interaction? \n\nWhat used to be just a small bump and some minor itchiness when I was younger has turned into nickel and quarter size welts when mosquitos bite me. Instead of just itching like they once use to they almost burn instead.\n\nI have asked about this to my rheumatologist but did not really get a response so I would be interested if others have experienced the same. It is quite possible too...\nTruth is, before I was diagnosed, with my doctor we made the maths, and my first symptoms of Beh\u00e7ets started 2 years ago, and it matches perfectly with an incident I had with a spider bite during an archaeological excavation.\nI reacted very bad, my leg had a lump of the size of a tennis ball on the thigh and I could not walk straight.\nSince that day, stuff strated to happen: after two weeks I had genital ulcers for the first time, my skin started to have sort of acne- violent one, mouth ulcers etc.\nBut each time there was an explanation. The ulcers they said it was either a reaction to the spider itself, or, to the amount of drugs I took for it. And so on, until last year when Beh\u00e7ets have me meningitis and they made tests in the hospital.\n\nSo maybe you are onto something there when you say it could be Beh\u00e7ets!\n\nI will have an appointment soon with my rheumatologist, so I will ask. Funny enough I had a similar issue with a black wasp where it swelled up my elbow pretty bad.\n\nHowever it was not until years later that I had some sort of stomach bug or infection that wouldnt go away for well over a week and they put me on antibiotics. This is when ally symptoms went crazy. Interesting. I have been on azathioprine (Imuran) for 6 years now (200 mg/day) and I have never noticed that. And I am outside getting chomped by mosquitos quite often. But, in theory, it is possible it is the Imuran causing it for you. I have heard of kind of similar weird things happening to people either after they got C19 or the vaccine, unusual immune reactions. Dietary changes can do it to. Lots of things. So, it might be the Imuran, or it might be something else. I know that is not really helpful but it is honest lol I took the 3 doses of Pfizer, but this started already before, so I do not think it is that either...\nAnd as far as I know, I did not have covid.\nNo dietary changes.\n\nThank you for your reply :) I have noticed since being on humira/Remicade &amp; azathioprine I do not heal quickly at all and even a scratch turns into a scar that I notice. Mosquito bites are included in that I have been allergic to pollen, antibiotics and dust for several months. I have finally been in covid and now I am using an inhaler. I have been using imuran for 1.5 years. I do not notice anything regarding the healing speed of injuries, I always healed fast and so far that did not change. When I was taking aspirin yes, but not anymore now that I only take the Imuran. \nBut mosquito bites....... I get big lumps and it even bruises after. When you say you have been in COVID, you mean you were sick with it? Is that why you use the inhaler now?\nOtherwise, how was your recovery? Did you take or will take the vaccine? \n(Sorry this is off the topic, but now I am curious!) my english so bad im sorry. im using google translate. I have been sick of covid, yes it is true. I use a corticosteroid inhaler. My allergies had started earlier and this added to it. I did not experience any beh\u00e7et symptoms during this covid. The inhalation treatment will last for 1 month. a temporary situation. I am in Turkey. I had two sinovac and one biontech vaccines. I would like to have my second dose of Biontech after these troubles have passed. Do not worry, it is fine your English! It is not my first language either :)\nI see... I wish you a fast recovery then! Good luck! thanks :) Yes! It is actually a pathergy response which is hallmark of Bechets. My dermatologist explained it to me because I have had the same issue recently. It makes sense. Funny enough they have never done the pathergy test with me. Although I frequently get little cuts and scrapes from work, but they do not seem to over react with small cuts. \n\nI attract mosquitos pretty heavily though. When they are in high numbers I cannot even be outside, 5 mins and I will be covered in burning welts.", "Behcets Ulcers outbreak Mouth/Genitals Does anyone get ulcers on testicular area? It is making my life really hard Yeah it was actually the symptom that pushed me to go to the doctor since it hurt so bad. Honestly the only advice i can give you is lots of loose cloth, ibuprofen, and kneel instead of sitting. Thanks mate Can you recommend me any sort of ointment to stop the pain/spread? My doctor gave me a lidocain based cream (not sure what the official name is). For me personally, cutting sugar and caffeine, as well as alcohol if you drink, from your diet as much as possible will a help a bunch. Really removing any inflammatory foods will help. ( It is a little ghetto, but the main thing is to keep the ulcers dry by covering them so they can actually heal so I used small patches of paper towel with scotch tape. \n\nThe thing with bandaids was that 1, they had limited absorption so you would need more changing that was less effective and 2, the adhesive itself was too strong and would lead irritate my skin, leading to more ulcers. \n\nThose medical bandage wraps would end up adhering to the wounds as they dried so that was not really an option for me either.\n\nBest of luck to you. This same thing pushed me to go to the hospital which got me diagnosed with Chron's and Pyoderma Gangrenosum. I have started to suspect recently that I was misdiagnosed and I actually have Neuro Behcet's. There is a cream called Kenalog (Triamcinolone) that I have used on ulcers in the past too stop them becoming full on soars and it works well. It is designed for mouth ulcers but I have also used it on ulcers on my testicles without issue. Of course you should see your doctor before trying any medication but this is over the counter stuff. It seems even if I am not misdiagnosed the stuff that works on Pyoderma Gangrenosum ulcers will work with Behcet's as the treatment is the same.\n\nSorry if this was no help I just stumbled on this subreddit today. I also use Triamcinolone, called Oracort here in Canada. Doctor prescribed it for my mouth and genital sores inbtwn flares or as follow-up to Prednisone during a flare . \n\nIf I catch them early with Oracort, it turns the sores around in about 2 days. I use it right before bed because the texture is pasty-grainy and kind of awful. But if it works, it works!", "Behcet disease and gut dysbiosis : did you already try prebiotics or probiotics ? Yashan Bu 2021 :\n\nBy comparing the fecal microbiota of 22 Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease patients with that of 16 healthy co-habiting controls, it was found that the genera Roseburia and Subdoligranulum were in lower abundance in the fecal microbiota of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease patients. Researchers found, for the first time, consistent and specific changes in the microbiome profile in patients with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. Furthermore, a significant reduction of gut microbial butyrate production was detected in Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease patients, which in turn may account for the reduction in regulatory T cell (Treg) responses and activation of T-effector responses.\n\nButyrate is a fatty acid essential in the promotion of Treg cell differentiation. From published studies, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) producing T-lymphocytes are thought to act as the main effector cells, together with neutrophils, in the pathogenesis of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease.\n\n**Therefore, gut dysbiosis and decreased butyrate production in Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease may play a role in disease pathogenesis by directly causing dysregulation of T-cell responses.** This is very interesting. But would any type of probiotics help or just some specific ones would be more effective ? At the moment, it is impossible to say for a specific probiotic because we need further studies.\n\nBut prebiotics like inulin or fructo oligo saccharides (FOS) can promote good bacteria (which product butyrate and reduce inflammation). \n\nIn addition, probiotics like Lactobacillus are widely used and safe and could help to reduce intestinal  permeability.\n\nFor Behcet disease,  symptoms can appaear following you eat cheese, gluten, lactose... that disrupt the gut. So improve the diet and heal the gut microbiota could maybe help. Yes that is what I assumed from reading the paper. More research is needed.  \n\nThanks I did not  know about those prebiotics, I only knew about lactobacillus.\nI have noticed for me that lactose, gluten and sugar increase the pain during  a flair and I have more stomachache.  I might give probiotics a try.", "New symptoms - Behcets related? The moment I think everything is fine (joint and gastrointestinal pain controlled with colchicine) I suddenly have random symptoms that I am not sure what they are.  Has anyone had the following?\n\n1. Double Vision\n2. Headaches that continue through the night\n3. Eyes not being able to focus\n4. Hands turning red and feel like they are burning\n5. Cheek spasm\n6. Increased fatigue\n7. Inside of thighs going numb\n8. Decreased bladder control\n9. Massively increased anger and irritability\n\nAll happening randomly in the last 2-4 weeks.  Have an appointment with my PCP tomorrow but this seems like a random list of problems likely not connected right? Are you on anything besides colchicine? \n\nDouble vision and eye trouble can constitute an immediate visit, especially if you believe it could be iritis.  Are your eyes discolored ? Eyes problems might be connected as Beh\u00e7et's does affect them. Increased fatigue is for sure a symptom of Beh\u00e7et's.\nAs for the others I honestly do not know. I have always had double vision, but if it just started spontaneously for you I would definitely recommend you visit your doctor. \n\nMy double vision gets much worse (harder to make a single vision even when aware of it) when I am exhausted. Are you particularly lacking in sleep or any other changes to your usual routine? This sounds like Colchicine toxicity. There are certain genetic markers or drug combos that do not mix well with colchicine, which leads to a mild form of toxicity - it can look a lot like the above symptoms. ( Your PCP should run the following tests: complete blood count (CBC), liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and kidney function (creatine kinase). Hopefully everything comes back OK, but those tests should be pretty definitive around how your body is responding to the drug. I had  2 and 6 mostly for headache I take otc nsaids.", "Mental health and Behcet's I imagine I am not the only one who has thoughts like this, but how many of you guys have a purely mental struggle related with behcet's?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt times I just find myself so frustrated at the sores, at the loss of mobility, the inability to have a regular exercise schedule. I feel betrayed by my body, which decides to self-sabotage for no discernible reason over and over. \n\nI feel gross. I was already struggling with thoughts like this before lesions formed on my scrotum, and the pain brings them constantly to mind. Sometimes I feel like I have an STD, despite not having been sexually active in a long time. I have a hard time even picturing being with someone these days.\n\nThe worst is how much I find myself wistfully thinking back to before this manifested (or at least when it was limited to oral sores). To think of all those stretches of time when I was super lazy and sedentary when there was nothing restricting my movement. I have a severe case of \"looking back\" syndrome or whatever you want to call it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt sucks, and I find it hard to talk about with anyone I know. Sorry for the rant this became, not sure what I am going for with this post Though I have been more-or-less stable and healthy (mentally) for years, I experienced crippling anxiety and suicidal depression - much of it directly related to Behcet's - for over a decade. I actually wrote up a piece about this if you are interested: ( My mental health tanks when I have an episode and I turn into a cranky old man (I am 26 and have been diagnosed at 18).\n\nI do my absolute best to not let it rule my life and then it just pops up and I am left absolutely out of it, sore and fatigued, having to put what ever I read going to do on the back burner for a few days. I was diagnosed at 10, so the first decade of my diagnosis was not really mental health focused. I think - especially when getting diagnosed at a younger age - the physical ailments \"outweigh\" the mental in importance. Now, in the end of my 2nd decade of diagnosis (29), I am struggling with depression and anxiety in such an immense way; bursts of tears and stress throughout the day, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, exhaustion at never being able to do anything right - I wish this had been a bigger focus in the first decade of my Behcets life, compared to just now in the second decade :(\n\nyou are not alone friend. I was diagnosed at the start of the pandemic. I remember being happy for a diagnosis thinking I would get treatment and be better. The whole process has been a pain in the crotch. Autoimmune diseases are a bitch to treat. I love my rheumatologist because he is given me hope. \n\n\nHowever, I am slowly coming to terms that I will live the rest of my life in chronic pain. The joint pain is often worse than the ulcers on my labia. I am 29 but I feel like I am 89. I keep getting costochondritis and it is actually making me consider getting a breast reduction to see if having less weight on my chest would help with the pain. \n\nMy therapist has been with me through my diagnosis and treatment and he has even recommended that I read up on people who have chronic pain to try to not feel so alone. It is upsetting, but I have found help in this community \u2764 Navigating relationships, relationships of all kinds, from professional to familial to intimate to varying levels of friendships, is difficult. I used to isolate when it came to flare ups. I am exhausted and I know people want to be there for support, but the truth is, it is just awkward. No one knows what to say, and I do not know what to say to make them feel better too. Entering back into the workforce after an episode of absence due to a flare is tough. Everyone is nice, and understanding, and supportive-of course how could they not? But I still hate feeling so defined by the one aspect of myself I cannot change. I do not want other people to see me in that state.\nBut after 9 years post diagnosis, I have an amazing partner who helps me far more than I ever wanted to allow. You need a support system, even if it is just one person you can trust. Be vulnerable, people can surprise you in the best of ways. I am sorry to hear that about your past struggles. Thank you for sharing, I will read this immediately\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI read it, it seems very helpful. I am going to bookmark it and return to it. I tried keeping a journal and did well at first, but now I cannot write more than a few words every few days It really is like that. Right now I am trying to do the same and not let it affect me outside of flares, but it is always at the back of my mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis current flare is a succession of symptoms over more than a month, and it started after one of my best mental health days. I had just finished a run at sunrise, I felt great, the weather was nice, and then I felt it starting right there. 2 steps forward 3 steps back Thank you. The way I see it, everything I have been through has made me who I am today - and I am okay with that person. I have learned from my struggles and grown from them, so I do not feel sorry for myself. That being said, I never want to go through anything like what I went through in my teens and 20s ever again lol. I hope you like the article.\n\nedit: I am glad you found it helpful :) Wow I cannot imagine struggling for Behcet's for so long, I am lucky to have had it start in my twenties. I am sorry to hear that you are dealing with so much, I hope thing get better soon, for all of us here. I am sorry to hear about the joint pain, I have been lucky to have mostly avoided that symptom. It is ulcers and weird calf clamping for me so far, alongside random skin stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is good that you have a good rheumatologist. I think that is what I am missing, the local ones know nothing of behcets and it costs me hundreds out of pocket for each visit. I have very little hope in that regard, I think I will seek out an expert further away going forward I am so happy to hear that you have good support! It makes all the difference\n\nI think that is one of my biggest stumbling blocks. My symptoms started around the same time my closest friend distanced herself from me, among other smaller things. Both blows happening at once just devastated me. \n\nNow whenever I feel awful about behcets I wish I had a close friend to speak too, and likewise when I feel lonely and try to look forward to making new relationships after the pandemic, the thought of behcets making me limp or keeping me immobile weighs me down.\n\nI feel like I am stuck in a checkmate If I were you, I would start calling around and asking offices if they have anyone who is familiar with Behcets. Or ask your regular doctor if they know anyone who is familiar enough with it to provide good treatment! I know it feels like that, but it is not check mate. We all have a choice to make, and unfortunately for us, the right choice is the harder of the options. I remember being so frustrated at my own body, because it seemed no matter how much effort I put in, it would never be right. So, in an act of immature rebellion, I started pushing my physical limits\u2014never wanting to admit there is something I could not do because of my diagnosis. Of course this is not sustainable and I spent years trudging through mud of my life that I had put there. Your diagnosis is hard, but it is not your definition. Sometimes it is debilitating, other times it is inspiring. I hope you can find some peace, reach out if you ever want to talk Behcets stuff. Not a lot of people know about it, so I am always happy to openly discuss it. Yes to all of this. Today especially with it being Behcets awareness day. I am just passed that I missed out on a normal life. I was diagnosed at 18 after over a decade of symptoms and am 43 now. For me it is the loss of all I could have had but never was able to. I never finished college or was able to work regularly. We do not own a home or have a savings because most of our money is spent on doctors. I am lucky to have a wonderful spouse who takes good care of me and we met in high school so he has been on this journey with me through everything. I wish they had more mental health specialists is chronic illness. Its hard knowing you will not get better. I am sorry to hear that, but I am happy that you have a great and supportive partner! It is definitely rough, today I cannot walk normally and I am just lying in bed, hoping things will get better My biggest struggle is coming to terms with the fact that my energy is too low to have a normal career. I am an extrovert who feels stuck working from home. It is lucky that my husband and I can afford for me to not work, but also...it sucks. I would like to see a therapist about it.\n\nI also have a hunch that my periodic serious, diagnosed depression is at least somewhat related to inflammation. Seeing a therapist can definitely be a big help, I recommend it. They can help you sort through your feelings and mental state and maybe you will find a job that works", "Do you guys get acne/pimples as well with your flare ups? I do my eyes also get super inflamed. I have had sensitive eyes ever since i was a child, they would get irritated after a day at the beach so i always have to protect them now. Yes, I get lesions/foliculitis. They look like pimples. I get them on my face and on my body. Hope this helps. Best in health to you. :) Yes. Chest and back mostly and never had chest and back acne even during teenage years. However, been on Humira for a few years now and almost none since. It is truly been life changing for me. Yes all the time! Yes on my face! They are super painful and itchy sometimes, and they leave scars but I am hoping they will fade.\n\nHave you found anything that helps them? I have periodontal dermatitis, which are like tiny pimples around my mouth/nose. It gets worse with stress and flair ups. I would say to see a dermatologist, best bet for treating the skin issues. Best of luck! On my scalp I notice I get them at least once a month. I think its hormonal but now I know it is because of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s.. Then during my most recent flare up (the worst I ever got in my life) I had this one huge painful pimple thing on my back it was literally huge... I felt it growing as I felt sicker and sicker...disgusting.", "Possible bechets, anyone with recurrent fevers? So my doctor mentioned bechets. I got bloodwork done for a genetical marker, still waiting for that result \n\nI have had mouth sores all my life, pretty badly. I also struggle with intense fatigue, joint pain, abdominal pain and fevers. When i look into bechets myself i dont see anything about fevers, so i was wondering if fevers is a common thing with bechets. I have them on and off for weeks at a time. I do not think fever is very common with Behcets. The thing I have learned in my adventures in autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases is that, in some sense, it does not matter, because a lot of the same treatments are used, and a lot of the treatment is done empirically (ie, let us try X, if that does not work, try Y). I had mouth lesions as a kid but not so much now, but I do (or did) get fevers like yours, that could last for weeks. I also have blood clots. Nobody is quite sure exactly what it is - possibly a vascular Behcets, maybe something else. Prednisone worked for me to control fever attacks, though now I am on colchicine which seems to prevent them altogether. If it stops working I will probably move to azathioprine, which is used to treat a whole host of autoimmune/autoinflamatory conditions including behcets.\n\nFevers + abdominal pain could also be FMF (familial Mediterranean syndrome) which there is a genetic test for, but is also treated with colchicine as a first line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBTW there are large and fairly active fbook groups for both Autoinflammatory disease and Behcets. For whatever reason the reddit groups never get much traction. Yes. The majority of my flares are VERY acute and always start with a fever, which contributed to a year of thinking it was actually herpes. FWIW one doctor thought Eppstein Barr virus may have been the original trigger for me and that it may even be EBV reactivation happening. There are several autoimmune conditions with similar symptoms but also a lot of variation from person to person so it is hard to get a diagnosis for any of them, but a lot of tests can rule out other potential causes and most likely, they will focus on symptom management for any of those so regardless of what it is, track your symptoms and ask for help when you need it. In my experience, doctors do not know what to do other than Rx to control symptoms. If you have abdominal pain, you might ask about an endoscopy YES.  It sucks ass.  I have been getting recurrent oral sores for years now but only about 2-3 years ago did I begin to notice that I was getting fevers *all the time*.  I missed a lot of work and they thought I was full of BS because I was having mild-moderate fevers like once a month.  They always come right around the same time as one or multiple mouth sores, and go away when the sores go away.  My parents thought I had some weird ibuprofen addiction because I needed it all the time.  At one point it felt like I continuously had a fever that would last the whole winter.  Always got told to take more vitamin C and drink more fluids.  It felt so good to find out that there is actually a somewhat understood pathology for why I felt so crappy for years.  And the meds are actually working! I always get random low grade fevers. I do not think it is uncommon with autoimmune issues Yep. Usually at the beginning of a flare", "First Avsola (infliximab-axxq) infusion!  Shits good.

Yeah, I went in to urgent care and had some tests done but everything was normal on the tests yet I keep dropping things and even falling sometimes Do you know what tests? If your inflammation markers, things like CRP and ESR, are high, that could indicate your symptoms are Behcet's related - but it is not definitive. \n\nAnd what about medications? Dizziness, nausea, and vertigo are both common side effects of many meds used to treat Behcet's. For example, two meds I am on - Eliquis and azathioprine - can both cause nausea. Though this side effect got better with time, it still hits me every once in a while. Another med I am on, baclofen, can sometimes cause dizziness. So, if you are on any meds, they could be playing a role. \n\nLastly, if you are someplace hot like me (Boston has been scorching for several days), heat and dehydration can cause nausea and dizziness. Are you getting enough water and doing your best to keep cool?\n\nThose are just a few thoughts.

Will be happy to share what he says. :) Hi BD Zebras! :) Just met with my Rheumatologist and wanted to share his thoughts on COVID 19, as well as strategies their office used to reduce exposure of patients. During my visit, my doctor requested I attend by myself and reschedule if I had any symptoms of: cough, fever, etc. I signed in as I usually would, but then waited on my car until the nurse called my phone and requested me to come in.  Rheumatologist usually looks at my hands and throat, but I emailed him some pics he could look at instead of him getting up on my space. I am on methotrexate,  colchicine and prednisone daily; he explained that I am autoimmune suppressed, so I am at higher risk of infection period. He said although he did not know how COVID 19 would interact/affect my BD, however regardless if I become symptomatic for the virus I would have to stop my methotrexate for at least 2 weeks and needed to be tested immediately. He said that my area would most likely reach have a wave of cases in the next 4-6 weeks (in SE, USA), so to continue social distancing, washing hands,.etc. He also mentioned some cases in China where patients diagnosed with Lupus and treated with Plaquenil did not get COVID 19; some BD patients are treated with this drug. He also mentioned another autoimmune suppressant drug that us promising in treating the virus, it affects IL-6. Also, if you do have an N-95 mask it can be reused by putting it in the oven at 158F for 30 minutes (research according to Stanford University). \n\nHope this helps. Best to all you of zebras! Cheering you on in our fight. Stay safe and stay healthy!\n\n#becalmbehcetson\n\nHo", "Do you tell people when you are in too much pain (from ulcers) to speak, or do you suffer through it? Out of curiosity, how do you explain why you cannot talk/cannot talk much (due to ulcers causing too much pain) when you are in a setting where you have to speak, such as work or school? Or do you talk even though you are in a lot of pain? I find it kind of tricky to explain to others because our disease is so uncommon.", "How does one find a decent doctor that knows behcets?  Most rheumatologists should know about Behcets, but vasculitis specialists would be your best bet. Otherwise it is a bit of a lottery - I went through two rheumatologists before one knew enough to treat effectively. The nice thing is that the treatments for Behcets overlap with a lot of other rheumatological diseases, so it is not completely foreign from that perspective. I have behcets and live in SoCal - I can recommend two rheumatologists, one gastroenterologist and one ophthalmologist that have all helped me get my behcets under control. Feel free to DM me for info. They are great! I would start w. A rheumatologist. That is what I did when doctors gave me the run around. My insurance allowed me to see specialists without a referral. From there , she told me what other specialists to see", "Humira stopped working. What is next? Hi everyone! As the title suggests, Humira has stopped working for me after a wonderful 8 months of minimal-to-no Behcets symptoms. I started developing an allergic reaction, then some symptoms started returning, which prompted my doctor to run some labs. Those confirmed lower levels of Humira &amp; higher levels of the usual inflammation markers (ANA, C4, etc). He is suggesting I try a new biologic soon.\n\nDoes anyone here have a similar experience? My main question is whether this is likely to happen with other biologics (I think my doc mentioned Stelara and Remicade). I tend to build up immunity to every drug I am prescribed, more quickly than the average patient. Does anyone else share this experience?\n\nI feel like I am back at square one -- any insights on your experience switching meds/biologics, or even trying something completely new (I am willing to try any diet/lifestyle changes too) -- please share. Thanks all!  This is extremely common with the biologics unfortunately. The anti-drug-antibody rate for Remicade is about 20% over the first year and about 10% for Humira. It is common to prescribe 10mg methotrexate weekly alongside the biologic - this cuts the incidence of anti-drug-antibodies in half. I do not believe the medical community has found why this happens specifically - it seems largely to be the luck of the draw. \n\nRemicade is probably the next-best biologic to try if Humira was effective in controlling your BD when it worked. Remicade was one of the first anti-TNF biologics to hit the market, but despite that it remains one of the more effective treatments for BD. Humira improved on Remicade by being a fully-human monoclonal antibody targeting TNF-Alpha (Remicade is technically chimeric - it is half human, half mouse protein-wise), but it is functionally the same drug. \n\nOtezla, Stelara, and others target different cytokines with pretty decent success rates. They may be more or less effective than Humira - it really depends on which symptoms are the most prominent for you. I have been on remicade for a long time now and it is helped immensely! Same as you, I was previously on Humira and when the effectiveness started waning I went to remicade infusions. 10/10 would recommend! You will feel fatigued for a day or so afterwards but it is worth it imo I wanted to avoid Humira and ended up working with a functional medicine person who helped immensely, mostly with hormonal support. I decided to give it a go after I did the Autoimmune Protocol diet (with a lot of skepticism) and improved significantly. Good luck with whatever you decide! Otezla!", "Remicade side effects Ive been diagnosed with Behcets since 2011. Ive tried many medications, most work for a short time. Nothing has put me in remission.\nIve been taking remicade IV infusions for a little over 2years now.. In the beginning within 4-6hrs after the infusion I would start to have bilateral leg muscle pain.. Almost unbareable. After discussing with my Dr we started IV Benadryl before each infusion which helped this side effect.\nYesterday with my infusion they did not send my IV Benadryl but I had oral ulcers so I had to take it.. My nurse told me to take a Benadryl pill...the muscle pain started within a few hours of my infusion again.. And is continuing today. \n\nDo any of you have muscle pain in your legs after remicade infusions? What do you do for it ? God yes. My legs hurt so much that I prep for sitting around for 2 days after my infusion. Minimal eating and drinking to avoid having to get up. \n\nI have not found anything to help lessen it in my case. I do know that oral Benadryl does not help me much and I have to get the IV Benadryl along with pred IV pre-meds. \n\nIf you find something that helps, please let me know. Hugs. Got diagnosed very recently so I cant really talk about remission. What I can tell you tho is that I am on Adalimumab 40mg fortnightly and have literally no side effects apart from a bunch of tiredness. I am also taking Prednisone and since I started the cure (about two months ago) I never had any symptom whatsoever (no more ulcers, arthritis etc) This can be an indication that you have developed anti-drug antibodies to the Remicade, which is fairly common. There is a simple blood test to check for Remicade ADAs - it is worthwhile - since the presence of ADAs can lead to side effects. There have been success stories of patients moving from Remicade to Humira after developing ADAs, so that might be worth looking into with your doctor. \n\nHave you tried longer acting antihistamines? I take Claritin twice a day (morning/evening) during my Remicade weeks without any side effects. I also take two supplements regularly - Quercetin Phytosome and Longvida Curcumin - which helped my Behcet\u2019s symptoms before formal treatments, but have anti-allergenic properties as well. Benadryl has a short half life, so if you are mildly/moderately allergic to the Remicade it will only work for a couple hours at a time.", "I want to hear YOUR STORY with Behcet's #MYBehcets Hi everyone! I want to hear YOUR STORY with Behcet's Disease #MyBetchts  \nI work with a social innovation group called Rare is Special and we want to blast your stories and experiences on every form of media so that researchers, policy and fund makers will allot more time and money into researching and curing rare diseases. Your story has the potential to change someone else's life. Helen Keller said \"Alone we can do so little...Together we can do so much.\" Please reply with your story, we need your voice in this movement!", "Figured I post my story I am a 22 year old male and I just found this sub. I first had ulcers and pain in my joints as a child. Being from a small town in North Carolina, I went undiagnosed for a very long time. Puberty happened along with more symptoms. I was able to keep those embarrassing problems away from my family. They started realizing something was up by the way I was walking and that I had difficulty during flare up with simple things like getting out of bed. Puberty was by far the worst time with my symptoms and thankfully they are not as bad. \n\nWell my parents took me to a doctor, and another, and another. The diagnosed ranged but most thought I had diabetes. I end up going to one doctor at CHKD in Norfolk, VA who finally came to the conclusion of behcets and recommended me to a rheumatologist. We also went to see Dr. Yusuf Yazici (this guy is who you want to see if you have the opportunity but I think he has shifted to research, his dad discovered behcets). I have also been seen at Duke University's eye center. I had 6 or 7 students in the room looking at my case because of how rare it was. They were specifically looking at me for uveitis after I took a golf ball to my eye. There were some signs of uveitis in that eye. (They did this really cool test called Fluorescein angiography).\n\nSince my diagnoses I have been on many different meds, colchicine, azathioprine, Prednisone (I took this for a year, do not stay on this for that long if you can. It is a great drug short term though.) and most recently Thalidomide (Blackbox drug that worked the best). I am currently not on any medication, but still have a few flare ups.\n\nBehcets is an awful thing. I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. However if you take it day by day you will be fine. There are much more worse things that I have seen people have while sitting in the doctors office and it makes you see your disease in a different light. If I had to say anything about the disease I would say do not let it hold you back, but be rational your ambitions. My parents almost held me back from going to college because of it, however I was able to get my B.S. in Biochemistry and minor in Chemistry from East Carolina University on time and will be going to optometry school in the fall in Florida. There are days where I just do not think I can do it, but I somehow have made it this far and I do not plan on stopping. If anyone needs any support or advice or just wants to talk shoot me a message. My disease is not something I flaunt around or talk about publicly(hardly any of my friends even know I have it), however I have seen the benefits on opening up about some of it and I figured someone may need to do the same. Thank you for posting. I cannot imagine how hard it was for you experiencing all of this when you were so young.  Holy crap.  I flat out did not talk to my parents about anything below the belt.  I am so happy that they picked up on it! \n\nMost people do not 'get it' but for the few number of us who do...we know how utterly miserable it is. \n\nI will tell you that my flare ups are caused by stress and hormones (I am a female despite username).  I take colchicine (first symptoms appeared JAN 2015 and it took 11 months for me finally go to a rheumatologist.  \n\nBehcets does not own you. \n\nPs my optometrist saved my life. She told me I had uveitis, immediately put me on steroids and told me to go to rheumatologist immediately.  I now go to the onlt uveitis specialist in the state and flare free on colch for a while - fingers crossed! \n\nHave you gotten onto rareconnect?\nThere is a Facebook group but I never post on it.  Feel free to DM ", "No diagnosis yet Hello! I am new to reddit, it is.. a lot lol. I have been having some of the worst symptoms since start of 2020. But now that I look back on my life the last few years, maybe signs were there all along. \n\nRheumatologist said they ruled out autoimmune diseases and then my neurologist was like yeah, no it is autoimmune. I have seen a cardiologist, dermatologist the other two and an eye doctor.\n\nI have had several blood tests done. A chest x-ray, scalp biopsy, gi endoscopy, emg, mri, emg again (I hate that shit so much ngl), a muscle biopsy, etc.  \n\nI have been logging my symptoms almost everyday since June. Bc that is when I started getting the horrible flares. Over time some got better but others were replaced with new symptoms.\n\nI will be seeing my rheumatologist in a week or so. I plan on seeing if she can do that skin prickling thing to see if my skin has a reaction.\n\nI am not sure if I should list out my symptoms here or with a different flair (very new to reddit sorry!)  \n\nDo you all have tips to be proactive? I am sort of known to be assertive with my appointments and try to do as much research as I can prior so I will not be completely lost.  Good luck with your diagnosis!\nTake pics if you have any to show what is been going on with anything to do with skin, eyes etc. \nTake all documentation you have..  files and x Ray's and whatever else you have accumulated. \n\nI never had any reaction on my prick test and I am def Behcets diagnosed..so that may not yield a confirmation for you either - just FYI.\n\nBeing assertive is necessary - but I have found it can go either way, depending on the doctor. I have literally had doctors react in the \"you are over thinking your symptoms\" \"you know too much\" way, and then I have fortunately had a rheumatologist who asked me to tell hin everything, listened and said \"I am thinking Behcets\" and I said \"me too\" and that was that! After that first initial worst flare up of my entire body pains... Nothing can stop me from putting me first. I cannot go through that again. I am so terrified of that.\n\nI have an entire album called \"2020 health be like\" haha \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23 \n\nI think the test wasnt for a diagnosis but it would help them narrow it down? I am also reviewing my current meds (I hate being on a lot of meds) and hopefully new changes will help lessen some of the symptoms \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nI am SO glad your rheumatologist really listened to you 2020 health be like is killing me.\n\nBut I get it!! I had the worst flare of my life in 2020 and I am a bit traumatized by it.\n\nGood luck, truly. And look into diet - no gluten and no sugar really helped me. THIS yes, I have been trying to do gluten free, but sigh. Kind of hard when there is ulcers and lactose intolerance and trying not to eat anything too acidic like OJ \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nIt is so difficult to keep your body consistent or stable so you know how to feed yourself or even know how to take care of yourself.\n\nCurrently feeling extremely gaslighted by my boss's boss and coworkers \ud83d\ude14", "Question regarding exercise Hey guys, I strongly suspect I have got Behcet's (oral lesions for the last 2 years and recurring testicular ones starting this summer). I am currently in the process of seeking out a rheumatologist, but in the meantime I have got a question.\n\nDoes friction or exercise make testicular sores worse in your experience? I am unfortunately also suffering from depression and part of that is very bad body image.  I have been struggling to get in shape for a while, and I was just hitting a good stretch of exercising when I got a new testicular sore. It is really got me down that I am back to being sedentary as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, I use lidocaine to numb the pain for work and otherwise just try to avoid the pain without it. But now I am considering using it to go run as well, to not let my current good headspace slip away. My concern is that doing so my worsen the sore and keep it from healing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what do you guys recommend I do? I have problems with elastic in my underwear rubbing right where I get owies. Not matter what I am wearing, it always seems to be right in that bikini line area! Summer is the worst. \ud83d\ude12 Cover them. Stop with the lidocaine if you can.\n\nIf you can cover them, it will help a whole lot more than lidocaine, and in my case, the lidocaine preparation i was using seem to retard the healing.\n\nTo cover them, i use Mepilex boarder lite bandages. They are an absolute god send. Once you get the area clean, and totally dry, they will stick ANYWHERE and stay tight up against the sore, and then its just like.. a tiny fluffy silicone pillow for what pains you. Brilliant product. Silly expensive though, around $2-4 a bandage but there is not anything else like them\n\nYou can find them on amazon or they sell small 3 packs of them at CVS.\n\nThe 1.6 x 2\" size is usually perfect, but the 3 x 3\" ones can be worn on the scrotum as well.\n\nIf you get really sweaty, they might only last 12-24 hours.\n\n\n\nThe only other thing that is helped me so far is steroids/Prednisone, but you will have to get that from a doctor.\n\nSEriously though, those bandages are super unique, and just an absolute god send. A covered sore feels sooooooooooo much better than trying to keep it numb with cream every few hours.\n\nI have been dealing with these on and off for a decade, I just found the mepilex this last year or so. Life changer, really. As others have said, steroids. \nAlso colchicine is good. \nIf you are rheumatologist is willing try methotrexate but you cannot drink on it. \nAlso, try swimming to avoid chaffing. \nGood luck. Oh my go thank you so much! This is fantastic advice, if it works well it could pretty much solve all my problems! I will give those bandages a shot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah I have been reluctantly using the lidocaine because I just cannot work through the pain, but I did get the feeling it was having an overall negative effect on the wound's healing. Man you throw some wisdom out into the void and you never know if someone is listening...\n\n\nSo a few more tips, because i KNOW HOW DAMN DEBILITATING and miserable those stupid sores are...\n\nIf they still hurt and you want to get the area nice and clean.. use the lidocane about 20 minutes or so before you shower. Do not scrub or anything, but while its numb get the area as clean as you can, especially if you have used anything with petrollium jelly in it (can interfere with the mepilex - experience)\n\nThe first day its going to be tender, and might start to itch a bit. Ignore it, and honestly man, if i put one on when i have a break out in the morning, it will mostly heal over overnight, but you will still be able to see it. This is a trick. If you skip covering it, it can/will/probably reopen and this.. this hurts just as bad if not worse. Might be psychological. Idk.\n\nWhat i am trying to say is, keep it covered, until it looks like its 99.9997% healed.\n\nI promise you will just... have you gotten them yet?\n\nI really want to know how you make out man. It will make my trial and error and suffering so worthwhile, and this is not something you normally even like, get to share with someone who can actually use it... Thank you so much for the advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got the bandages and they indeed are life savers. I cannot even feel the sore anymore, and so far my first one has stayed on for over 24 hours. I will probably be able to exercise with these.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\&gt; The first day its going to be tender, and might start to itch a bit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah I have noticed the itch when the sore first forms. I have so far dealt with it by scratching in a circle around the sore without ever touching it. It offers relief, but I am worried it might help the sore grow or something, idk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will update you in a few days when I have worn them a bit longer. Thanks again! Sorry, throwaway account myself here..\n\nHow did you make out?\n\nI just had a nasty flareup, but fortunately have enough predinose around to start a course, which honestly clears them up in what feels like hours, if not a day or two. Hey! Basically, your idea is genius and in the end, not only did I not feel a thing with the bandage on, it helped the sores heal much quicker than the ones I have had before! Nice! \n\nThanks for the update, I am so happy you found some relief! Ok so weird development but it seems like the sores I used the bandage on are reopening. As in, they were closed, the skin was normal if tender, and now it is cratering and reforming the sores at the same location.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am new to these symptoms so I do not know if this is a normal thing for some sores to reopen due to friction or something, but none of my previous ones had. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave you had that experience ever? When I am recovering from a flare up I wear a bandage over it a few days after its healed just because.. \n\nBut yea, i/we tend to get them in the same places over and over again, or I did until we started trying immunosuppressants, now they rarely ever ulcerate, but i do not let them get that far before starting a course of prednisone.\n\nHave not really found my ideal regimen though. Okay, bad news update, I have had to keep using the bandages over the same areas and now sores seem to form at the extremities of the adhesive. I have been trying to not jump to conclusions but after covering my last one up for a few days I have got a sore forming at each corner of where the bandage was.\n\nI do not really know how to proceed :/ That sounds awful, are you on meds at all yet?\n\nI mean they bandages wont cure them, or stop them from coming back..\n\nSo far its taking 2 different immune suppressants and a steroid rx that is keeping me from getting more. Finally got diagnosed today, got a steroid cream. Going To try it. I am not on this account often... how is it going?\n\nI was thinking about you just a few days ago, up until now the only steroid that really \"solved\" the genital junk was prednisone pills... but recently tried whatever topical they give us.. My dermatologist has me mix it in with a CeraVe moisturizing cream, and damn if it does not stop a sore right in its tracks as long as i catch it before it ulcerates.\n\nEither way, i hope you are well and get some relief.", "Newly diagnosed!! I am so excited, I am honestly through the roof! obviously, I am not happy to be sick, but it took me like seven years of being told I was fucking nuts and being in constant pain to get to this point. So today is a happy day, and possibly the happiest of my life. I am so excited to hopefully get it under control and start living for the first time in my mid-20's, I have been too sick to work or study for several years now. I really thought the only way we would ever get an answer was going to be through an autopsy. \n\n**Do you all have any recommendations for a newbie, anything I should know? How are you guys treating your disease?** I would love to get a good feel of what the future holds. This is super fresh, like, biopsies came back this morning, fresh. And rather unexpected! My GI was the one who found it and diagnosed it (and she was excited to see such an uncommon disease in her practice, haha). We catch up my rheumatologist tomorrow!\n\nYou do not have to read the rest of it, the rest of the post is just my journey on how I got here. \n\nFor some background: 25F. white as they come, lived most of my life in the West (Europe/USA/Canada). I have been battling a long list of symptoms that have lead me to seeing just about every specialist that exists. The answer was always the same, \"we know it is inflammation, but we cannot figure out WHY its inflamed, so, good luck.\"\n\nI started getting more and more desperate starting 2021. I lost all my hair. I would get \"staph infections\" everywhere -- giant white pustules -- and they were so painful. Dermatology could not figure out why I was losing my hair (ruled out everything, including alopecia) nor why I got so many sores (\"we know you have a bad immune system, right? so probably that.\" -- he really did try, despite what it sounds like). \n\nLike probably everyone here, one reoccurring issue through all my symptoms was the mouth sores. Nothing got rid of them. I tried EVERYTHING. I had excessive oral hygiene (I splurged on a fancy toothbrush, brushed after \\*everything\\* I ate, tried every type of toothpaste and mouthwash in the book. I flossed after every meal. Wisdom teeth were pulled, anything that could be a cavity was filled... I really went to the max). Then my doctors thought a vitamin issue, so I carefully balanced my diet, took a ton of supplements, we would run tests with and without all the extra measures and everything was normal. Then they would recommend removing xyz from my diet, I would comply... still had mouth sores. I could not eat. My doctors just kept assuming I was lying and one ENT even dropped me as a patient because they were convinced I was lying and/or triggering them purposely for my visit. I cannot wait to send them my biopsy results. \n\nI would say half my doctors believed me with all my random symptoms -- the problem is that it was always SOMETHING and it was never consistent with what I was struggling with (beyond the mouth sores, exhaustion, joint pain). Something new ALWAYS popped up. These doctors were so frustrated that they could not narrow in on it. I even got transferred to the top rheumatologist at my Ivy League rheumatology office (in the Ivy League campus hospital). He is primarily a researcher and only sees \"bizarre and insolvable cases\" and even he was super frustrated by my symptoms. \n\nThe other half of my doctors always passive aggressively offered psych referrals. \n\nWe got an answer in the most unexpected way: I wrote my GI asking if she had a standard blood workup she could run/tends to run on new patients, because she was one of the only specialists that had not really done a full workup on me (I had contact with her because I also have Celiac Disease). She agreed. First round of blood tests came back irregular, notably my vitamin A (which in the West, can only be caused by a medical issue). Next round of GI tests came back and one of the inflammation tests -- the range was 0-49 and I hit almost 7,000. Immediately was given an emergency scope. I want to clarify: I have never even had as much as a stomach cramp. I had no GI symptoms. \n\nWhen I came to after the anesthesia, she came into the room and was smiling and announced: \"/u/pm-me-shibas, we found it! We know the source of all your issues these last few years.\" and I was so relieved. \n\nMy biopsies came back this morning and vasculitis is confirmed, with the pathologist noting that Beh\u00e7et's is the most likely. We still have to diagnose the type of vasculitis, but we all agree on the likelihood of Beh\u00e7et's and the types of vasculitis that can effect a 25 year-old woman *and* match my symptoms *and* can also completely destroy a colon (and only a colon -- yes, UC was ruled out) is incredibly narrow. \n\nWe strongly expect to find more damage in other organs where I have had major complaints, so that part is not over. \n\n**So, tl;dr**: what are your tips for a newbie and how do you currently treat your Beh\u00e7et's? Hot yoga and everyday is a new day.   Took me 3 years to figure it out.  Good luck. Congratulations! I understand how you feel as well. I have been dealing with my symptoms since I was 12/13 years old and have always been dismissed or told it is this or that. After being on completely wrong and unnecessary medication due to a misdiagnosis for years, I finally found a rheumatologist this year who is going the extra mile for me. I have tried colchicine and otezla - both made me sick and did not relieve my symptoms (biggest issues being oral and genital ulcers.) I have been on methotrexate since August and started infliximab infusions just last week which a lot of people have great success on.\n\nI am 26 F btw if you ever want to discuss anything or seek support! So happy for your diagnosis and wishing you the best. I am so jealous, can you please please please send your path results to the dr that fired you? If it were me I would hand deliver an envelope addressed to \u201cDr. Name\u201d and in it would be the path results with a solitary note saying \u201cFuck you. Do better.\u201d Do not worry, you are not alone. Almost no BD patient (or similar rare diseases patients) have eve gotten a straight diagnosis. I honestly laughed when you said everybody KNEW it was inflammation they just did not know WHY, because that is exactly what happened to me aswell. Also I have had myself a doctor (a RHEUMATOLOGIST) give me one very quick visit and telling me it was definitely nothing related to her specialty... Honestly doctors like that should be radiated. My diagnosis took over 5 years, my symptoms blew up in 2015 and since then I had random inflammation and those constant huge mouth ulcers. Only last year in summer I finally had my answers after almost going blind in one eye.\nHumira. Humira is the only thing that is making me feel better: I have had no mouth sores for over a year and it is a different life. I have heard many people talk well about Infliximab and given they have the same effect as far as I know (tnf alpha inhibition) it is most likely true.\nGood luck! Congrats on the long awaited diagnosis.  I went thru 10 specialists (mainly ENT's and rheumys) to get mine in 2012 at the age of 29.  I had all kinds of wonky diagnosis by all kinds of jokers: cancer, herpes, etc.  Finally found a rheumy DO that listened and actually wanted to work to find a diagnosis.  (some docs are just lazy). My symptoms are mainly large apthous ulcers in the soft palate of the mouth, and the throat that make eating, speaking and sleeping miserable.  Before I started Embrel in 2012, I also had sores at various parts of my body and some arthritis in my ankles.  After 10 years of taking Embrel, it seems like it does not quite work as well any more--in fact I am dealing with back to back flare ups right now.  Embrel worked spectacularly well for the first few years.  I am considering the otezla change over, but those side effects!  I had no issues with embrel.  I am already underweight and really do not want to be projectile vomiting in the middle of the night!\n\nThings that I do to minimize flare ups over the years:  For me, it seems like any laceration of the oral mucosa immediately triggers a large ulcer.  So I stay away from chips, almonds, crunchy/scratchy cereal and anything else that could lacerate. But even then, they can pop up occasionally.  Stress also seems to be a major contributor.  Never let stress chemicals course thru your body without IMMEDIATELY doing something to relieve it.  Leave the situation, go for a run, go into another room and do 200 jumping jacks etc.  Do not know your climate, but try to get some sun as often as possible.  Also, minimize inflammation by minimizing sugar in the diet. Even if you do everything perfectly, It just seems like the body has seasons of inflammation. Welcome to the club! It is a club you did not ask to join but, since you have got a lifelong membership, why not enjoy its benefits? lol\n\nA lot of us have experienced what you have described. No one wants to be diagnosed with a rare, chronic illness. But after suffering for years and not knowing why, finally having a name to put to that suffering can be incredibly liberating. \n\nI have written several articles about Behcet's disease on my website, as well as several podcast episodes. I will link a couple that you may find helpful. Again, welcome. Be well!\n\n[So You have Just Been Diagnosed With Behcet's Disease - Now What? - written article\n](\n\n( &gt;Humira is the only thing that is making me feel better:\n\nFunny you mention this. I had my rheumatologist visit today and as of right now, my rheumatologist and my GI have yet to discuss with each other (but my rheumatologist was following things closely from afar -- I had no clue. He even knew I called in to the GI on-call during the scope prep, he is a saint, I love him).  My rheum said he does not know what to make of everything and it is all just so bizarre. He agrees Behcet's is the most likely, but he also is concerned about a handful of other things, I think because of how severe of a GI manifestation I have (but no GI symptoms!!) I also have an ankylosing spondylitis diagnosis already, which seems to be part of his hesitancy -- I think he is trying to figure out how it all fits together. \n\nBut at the end of my appointment, he was like, \"honestly I think the answer here is to stop thinking about it and to just throw Humira at it\" so that is probably my future as well. He is going to speak to my GI in the next day or two and they will come up with a plan, but its probably Humira for me, haha. It also sounds like this may be as close to a diagnosis I get -- c'est la vie. &gt;Congrats on the long awaited diagnosis.  I went thru 10 specialists (mainly ENT's and rheumys) to get mine in 2012 at the age of 29.\n\nThis sounds very similar to what I went through! I actually got dropped by a prominent ENT earlier this year for \"non-compliance\" because they insisted that I was purposely triggering the sores/not following treatment. It was honestly soul crushing. I look forward to sending them my biopsies and diagnosis when everything is official, not that I think it will change anything.\n\nI saw my rheumatologist today, actually, by pure luck this appointment was already scheduled. He is the top rheumatologist in our system (not trying to humble brag, but an Ivy League system - I think it helps give context) and he was looking through everything was a childlike fascination (love him) but also was like, \"I have no idea what the hell to make of any of this.\" He gets sent all the difficult cases in our entire region, so that was not comforting. He mentioned Beh\u00e7et's specifically as well and did say it was his main concern, but he is put off by my demographics (my family is very recent as far as USA immigration goes -- my grandparents are from Germany and Scotland/Ireland (lol my grandmother is the granddaughter of Irish Potato famine refugees who settled in Scotland... its complicated). My mother is Quebecois, born in Quebec, always been in Quebec for a billion generations -- aka I am not Turkish.) He did acknowledge that Quebecois genes are a bit spicy, though, which makes the lack of Turkish-anything matter a bit less. \n\nMy point being: his conclusion was that he just wants to stop thinking about it and to throw Humira at it, haha. He is going to consult with my GI and make sure she was not wanting to do any more tests. So I have to ask: is there a reason they chose Enbrel for you over Humira? I am honestly scared shitless of Humira -- I also have ankylosing spondylitis, so I am pretty familiar with many of the biologics because of that.\n\nI have often wondered about hard foods and sores, so thanks for that tidbit. I noticed this summer that on the rare occasion I made grilled cheese, it would lead to more ulcers developing (on top of whatever I was currently dealing with). I can eat bread, butter, and cheese just fine with issue, so I always assumed it was the hardness of the bread that was doing SOMETHING to trigger it. Seems like I was onto something, haha. Definitely humira then as it also works amazingly for ankylosing spondilytis. I do not have it myself, but on my medical plan that I have to present to the hospital pharmacy to get the pens, there is actually written I have ankylosing spondilytis just because it requires no \"rare disease paper\" that BD instead has (welcome to Italy). Basically my rheum did this to get me humira immediately instead of having to wait a couple months for beaureocracy, so I know it is also works for that disease.\n\nHumira is an annoying thing, once every two weeks (once a week for you maybe since you have both diseases) and it definitely gives a lot of tiredness, but BD gives tiredness anyways, so it is the same tiredness without the symptoms so I will take it any day. Just got a call from my GI who said its official, thank goodness. I was stressing for awhile. It is just that the disease is so uncommon outside of the Mediterranean (I guess you might just squeak by in Italy as a classic Beh\u00e7et's demographic? haha) that no one really knew what they were seeing. My GI is the director of a huge GI program and she made everyone she knew look at my scope photos to triple check, haha.\n\nYes, ankylosing spondylitis is seronegative (i.e. there are no tests for it, at least early in the disease process), which is why your doctor did that -- diagnosis is usually based off of several MRI's and a positive inflammation blood marker. I have heard this happening a lot for people with a variety of diseases, especially if the disease is not showing up strong enough to make an argument for to the insurance (here in the USA), or something like this where it is not indicated well. Mine is not too severe, so you can come join the AS party, haha.\n\nI am excited! Her and my rheum have to fight it out over what treatment they want to do (likely some TNF). Thank you!! I will definitely look into these. I am so happy. We had a bit of a wishy washy week -- the day after I made this post, I met with my rheumatologist who hit me with, \"you know, I have no fucking idea, this entire thing is so weird.\" which was not comforting! But he also let me know that he does NOT do IBD's at all (he is a lupus (SLE) specialist with a side-focus on other rare rheumatological disorders), so the only reason he was really uneasy about calling it was because for all he knew, it could still be Crohn's.\n\nMy GI called me tonight and let me know that lol, no, it is not Crohn's. She apparently sent my scope images all over the country (despite the fact she leads our Ivy League GI research center!) because she wanted to be confident due to how rare the disease is, she is unlikely to ever see more than a handful in her career, and its not guaranteed she will ever even see another one again. Especially since its a pretty late-stage manifestation of Beh\u00e7et's to show up in the GI and I was pretty severe.\n\nAll the specialists she reached out to said Beh\u00e7et's or NSAID overuse, we talked about the NSAIDs and ruled it out (I was a heavy NSAID user in 2020 due to what we now know is the arthritis side of this disease, but got told to knock it off by nephrology in February due to a shitty renal result and was given pretty much unlimited steroids to use during flairs instead, so she thinks it would have definitely healed by now if it was NSAIDs). She will call my rheum and talk to him this week, so that is exciting.\n\nMy point: its super duper official now. I do not know what you do for medication but my GI expects to argue with my rheum for awhile between Remicade and something like Humira, but otherwise I am on track. I will look into your articles in the next few days (when I have energy... the GI bleed is killing me, haha).\n\nThanks a million for running this sub. I am sure it gets super annoying with everyone thinking they have Beh\u00e7et's due to Dr. Google, but I am happy its here. &gt;I am so jealous\n\nIf its from the diagnosis, do not be, haha. Mine was allowed to manifest so long that I am likely going to lose significant pieces of my GI system, haha. 0/10 do not recommend. I have no idea why I had no GI symptoms.\n\nBut! I will be sending them to many doctors. Two PCP's and an ENT off the top of my head. Both PCP's were convinced I had medical anxiety or were lying to them. ENT was just awful from start to finish.\n\nI am a big kill them with kindness person, so it will not be an outward \"fuck you,\" but it will be a bit passive aggressive. I have def already messaged a lot of doctors who were Luke warm about me and my symptoms, haha.  \n\nI did find this in my MyChart account today, which made me giggle, but this doctor actually really did try and does not deserve a \"fuck you\" -- just more, I am a 25 year old German-Quebecois woman and Beh\u00e7et's is so uncommon in the USA, I think everyone wrote it off because I am not a Turkish male. But this doctor tried, the doctors I hate above just insisted I was crazy and that I was fine medically.\n\nSo for the LOL's:  (\n\n/r/agedlikemilk Thank you! I just got it super confirmed. I posted after getting my biopsy, GI was trying to get ahold of my rheumatologist, who I actually met with on Tuesday and he backtracked on me, which made me panic. But he also reminded me he does \"rare disease and SLE (lupus), not IBD, and need someone who knows IBD to tell me this is not Crohn's and then I will call it,\" haha. GI just called me this afternoon like, \"yeah, no, not Crohn's. Sent your scope photos all over the country and its def Beh\u00e7et's\" so I can breathe easy.\n\nRight? Do you know how many passive aggressive psych referrals I have because everyone thought I was just a paranoid white girl with medical anxiety? I even have alleged MD's who saw my various posts on Reddit while I was trying to sort it all out (because after years, it became clear no one was going to do it for me -- I still went to doctors, but did a lot of Google-Fu too) -- and they have harassed me since, hahaha. Man I feel validated, but mostly just relieved. I knew I was sick and getting worse and I am thrilled to death its over.\n\nYou sound a lot like me. I remember I started getting arthritis-type symptoms in middle school/late elementary school, with mild mouth sores, but it just seemed normal aches and pains (on the more extreme end, though) with some weird penchant for mouth sores. It started picking up again at 17/18/19 and then spiked in severity again around 21, where it is been getting significantly worse every few months since then. I am happy its over. No thank you! I was heading straight to aneurysm-ville with how fast it was getting worse. It is my understanding my doctors are arguing between which TNF now, so it will not be too much longer :) &gt;:)\n\n:) Although they say \"in the Mediterranean\" looking up the numbers the incidence of the disease in northern Italy (where I am from) is around 3.6 in a million iirc, so still VERY rare. It also took years for me to be diagnosed. I hate having Behcet\u2019s, but it is nice to have a diagnosis. When I was younger I was on and off so many medications tying to determine what would help. I eventually was feeling good and my doctors did not feel like I needed to be on medication anymore. Long story short sometimes it is better to just stay on the meds because a few months ago all of a sudden I was doing horribly. Pain everywhere, completely exhausted, mouth sores worse than they had ever been, headaches which I rarely get. Now I am on pentoxifyllne and colchine. It is a lot of trial and error.", "Skin? I was recently tentatively diagnosed with Behcet's and we are awaiting confirmation via extended medication use. My question is for the ones who get the weird rash on the body: \n\nHow the hell do you control this? Can you? Its everywhere and looks like gross red dots on my arms, legs and half my torso. It did not used to feel like anything but now the damn thing is itching and I have broken several open. \n\nAny advice? Steroids for me. I see a dermatologist that gives me this liquid steroid I mix with a jar of CeraVe cream. I use a light coating everywhere I am prone to them, but can go heavy if something pops up.\n\nAny kind of lidocaine cream until you can see the doctor will help with the itching, and just make sure you have a good moisturizing routine down. I used to be really bad about that, but now its like, head to toe lotion every time I bathe. Helped a lot. Every time I have had a weird rash it calmed down within hours of taking prednisone. I have also been prescribed steroidal creams that helped too. Like others have said: steroids or steroid creams might be your best bet. The right anwser is steroid creams. Otezla which is indicated/used for oral ulcers honestly removed all my pseudofolliculitis. Im trying off it and all my pimples returned in a matter of days.  But if you dont have frequent mouth ulcers i doubt you will be given otezla.( or have behcets) I get mouth ulcers about every other month. I have my second round in the last 30 days just after the last ones went away. :( They just gave me colchicine (is that how you spell it?) And I am about a week in to taking it. The rheumatologist said she did not know if it would impact the skin rash or not, but that once I have been on it awhile I should go back to my dermatologist. I think I will sooner, because for real, it is bad.", "Steroid Mood Swings I was hospitalized for 9 days for CNS vasculitis. I had 3 day 1000mg pred and I have been on 60mg after the taper for a few days now. Today I cried for 15 min because I am failing at life. At least it felt that way for those 15 min. When I finally calmed down and went to apologize to my 17yo for my temporary insanity  she showed me a cute video of a baby seal. \n\n(Sigh) I took it to mean I was as big as a walrus and started crying again. (I should never have taken my glasses off)\n\nWhat are some of the things you have done to survive this insane rollercoaster. I am at a loss and apparently crying over baby seals now. Plus I am hungry and cried for 5min because I knew I cannot eat anything. \ud83e\udd2c\n\nDoc changed up my meds. To add Otezla and Simponi Aria and took me off of Remicade and pred (which he changed it to methylprednisolone). I would love some feed back on these meds and if they have worked for you. \n\nNo promises about me not crying in a corner if you say nice things. Hell, I would probably cry more, be mean, anger I can deal with. This crying is horrible.  And apparently a bit scatter brained. I cried because I did not buy candy in Animal crossing before midnight. That Is how bad this has gotten. I hope you are feeling better than you were when you posted this a month ago. In my mid-to-late teens when Behcet's was kicking my butt all over the place, I was on high-dose prednisone. I was prescribed 60 mg/day for many months. Coming off it was freakin' awful.\n\nLike you, my mood was up and down. I would cry for no reason, feel like a total failure one minute, be fine the next. This was in my late teens over 20 years ago. At one point, I got so depressed that I tried to kill myself. There is no doubt in my mind that prednisone played a role in my severe depression and suicidality. \n\nAs far as surviving the rollercoaster, I almost did not. So you are already in a better position than me. I think the most important thing to do, you have already done: be aware that your mood swings are being caused by the prednisone (or withdrawal from) and will pass. Do not try to fight it. Just go with it, knowing you will get through it. \n\nI have never been on Otezla, but I have heard really good things about it. Methylprednisolone seems to be better-tolerated by a lot of people than prednisone, though they are very similar. I have found that to be the case, personally. \n\nJust hang in there. You will get through it. But, believe me: I know how much the rollercoaster sucks!", "Anyone experience extreme hives and muscle pain? I was diagnosed with Behcet's at one year old. At 12 I was rediagnosed at Mayo Clinic as having a \"Behcet's-like\" disease. My symptoms do not fit Behcet's much anymore but they cannot find anything else close enough. \n\nSkipping ahead to today, I have been dealing with extreme swelling and petechiae with muscle pain and fatigue mostly in my legs but it is spreading to my whole body. Everyday I swell then my finger nails and my lips turn blue and I shiver. The swelling gets worse and then after some time I get incredibly hot and sweaty. During all this I am so weak I can hardly sit up. Walking is extremely painful. My lymph nodes in my groin also swell to the size of large golf balls. \n\nThey biopsied and it came back as hives. But they found my intestinal tract is also inflamed and swollen. I had an allergy test but nothing came back that would explain these increasingly severe symptoms.\n\nHave any of you dealt with something like this? Sounds like extreme inflmmation- not so much allergy but food intolerances since the digestive is affected? Has crohns and celiacs been ruled out? Yes both have been ruled out. I have problems with my stomach and just assumed that it was sores or ulcers in my intestinal tract or stomach because the symptoms are exactly like peptic ulcers. Also, with severe flare ups I get muscle pain, fatigue, genital and oral ulcers, fevers, swollen lymph nodes to the point that I get bruising on my neck and arm pits. I have difficulty walking or even just standing during these type of flare ups because I have no energy and my whole body is just aching. I can also get less severe flare ups where I get one or a couple of symptoms and am still able to function. I have had petechia on my legs and just assumed that I get that because Behcet\u2019s affects the blood vessels. I noticed that I get itchy and when I scratch the petechia gets worse. Your lymph nodes are swelling because they are trying to fight off infection or whatever in your body that is off. Try to stay warm, a heating pad works good. Also take ibuprofen or something with an anti inflammatory, this will help with the pain and bring some of your energy back. Prednisone might help you, ask your doctor about it. You should really be seeing rheumatologist and immunologist. Your situation sounds similar to mine. I am not itchy however. I am seeing a rheumatologist. She is just out of answers. Do you know if you are iGA low? That can also have some issues with the digestive tract. \n\nSo I am assuming they prednisoned you up? I do not know of iga. Is that immature granulocyte absolute? That is at 0.02 K/uL per my last work up. But my sed rate is high, hemoglobin and platelet count are low. \n\nNo to Prednisone. I have had pretty bad skin infections. The last time i was on it one infection landed me in the hospital. I actually agree with my doctors on this one - Prednisone is the ultimate last resort. \n\nThere is not much you can do about it but it at least it gives a direction between behcets, other immunodeficiencies, or \u201cnormal\u201d people\nProblems.", "Vaccine technicalities Has anyone gotten a covid vaccine yet? I am scheduled to get mine (an hour away) this Friday when I am eligible. However my doctor says I do not count in high risk category. I work with the public near a university and medical area. A lot of elderly people and a bunch of sorority/fraternity kids everywhere.\n\nDo pharmacies ask for proof of eligibility? I have no idea what to say. Walgreens says autoimmune diseases, but CVS says higher risk, and does not say autoimmune diseases. Even if I am not officially diagnosed (bc it takes forever to get appointments), is this ethically wrong of me bc of technicalities? \n\nI also have business with people coming from states where covid is not that great and is not following mask mandate. \n\nMany people said just ID and insurance is needed. Can anyone say nice things to reassure me or share any info they have come across?\n\nThank you! I am in Oklahoma.\n\nWhen they opened up the vaccines to \"at risk\" adults under 65 it was largely on the honor system. No one asked for any documentation, no one even checked my ID. They worked off the appointment only.\n\nIf you are not currently on any immunosuppressive therapy I suppose you/we probably would not be higher risk by default. I do not know.\n\nMy RA said my med combo absolutely put me there, and told me I can and should get vaccinated as soon as I could. I have a lot going on though, besides just the Behcets.\n\nI got the Pfizer shot 26 days ago, and I am getting my second dose this Thursday.\n\nFirst shot was mild. Sore arm. Little feverish for a few hours the next day.\n\nMaybe they are still being strict other places? \n\nAFAIK the game plan most places seems to just stick every available and willing arm.\n\nCongrats and good luck! I wanted to get the vaccine before I started any sort of treatment for it. Lately I have been managing my symptoms alright. My doctor was my primary care provider and not my rheumatologist or neurologist if that helps at all? \n\nI had pneumonia twice and it nearly killed me as a child and when I had it in college, I was coughing up all sorts of colors and I am already scared of my current symptoms. Idk if it works like that but is it possible that pain from coughing comes from past pneumonia? It feels strenuous as if I had thrown up. I get red, get uncontrollable tears, sweats, etc. \n\nI am on the East coast \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I got the Pfizer vaccine. First shot done. My doctor said I was in the high risk category, but I was eligible faster because I work in education. So many people count in that higher risk category its ridiculous. \n\nI do not think you are ethically wrong. My docs said covid probably would either kill me or permanently disable me. My rheumatologist did say it might not give me as much immunity as a normal person, but I should definitely get it. Protect yourself if you can. If you can get into the VAMS system with the CDC it is the easiest way and they did not make me prove my eligibility since being in that system proved it for me. I also have had pneumonia twice, and the first time (when I was 18) almost killed me. I have had bronchitis so many times it is ridiculous. I already have scar tissue in my lung from so many infections. I could not risk COVID-19 based on that. I got one shot of the Moderna so far. I experienced major fatigue for about 3 days. I have heard the second shot is worse. Yeah I would not risk covid either. I am just saying imagine how bad it could be if we got covid \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I got the first moderna shot about two weeks ago.", "Gastro symptoms? Hi everyone, second time posting here and I (20/f) have a few ?\u2019s abt possible symptoms. Last thread I posted I shared my symptoms and how I think it is likely I have Behcet\u2019s (as well as my gyno), since I have had recurring genital sores. My most recent flare up like that was last month, I was out for a week because I could not walk or urinate, as well as having some sores on my mouth. Yesterday and the day before I felt kind of nauseated after eating breakfast, like I was going to throw up, and had to sit for a bit and wait it out. Today I have hardly eaten, maybe one solid meal and a few snacks throughout, but I have felt terrrrrribly bloated and gassy but built up, like nothing is really moving along except occasional diarrhea but mostly constipation. Not to overshare, but there is also a strange brown mucus when I wipe?? Is this something anyone with a confirmed diagnosis can relate to? Looking back around the beginning of fall I had these symptoms as well, which is also when my vaginal flare ups started to pick up. I always thought they were yeast infections that affected my gut health but as I learn about the disease there are lots of things that are making sense. I also woke up this morning extra stiff and my sciatic nerve on my left side was buggin me more than usual. First, welcome. Second, you cannot overshare here, so do not worry about it. And third, yes, I can relate.\n\nIn fact, stomach pain was the first symptom I can remember. The first time it happened, I was just a kid (somewhere between 5-10 years old). I would get this intense pain in my tummy that made me literally curl into a ball and cry for hours. This was a decade before getting diagnosed with Behcet's. But it only happened in my childhood and seemed to stop by my teens. For decades, I completely forgot about it.\n\nThen, in 2015 after the first major flare up in years, I experienced the same horrible pain in my stomach. It made me remember the pain as a kid and I put it together that it was Behcet's related.\n\nThere is no question about it: Behcet's can cause gastro symptoms. Whether it is Behcet's in your case, I cannot answer. But it definitely seems to be worth strongly considering. I hope that helps! I have related gastroparesis and recurring bouts of gastritis as a result. It can definitely lead to gastro issues. \n\nI would start working on your gut health now. Stay away from anything too fatty or hard to digest. Avoid too many raw veggies and stick with cooked. Try to keep mostly soft foods in the diet, ect. Not all the time, but maybe as a general rule. Things started like they did with you for me and got progressively worst by the time I was in my 30s. That sounds a lot like my symptoms. My Dr does not want to give me an official DX of behcets for insurance reasons so I currently have a dx of aphthous stomatitis and IBS. I take trulance for the gastro issues, which is mainly constipation. I am also on colchicine so I get diarrhea fairly often but that is still better than severe constipation and pain Okay, I have chronic severe constipation and I thought I was going crazy when colchicine made me more regular and even caused diarrhea. Glad to hear I am not the only one, but sorry you are experiencing it as well!", "Anti inflammatory food and behcets Hi, does anyone here tried anti inflammatory food and diet habit to improve behcets recurring symptoms and saw any improvement? Please share your experience or food that helped you! Personally, I have not noticed much difference. I have played with tons of diets over the years: low-carb, no-carb, intermittent fasting, carb cycling, flexible dieting, vegetarian, vegan - none of them seemed to have any effect on the symptoms of Behcet's. But some people swear that dietary changes make a difference. What I can say is that, the better I eat, the less sugar I consume, the more unprocessed foods, the better I feel in general. Ok thanks for your comment. I also tried intermittent fasting it helped me but ulcers keep coming frequency reduced a bit. I also noticed that sugar and stress cause flares up it. Less stress, for sure. That one I definitely find true.\n\nNo so much with sugar, though. And I know my mother (did not have Behcet's but used to regularly get canker sores) use to tell me that salt made her cankers worse/more numerous. Salt may have a similar effect on oral ulcers from Behcet's. Reducing sugar helped a lot with inflammation and pain for me. Reducing gluten and lactose helped too but it is  not 100% the solution  for everyone.  I just noticed in my case that sugar intake  seemed  to increase  joint pains and gluten  and lactose seemed to act on my stomach pain. I learned after years of painful ulcers that sodium laurel sulfate (SLS) is commonly found in toothpaste, cosmetics and all kinds of other products. I wish someone had told me that before I went on medication! I would highly recommend looking into the products you use on a daily basis as well as food. Of course this depends on the symptoms you are having, but we come into contact with many chemicals that can irritate ulcers and cause inflammation.", "Week 2 of flare up. ", "Story and provider experiences I am a 34/f and when I first had issues I got ulcers both on my genitalia and mouth. I had a difficult time eating and all that.  I was tested multiple time for stds and none. They had a suspicion of possible behcets but were uncertain. After some time, I was sent to a rheumatologist that performed several tests and concluded that I did not have it.  Well.  I still had all the symptoms.  I spent that first year having flair ups, eyes hurting, IBS, and would have to not participate in activities. I ended up getting a colonoscopy which came back with a great bill of health. I am epileptic so my neuro did a cat/mri and as always, clear - this is typical for me - some epileptics have multiple episodes but there is not a visual.\n\nFast forward and I have moved to a new location (husband\u2019s work) and have to start over. \n\n1. Does anyone have difficulty explaining that you have a dx of behcets and have the blank stare effect?\n2. Do you feel like medical providers question the validity? I should say I am a white female - which is always the first reaction that I do not fit the profile. \n3. What do you say to help them understand? \n4. I saw a new rheumatologist and he was pretty good.  But.  He said that ulcers should leave scars and he did not see any.  Also he wanted to try changing from colchicine to Otezla - any experience?\n5. He said the med has not had any testing for pregnancy.  Are there any females that have had children post dx?  Can you share experiences with me?\n\nThank you I am a 35 yo white female. Diagnosed since 2003.  Just wanted to throw it out there that I have had hundreds, if not thousands of ulcers and not once have I had a scar. My rheumatologist says it is unusual but he is still 100% sure I have behcets. I do not believe your rheumatologist is correct with his beliefs on scarring. 30 yo white female, and the blank stare is a thing. The number of doctors I have explained it to and had to convince is too high. I have dealt with the ulcers my whole life, but was diagnosed at 20. I keep a detailed record of my history on my phone so I can hand them the details and clarify as I go. My rheumatologist is my lifeline, so everything medical goes through her. \n\nAs for Otzela, it is the only medication (apart from prednisone) that helps my ulcers. I am currently on that and Plaquenil, but my doctor is working on getting Simponi approved since it is approved through 34 weeks and we are planning for kids. \n\nAlso, for what it is worth, my rheumatologist says there is an \u201cAmerican\u201d Behcets that has some of the more \u201cmild\u201d symptoms of ulcers and joint pain without some of the harsher symptoms (though I do not really consider the ulcers and joint pain mild). She says it is more common in Western countries and even thinks there is probably more people living with Behcet\u2019s that is been diagnosed as a type of arthritis because their symptoms are primarily joint related. No idea how much research there is behind it, but it sounds logical to me and would explain some of my history. Have they perhaps looked into it being Sjorgens? It seems the two have a lot of similar symptoms. I hope you find a doctor who helps you find a solution. &gt;30 yo white female, and the blank stare is a thing.\n\nWhite male, been diagnosed since I was in my late teens, I have just had jokes about how I am anything but the standard profile and scratching their head trying to remember med school. That difference in our experiences from medical professionals is *fucked*. Depending on where you live will determine the typical profile. If you are in the United States, white female IS the profile. If you live in, say, Turkey, Behcet's is wayyy more common in men.\n\nWhy did the first rheumatologist rule out Behcet's? Did s/he give any reasons? And did s/he offer any differential diagnoses?\n\nI was diagnosed 25 years ago and Behcet's fit my symptoms perfectly, so no one has questioned it since (once the diagnosis was finally made). \n\nDo you have any other diagnoses? As a (former) mental health clinician, I can tell you that a lot of doctors will dismiss all kinds of things if the patient has a history of personality disorders, hypochondriasis, and lots of other diseases. If you have got other diagnoses (psychiatric or otherwise), that could explain why you feel your providers have questioned your validity. \n\nRemember: your doctor(s) work for you. If you are not happy with the care they provide, go see someone else. But if 10 specialists tell you it is not Behcet's - then I would reconsider. Thank you!  We are wanting to start a family soon too - which was my concern about otzela   Next time I see my rhyme is will ask about Simponi. I will ask that as well Thank you!  The one at Virgina Mason ran several tests including a \u201cbechets \u201c test (I kind of think that is not a thing). Part of it was a test for lupus that came out negative.  This new rheumatologist I do not think questions it - it is more the other providers.  \n\nI am epileptic but the two seem to be not associated (according to cat scan and mri). \n\nRecently, my face is always red.  So  he wants me to see a dermatologist.  \n\nAlso - does cold weather have an increased effect? A lot of people with Behcet's are sensitive to the cold. That much I am sure of. But I am not sure if the cold actually increases symptoms. I would not think so. \n\nYou are right: there is no \"Behcet's test.\" There are tests that can be done that are like clues that point to Behcet's (like a test for the HLAB51 gene, or the skin prick test), but no single (or even combination of) test can diagnose Behcet's. \n\nIf I was you, I would see that dermatologist. See what s/he has to say about your face. It could be Behcet's related - but it might not. Epilepsy is not a symptom of Behcet's. I suppose in extremely rare cases, neuro-Behcet's could lead to seizures, but it is a lot more likely you have got comorbidities. See another rheumatologist. A crucial first screening for your next doc question is, \"How many Behcet's patients have you treated and how many are you treating now?\" If he has not treated many patients and has not put considerable effort into understanding the disease and keeping appraised of current treatments, then my advice is do not waste your time.\n\nBehcet'ssyndrome (BS) is a rare disease and more importantly an extraordinarily complex one with protean manifestations and vast variations between how it presents and progresses in individual patients. BS makes the diagnosis of most other autoimmune-hyperinflammatory diseases such as lupus, MS, Goodpasture's, RA, GPA, etc., look like child's play.  This not to say that diagnosis and management of these conditions are easy. Instead, these diseases most often present in more stereotypical ways and the clinicians treating them have had experience with many, many more such patients than they are likely to have with BS. BS is the very definition of a disease that requires not just a \"specialist,\" but a highly experienced one. Well.  I live in a rural area and insurance is picky.  I have to go with what I got I understand your situation. Many people like me have HMO coverage and have no, or very limited choice over who will provide their care. Nevertheless, knowing the quality and capabilities of the physician treating you is always an advantage. In the worst case it gives you the opportunity to pay out of pocket for a single or visit or two to a clinician who 8s competent. This can sometimes be a lifesaver and can provide you with you information that might help you to ask the doctor you are \"stuck with\" for different care. Some docs are willing to listen to suggestions from well informed or patients or from more experienced colleagues. you are on an hmo? Why? You are old enough for medicare, right? Yes, I have Medicare, however Medicare does not pay for all my medical care and the only affordable supplemental programs  are HMOs or PPOs. Inb my case, Kaiser Permanente was the best value for money and the do provide a good level of all encompassing medical care for people of limited means.  Supplemental policies that allow you to run off to the Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson or Cedars Sinai are available but are fantastically expensive. \n\nBTW, the expert researcher-clinician rheumatologist I paid out of pocket to consult with does not take Medicare patients. This is not uncommon among elite physicians who do not want the hassle and do not need to see Medicare patients. In this respect such docs operate like plastic surgeons in that they see only patients who can pay cash or who have excellent private insurance coverage. ", "Please help I was diagnosed with Behcet's recently (sick since Aug 1, diagnosed with Behcet's mid-Sept, symptoms since 2004). \n\nMy mental health is the worst it is ever been in my life, esp these past 3 weeks. Worst today. I have reached out for help but no one is understanding what I am going through. \n\nI am in so much pain and sick, they cannot control my erythema nodosum and arthritis pain, many other symptoms, have had 3 doses of oral prednisone and 2 shots of cortisol since mid-Sept, and I think it is making me depressed on top of the diagnoses. \n\nPlease please tell me this is not as horrible and forever-ongoing as it seems. I am so so sad. I see no progress since August and no potential to get better. I hate this. I am sick of steroids and weight gain and feeling gross and new meds. I am so heartbroken. Please help me feel ok. \n\nMid-30s female, 3 young kids at home (under 5), mid-west USA (freezing cold temps are not helping). I am so sorry for what you are going through. And at least from my perspective, prednisone is hard psychologically. I think if you have a predisposition toward depression it might hit you hard. Finding out your ill is a loss that is worthy of grief. I would strongly recommend you looking into getting a therapist to give you extra support during this time of change. Please do not grieve on your own. I do not have a crystal ball and cannot promise it will get better but at minimum you will get better at it. If that makes sense? Do not give up! You are not alone! How to find the right therapist? I have met a lot of not great ones... This is a highly charged topic for me and I do not have much energy for bad matches. Any ideas? That is such a hard one! I am a mental health therapist myself and have also gone to therapy over the years off and on. And I hate to say it but I have had some really really underqualified/shitty co-workers and therapists myself. I would steer clear of social workers because they are not trained in diagnostics and treatment at the same level as someone who is a licensed clinical counselor or a licensed mental health clinician.  Obviously that is not always the case but it is enough that I would avoid them. I also would find someone who has something called an \u201cindependent license.\u201d It means they have been doing it for at least a few years. It is a better indicator of experience than age alone. If you can, try to find someone with a phd in counseling (not just diagnostics/assessment). Psychology today has a pretty decent search tool you can use and now with telehealth you can even use clinicians from out of state. Unfortunately health insurance can get in the way but you can also try to negotiate terms of payment if you really find someone you think you would click with. Check reviews from multiple sources, not just one website, if you can. It is really hard because medical doctors sometimes try to dismiss physical complaints as being \u201cpsychological\u201d in origin even though it is 2020 and there really is little separation between the two. I would actually discourage you from asking for a referral from your medical doctor\u2019s office for that reason. It can go into your chart that you have depression and god forbid you develop fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue later and get blown off by them as having anxiety alone. I am willing to help you sort through some of this if you would like. I know it is so confusing and you are probably already so overwhelmed. Please also seek support from local support groups or online support groups too. If you need to chat I am around. Sorry if this is less supportive and more informative but I wanted to answer your question ASAP but am also on a conference call and my attention is split. So I am sorry if my tone is rushed or I am confusing you... I am so sorry to hear this. I am a fellow mid western 30-something just diagnosed yesterday after an incredibly hard month and years of confusing symptoms. Do you feel like your doctors are understanding you? I am currently reaching out to therapists and have also had a lot of luck using psychology today and filtering through insurance provider. Huh, I find this strange because I actually was happy about the diagnosis.\nI have felt I will for years and now finally doctors understood why and can cure me.\nI have been on Humira for a couple of months now and I am very happy about the situation as a whole. I do not have symptoms and while yes the weight gain is there (I got about 12kg in 3 months) in my case it was needed given I was slightly underweight.\nThe only thing I can tell you is be happy you have a diagnosis, because if Beh\u00e7et's gets left to act it can devolve into serious problems, if instead it is cured and taken care of, it is completely possible to live a normal life.\n\n18, had symptoms since I was born, serious since 2015, Italian male, diagnosed this summer btw. You are lucky to be handling it so well! You also sound like an optimist \ud83d\ude0a I am married to an optimist and I can appreciate the trait (usually haha). I just quit my doctor, actually. He has no idea what he is doing with Behcet's, has only seen it twice in his career, and is not helping me. He scheduled a CT angiogram for it recently... Another surgeon told me how ridiculous that is for this condition. It is just too much guesswork and I am done with it. Thank you so much for your reply! That is a lot of information, and I am usually good at deciphering it... But I am not up for it right now. I am just not up for reading reviews and trying to figure out who is qualified. Could you help me find someone in my area? I live in zip code 83402, Idaho Falls. My insurance covers pretty much everything. I checked myself into the ER two days ago because I was not coping, but I need a long-term solution. I am so overwhelmed, I think if I can find a counselor and talk to someone that could help. Yes, yes, yes, yes, this resonates so much. I have had symptoms/mini-flares for years but had my first huge one start in February. Diagnosed by early March because the symptoms were so pronounced, and luckily my doctor is really knowledgeable about it despite his being relatively young for a rheum. I do not know where in the midwest you are but I am an hour out of Columbus, OH and my doc is part of the OSU Wexner system. If you are reasonably close he is worth the drive.\n\nI am predisposed to mental illness, I am bipolar 2 so the type with more heavy depressive episodes. I have been an extremely active person my whole life. Professional dancer until grad school at 25, then power yoga every day and a 5-10 mile run a few days a week. Long hikes every weekend even in deep winter. To suddenly not be able to go on even a mile-long walk or even stretch too much has been jarring, to say the least. I am still in the experimenting phase with treatment so some symptoms are better but not close to enough. Starting Remicade this month and putting an unbelievable amount of hope into that. Like, I NEED it to work.  \n\nI go through phases of it feeling emotionally insurmountable and phases of hopefulness and near gratitude for the easier days. Being bedridden from pain and exhaustion does not help - I sometimes feel like I am stewing in my grief. Still in my 20's and I feel like I am 80. I cannot imagine what it is like to have kids too. Exercise has always been a coping mechanism for me. Honoring \"what my body can do\" has historically been what I have clung onto when fighting against the eating disorder I have struggled with since I was 14 (thanks dance). When I have manic periods, exercise is how I keep myself from being overly destructive. Go run for a couple of hours instead of deciding to uproot your life kind of thing. Not having those options right now, I do not know how to explain to my wonderful, supportive, listening partner who will never fully understand. \n\n**I will say - the good and hopeful phases grow more frequent and more prolonged regardless of how I am physically feeling.** The first couple of months were the worst. Three things help me more than any others: you are not alone. You are valid in feeling shock and loss, you are not overexaggerating. Try to find ways to communicate with your partner/support system when you feel bad - you do not need them to understand exactly what you are experiencing, you need them to understand that you are experiencing something significant. I find it useless to try to communicate what I need because I do not always know... Instead I just say \"8.7\" or something (1-10 scale) so we are on the same page about what I can and cannot do and my capacity for thinking. Read other peoples' stories on this reddit because knowing that other people have similar and different journeys is comforting and we DO know what you are experiencing!!!\n\nTwo: ***your grief is not for a permanent loss!!!*** There are as many remission stories as there are diagnosis stories. It is a journey and it may be a long one depending on your subjective experiences but you WILL feel better. Your body is still your own and it is communicating its needs to you and you will learn to understand them and you will get to a point where you can give it what it needs. Things will get better!!!!!! \n\nThree: I echo what others have said, a good therapist is so helpful. Mine is a cancer survivor, and I think that it gives her a certain level of understanding that is helpful... Really nuanced things like she knows when empathy is important, knows what kind of understanding I am needing from my support system, and also knows when I am...being a little bit...self-pitying. Psychology today is helpful, what I did is find a relatively large and seemingly appropriate practice, then had an intake appointment with the first person available and asked them to please match me with the therapist they thought would be most appropriate. I do not know that every practice would be so honest, but generally speaking, if their priorities are in line and they want you to get the support you need, they should be willing to find you the best match.\n\nEvery single day is a step in a process and it gets better. You are learning and your doctors are learning and your family is learning. Sending you so much positive energy!! If you ever just want to talk I find it so nice to talk to other people in our community so please reach out. I am the same way; I work out 6 days a week, I love yoga, I love lifting weights, part of my identity is being strong... then suddenly I cannot hold a couple yoga poses that I have done for years. It is earth-shattering. I have been consistently sick/in pain since Aug 1. And it is during covid, there is literally nothing else to do and I am exhausted and sad. \n\nI have watched my mom fight cancer 3 times in her 40s. My grandma died at 49 from it. I grew up knowing I have the same gene which guarantees I will have stomach and/or colon cancer by age 40. I am 34. I have known my whole life it is coming (I get tested bi-yearly, have a team of doctors, preparing for the inevitable) and then suddenly I get diagnosed with another disease. It has decimate me. I could handle one. I never saw the second one coming, even with random symptoms over 15 years. Sorry for your predicament. Not sure what type doctor you are seeing. I would recommend a rheumatologist. Rarely with autoimmune are there only one disease to manage. For instance, with me, my initial diagnoses were lupus, behcet\u2019s, anemia, fibromyalgia, and celiac. My vitamin d was also very low (in the teens). Started vitamin d (50,000 per week), iron, plaquenil, and colchicine. It helped significantly- still struggled with fatigue (sleeping 20 hours per day), gi issues, painful joints, brain fog). More testing revealed active chronic Epstein Barr Virus, Hashimoto\u2019s, and positive HLA-B27. Now I also take thyroid medication &amp; for fatigue I take Provigil &amp; Concerta (one or the other does nothing-I have to take both if I am to stay awake). Additionally, I take natural supplements to help with pain &amp; inflammation- Boswellia is amazing! I also take omega 3 fish oil, probiotics, collagen, turmeric, GABA, vitamin A,E,C, and zinc. These are the main ones. You may to see a different doctor. For me, the key is to be open to all types of treatment. My diseases are rare and treatment is not is the realm of many doctors. That is not a slam on them, just advice to acknowledge limitations and if you need to continue to search for a different doc, by all means continue to search. Our bodies want to heal and are made to heal. You have to find the way to bring balance back. It will seem like a scavenger hunt but you are your best advocate. Good luck. Thanks. I am seeing a rheumatologist but he sucks. The other rheumatologist in my area cannot see me until March. Anyone else is hours away, and I have no idea who is even competent. And I have young kids at home, so I cannot really travel.", "How is your heart doing? Hello, I have been monitoring my heart rate, I found it fluctuating though out day between 70-110 BPM and mostly it is remain 90 BPM during day.\n\nBut my resting heart is almost constant during sleep 65-70 BPM.\n\nI met an cardiologist (I am from India and here you can easily get same or next day appointment with any Doctor) who has done ECG, TMT which found to be normal till now. \n\nI had been reading some medical publications which correlates heart BPM found to be higher in BD patients, so arrhythmias is common too and heart-rate recovery index is also impaired.\n\nJust curious to know any fellow member is also monitor and share details about heart rate? My fiance has BD, and his cardiologist diagnosed him having myocarditis about 2 years ago. Since the diagnosis, we have been able to get him on all the medications he needs, but it was pretty scary when. we did not know what was going on with his heart. Maybe this can be of some help. I have Behcets and I am diagnosed with long qt type 2, and I have frequent heart symptoms. My heart rate is always high despite being athletic and on heart medication. I hope you start feeling better soon. You are not alone! Wow, I had no idea what Long QT syndrome was but I was diagnosed with POTS 10 years ago. Current cardiologist says my POTS is a misdiagnosis because I faint all the way (as opposed to just greying out) sometimes. He has not mentioned long QT. Can I ask what symptoms led you to testing for this? Of course! I had symptoms my whole life but ignored it. I had issues with cardio in gym class as a kid and would have episodes of tachycardia that would come and go lasting for a few weeks at a time. I would get very shaky and black out. I had intermittent chest pain my whole life. But I did not find out until I was at the Mayo Clinic for a different condition and they did a head to toe work up and found the long qt. I have several cousins who sadly passed away as children most likely from long qt.  I just had not put it together. I cannot say that is what is causing you to pass out but maybe something to consider? They can find it on an ekg.", "Mouth and genital ulcers at the same time Hi,\nDo you guys get genital and mouth ulcers outbreaks at the same time?\n I do not know if I actually have Behcets but I am pretty sure I do.\n\nI only ever had genital ulcers once. But I have had mouth ulcers throughout my life. I was wondering if you guys usually get them at the same time with Behcet or it was just a coincidence if I had really bad mouth ulcers the one time I had genital ulcers. I am pretty sure the genital ones were triggered by a yeast infection and damage to the skin on my genitals (from my panties rubbing too much) but maybe getting genital one triggers the mouth ones. Help me please!!\n\nThank you! I would constantly have mouth ulcers. If my flare got too bad, then it would also be genital. \n\nI have had genital ulcers maybe 3/4 times. I have avoided a genital flare a few times (it would get tingly and spots would start to appear) by doubling up on my colcrys and making sure I sleep well. I always get mouth ulcers first, and are pretty common for mild flares. If it is severe I will get both though. I have never had genital ulcers without mouth ulcers showing up first. I do not, but I have always thought I was odd, like usually people get both. I get them in my throat during flares but not my mouth. Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean, nearly every combination really.\n\nGenital sores are rare for me, except for the summer i was diagnosed they were constant but now meds keep them at bay for the most part, but they all for the most part started out looking like friction burns. I thought my underwear was not fitting right, or maybe I was sweating too much. Everything I did to try to remedy it though made it worse until I was diagnosed. I have gotten them in my nose before. Thought it was a cold sore, and may have been before, but I have genital lesions right now with nose and eye lesions to accompany. Misery loves company!", "Wife with possible diagnosis mentioned... Long story long, over the past 2 weeks my wife and I have visited 5 doctors and 2 trips to the ER. She turned 40 this year and she had small canker sore begin roughly 6 months ago, they came and gone and were not too bad to start off with, but since the beginning of December 2019 have increased drastically and moved to her throat and makes it hard for her to swallow and (before 1 trip to ER) even breathe, especially the in the morning. She has also been using refresh tears on her eyes for years, and ever since we have met she is had this sort of gagging cough in the morning (she says nothing comes out, and usually only in the mornings while brushing teeth). \n\nLooking over some of the stories on here she has some of the same symptoms, but no joint pain or private area ulcers, but the mouth symptoms are definitely there, to the point where drinking a gallon of whatever liquid for a colonoscopy is out of the question right now, also the dryish eyes could be another symptom? We have an upcoming appointment on Monday (12-23-19) with a rheumatologist after an oral pathologist referred us to a Gastrology doctor who referred us to the rheumatologist. The Oral pathologist was referred from a Ear Nose and Throat doc, who originally was referred to us from a primary care physician. Yet, I would think some kind of mouth swab would be taken from one of her sores and examined or tested by ONE of these doctors, but that has not happened yet? The most human responses we have seemed to get were from ER Physician Assistants, acknowledging how frustrating this must be, after just doing what we are told to do and being beat around the bush, as her condition seems to worsen by the day. And yes I have raised my voice seeking answers and treatments. \n\nIt just seems like we are going from doctor to doctor to doctor and each one is trying to get rid of us cause nobody knows what is going on and hopefully the next guy/gal will but Behchets has been mentioned! I just wonder if we are on the right track with that? \n\nRight now it is amazing seeing her not coughing and walking around laughing and doing normal things after a heavy dose of painkillers from the ER and her 2nd day of perdnisone treatment, but I worry it will be short lived once the tortal (type of pain med in shot form I believe it was called) wears off and shes coughing again... coughing up blood... waking up at night, grimacing every time she swallows... it is heartbreaking to see, I am 9 years younger than her, but by looks you would not be able to tell BUT we just got married 2 years ago... \n\nI guess my questions are, could we be on the right track? Is there anything we can do at home/ besides magic mouthwash, OTC Aleve and Tylenol to help with throat lesions and swallowing?\n\nP.S. My wife is originally from Lao, and we are in Minnesota now, so many doctors I fear have not seen this before one admitted it is not anyone that they would know areas of expertise at all... she is lost 3 pounds as she is forced to eat ramen noodles that are not even spicy (she loves spicy food), rice soup, egg drop soup, ice cream. She is just everything to me and I hate feeling so helpless... \n\nThanks to anyone who is read this far, we are not even diagnosed yet, but maybe this subreddit can diagnose her through itself.... For me, I went my entire childhood with oral ulcers. Got really bad my senior year of high school and cold hardly swallow. I was fighting the school to carry water with me in classes because it was unbearable. I got the genital sores right before I turned 19 (34 now) and was quickly diagnosed (which is super rare). I have always had dry eyes, but I wear contacts so I cannot be sure of the reason for that. I also see a ton of \u201cfloaters\u201d in my vision which come and go. I did not develop joint pain for many years later and it is still minimal at that. I do struggle with migraines. \n\nFrom my experience and what doctors had told me, if prednisone makes a huge difference quickly, it is surely autoimmune related. It does sound like it could be the start of behcets. Adjusting my diet by limiting foods which cause inflammation (carbs sadly) has really helped. Good luck and I would be happy to answer any other questions. Rice and noodles are carbs are not they? Which is all she is been eating lately... great Thank you for sharing this information. I have had the same struggle OP mentioned and am tired of doctors not listening to me. They are carbs. Try and stick to meat and dairy as much as possible Surprisingly our doctors think this may be what she has which is why we have been bouncing around so much, but we will see in the morning if the sores have gone down or gotten worse. If they have not gone down and essentially prednisone is not doing much, and we are looking at something not auto immune... what else could this be I ponder? These initial sores only really started for the first time in her life mere months ago... \n\nWhen will the days of Star Trek come and patients can be scanned under some highfalutin machine and treated with a simple hypospray?!? No problem. Message me if you ever need someone to chat with Make sure they check her sed rate when they do a blood test. It will show inflammation in the body. It is not entirely accurate though, I have been swollen and tested normal. But more times than not it is a good place to start. Ah yes, the two times we have had the blood tested it has showed an increase in \u201cESR\u201d which I believe is sed rate? We are going to try eating more meat and veggies tmrw instead of classic rice and noodles. Thank you u/anellakai for all the help Yep. That is inflammation. Eat as close to keto as possible. Best of luck You need to ensure that docs are tapering the prednisone if she has been receiving pulse treatments. Especially if the prednisone has been working. Additionally get a prescription for colchicine as it will help with the ulcers. Then you need her to get a preventative med like methotrexate, azt or one of many other options. I wish you guys the best of luck. The first treatment of prednisone came right back up, but the 2nd day it seemed to help greatly, although when she woke up in the morning she had a few new sores in the tongue so still not entirely sure prednisone is working... 3rd day today of prednisone and she wasnt doing too hot until we got some mighty painkillers going. But ER doc recommended switching between ibuprofen and acetaminophen @ 500 mg every 3 hours. That seems to be helping a lot, even if she is only 100Lbs and 5 feet tall, she is not spitting constantly now... a little relief feels great at this point! But i am literally going to copy paste your post into my notes on her treatment and ask the doctor about them! Thank you u/therealvisual No problem. My first major flare actually hospitalized me for 3 weeks and I ended up being diagnosed with an even rare type of behcets with a neurological aspect. Did they give her 1000 mg of pulse? If they did you really need to get in touch with them ASAP to get on a taper dose otherwise she will have a relapse and your body has a tough time with no taper after such a high dose. Pulse? The prednisone? They gave us what they called bursts, two 20 mg tablets once a day in the mornings... not too clear yet if they are actually working but the OTC ibuprofen and Acetaminophen @ 500 mgs switch every 3 hours is keeping her from spitting constantly and being in pain fairly well tonight so far. The most trouble she is had as so far has been mouth related, but we did notice a weird sort of small skin rash on her chest today... \n\nBut my god I did not realize it could get neurological, I hope you are doing better now.... We have not actually gotten an official diagnosis yet but after hearing\u201dbehcets\u201d being tossed around and reading up on the symptoms, I immediately searched for a subreddit and the help and info so far has been outstanding. So with 20mg tablets you will not need to taper. I had 3 days of 1000 mg (pulse) There is a lot of information out there if you want to google. Lidocaine is good for the ulcers too if your doc will give it to you. A swish and gargle do wonders. There is also a lollipop that is good but I have not used it before. If she does get officially diagnosed, as your rheumatologist for Otezla. It was very recently (like in the past few months) approved for treatment of behcets. It is been a miracle drug for me ulcer wise. I went from nearly constant ulcers to almost none within a week or two of starting it. Wow i just googled that and it is the first and only FDA approved medicine for behcets ulcers!!! Thank you so much for this info!!! Keeping this post saved for reference during rheumatology appt on Monday!!! Without skin ulcers and genital ulcers she does not have all the symptoms. Sadly dry eye is also not the same as eye inflammation and eye ulcers. It sounds like she for sure has an autoimmune problem. \n\nMy husband has ulcers also in his mouth throat and upper and lower gi tract and sadly the same treatment I use for behcets does not bring relief for him :(. \n\nOtzela is a god send for oral ulcers but the first week side effects can be intense. \n\nI am 32 now and have been prediagnosed with behcets since I was 4  with full symptoms since I was 12. Feel free to message if ya have any questions and what to expect, Diary can trigger allergic reaction responses and can make symptoms worst. Best to eat bland diets that she knows she can handle and not cause upset. We have recently found a few skin marks on her chest and back, but nothing on the genitals from what we can tell... so that means we could be back to square one and the only way of knowing would be to treat for Behcets and if it does not work then we would know it is not i fact Behcets? Does she need all the symptoms to be diagnosed? I do feel like it is auto immune though... \n\nThrowing a giant net all over the place before felt hopeless of catching this small thing, but even if I am not on the right track with this I do feel like at least we are throwing that net in the right part of the water now. The skin lesions look like giant boils that burst after a while. The vaginal ones are open Sores similar to the mouth ones. They start the same as small bumps and then spread to large areas and clusters. \n\nAs far as a diagnosis you have to have 3/5 symptoms to for sure say you have behcets. Usually it is mouth gentile and eye ulcers for some people and others have positive skin pathology tests and a rare few have neurological ulcers. \n\n\n Even if she does have it there is no cure only management. Her best bet is to not stress and keep her ulcers clean with magic mouth wash and stay on her pred cycle. \n\nFlare ups fucking suck and I feel her pain!! I hope she gets some relief soon\u2764\ufe0f The skin lesions look like giant boils that burst after a while. The vaginal ones are open Sores similar to the mouth ones.

I just dont get how someone can make it 40 before having these crazy mouth flare ups... Ground flax seed in warm water with a bit of cloves can help too. Let the flax sit in the water for a bit until it has thicked a bit and steep in the cloves. Cloves have a natural numbing property and the flax thickens the water helping it stick to give her some relief. Ground flax seed in warm water with a bit of cloves can help too.

And for about six months they were almost intolerable, after that initial constant bombardment of 20+ does at a time it finally started to calm down. \n\nI know that for some the diagnosis helps, but really there being no cure or easy fix for the symptoms the diagnosis does not really matter. Keeping the symptoms at Bay is the important part. \n\nAt least for me the symptoms come and go,  there painful acne like legions come and go sometimes 5-6 at a time other times I will not have any at all for a month. With those one of the defining things to me that was abnormal is how long they took to go away. Usually the legions are there and painful for about a week, then they turn almost a purple color and do not hurt as much but linger for at least a week after that. I guess everyone is different, I have flourished on an almost keto diet Yes, definitely ask about starting with Otezla before a medication like Remicade or Humira if you do get a diagnosis. HOWEVER, I must mention that everyone reacts differently to Otezla. I was one of those people, and had terrible nausea and severe abdominal cramping that eventually took me to the ER on Day 3 of the medicine. They took me off the Otezla immediately. I am a smaller woman (fluctuate between 95 and 105 lbs, 5\u2019 4\u201d) and have had terrible GI symptoms this recent flare, which eventually led me to my diagnosis. But I would advise taking the dosage slowly (they taper you up from 10 to 60 pretty quickly), especially if your wife is small and dealing with upset stomach / nausea already. Best of luck! Feel free to DM with direct questions as I just got diagnosed this month. You are very welcome. I hope it works as well for your wife as it does for me. Check with your insurance company before you fill the prescription. It can be massively expensive if you have shit insurance like me ($1500 copay, $4000 with no insurance). If that happens, ask your rheumatologist for free samples (they come in 2 week packs). I have been getting it that way for almost a year with no problems. I am very lucky that mouth ulcers, while something I suffer with, are not as bad as other people experience. I use magic mouthwash when it gets unbearable and usually up my steroids. \n\nI would suggest taking her to an eye doctor if she has not already seen one. I have super bad dry eye, but I also have really.bad Uveitis that I did not get red eyes from like some people. \n\nJust make sure you take her to an Opthalmologist, not an optometrist unless you really trust them. Holy Cow!!! That Is expensive, i think we have decent insurance but damn!!! Hii I just read your comment. My mom was diagnosed 3 years ago and it has been a rough road. They are kind of at her last resort....they are putting her on humira soon but she is really worried about starting it. Any advice? I feel helpless to her and she is my best friend. DM me :) I have been diagnosed since I was 12 (32 now).", "Went to the Gyno today So I went to the gyno today to remove a vaginal ulcer that had been there since last November. She said to me that it looks like it  could be Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease (or chancroid but that does not fit because my partner would have had similar sores by now). I have been also having some other problems lately- hair loss, weight loss, fatigue, random pain throughout my body, and mouth ulcers that take a few weeks to heal (I thought they could have just been canker sores), and I am wondering if anyone with behcets has experienced similar symptoms to this. Before anyone asks, I have been tested for STDs with swabs and blood tests to which they came back negative. I am currently waiting for pathology results I was diagnosed with herpes more times than I can count. The ulcers got so bad that I could not wear underwear or pants and had to go commando with my dresses because everything hurt. I finally went to a dermatologist who took one look at my vulva, did a biopsy, and asked me some questions. When I told her that the ulcers on my vulva happen at the same time I get ulcers in my mouth, she told me she was certain it was Behcets. She sent the biopsy to test for herpes just to be safe. I told her that all other medical professionals took one look and told me it was herpes even after the tests came back negative. \n\nShe did not give me a prescription for Valtrex because she said \"this in no way looks like herpes and your symptoms do not make sense to consider it to be herpes.\" She instead gave me a topical numbing cream because I had so many ulcers down there and was in so much pain.\n\nThat doctor saved my life because I was reaching my breaking point. \n\nShe asked me about joint pain, which I have as well- wrists, fingers, ankles, knees, and hips. \n\nThat pretty much sealed the deal. I had never heard of Behcets until I met her so it is not like I could be faking it (also, such a dumb disease to fake.... our meds are not fun).\n\nBe your own advocate and if you need to, ask for a rheumatology referral so at the very least they can rule it out.\n\nBest of luck! Sounds autoimmune for sure. I would say it cannot be a coincidence that you get vaginal and oral ulcers. I hope your gyno gets you treatment My first flare with Bechet's sent me straight to the hospital with concurrent genital and oral ulcers. Was there four days. I saw multiple doctors from multiple specialities and though they all ran the herpes barrage of tests (all negative obviously) they all made it clear that it did not look like herpes. My regular gyno added that it looked like some saddle injuries she is seen (one really large ulcer). Coupled with my other skin issues, IBS, joint problems, etc my rheum was confidant it was Behcet's from my first appointment.\n\nSounds like you are in good hands with someone knowledgeable. Yes yes and YES. My first symptoms when I was 11 or 12 was vaginal ulcers... painful, horrific things that took me out physically for weeks at a time. Mouth sores have always been a problem for me as well. I am 27 now, but I know a flare is coming when I feel lethargic and physically exhausted for little to no reason. You are not alone! (Also I was diagnosed when I was maybe 19 or 20, my mother also was diagnosed at a young age). I  went to my primary care first and she sent me to a gyno the doctor took one  look and said it was Behcets, did a biopsy and it just confirmed it. T he ulcers clear up after a bit and then come beck, lots of sore in my mouth, ears and nose.  Stress seems to make it a lot worse.  But who does not have stress? I agree with all the comments. I had the same symptoms since I was a child, got worse in my teens and early 20's when I started getting 7-8 oral ulcers and at the same time a few in my vagina. I am 25 now and I was diagnosed at 22. Ngl it takes a very long time to get diagnosed because not many doctors know about Behcets and it presents itself in different symptoms that first seem unrelated.", "Can you describe your Behcets when you are not flaring up? Hi everyone! I am new to this community and this world, just got a hesitant Behcets diagnosis last week bc I do not meet all the diagnostic criteria (read my previous post for more info!)\n\nI typically have oral sores most of my days, but of course for the last few months while I have been on the medical journey towards a diagnosis, they have been weirdly dormant. Like only one here or there, me always wondering when they are going to strike full force again.\n\nI am wondering if this is what other people experience when they are not flaring up? I have been prescribed colchicine to help with the symptoms that I typically experience, but since I am not really experiencing them right now, I am a little worried to take the med as I have heard it really messes with your stomach.\n\nDoes anyone else experience these eerie dormant periods of symptoms or is that just me having a very new/mild case of Behcets? I would appreciate any feedback anyone has!", "functional medicine? Curious what others do for their Behcet's from a functional or holistic perspective.\n\nI worked with a regular rheumatologist for about a year and the top 5 or so go-to drug treatments did not work out for me. Imuran made life \\*better\\* but not \\*good\\*. Eventually found a functional medicine nurse practitioner and improved by 80-90% by:  \n\\- stopping! hormonal! birth control! pills!  \n\\- balancing thyroid by taking T4  \n\\- taking progesterone  \n\\- quitting gluten and dairy\n\nEventually went off Imuran as symptoms are mild and the meds made no difference.  \nWorking with her was such a relief I have become really frustrated that none of these options were explored before.\n\nHowever, in 3-4 years my estrogen levels have never gotten up to normal and I feel a bit like we have hit a wall\u2026and I am trying to get pregnant.\n\nAnyone else found your Behcet's is related to your cycle/hormones?  \nOr working on it from a functional/holistic perspective? Long post!:\n\nI see no difference in my cycles.\nI take Imuran 100mg/day + 7 of prednisone (that I will slowly decreasing after starting with 60 last August).\nI took vitamin D and other supplements for articulations. But nothing else. My symptoms started in the end of July last year, I had knee pain (, horrible horrible knee pain), red eyes and eventually a vasculitis on the retin + I developed meningitis on my own + little mouth ulcers (6) and I had had genital ulcers 2 years before that. Quite severe, and it happend after a spider bite and me taking corticoids for it, so doctors assumed it was a reaction. Now I know it was the Behcet.\n\nI have been without symptoms since I started my treatment.\n\nI do not use hormonal birth control pills either. It is been quite some years I do not (I am 27). I stoped those way before I had Beh\u00e7et, because they made me feel sick actually. I tried different ones and never worked. Always nauseous no matter what, and an overall feeling of... Meh. You see? Plus, I keep hearing nasty stories about them, and I have a class mate from Uni that had a thrombosis because of them. \n\nSo I used condom for some years, and 2 years ago I changed for a copper IUD after agreeing with bf that we had issues with condoms xD best decision ever.\n\nI always had heavy periods and long ones (7 days, with pain in the first 3, and very heavy flow). I had no change by using the IUD, and neither after taking my medication.\n In fact, my rheumatologist asked if I was taking any hormonal stuff, and told me I should not. Apparently there is some conflict in the effectiveness of hormonal pills and all with what we take - he did not develop the issue because I do not take it anyway, and will never again to be honest. Just not for me I suppose. I would take if I absolutely had to, but I found an efficient alternative that makes me feel much much better.\n\nHowever, cooper IUD makes you more prone to urinary infections, and being on Imuran... It is not easy. It already happened I had a small one. It went with lots and lots of tea and infusions - but again, it was not serious enough. Once in a while I feel it starting to come, so I imidiatley take action to prevent it from settling. \n\nThis said, I do feel \"fine\" otherwise. I have those days when I am not great, mostly the mornings. I shake a lot on my hands and feel heavy. \nI noticed an increase of headaches (I always struggled with migraines but now it is been worse). But nothing that I do not manage with paracetamol. I did stop taking ibuprofen because I was under colchicine for quite some time and it is dangerous to mix them. I had the habit before, of taking ibuprofen for the migraines... Now I lost the habit. \nWhen they are really bad and do not pass with paracetamol alone, I put some chinese balm or even Vick balm to soothe the entire face :v and I take one coffee (I do not drink coffee it is been 8 years, so if I take one it works wonders for headaches- but the flavour now makes me nauseous so it is last option).\n\nI developed skin issues with the Beh\u00e7et. Like lumpy acne-ish. \nI tried a bunch of stuff, creams and all... I seem to have recently found a combination that works for me: rice flour and bicarbonate to wash my face at night and morning. After reading a lot a lot, I decided to try this. It works for me. No more lumps. I do this every day, but, I stop once in a while for a week or so to test and also not to make my body \"addicted\". It is been 3 months I do this, and so far my skin seems to be improving. \n\nI noticed that hair dyes were suddenly affecting my hair and scalp. I never dyed my hair on a regular basis because I usually choose tones that I already naturally have, so when I dye, it lasts really a long time with optimal colour and all.\nAfter starting the medication, it started to burn my scalp, and I noticed my hair falling more and being overall weak.\nI changed to henna. Problem solved, and I even like the colour better. No more root issues either. My hair is back to normal, long, strong, hydrated. \n\nI also drink more water and tea than before, it is a choice I did to keep my kidneys and blader working well: I heard stories and decided to do everything in my power to try to minimise risks. So far, I am perfectly fine about those too. Plus it helps with the swelling of the prednisone.\nI started now, couple of weeks ago, to avoid sugars because I am finishing my thesis and I do not do anyyyy sports xD lost 8kg in 2 weeks. I am adapting the ketosis diet to my situation.\n\nCannot really tell you about the pregnancy stuff tho... My gynecologist was glad I changed to the copper IUD because according to her, my ovaries are big and very healthy and all my levels suggest I am quite fertile and apparently I was lucky not to get pregnant (even with condom- since there are still risks like, not the right size etc). I do want to have children one day, but bf and I are just settling in new place, so it is not for now anyway.\n\nBut I read Beh\u00e7et works in mysterious ways with pregnancies. You ought to talk about that with your doctors I suppose. I am sure there is something you can do about it! \n\nOverall, I consider myself very lucky. I see all the time here how people struggle with their treatment, and while things are not perfect, in spite of my ups and downs, I am luck. I also think I have a very very good rheumatologist, he is very down to earth and a specialist of Beh\u00e7et - Guess that helps.\n\nI wish you very good luck in your endeavours:) stay safe! And hope you find a solution I want to stop birth control so badly. I have suspected endo and every time I have tried stopping, I end up in the ER :( I am glad this has worked for you, but the words \"functional\" and \"holistic\" ring alarm bells for me. As well as a nurse practioner being the primary overseer of your care; the level of training nurse practitioners go through is not at all near the level of training an M.D. or D.O. physician goes through. We are talking about tens of thousands of hours. Again, I am glad it is worked for you, but I am never going to resort to functional or holistic care, let alone put a provider with 10,000 less hours of clinical training in charge of my care. I have been burned by rheumatologists too, I understand where the desire to find alternatives comes from. No functional medicine, only real medicine because I went half blind and I would rather not go completely blind, I had testicle inflammations and I would rather not become sterile. Beh\u00e7et's is a serious problem, and you are on a placebo cure. You are lucky your BD is very mild and doing nothing allows you to not have issues. Every point you make is 100% valid. Words like *functional* and *holistic* are virtually meaningless, as anyone can use them. That being said, there are some amazing doctors who *do* use those terms. And there is definitely something to be said for finding practitioners who approach things differently than your average healthcare provider. Traditional medicine has failed so many of us with chronic illnesses that an alternative approach is often needed. \n\nI also agree that it is probably best to have an MD (or DO) overseeing your treatment plan. However, there are advantages to seeing an advanced-practice nurse. They are generally more patient-centered, which is important for those of us with chronic illnesses. \n\nUltimately, I agree with everything you wrote. But I think there is room for functional/holistic/alternative-medical practitioners alongside more traditional providers. And I also think there is room for NPs in a patient's treatment team, if not the overseer. Personally, my PCP is an MD (as are two of my specialists), my psych provider is an NP, and my urologist is a PA. It is great to see a diverse group, as I get to hear things from many perspectives. But, at the end of the day, it is *me* who ultimately makes my own medical decisions. I am sorry you have had a rough joinery. I am not sure if you are aware but progesterone is a birth control hormone however. For example, it is used in the \u2018mini pill\u2019 which is an alternative to oestrogen and prevents pregnancy. There is evidence that Beh\u00e7et\u2019s flares are linked to hormones changes but you will not be able to get pregnant whilst taking progesterone. Perhaps speak to a medical professional about this. When you say \u2018balancing thyroid\u2019 do you mean you were diagnosed with hypothyroidism via a blood test? Because if not then you should not take T4 as a supplement. However, If you do have hypothyroidism then you need to be seen regularly by a doctor and not a \u2018functional\u2019 nurse as there are long term systemic implications if hormone levels are not correctly controlled. Saying this, I have cut out gluten and dairy too and found it helps my symptoms. There are a lot of medicines other than imuran and it can be a case of finding one that suits you but if you can manage without then I am happy for you. I hope you find a Dr that is the best for you, I am 69 and have had behcet's since I was a born, and did not get diagnosed until three years ago. So you can only imagine how many Dr's I have seen and how disappointed I was each time with no answers and a look from them that I must be a hypochondriac. Also back when I had periods I always had flare ups of different symptoms a week before my period and lasted thru my period, I still do not know how that is related. 69? Nice. \n\nI am a bot lol. I would not be surprised if hormones were related. There is a TON that incredibly well trained doctors do not know much about behcets and it is just not common enough to have a lot out there on it. I agree that holistic approaches are not a substitute for medical care, I think they can ABSOLUTELY be a good supplement to it and I think are necessary. Sleeping well, taking care of yourself, eating well, managing stress, and taking care of any related or other health conditions etc can definitely help. I watched a video recently about the link between autoimmune disorders and mental health and they do not know which, if any is causal, but they can be clearly related and research is still being done. Functional Medicine IS REAL medicine. These are medical doctors providing services often overlooked by other M.D.\u2019s who are bound by golden handcuffs (also known as coding for insurance reimbursements). Why stop birth control? Does it make behcets worse?   For sure", "School with Behcet\u2019s I am a college student with a busy week. I have a 7 minute speech to deliver and class discussions to attend, discussions that I must be active in. And, I am having a terrible, horrible, noticeable flare.\n\nMy mouth is an absolute disaster. You can see it, you can hear it in my voice. And it hurts so bad to talk. But what do you do? Failing is not an option.\n\nOuch. I feel your pain. When I was in college, I often had a mouthful of ulcers. They started in middle school and persisted until grad school. Speaking, whether in front of a room full of people or from my seat, was something I dreaded. It hurt like hell and made me super anxious. \n\nBut I got through it. And so will you. \n\nDo not worry too much about other people watching you or hearing it in your voice. I promise you most of them are too self-conscious to be thinking about you - they are worrying about their own speeches. \n\nMy advice, first and foremost, is to have that 7-minute speech down cold. Practice it until you are overflowing with confidence. That will at least eliminate some anxiety. \n\nBut what about the pain? Is there anything that helps you? How about something like a milkshake or another cold drink? Maybe pour a shake into a water bottle and take a few sips throughout the speech. \n\nYou will get through this. I know it sucks. I know it hurts. But, as you said, failure is not an option. So what does that leave? Success: it is yours for the taking. Thank you so much for this kind reply. Just knowing that someone understands and has had the same experience really helps.\n\nThe milkshake in a water bottle is a brilliant idea! I will do that!\n\nThank you! You are very welcome. Best of luck! Sounds like you need to reach out to the school's disability services for accommodations; I think they and your professor would be very understanding if they knew what was going on in your mouth/body. I think maybe they would accept a post-class write up, or being able to type your discussion points in class. For the speech I would ask for the ability to prerecord it, or find a way to present something alternatively. \n\nIf there is anything I have learned from my time with multiple disorders/illnesses, it is best to let whoever needs to know, know before you are struggling too much. People, specifically bosses and professors, will first see anything you do not do/mess up doing as a sign of laziness/carelessness, unfortunately. I have had the best success with getting in front of things I know will become issues for me. In the past I have contacted my teacher and explained and we were able to arrange something else, like a video instead, or to give the speech at a later date. Maybe even just giving them your notes and or writing an essay instead. If you cannot get help contact whoever is in charge of accessibility (if you do not know who email your counselor or the nurses office), and explain your condition and that you need accommodations and cannot speak until your sores get better. Good luck, I had to temporarily drop out this year to take care of my Beh\u00e7et\u2019s!! Honestly, speak to the professor and do they still sell chloraseptic? Spray the inside of your mouth with that stuff and you will get about 15 minutes of dramatically decreased pain. It used to be how me and my sister were able to eat as a kid when we had too many ulcers. I have tucked squares of gauze in between my teeth where they were cutting into my tongue and/or cheek lining overnight and it worked really well for 'smoothing out' rough ridges! Also, check in the oral care or baby teething section at the pharmacy for some numbing gel - I hope that helps during your presentation! Good luck.", "The jelly! It burns!! So my husband just walked in on me attempting to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I know, reckless of me, but I was just so sick of pudding and mushy shredded wheat, I decided to live life on the edge.\n\nH: Is that.. (glances down to confirm what I am eating) ...burning your mouth???\n\nMe: (looking like a dog trying to eat peanut butter while only using the middle-left quarter of the roof of my mouth) um... yes... actually...\n\nAfter many small bites and lots of water, I can report that it was worth it. Brave of you.... I hope it felt good n.n\"\"\"\nI do not have that issue with my Beh\u00e7et, but when I was with 60mg of prednisone I could not eat sugar (to avoid diabetes).... I remember when I finally could eat sugar again, chocolate bars were a must I feel this.\n\nNot currently right now, thankfully.\n\nGetting ready to tempt fate with a fridge full of lemons... My body was just craving some sort of non-daily protein. I usually try not to aggravate it more than necessary. Hope it did not come across like that I really understand the carvings!\nI mean, we still need to enjoy life..... Sometimes it is alright I suppose I always want chocolate when my mouth ulcers are their worst.... it burns so bad!!! Get the most agressive sparkling water you can find and have a sip before each bite, it anesthetize a bit (I recommand San Pellegrino) That is insane. \n\nI mean I am curious to try it now on purpose, but when my oral ulcers are at the worst the last thing I want is anything carbonated.\n\nI mean ordinarily I really enjoy my seltzer water, so I always have it around but never during a flare up. Well, it hurts like hell first - I probably should have said that first ahah - but then the pain diminishes. Also, I looked it up and I found ( saying \" *Consumption of carbonated drinks can disrupt oral wound healing.* \", so maybe be cautious? I was basically using this as a last resort to eat, as I just had new flares developing before the old one were healed anyway. Chocolate icecream?", "experiences quitting otezla So i have been on the drug for almost a year, the GI issues and nausea really dont go away even if reduce to once daily. It has been effective, i get very very minor oral ulcers months apart that stay only 24 hours. My pseudofolliculitis on my legs is also gone. I stopped and in like 2 days my  folliculitis came back. No ulcers yet(to be honest my ulcers are never really severe). But ive had alot of tension headaches and nausea on otezla i want to try to get off it see if those get resolved or they are just behcet headaches. Any experienceS? I took otezla for a year and it was awful, I had terrible GI issues. You should talk to your doctor on the best way to stop it. \nI was taking it twice a day and I stopped it all together and it was miraculous, it was the first day in a year where I did not have any GI discomfort. Also suffered headaches from Otezla. I was only on it like 10-13 days though before I stopped. It was a constant headache from waking up until bedtime. I have been on Otezla for a month now with only minor GI issues and headaches. But better than the constant four or five ulcers in my mouth.  Hopefully I have better luck than you guys. Taking Otezla for over 2 yrs now. I take less than prescribed- I am on 15mg/day (30mg is my dose). I have been in full remission this past year.\n\nToday I am having my first mild flare up of neuro-BD (it is been at least a year &amp; a half since last flare) but no big deal, can manage by resting. \n\nStarting getting better within a month of taking Otezla. Decided early on to start taking it at night before bedtime to manage nausea because that was rough. Have not had issues since I switched to evening dose. \n\nI consider stopping all the time because at 15mg I am really how much it is doing. I have healed my BD &amp; gone into remission for 10 yrs without meds before and I think this remission has a lot more to do with other changes aside from the Otezla but wanted to share my experience in case it could help. Thank you to all the replies. Yeah so far ive had a small ulcer that lasted like 4 days. Folliculitis is back. Headaches and gi are better tho. Ill stick to it till feb when i see rheum. I want to run inflammation markers while off. But yeah been having re emergent back pain that was gone while on otezla. Guessing what and what isnt behcet has beem the most annoying part of this disease most of these may be completely unrelated to behcets outside of ulcers and my folliculitis  :((( sending out a prayer to our brothers and sisters with actual organ involvement. Feel petulant to complain about headaches and gi lol.", "Consistent mid day nausea off and on for the last year. Have you experienced this? Every day around two PM I start feeling nauseous. Almost the same feeling when you are in  room with paint fumes too long. I am fatigued, my head is aching and my stomach is churning. The only way I feel comfortable is to lay down and do nothing. This has been happening in spells for at least a year now, last year it was every single day without fail for weeks on end. I am tired of feeling this way. Not to mention right now I am having my worst below the belt outbreak in four years, and my joints have been incredibly sensitive. Have you felt this way too? Yes, I have felt that way too. I definitely had nausea as a symptom, although mine was not specific to time of day. That fatigued feeling also is familiar to me, and I most commonly have felt like that when I was also anemic. They think the anemia came from\ninflammation and ulceration in the GI tract preventing nutrient absorption. Have you ever had an endoscopy done to see if you have any GI involvement with your Behcets? (I will say that this is not something I experience anymore now that I am on Remicade- hoping there is a similar solution for you to avoid these symptoms!) I have never had an endoscopy but maybe it is time. I will talk to my doc about it. my stomach sounds like a hot tub right now. That is exactly how mine sounded, that whooshing bubbling sound. Hopefully I am wrong and your GI tract remains unaffected, but checking in with a good gastroenterologist cannot hurt \ud83d\ude42 Yes whole lot of gurgle going on in there. We shall see what they say. I have nausea nearly every day as well. I had an endoscopy had it was inconclusive. I do not have any solutions just letting you know you are not alone. Thanks, it helps honestly. What do your eating habits look like? Do you eat shortly before the symptoms appear? Nausea could also point towards the liver.\n\nJust something you might also want to check out if the endoscopy shows nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nGood luck! I have dealt with bouts of insomnia off and on my entire life. When I have not been sleeping well, I experience several physical symptoms in addition to the usual tiredness, brain fog, etc. One of those symptoms is nausea and loss of appetite. The longer I go without getting a good night's sleep, the worse it gets. Another symptom I get from lack of sleep is extreme hot/cold flashes. I often get them anyway, but they are much milder in comparison when I have been sleeping fine. Definitely relate to that, I get this bile in my throat when I do not sleep. And the hot and cold flashes. I would look for connections in your environment. Food, activities, surroundings. I have had some recent activity in the mornings where I black out for a second and then have a very heavy feeling and nausea. My neurologist is doing a work up to test for TIAs. But that is a rare scenario. Try wearing Sea Bands and carrying some anti nausea medicine or ginger chews once you eliminate everything environmental. Hopefully that helps until you find the source.", "Getting rid of dormant oral ulcers I have not had new oral ulcers in at least two-three years now (had Behcet\u2019s symptoms appear 2011). However, I have several in my gums that have \u201chardened.\u201d I do not take any medication for BD...just healthy diet and lifestyle. Has anyone been successful at removing these types of ulcers? How did you do it?", "How did behcet affect your life long term? 22f I am working on getting diagnosed with buhcets. I just spent 4 days in the hospital with a catheter because of genital ulcers and inflammation not allowing my body to urinate. (All std test negative) I also have tons of oral ulcers on top of it and a few on my back. This is all new to me. I never would have guessed something like this would ever happen. Being told you more than likely have this rare auto immune disease when you are in the worst pain of your life is scary. But with past medical problems (chronic pain, GI issues, major skin problems) it makes sense. I cannot help but be anxious about what this means for my future. How did your way of living change when you were diagnosed? What has helped you cope? What helps the pain? I will take all the advice/knowledge I can get. Stress is a huge deal in Behcets. It triggers all the symptoms and makes them almost unbearable. Do what ever is reasonable to reduce stress in your life. That helps the most. Another user commented about stress, and I will double on that. Stress is able to shoot up flares on its own, so keep it down. Also excessive physical strain: the golden rule is to do less intensive stuff for a longer period of time.\n\nAfter the diagnosis my life got much better: adalimumab surely makes you tired, but at least I do not have any more symptoms! I was diagnosed with Behcet's when I was 16 in 1997. It fit perfectly. After years of not knowing what was causing all my strange, painful symptoms, it was almost a relief to have a diagnosis. The good news is, Behcet's is often worse earlier in life, particularly for those of us it starts to affect early in life. For me, between the ages of 15-25 were the worst. Since then, it is been mostly uphill. So keep your head up. A lot of people get slammed with symptoms for a few years and then the disease eases up. Hopefully, you will be one of them. Be well! I cannot second this enough.", "Pathergy test? My rheumatologist is requesting a pathergy test to confirm my diagnosis, but I literally have no idea where to go. She said a dermatologist should do it, but I have called all within 10 miles of me and none have even heard of it. I like in Eastern PA if that helps anyone. \n\nDid anyone ever need this test done? I am also getting the HLA typing, but I am assuming my rheumatologist just wants me to get a definitive diagnosis?\n\nI am going to another rheumatologist next month (my 5th) to get another opinion as I have had so many symptoms I just want a treatment already! It is just a skin prick. Why did not she just do it? Because she is not a great rheumatologist and I am stuck with her at the hospital until I find a better one :) The pathergy test is not even a reliable test, it cannot be used for diagnosis. Usually, they diagnose Beh\u00e7et\u2019s through symptoms and by dismissing everything else. The HLA typing can point you in the right direction but it is not also bulletproof. You can have it positive without having the disease and you can have negative and having the disease. But, if all of your tests are negative, if you have the symptoms and if the HLA typing is positive it is likely that you have it. ( Here is a non-image ( about the specifics of the international diagnostic criteria. \n\nBut yeah, as others have said, a positive pathergy test is a small part of the BD diagnosis. I have seen way too many rheumatologists deviate from the accepted standards for a diagnosis, which can often delay a diagnosis and lead to more serious complications long term. Thank you for this! The issue I am having is unfit the criteria perfectly, yet my doctor keeps ordering more tests almost like she does not believe it is Bechets? I am a textbook case, as all my other doctors say, and she is ordering these things that only further support diagnosis without even starting specific treatment. If she is continually ordering tests to try and \"confirm\" behcets she is probably not your best bet for a doctor. It is a symptomatic diagnosis disease not a test one. I would try and get a new rheumatologist as soon as possible. My rheumatologist talked to me for about five minutes after looking at my records and said \"well that is behcets\" which made me wish I would seen him ten years ago. Yep, currently trying to get in but with starting a new job &amp; the wait times it is been a mess. I think my rheumatologist is trying to differentiate if I have Lupus or Bechets, which is weird because every other one of my doctors has told me I likely have both (including other rheumatologists). I am trying to get in for new ones but the wait times are 6+ months, so at this rate I am just doing anything she asks so I can start treatment. I am on plaquenil &amp; colchicine but they stopped helping as much so it is just a waiting game now. Awww I am sorry you have a shitty doctor. It def does not help things. For sure. I moved a few months ago and my past doctor was so great, so the step-down is the worst! I think lupus can be diagnosed through the ANA test. \nBut the thing is, the treatments for lupus are very similar to the ones you take for behcets. Plaquenil and colchicine are usually the first things they try. Plaquenil usually works well for lupus patients. \nIf they are not working, you still have tons of other options to try so do not freak out, they will figure something out. I failed my pathergy test but had it \u201capproved\u201d from a reaction I had to acupuncture. Save yourself the office visit and possible \u201cprocedure\u201d fees and take some pictures of your skin symptoms if they need skin proof. I have numerous pictures but I have come the conclusion my rheumatologist just really sucks. They insists it must be \u201cmedically documented\u201d or seen in person. Absolutely ridiculous and I am looking for a new one currently, but the wait times are rough. Oh. Sorry to hear that. I have had to fire a few specialists over the years. Hold on the this one while you shop around. They do not need to know you are meeting with anyone until you are ready to fire them. How comfortable are you with your primary? Could they step in with some creative ideas until you change docs? My primary is amazing and he is definitely willing. I just think he is done everything he can over the past few months. Great to hear. My primary is the only doctor whose hands I would literally put my life in. Having that strong anchor on your team is priceless. I take one day a year and send breakfast to her office because they are just THAT awesome.", "Periodontal issues My wife has been doing ok with cancer sores lately, but ongoing red gums that feel like they are cuts are troubling her when eating, rheumatologist has recommended increasing prednisone dosage and frequency of infusions and dosage in that as well. In the meantime is there anything we can do to help her? Has anyone else had gum issues along with Behcets? Thanks", "Fmf &amp; Bechets \nWas wondering if anyone has both familial Mediterranean fever and bechets disease. I have fmf and have just been diagnosed with bechets as well. \nBecause I have Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon / ulcers / erythema nodosum. My doctors say there is a lot of unknown with the diseases and they can overlap. But the ulcers and erythema nodosum is related more so with bechets than my fmf. \nAlso any successful treatments for anyone? \nI have been doing pretty well. I have HBP from inflammation in my lungs and heart caused by my fmf flares but colcrys has been helping a lot. \nIt varies for me though. Sometimes my flares are my appendix. Or just focused on my joints. I also get these terrible migraines with fever. \nBut I was not diagnosed with fmf until I had a mini stroke. Even then took many months with wonderful drs. \nI also wonder if I would have got bechets or raynauds if I found out about my fmf sooner. \nJust do not know anyone besides my niece like me.

Best of luck to you and hope your doing well \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Differential Diagnosis Hi guys,\n\n\n28 year old male, otherwise healthy, 185 lbs @ 6ft. I have had mouth ulcers my entire life. A year or so ago, I started having ulcers in my throat. At the time (first presentation), I was super worn out, and did not want to get out of bed for 3 months. I constantly felt tired. I kept having chills, and feeling feverish, but without having a fever. Ever since then, every few weeks I have had throat ulcers that last approximately a week or two. During that time I feel feverish but often do not have a fever. I have an inability to focus and just feel run down. Every now and again my eyes will be red for short periods (never lasted for more than say an hour or so).\n\n\nThe sides of my throat have been red/inflamed for months. This is usually where the ulcers form. They also form on my tonsils, which are large. Lymph nodes appear to be large as well.\n\n\nI have random sharp pains in my abdominal area that last for a few seconds at a time and occur when sitting.\n\n\nPerhaps unrelated, my memory is AWFUL as of late. It used to be amazing, but I cannot focus and I cannot remember anything anymore -- including things I did or said the previous day.\n\n\nEvery time I eat, my throat swells a bit and I feel like I have to clear my throat constantly and cough and my nose runs. I also always feel dehydrated. (GERD-like symptoms) My doctor says these are unrelated and may be a respiratory issue.\n\n\nOn multiple occasions I have tested igG and igM negative for HSV1 and HSV2. I also had a Western Blot done to confirm this is not HSV. It may be worth noting that my EBV titers are high.\n\n\nEvery time I have a 'flare up', I feel sick. With this latest one I have fluid in the ear and again feel downtrodden.\n\n\n\nOtezla seemed to limit the occurrences but had bad GI side-effects. With Otezla, the flare ups would not ulcerate or would be drastically shorter and just red spots. Otezla also seemed to exacerbate some depression-like experiences I was having, and my doctor decided to pull me off the drug as a result. I loathed taking Otezla because it gave me horrible cramping every morning.\n\n\nI feel defeated. I spend a lot of days crying. As I am typing this, tears are welling up. I hate not knowing what is going on, but I also hate the fact that my rheumatologist thinks this is bahcets, as my endoscopy, colonoscopy, and video endoscopy do not reveal IBS or anything like that. I just want to be normal. I just want to feel normal.\n\n\n* Does this sound like your behcets symptoms? \n* Does behcets every spontaneously clear up/go away?\n* Are there any differential diagnosis (other disorders which produce similar results)?\n* Have any of you experienced the throat sensations I am describing?\n* General advice on how to proceed? \n\n\nMy doctor wants to try weekly inject-able treatments, and I am just not ready for that -- but also, I want to be sure of diagnosis before proceeding to such extremes.\n\n\nPlease help I do not understand most test results so those numbers you have do not mean much to me. I can remember a pain/inflammatory marker that they checked my blood for, the results said normal pain is 0-1 and anything major would be over 10. Mine was like 140. So my doctor said that I must be in a lot of pain, to which I replied no shit.\n\nAnyways, behcets typically gives you mouth ulcers. So I have had them just about everywhere inside my mouth since my diagnosis, including near my throat on that thing that hangs in the back of your throat. It is awful. The loss of concentration you mention rings a bell. When I was first diagnosed I was given steroids and chlorambucil. After 6 months I was switched to mycophenolate (cellcept) and I have gotten off the steroids (but it was hard, took 3 years) and the cellcept has kept me happy for almost 5 years with only minor flares. Maybe your doctor could look into that. \n\nI went to graduate school in England and just so happened to be where there is a special behcets department and so they helped treat me early on and recommended the cellcept. My condition was considered severe and a bit unique but cellcept allowed my body to calm down and heal itself. The drug apparently can have side affects but I have had none. I feel mostly normal most of the time, and it is a precious feeling. \n\nGood luck Hey there, F/24/USA here,\nYour throat/ulceration sounds just like mine.\nI have been told that when you get ulcers in the throat or on the tonsils it will cause a flu like reaction (fever, chills, fatigue) and that has definitely been the case for me. I have had mouth ulcers every day since I was 2 years old, the longest I have ever gone without one is maybe 5 days, but my \u201cflares\u201d are basically constant... one week it could be just bad ulcers, another could be terrible joint pain and fatigue with mild ulcers....etc.\nI have quite a lot of GI issues, a colonoscopy/endoscopy revealed some mild colitis and general inflammation which is normal for behcets. And with behcets you generally get a mix of symptoms similar\nto many other autoimmune conditions without fully having the other condition (gi inflammation similar to ibs or crohns or fatigue and rashes similar to lupus)\n\nIt does sound like you could have behcets but you need to have like 5 of the clinical markers to properly be diagnosed \nMouth ulcers, genital ulcers, skin lesions(erythema nodosum, pustules, pathergy), eye involvement (uveitis), fatigue, joint pain (arthralgia), gi involvement.\nSince behcets is progressive you could have it but only have developed 2 or 3 of the clinical markers at this moment which is why it is very hard to diagnose, it took me about 5 years to progress to the point where I developed every possible symptom of behcets \n\nFeel free to PM me if you would like to talk more  Also, for your other questions. Mouth ulcers are normally a dead giveaway for behcets, and also genital ulcers can happen (I have had both). Symptoms come and go is typical for autoimmune disorders in general. Untreated, my symptoms slowly multiplied over the course of a year and the severity came and went. They eventually hospitalised me and ran a great ton of tests to eliminate possibility of any foreign disease before confirming the diagnosis. My diagnosis journey took almost a year and many doctors. Maybe you could find another rheumatologist to look you over for a second opinion Thank you both for the replies. I am curious if your ulcers primarily focus in the mouth and throat. I said you have had them in both places, but might seem to be almost exclusive to the tonsils and throat. The mouth sores only happen very occasionally now and occasionally I will get one on the uvula.\n\n\nIs there any physical difference in appearance between canker sores and the sores you present? Do they tend to favor one side of the throat/mouth or the other?\n\n\nDo you guys have any of the sort of post-eating symptoms? I have very little joint paint if any. Just an overall exhaustion is what I would describe it as.\n\nThanks again! Heya,\n\n\nThe HSV = Herpes Simplex Virus, EBV = Epstein Barr Virus.\n\n\nJust wanted to rule those out before accepting Bahcets.  \n\nIs there any physical difference in appearance between canker sores and the sores you present? Do they tend to favor one side of the throat/mouth or the other?\n-Canker sores and behcets ulcers are basically the same thing. ( is a picture of what they look like. I most of my ulcers on my bottom lip, tip of my tongue and my tonsils. My tonsils get inflamed sort of like tonsillitis about once every other month (sometimes even just for a day) \n\n\nHow long did it take for genital symptoms to present?\n-my first genital ulcer came about 4 years after my diagnosis, I get them about once every 2-3 months \n\n\nDo you guys have any of the sort of post-eating symptoms? I have very little joint paint if any. Just an overall exhaustion is what I would describe it as. Is it odd that I do not have joint pain?\n-post eating as in GI? Yes, as I said before I do have colitis/ibs like symptoms all the time.\nMy joint pain comes and goes, I do not think it is odd for you not to have it and if you have behcets you may have just not developed it yet.\nThe exhaustion for me is often the worst symptom, sometimes it is truest overwhelming and debilitating \n\n\nHow long do your eye symptoms present? Hours at a time? Days?\n -My behcets started progressing around age 16 but I never developed uveitis until I was 24, for the last year since I got my first uveitis flare I have had about 6 major flares of uveitis but it seems like I have a constant mild inflammation in my eyes, for about he first 4 months it was only one eye but now it is both. My flares tend to be relatively short, a few days to a week. I personally had an allergic reaction to the steroid eye drops they use to treat uveitis so I have been trying imuran (my second time trying) to see if it will lessen frequency.  Thank you SO much! Found all the symptoms on his form to be similar to what I am experiencing and was wondering if anyone could tell me if they have had symptoms like mine. I started having horrible pain and inflammation in all around my vulva, thought it was herpes, except they are clearly ulcers, not blisters. I was stared on valcyclovir 3 days ago but everything has worsened. I now have an ulcer similar to a canker sore on my lower lip. It matches the sores on my genitals as well. My knees and ankles are aching horribly, never had my joints hurt in a way like this before. The ulcer on my lip was preceded by what felt like a round bruise under my lip, almost like I had been hit in the lip and it swelled up. I truly do not think I have HSV-2 which is what the doc said. Does anyone know if symptoms can present very quickly as in my case? Also I have been extremely sleepy, far more than usual. Feels like I could sleep all day and some. \n\nIf it sounds like behcets, what type of doctor should I see? Will an OBGYN be able to diagnose this? Thanks.. worried:(  The visual appearance of HSV varies. Is the ulcer on your lip inside or outside of your mouth? \n\n\nWHILE YOU HAVE VISIBLE SYMPTOMS: You should have a PCR DNA swab done to confirm HSV. This is the most accurate way to quickly determine this conclusively.\n\n\nHumans develop antibodies at different rates (up to 6 months on the traditional herpes igg blood test) -- so my advice is to go get the swab done now.\n\n\nBear in mind, herpes can cause systemic symptoms on initial presentation as well. Incubation period from first contact is 2-22 days, but typically within the first week.\n\n\nAlso, does not necessarily mean HSV2. HSV1 accounts for 50%+ of genital infections. The ulcer on my lip is on the inside. I was expecting oral herpes to be cold sores not ulcers. I did have a swab test done and I am awaiting the results. Can herpes present as oral and genital at the same time? I heard this was uncommon but I am unsure of that.  Not impossible during incubation. Especially considering both oral and genital exposure tend to occur at the same time...\n\n\nNote, the first presentation (and subsequent) CAN be inside the mouth and while traditionally herpes presents as a clear blister, that does not make it always the case. The severe pain you experience down there and body aches match a friends experience fairly well -- but again, the test will tell for sure.\n\n\nI do not have first hand experience. Only countless hours of pouring over medical journals when I originally was trying to isolate my condition and speaking with friends impacted by this.\n\n\nMy advice is to wait for the result of the swab test and go for there. \n\n\nSomeone else here can chime in if this sounds like their experience with Behcets.", "Behcet\u2019s and Pregnancy I have a posdible behcet\u2019s diagnosis and i m 18 weeks pregnant. I had no symptoms untill today when my elbows and wrists started aching. I m scared. Has anybody Any pregnancy with behcet\u2019s experiences? My current pregnancy actually just sent me into remission after over year long flare! Your are probably just under stress right now. Try to take some time to yourself to allow you body to heal girl. Also, I have had 2 previous pregnancy. One preterm from breech baby, other would not be evicted and had to be removed via c-section lol", "Johnson and Johnson Vaccine Just got the J&amp;J COVID vaccine tonight- anybody else had this new one? Curious to hear how it has been for fellow Behcets/Remicade patients. So far just a sore arm and some light neuropathy for me (3 hours in). I just got shot one of Pfizer yesterday, also behcets and on remicade. Sore arm, ran a small fever yesterday but otherwise okay today! Update for anybody interested- had a hard time sleeping last night and was pretty sick by morning. Fever stayed between 101-102 all day and I have had a sore throat, headache, and fairly severe body aches. Fever broke about 24 hours out from the vaccine and the other symptoms are slowly improving now. Not the debilitating reaction I have heard described by others who had reactions with the other vaccines, but definitely an unpleasant day! I hear that flu-like symptoms are rare with J&amp;J, so I am wondering if my condition contributed to the reaction. Overall I am feeling lucky that I was able to receive it and would do it again. Any updates? I am now 5 days out from the vaccine- I commented separately with some info about symptoms in the first 24 hours and do not have a ton to report after that, thankfully. Once my fever broke it has not returned and things are pretty much back to normal. I have had a sore arm, some lingering joint pain (especially in my hips), and have felt pretty fatigued, but it is hard to tell if that is specifically tied to the vaccine as those symptoms are not terribly uncommon for me. I coincidentally had a checkup about 36 hours after the vaccine where they did bloodwork that was all normal except my liver labs, which had really spiked (very unusual for me). The doctor was not concerned and said it was probably related to the vaccine and would resolve quickly on its own. I had 2 family members also get it this week and they have had no reaction beyond a bit of a sore arm. Thanks so much for keeping us updated. Glad to hear you are headed back to \u201cnormal\u201d", "Plasmapheresis treatment for behcets Has anyone undergone plasmapheresis treatment for behcets?\n\nI found several studies where the participants had improvement. Interesting. I would never heard of plasmapheresis being used for Behcet's before. I did a PubMed search and found a couple of articles from the early 1980s about it. Looks like, for people with severe Behcet's who do not respond to conventional treatments, it might be worth a shot. All I could find were case studies, no controlled trials. So I would say it is inconclusive whether or not this actually works. But again, if biologics, immunosuppressants, and steroids are not effective, plasmapheresis might be worth trying. I agree. I cannot believe it is not the first line of treatment before  chemo type drugs . I am new to all of this. My partner of 4 months has had behcets for 6 years. Has severe flair ups and had several strokes early on so I am looking for as much info as I can find. This community it awesome for that. A wealth of info and experiences. This community IS awesome. There are also several wonderful FB groups, if you were not already aware. Last night, I was listening to a lecture about a different autoimmune disease and they mentioned plasmapheresis for the same reasons we discussed. Highly effective, but needs to be repeated every so often. Made me think of you. Weird synchronicity lol\n\nedit: \"listening to a lecture\" instead of \"lectured\" Weird synchronicity is definitely my wheel house.", "22F diagnosed at 16, breast ulcers || TLDR below I have been having Behcet's symptoms since I was about 8, and as im sure you all know, it took SO FUCKING LONG to get my diagnosis. I used to use colchicine but a few years back i nearly OD'd on it so now doctors wont prescribe it to me. That part really sucks because I really dont have anything to help but consuming ungodly amounts of vitamin C and trying my damndest to eat healthy, stay active, etc.\n\nAnyway, about a week ago or so I guess i had a  Erythema nodosum that ulcerated on my breast. its grown quite a bit, and is rather painful when i clean it etc. I would go to a doctor, but I am not actually insured right now because my mom kicked me off her plan to 'save money'. Worse still, I work in a warehouse and sweat constantly, so I have got all the fixings for another debilitating infection. I really cannot afford to take off that time from work if I do get sick though, because I just got a car, and I am finally moving out of an apartment.\n\nThis is probably the biggest ulcer I have ever had, and I am very scared and do not know what to do. Should I go a clinic tomorrow since I am off? Should I call a doctor and set up a formal appointment? Should I ride it out with warm soaks and antibiotic ointments?\n\nTLDR: Really bad breast ulcer, not sure if I should go to the doctor because I am uninsured First off, I am sorry you are dealing with this stuff in addition to struggling to access medical care. Our society could and should do better for people like you.\n\nAs for your actual question, if I were in your shoes I would not go to the dr's because I do not ever find them useful for this kind of thing. I would just keep the thing clean- maybe keep gauze over it that you can change throughout your workday? But please do go to a doctor if it becomes hot to the touch or you notice redness expanding outward from the affected area as both of these would be concerning signs of infection. I have been asking for years about vitamin C. My body wants lemons!", "Behcets frustration/advice if you have any I am a 27F with behcets, diagnosed maybe about 5 years ago. Was stuck in the hospital about two weeks with a ton of unanswered questions for a rheumatologist to finally confirm it was behcets, which of course, very little people have heard of even in the medical community. My favorite is when new doctors tell me they \u201cgoogled it\u201d. Well I was on Otezla for a while before the pandemic, and I felt like maybe it helped but I still had flare ups which they gave me prednisone to help with. When 2020 happened, I had to uproot my life and move. Could not keep up with my meds due to healthcare in my new area being absolutely awful. Flash forward to now (or about two months ago) I start having a really bad flare up (arthritis pain on full blast, nausea, vomiting, gut pain). I went to the ER when I was dehydrated, they asked what usually helps. I get put on new but different steroids that help with everything except tearing my stomach to shreds. I finally found a primary care but I cannot see her for about a month and a half, and I cannot see any specialists without her referral- so I just do not know what to do short of going to the ER again. I know they are just going to try to put me on more steroids which I do not think my stomach/intestines can take. I guess this is mostly a rant about how hard I am struggling to live a regular life with this disease (I have had to call out of work all week and I fear my job is on the line) but I guess also a cry out for any advice at all. Anything natural or even just soothing temporary remedies I can do at home to keep myself comfortable JUST until I can get in with my doctor? I eat mints constantly to help with nausea and I am doing a mostly liquid diet to be gentle on my gut, plus lidocaine patches/rest for my affected joint pain- but other than that I just feel so frustrated and lost. Hey, in terms of stuff to do at home I do not have many advices other than try to control your stress levels because high stress is linked with more inflammation so you could try meditation. Try to get as much quality sleep as you can get and try to cut down sugars because they are also very inflammatory. \n\nIn terms of medication, you do not have to be on steroids forever, when steroids do not work or are not well tolerated you can switch to tnf blockers that usually good results on arthritis. For oral ulcers you can also try colchicine, sometimes it helps. You still have lots of medicine to try and I am sure you will find something that helps you. \n\nI wish you all the best, please do not give up and I hope you can find a doctor that will help you. &gt;colchicine\n\nYes!\n\nAnd Lysine, I have to take it every day. L-Lysine changes everything!! I am also taking a sacchromyces bouldarii probiotic (Florastor) and Diclofenac topic gel for joint pain. The OTC name is Voltaren but is much weaker than the rx version. I am in a bit of similar place as you. Diagnosed 7 years ago and doctors that dont know much. I have steroids when the flares are too big or then i get injections of Anakinra. \n\nAt home, I usually reduce the sugar, gluten and lactose to help the stomach pain and reduce inflammatiob \nLocal joint pain I use voltaren plast and a TENS machine. CBD oil helps a bit. And hot bath too.\nFor the mouth ulcers I am on colchicine and I use some mouth wash with hyaluronic acid in it. They help a lot for me. \n\nSending you my support ! It is tough and there is not much help specifically  for Behcet. This is different from person to person, but, do you have fever? if that is the case... insist with your doctors. Really. I had a flare up for more than two months, and after so much time with inflamation in my body, my lunges could not handle it and I started getting thrombus and coughing blood, I could have easily died.   \nI have been almost two years with no symptoms after taking humira... they seem to be reluctant to give it to people in my country, in theory because... reasons, in practice, because it is expensive, so they only give it to people who are really bad. It has it risks, mainly, it makes the possibility of cancer super high compared to a normal person... but well, steroids have even worse problems. Try to talk with them, talk to them about this kind of treatments, insist, because your life may depend on it, I know you are probably tired, and well, it is kind of depressing when you are passing though hell the best you can do is expending your energy in disturbing some lazy incompetent idiots enough to making you stop being a bigger motivation than healing you because they do not care about the last, but... and maybe you can try to look for other doctors, you probably have a right to do so, some of them are very good and they care. Just do not do not let it be, do not wait till your body have some damage that cannot be repaired like I did. I have an appointment mid September but I cannot really get anything sooner, short of just going to the ER, where they will absolutely just put me on more steroids. Which kind of helps (I am about 2 days in to another script of prednisone cause the last doctor said I cannot just stop them abruptly)  but also makes other things way worse, like any intestinal issues. It is just all so complicated. Thanks so much! And thankfully right now I have no ulcers, it is just my gi tract that is so messed up right now. I have cut out sugar and dairy, gunna try out any other suggestions I get. Oh I never heard of that one but I am going to check it out, thank you! Good luck Good luck ! As for the gut when it get really bad I also take some omeprazol to protect it, reduce  all food that give inflammation  and take some CBD oil. That is the thing that works okay for me .", "Sores in the female nether regions? Hey all, I have had mystery symptoms for a long time. A neurologist told me I might have Behcets. I get oral ulcers but I have not noticed any genital sores. (I am female). \n\nI am wondering if it would be exceedingly obvious if I had them? If it is important, intercourse can be painful... which makes me wonder if they are, you know, hiding out or something? I am a man so there is obviously some difference in \"architecture\" down there, but my genital sores were very painful and obvious at first. Now I have not had a big sore in a while but I do get small ones that are not noticeable by themselves, but the inflammation that causes them is. When part of my scrotum gets inflamed, the skin all around gets red and sensitive, and I get an urge to itch. Typically in culminates in small sores forming and healing quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would try and think back about feelings of inflammation in your crotch area, it is possible that you would be getting minor inflammations like I have lately that do not end in open sores but does cause minor pain at the touch. Thank you Hi :) I have BD. Symptoms with this disease vary. I do not have vaginal ulcers, but I do have cervical ulcers. Originally my OB thought it was endometriosis or yeast infections. I ended having an \"exploratory surgery \" and my OB found the ulcer on my cervix. This in combo with my other symptoms helped me get diagnosed. Feom my understanding BD patients have high rate of vaginal infections as well. I had that too and ran fevers regularly. I would suggest starting a medical journal, as this was a great strategy for both diagnosis and ongoing treatment. I make notes and take pictures. Hope this helps. Best to you and your health.\n#becalmbechetson Thank you this is really helpful! My pleasure. :) Mine were all internal. So never noticed until I was sent to my OB for suspected bechets. My pains were never as bad as some describe because of location. They also caused scarring. Now that I know that I have them it did explain my discomfort. I just thought it was female issues whether my period or whatever. Good luck ! Thank you! Hi!!\nI am a girl, 14-years-old. I had vaginal ulcers a few times right before discovering I had Behcet's, they were kind of later development of my usual symptoms so after treatment I did not waited enough to treat the symptoms before the vaginal ulcers appeared.\nWell, at first mine was external but not that obvious, 2/3/4 tiny ulcers, some were barely the diameter of a medium needle. But then they started getting bigger, until the day I had a 1,5\u00d72,5 cm large monster in my vagina, everyday many doctors came to visited in my room to take a look at it, lots of surprised faces, fear faces and worried whispers.\nPersonally, mine were really dramatic but it really depends on the person. Maybe even if you do the treatment will suppress it as it did to mine, good luck \u2606 Thank you! I had my first experience with genital ulcers. Trust me you will know. I could not walk sit or lay down without screaming in pain. Peeing was a nightmare I would scream the whole apartment heard me. I am finally better now but omg I pray to god never again yiiikes! Glad you are better. Thank you, this is helpful", "Is alcohol okay? After I was diagnosed, my doctor gave me a list of inflammatory foods I should avoid and alcohol was on the list. I was wondering if there was anybody on this subreddit who drinks and would be able to give me an idea of how much (if any) one would be able to consume? I think it very much depends on what medications you are using and if there is any issues with that. Beyond that, I think it depends on your current remission/flare-up state. If you are already dealing with a flare, your body is literally working very hard to attack you and heal you from the attacks, which takes a lot of energy from you to do. So in my experience, as long as Im not having a bad day/week then a few drinks normally do not bother me. Even the occasional tie-one-on kind of nights do not usually bother me, but sometimes they do and I wake up the next day with new mouth ulcers our other symptoms. drinking has never been a daily thing for me and I would think that doing so gives your body one more thing to deal with. I would probably listen to your doctor though, especially if you are freshly diagnosed and are trying to get your condition under control. It is likely one of those things that varies from person to person 25/f fully disabled w Behcets\n\nSo I have such a strange \u201crelationship\u201d with alcohol and I know it is has to be because of the behcets \nBasically, sometimes I can drink with absolutely no issue and other times even a few sips will send me into a tailspin. I can always tell which situation I will be in from the first few sips of a drink too. \nBut in general, whether I had a \u201cpleasant\u201d experience while drinking or not, I always wound up very sore, swollen, stiff, achey, tired and full of ulcers after a night of drinking, the worst for me is that my joints would absolutely throb for a day or two afterwards. Alcohol definitely always sets off a flare for me. \nI even found that it seems like maybe my behcets would affect how I metabolized the alcohol or something, sometimes if I were already feeling ill and still decided to have a drink or two, I would experience feeling very drunk very quickly (I do not take daily medication for my behcets, I have never responded to any of the available options) other times it was like I could keep drinking and never get drunk, very strange.\n\nOverall, I decided to quit drinking all together because it just was not worth torturing myself 9/10  It would depend on how much pain medicine you are on and stuff like that. My doctor tells me 4 ounces of alcohol is not going to hurt anything Pain meds? Not immunosuppressants? I am on both. My doctor said it was safe to have 4 ounces of any alcohol.", "Hello, my medical story First of all, sorry for my English, I am from Spain. I am not good at English, but if I go to a specific field like medicine... well, I do not know how to say anything XD.   \nThis is a strange disease, and it can be very different from pacient to pacient. I have always thoutght that the way we treat data in this cases is very bad for research, but I cannot change that, what I can do is, with my limited knowledge, tell my story. It probably will not be very useful, but well, here it goes.   \n\n\nI was diagnosed... three years ago? My first symptom was being tired, very tired, some days, but in that time I did not think I was ill. One week I started feeling a little weird and one day my eye started failing, I went to the hospital and they saw that pressure inside my head was too high, there was a thrombus in the jugular vein. At that thime they thought that I had something in my blood, so I started taking  anticoagulants for over a year, and that was all.   \nA year after that I had fever for over a month, I went to the hospital. In that time I had some ulcers in my mouth, and one in my testicles (the only one I have had so far) and when they took my blood, I had something similar to a pimple in my arm... even though there was not any prove that could say \"this is positive, so you have Beh\u00e7et\", I was diagnosed with it. In any case, I asked for a second opinion in another hospital (and they thought the same). \n\nIn that time I started taking prednisone, some inmunosupressors and still took the anticoagulants.  \nWell. a year after that, around the same time of the year, I started feeling bad... and that time was the worse, I coughed a considerable amount of blood. New thrombus in the lungs, they treated me with more prednisone and quimiotherapy, I stopped taking anticoagulants (after all, thrombus are not caused by the blood in our disease, but because of the veins and arteries).\n\nAnd now, this year, in the same month, the fever is with me again, though this time I think I got it on time and it will not be so bad (at least I hope so). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I find very curious is that I did not have many ulcers, my main symptom is fever, and then thrombus. I trust my doctors, and even if I do not have Beh\u00e7et, it is surely something similar and all that kind of stuff is treated in the same way, but sometimes I even doubt that I have it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, that is all, have a good day. Maybe it is Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)?\nI am seeing a Beh\u00e7et\u2019s specialist in NYC. He told me about FMF and that Beh\u00e7et\u2019s and similar conditions are more common and are treated \nfrequently in the Middle East. He worked in Israel for awhile. Can you try to make an appointment with a doctor there that speaks your language? I take prednisone when I get a lot of ulcers/fatigue and I take colchicine everyday. I still get ulcers but not as bad as before. \n\nYour symptoms sound serious. I think it would do you good to find a doctor that specializes in Beh\u00e7et\u2019s as soon as possible. Also, go to an eye doctor to get documentation on any abnormalities. You need to get treatment to suppress these symptoms before they cause permanent damage.\n\nIf you cannot go to the Middle East, check out the Beh\u00e7et\u2019s specialists at NYU Langone in New York City. \n\nI wish you luck and I hope that you receive the help and support that you need to live a normal life again. You are not alone. Thanks you for reading and for your kind message.\n\nI do not know the name for the inflamation of arteries and veins (vasculitis in Spanish), but that is one of the reasons why my doctors are pretty sure it is beh\u00e7et (i have had thrombus in both of them and they said that it is very strange, the common thing is having them only in veins or only in arteries), I think at first they considered FMF, but maybe they discrded that possibility because of that. I will ask them about it in my next appointment though.\n\nMy eyes (and my skin btw) did not have any problems so far. I had that problem in an eye a couple of years ago, but it was caused by the pressure inside my head, it was not the eye itself.\n\nI take colchicine too (I did not say it before because I thought that maybe it had other name in English), but tbh I do not think I need it (my mouth did not have many ulcers, and that is one of the reasons why I doubt if it is Beh\u00e7et). \n\nI have a normal life... You would not say that I have anything, except, of course, when my body gets bored and starts attacking itself. It seems like It always thinks that un May/June, I have started to notice thw symptoms and go to hospital earlier, I Hope that is enough to keep the symptoms as only fever, if I could sign for that...\n\nSometimes I worry about the secundary effects of medication in the long term, but well, nornally I have more urgent worries.\n\nGoing to other country would probably mean a lot of money, and I trust my doctors, they have had experience with many Behcets (or at least that is what they said) and I went to other hospital with specialists un autoinmune diseases un my country (were it is free), I thought about going to other places but for now I will wait.\n\nGood luck with your life too, and thank you a lot again :)\n\n(Now I have to say sorry because of my English and because I wrote it in a mobile... That corrects to Spanish XD). No worries! I considered writing to you in Spanish but your English is waaay better than my Spanish. :) \n\u00a1Buena suerte y te tengas un buen d\u00eda! &gt; I do not know the name for the inflamation of arteries and veins (vasculitis in Spanish)\n\nThank you for your post!\n\nFWIW, your English is excellent and most of the medical terms are going to be Latin, and AFAIK that is all we use in Western medicine. Its vasculitis in English too. Oh, I did not know, thanks! (I have an English exam this month so let us see if it is good enough). :) Gracias, igualmente. So sorry. The problem with autoimmune diseases is that they usually give rise to other diseases. Maybe ask your doctors to consider that there might be a co-morbidity. A doctor mismanaged me thinking the symptoms I was having earlier this year was my behcets,  while I had actually developed diabetes! Another doctor. Discovered it. Now my behcets is still well controlled and the symptoms I had disappeared after I was put on insulin and metformin for diabetes. Try and do your own research as well to see if you might bounce a few ideas to the doctors for discussion. I wish you luck in your English Exam\ud83d\udc4d... I am having fever this days. I will see the doctor next monday. What I fear the most is a new thrombus (if I keep geting them in my lungs I may start having problems to breath). Tbh, if they say me this will kill me in 3 months, I think I would accept bad news better than if they say me that I am going to be many years with pain, not being able to have a \"decent life\", with people taking care of me, giving me food, helping me go to the bathroom...  Before my diagnostic, when all the symptoms were in my eye, I suspected that I was going to have other disease, (Multiple schlerosis? I do not know how yo say it), because I had an aunt who died because of it, after years of suffering, for her and her daughters. I said to myself that if that was the case I would kill myself. \n\nIt is true that this disease raise the chances of getting others, specially if we consider drugs and radiation (I think I had more than 10 TACs already), in fact some things are going to be \"worse\" in the long term, like more fragile bones and all of that, but for now I see this as not very bad. I mean, nobody has a perfect health all his life, almost everybody has some things through all his life, but in most cases it does not change your life a lot. I was two years with Sintrom, you have to go to controls every few weeks and you bleed more, in your case I guess you have to check your glucose or use insulin from time to time... Now I have fever for a couple of months every year and I have to go to hospital more than I would like... But what is that? That is nothing, really. It is even said that Beh\u00e7et usually gets better with the years. You say \"so sorry\" but I could not care less about it... As long as it does not get worse, fear is the worst part for me. \nAnd thanks for the luck you wished me ^^\nGood luck with your things too :) My doctor always tells me that with behcets you should be mentally prepared for something to always go wrong. Trust me I understand where you are coming from. I spend every other day in hospital despite the behcets responding well to treatment. Half my body the nerves are damaged so I am in daily pain. Diabetes makes it worse. I have glaucoma and lost 50 and 25 percent peripheral vision in my left and right eye. Recurring uveitis...e.t.c behcets sucks. It really steals your life away. I do not know what to say. All we can do is hope it does not get worse like you said. And if it does, lets hope we can steal enjoy something in life. I am sorry to hear that. I do not know your age, but in many articles it is said that Beh\u00e7ets usually gets better with time, and science and treatments certainly get better with time, maybe soon you will get to see that the disease does not cause you more harm, or that you can treat better some of the harm that has already been done, you have to be prepared for something to go wrong, but they say it is important to be optimistic too. \n\nNobody gets old without losing health, in the best cases people only lose energy, reflexes and strenght till they start loosing vision, but that is very rare, I have never met anyone who was helathy his whole life. My father (I am 27, he is 59) is very helathy for his age, but he had stones in his kidneys and he has back pains from time to time, it is said that those two pains are very high. Most people have something... we got worse than average luck in health, that is true, maybe you can say that we get older more quickly, but... I do not want you to feel that it steals your life away... you have it worse than me, I know, I may sound like an asshole saying this, but no life is perfect, I do not know how much does it hurt you, damage in nerves can be hell, I do not know anything about you really, but you sound like a good person, and I would like to think that you still can enjoy many things in life.   \n\n\nI was not going to be an athlete anyway, I spend most of the time in the computer, for job and for fun (programmer), with videogames, reddit, netflix... I like to walk, and play with pets... it has to be very bad to lose that. I wish you a happy day. Thanks for the encouragement\ud83d\ude0a. I am 34 by the way. My mum is 62 and she is perfectly healthy too apart from an occasional cold!quite fantastic. I am grateful for it. Have a good day as well. I currently cannot keep a job but i still hope one day I will\ud83d\ude01 Theres also a specialist in Birmingham, UK", "I do not know how to explain what i m feeling. Had my first behcet\u2019s like symptoms back in july: ankles, wrists, elbow, back and right knee pain, along with headache and a single episode of genital ulcers. All these dissaperead gradually untill september. \n   Now, every month i have some days when i m feeling all those pains are back. For exemple, today, i m feeling mild aches on my arms and legs and my knee hurts when i strech. My menstruation is about to start. \nAll these are giving me huge anexiety. Are you experiencibg something like this ? \n\nI have no official behcet\u2019s diagnosis. No medication. My symptoms regularly flare up around my cycle. It is one of the ways I know to expect my flow. I get the same recurring ulcers in my nose, pain, light&amp;sound sensitivity, indigestion and mood changes. My OBGYN has no skill in autoimmune relationships to menstruation. My rheumatologist is not any better. My PCPhysician from the local clinic rotates often. I use a symptom tracker to keep a record of the changes, day to day. (Folia is great, and offers quarterly cash incentives!) It sounds very cyclical \nAre you on oral contraceptives? No This might help you! It sounds like hormone levels are causing it. If you are on BC, your hormone levels could be slightly altered. I also get flats right before my period. Definitely stay hydrated, try tiger balm for your pain, &amp; ask a dr about keeping a stash of prednisone on hand for your flares", "Fluctuating Vision Hey\nDoes anyone else get fluctuating vision. For example one day I can see perfectly and the next my eyes are dry and My vision is blurry\n\nI just trying to see wether it is linked to behcets or something totally different.\n\nThanks in advance This happens to me too, and I was recently diagnosed with behcets. My vision is actually ok (thankfully!!) but my ophthalmologist said I have severely dry eyes and photophobia. Hydrating eye drops have helped improve my own experience with fluctuations in vision.\n\nThat being said, many behcets patients suffer from uveitis or actual inflammation of the eye itself, which could be damaging long term. Definitely try to see an ophthalmologist if you can! Best of luck. You should go see an eye specialist about it as soon as you can. It is linked to behcets, it is your eyes becoming inflammed, the fluctuations is because behcets inflammation fluctuates, ithe episodes of inflammation can gradually get worse and become constant or become so bad that you get permanent eye damage. I ignoredmy fluctuating clear/blurry vision and dry eyes because one day i had it and the next day my eyes were fine and I was actually wondering if I imagined it had happened. One day I was in an airport around and I suddenly went blind for ten minutes. Then for the next month it was like - frying an egg are we? SURPIRISE BLLLIIIINNNNDDD!! on an escalator at the mall? SURPRISE BLIIINNNNDD!! and it was starting to last for up to 20 minutes or so. It will not just go away if you use eye drops lol. Anyway at this stage I went to an eye doctor but I didnt have the inflammation on the day of the visit and he insisted my eyes were fine and it took a few visits with different people before i got help. If you have already been diagnosed with behcets (which I had not at the time) they should treat your dry eye thing seriously because eye inflammation is one of the major complications they look for with behcets and it is one of the leading causes of blindness in countries were it is a common disease. So yeah, I would see someone about that. Even if it suddenly goes away and does not come back you should tell your doctors you were having this problem. Thanks :) Thanks for the input :) Yes. I do. I have not gotten an ophthalmologist yet but that is next on my list since I got my diagnosis after the nephrologist. I am literally sitting here blinking because today my eyes decided to water and hurt for no reason. They are hot and I look like I have been crying. Its obnoxious and irritating. I use restasis for treatment.. It helps!", "New diagnosis of neuro behcets I feel so alone in my hospital bed, I have been in the hospital for two months straight, for sepsis and malnutrition and weight loss. I was on TPN for three weeks but got a fungal infection in my blood so that was stopped and tube feedings was started. Hospital was unsure what caused all my symptoms, but ended up getting transferred to a bigger university hospital in the next town over due to my history of behcets syndrome and smaller hospital did not know how to treat it. While at bigger hospital I have been diagnosed with Neuro Behcets and SMA syndrome. I am wondering if anyone else has been diagnosed with neuro behcets and what the plan and future looks like. I am genuinely frightened of these two new diagnoses. Rhuematology wants to start me on  IV cytoxan  and what being on that Med is like. I had to stop otezla due to chronic vomiting and nausea and weight loss on that specific med. I am not on any immunosuppressive at the current given my fungal infection and new UTI with blood that I am on Iv antibiotics for. I am so frightened. If I could have some positive stories it would help with my anxiety attacks, been crying myself to sleep in these nasty hospital pillows since I heard brain involvement a week ago. Thanks for taking the time to read and hopefully respond. Feel so utterly alone. I am so, so, so sorry you are going through this. I do not have a story or advice, but I just wanted to let you know I am thinking about you and sending good vibes your way. Take it second by second. \u2764\ufe0f Two years ago I was at the hospital due to a heart attack caused by heart inflammation. Probably due to behcet. I barely survived. I am in my mid 20. This sucks. But I mostly recovered. What I am saying is that nobody knows this disease very well and how it will progress. it can have many symptoms that can come and go. \nI wish you all the best! You already had a Beh\u00e7et diagnosis and then even if it was cured it devolved into neuro? Cause my doctors told me that cannot happen, but I guess they might have done it just to not scare me. \nStay strong is all I can say honestly... Hope everything will turn out well for you. I am sorry to hear you have been dx with Neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s, it is a very scary diagnosis. I have had Beh\u00e7et\u2019s most of my life (50F). It devolved into nuero in my early 30s. I have had hospitalizations, lesions on my brain, mild damage to my brain stem, minor strokes, weakness in my limbs, tremors...etc. My Dr hit it hard with massive doses of steroids and IV Cytoxan. I ended up doing the Cytoxan for 4 years total, but that long of a treatment course is not recommended due to Lymphoma risk. Cytoxan really worked well for me and the side effects were not bad except it accelerated my neuropathy in my feet and hands. The steroids are hell on earth and damaged my body. I also take Imuran sometimes and am currently on Cellcept. The Cellcept works great except I have constant infections and was recently septic. But if you have neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s, you will not survive without steroids. Steroids are the number one treatment that can save your life. So here is the encouragement. I have survived 18 years. My family and my friends make my life worthwhile. Yes I am bed bound most of the time, but I can still drive and walk around places within reason. Please, please, make sure your diagnosis is correct before you commit to treatment. Best of luck to you. I ended up in the hospital for 6 weeks in 2018. They figured it and I am out and working and everything now. I do have last issues like lack of balance and ataxia. You will find a medicine that works when you are healthy enough. I am on Infliximab now. It is pretty good. You will figure it out. My behcets has been really hard to treat, and resistant to a lot of meds. I have tried almost everything used for autoimmune diseases. I am not sure my behcets was \u2018cured\u2019 I have gone into remission a few times but I am in a flare more often than not with this disease. The neuro part came as a big surprise, started having weakness on my right side a few weeks ago( while currently hospitalized, so I guess that a plus) they did a mri of my brain to try to figure out why I have had unrelenting nausea and vomiting and they saw 4 or 5 lesions I believe, and was told by neuro and rhuematology that it is from my behcets... I hope your illness goes better than mine. I was diagnosed 7 years ago with behcets and have had brain mris three years ago, and last year that had no lesions. I have new weakness on my right side, and new brain lesions( new with in the last month, via multiple MRIs) so I do fear it may be correct. I am glad I am in hospital while all this is going on. Your words are very encouraging, I really appreciate them. I am sorry you had such a rough ride with behcets, but glad the meds seem to be helping you. I was told this disease will not kill you, but it can make your life kind of like hell on earth, I am not looking forward to that. Thank you so much for responding to my post, it really did help! I have been in remicade in the past and it seemed to work really well for me, but the doctors are now saying it is not strong enough, anymore, I am really hoping the cytoxan does something. I am am glad that medicine is helping you, it was really helpful to me too. I hope it continues to help you and you can lead a normal life with this stupid disease. Got just diagnosed last summer and MRI found nothing. Adalimumab seems to work for the moment. Oh well whatever'll happen Icll take it, there really is not much to do other than accepting it. That is weird because I was on cyclophosphamide and my rheumatologist told me that Infliximab is the stronger drug but it is expensive. Now I am on that and it appears to be working for now... I know that you can add methotrexate to the Infliximab to increase its efficacy. Luckily you are getting treatment quickly and that will help a lot. If I had been treated for my Behcets sooner maybe my neuro would not be so bad. My daughter now has Behcets, but got treatment early and her prognosis is way better than mine. There is a Behcets Facebook group you can join. I cannot remember name and cannot look it up at the moment. Try searching Behcets on there and you will find it. It is helpful to talk to others. Best wishes! I am so sorry you have this diagnosis. My mother has neuro Behcets with lesions on her spinal cord and she has been hospitalized multiple times BUT she is doing great now! She had an IGG Infusion and has slowly improved. While her symptoms are present, the flare has slowly and steadily gotten better and she is flourishing! I have neuro bechets. My fam has a history of it which was mis diagnosed MS. \n\nLast year I had a severe flare. My muscles were breaking down my adhd was in hyper drive. I was anxious and aggressive, not myself. They could not figure out at first what it was. I have severe red Flushing in my hands, urticaria and arthritis. I was 29 years old unable to open a can of pop or twist my baby's bottle closed,my arms so weak I could barely lift my toddlers. I would get lost driving to places I have been traveling to my whole life. I could not remember anything. I stopped reading and writing (a hobby of mine) because I would not remember things I would read after rereading again and again. I would lose my grip out of no where and drop things. I could not feel my fingers most days. To top it off I have severe rash lesions down my legs and sensitivity to the sunlight. That would not resolve.I isolated myself because people do not understand invisible diseases. \n\nI looked healthy, simply because I was good at hiding it. I did not want people to know there was something so wrong with me.  \n\nI spent months crying myself to sleep before my diagnosis. I layed in my bed wondering if I even would wake up or if tomorrow I would leave my husband widowed and my children motherless. I felt completely helpless, not to mention physically useless. \n\nI got lucky when dermatologist suspected behcet's. Which was the first key to my diagnosis. I began meds and started to do better. Then I got unexpectedly pregnant again which triggered me back into remission. \n\nI do not know what God plan is for you, or me. Or why we have to hold this type of struggle. I can tell you I pray everyday, so far my prayers for recovery have been answered and I pray soon you will find your peace too. \n\nHang in there. There is hope. \n\nAnd also... get many opinions.

Get yourself checked.\ud83d\ude42 What other symptoms do you have? Do you get them consistently? From what I remember the diagnosis requires the main symptom which is oral ulcers. I do not think they necessarily have to be constant, but it seems like a lot of people tend to get them consistently with Behcets. Then you need 2 of the secondary (not sure if that is the term) symptoms, like genital ulcers, a behcets related rash, eye issues, and anything else on the list of symptoms that I cannot remember right now. For me when I have oral ulcers, usually they come in huge breakouts (when I get one I almost always get *at least* one more). I think there are several conditions that can cause mouth sores during flare ups, (I think Crohn's may be one of them) so it certainly could be an initial sign of Behcet\u2019s, but unless the ulcers are an ongoing issue or you have experienced some of the other hallmark symptoms as well I would not assume it is Behcet\u2019s.", "I have not been diagnosed but I suspect I have bechets Let me just start off by saying I do not want to waste anyone\u2019s time and I know this is a safe space for you all and do not want to interrupt that, so please feel free to just ignore this post! \n\nI am 26, male and for a year and a half now have been suffering with a myriad of symptoms. It started off as joint pain, then rashes, sores in my lips, eye redness and intermittent blurry vision. But the worst of all the headaches, insane tension like headaches with horrible nausea. I have seen my doctors they have ran all auto immune tests on me, scans, mri and bloods all usually coming back somewhere within normal. A couple of months before these symptoms occurred I had a really awful bout of strep throat which lasted for around a month. \n\nThe main thing that points me to Bechets is I get sores in my mouth before I seem to get really the really awful debilating headaches. My skin constantly feels sensitive and reactive. I get brain foggy sometimes. Fatigue, muscle and joint pain which never shows up as high CRP or ESR?\n\nI am just wondering if any of you can relate to my symptoms, I seem to have no genital ulcers as of now. \n\nMy question is I am seeing two neurologists at the moment one is more a general neuro and the other one is more of a headache specialist, how should I go about bringing it up with them? \n\nThanks so much for reading I really appreciate it So I will start off by saying that you can leave that \"intruding a safe place\" bullshit out: this place is made not only for people with BD but also for anyone willing to learn more about the disease, so anybody is more than welcome to post and ask questions for any reason.\n\nNow then, the mouth ulcers are a good signal, but they are shared between many autoimmune diseases and are not specific to BD.\n\nThe only kind of BD that affects the brain and would cause severe headaches is neuro-BD, but if that was the case then the MRI would have shown something out of the norm.\n\nIn my case CRP was constantly high, which makes sense given BD is a chronical systemic inflammation of all blood vessels and surrounding tissues. So that honestly doesnt point much towards BD.\n\nAs for genital ulcers, I have never had any and I am a confirmed case also HLA-B51 positive, so it is not a requirement.\n\nJoint pains to line up with a possible BD case, but again it is a symptom shared by many diseases.\n\nMy advice would be of listening what your neurologists tell you and then try and get an appointment with a rheumatologist since although it does not sound like BD to me, given the mouth sores and joint pain, it still definitely could be a different syndrome of the same very broad family. \n\nI wish you the best of luck. I completely echo what Elq3 says... You are in the right place.\nAs Beh\u00e7et's is still fundamentally a symptomatic diagnosis, and quite rare in the West, you might find that neither neurologists know much about it. Rheumatologists yes. But not necessarily neurologists, and in my experience those that do tend to have encountered it through the lens of Neuro-Beh\u00e7et's (a rare subset within a rare condition). You may wish to direct them to the formal diagnostic criteria (which varies somewhat depending on where in the world you are - if you let me know your country, I can send you a copy of the respective accepted diagnostic criteria). \nIf you are in the UK, you may need to go to GP with the same criteria and ask for a Rheumatology referral. Most of the widely accepted Beh\u00e7et's Disease symptoms have several differential diagnoses (similar conditions with slightly different diagnosis criteria) and much as with variations in diagnosis thresholds globally, there is no grand unified treatment methodology or pathway for Beh\u00e7et's - nor, in my view, does a Beh\u00e7et's diagnosis necessarily ensure that you are treated appropriately by clinicians. In my experience, just as the diagnostics are symptomatic, so are (with a few exceptions) the treatments. The symptoms get treated when they arise - unless things are so bad that long term oral steroids or a TNF inhibitor is indicated.\nI see an ophthalmologist specialising in inflammatory conditions for my uveitis; a dermatologist for lesions and ulcers; a gastroenterologist (because I have gastro-BD); a rheumatologist who kind of project-manages and directs my GP; a pain management consultant for, well, pain; an occupational therapist for the joint issues; a neurologist for the nerve issues and following the encephalitis I had during a flare up; a vascular clinician for regular check-ups because of the vascular issues... And that is the abridged list!\nI often talk to people who are pursuing a diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et's because they believe that a diagnosis is the key to some kind of coordinated and streamlined panacea, and I try to explain that whilst a diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et's may *explain* the problem, it does not necessarily bring you or your clinicians any closer to treating the problem, simply because my Beh\u00e7et's Disease may manifest itself entirely differently to Elq3's, or anyone else's. Symptomatic diagnosis, symptomatic management, symptomatic treatment.\n\nPlease feel free to send me a direct message if you have any further questions or just want to chat about this. There are a few Facebook groups that I have found really helpful. There is a great book that is recently been published too... I could easily make this post into an essay, but I will end by saying that you are not alone in this. We have all been where you are now in some form or another. Do not get too overly focused on one disease. The thing is, once you start getting into these autoimmune cns diseases, there is a million of them, they are all rare, and they all basically have the same symptoms. In a couple of weeks in heading back to Mayo for the fourth week long round of tests. The 5th is already scheduled for June. Even Mayo has a hard time with this stuff. Luckily last time they stumbled onto since new clues so I get another mri, another spinal tap. yay me... lol\n\nI have been dealing with this for 5 to 10 years now. At least now there is enough radiological evidence in my chart that doctor's have stopped trying to convince me in nuts. If you get overly focused on a single disease (like bechets) you kind of play into their hands. They will run the easiest test they can think of to \"prove\" you do not have it, and then what? If you do a little research you will find out whatever test they ran is like 60% sensitive and now you are arguing with them. Or you will find a new disease to test for, they will roll their eyes, it never ends.\n\nSeek treatment, not a diagnosis. They tell you to take an antidepressant? Take the antidepressant. When it does not work, go back and ask \"now what?\" When they tell you to do yoga, balance your fucking chakras, then go back \"now what?\" You will be surprised just how quickly you can get through all that bullshit if you just play along. Then they are stuck having to actually do their jobs. Good luck! Could be. I have experienced most of the symptoms you have described. I am diagnosed but to this day I am not sure if  have Behcets even with HLA B51 positivity since ive yet to have a recorded event of a more severe manifestation. ESR and CRP always clean. Tons of imaging all over  done with nothing to show for. Im 36 not young by behcets standards. Anyways  all this to say it is a very unpredictable  and complex disease state. I have once brought up the mere name of a behcet to a comptent neuro and he basically yeeted me out, wanted nothing to do with it, which i actually appreciate rather than a neuro foolhardily trying to figure something  he has no clue about. Go to a rheumatologist, stat. Try to find one that deals with behcets, which you prolly wont if you are in north America,  if not just go see a rheum. You are completely right in that a diagnosis is not the silver bullet many to right all their wrongs. While rare i do think honing in on this auto immune spectrum of disease can be life saving in severe manifestations. Doing all the diagnostic ground work can really help in the case of an acute event. Lets say pt has a dvt, ER dept automatically starts anticoag protocol, while if bd is known/suspected immunosuppressants can be administered along anticoag. Arterial aneurysms grow slowly in normal pop, in behcets they may rupture unpredictably  making intervention more urgent, furthermore immunosuppressants need to be administered  to baseline inflammatory  markers before endosurg instead of traditional approach. Acute septic meningitis  cases of parenchymal neuro bd responds well to immunosuppressants etc... Again you are completely right to guard against the presumption that a diagnosis is a panacea, but i would encourage people on the fence to go see rheumatology (not that that you wouldnt yourself just saying) because it can be of value in rare acute events for emergency/icu crews to quickly look in the right  direction rather than running in circles. I am the reverse of you! Lol. I am one of the few who has exceedingly rare mouth sores, but I have still been exhaustively worked up and diagnosed as BD (including eight genital sore punch biopsies and innumerable swabs negative for HSV). This is a great resource for learning about BD and forging relationships with other sufferers. We welcome you, even if you end up not having it! As the person who created this subreddit (under a different name), I fully support this reply, particularly the first paragraph. You said it better than I was going to say it myself! Wow. Just wow. \nNot OP obvs, but can you please send me the diagnostic material for Canada, specifically Alberta (if that makes a difference)? Sure. With pleasure. As I wanted to be certain that I was giving you reliable information, because the information I could find was somewhat outdated, I spoke to a brilliant Clinical Rheumatologist in BC to verify that the details I had were up to date - I have not cited the quotations below, but send me a message and I can send you the original articles:\n\nCanada, in general, uses the 'rule out all others' method before diagnosing Beh\u00e7et's Disease (sometimes referred to as 'the diagnosis of last resort' approach). The diagnostic process in Canada is still probably best summarised by an article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal from 2007 : \"Diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et's disease is based on clinical criteria in the *absence of alternative* clinical explanations.\". This kind of wording is likely a useful insight into the approach of the medical establishment: clinicians are likely to test numerous potential diagnoses prior to applying their accepted Beh\u00e7et's criteria. This is (in my experience) a relatively standard approach in countries where Beh\u00e7et's is considered an 'exceptional' condition.\n\nAfter excluding all other potential diagnoses, the Canadian criteria then reverts to the International Study Group for Beh\u00e7et's Disease diagnostic criteria which was published in The Lancet in 1990 (yes, 1990!) and states that \"recurrent oral ulceration must be present as well as at least 2 of the following: recurrent genital ulceration, eye lesions, skin lesions or a positive pathergy test result\". Confusingly, the Canadian criteria then goes on to say that \"the features of Beh\u00e7et's disease, however, are not limited to the diagnostic criteria: the syndrome can present in a myriad of ways and can involve nearly every organ system\" before then listing numerous other potential symptoms, each of which *could* indicate Beh\u00e7et's Disease. The sum of all this means that the diagnostic process for BD in Canada is as messy, convoluted and - most frustratingly for patients - *subjective* in practice as it is on paper.\n\nThis means that, when faced with two identical patients, the diagnosis of one Rheumatologist in one hospital may differ from another Rheumatologist in another hospital. As with several other (Western) nations, there seems to be a paucity of clinical consensus when it comes to an *objective*, nationally-accepted, set of diagnostic criteria.\n\nThere is, however, some light at the end of the tunnel. In the UK, there is broadening consensus on adopting a unified diagnostic criteria based on several 'subset' presentations of Beh\u00e7et's Disease (gastro-, neuro-, etc.) most commonly seen in 'Western' patients. As with the 1990 publication in The Lancet that I mentioned above, often these criteria are adopted much more widely than just in the UK.\n\nSo, whilst things are likely to remain frustrating for some time to come, some consensus and meaningful change is (at least) in the pipeline. There is hope. ...and yours was the book I was going to recommend! I agree with the comments about not getting caught up in a single diagnosis, but instead seeking doctors that will treat your symptoms. \n\nI think sometimes we can find symptoms where they are not if we are looking too hard.\n\nThat said, if you have eye pain and blurry vision see an eye doctor! I am nearly blind in one eye from a bout of uveitis that was stubborn. It can quickly affect your vision. okay so ive done all of the anti depressants and therapy in the world they told me to take. but how do i get treatment for something symptomatically when they dont even want to hear that im in pain in the first place? Have you a asked for a referral to a pain clinic? I have had a lot better luck at pain clinic than with neurologists. What is funny is half the doctors at the pain clinic are neurologists anyway. lol Echoing this, but also adding your symptoms could be the beginning of Bechets. Unfortunately, it can take years for blood tests to reflect systemic inflammation. The best step is really going to a knowledgeable rheumatologist and seeing what they have to say as well as getting a full autoimmune panel done. Could I get a copy of the diagnostic criteria for the US? I cannot find it anywhere!\n\nAlso, do you mind sharing more about your GI symptoms? I suspect mine are related but cannot seem to find much online. I have just messaged you to find out a little more information. When I have that (and if you are in agreement) I will post my answer. Were you diagnosed with Bechets?", "Hi, so I am 15 have chronic mouth ulcers that last more than a week accompanied with inflamed lymph nodes and now I have this rash on my chest is this a sign of behcet's?  Chronic oral ulcers are certainly a sign. I have also had swollen lymph nodes in my armpit. However, the photo you shared does not look consistent with Behcet\u2019s. I think they are larger, redder, and do not quite have a head, which yours appears to have. Seems like some kind of autoimmune flare-up. I certainly would not jump to Behcet\u2019s. Look for a Beh\u00e7et\u2019s specialist in or area or a rheumatologist that has treated people with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s before. I am working through a Behcet's diagnoses now, at nearly 40.\n\nFWIW mouth ulcers are my primary symptom, and the sores/rash i get above my waist look like your picture. The ones I get on my legs look more like the pictures you find when you look up Behcet's sores. Do the ones above your waste hurt? These do not No. They are just tiny fluid filled blister looking spots, but barely even get red.\n\nbelow the waist they are larger, flatter, and nearly always ulcerate, they go from being sore like a bruise to, well, like a canker sore except on your skin. I have bad circulation in my legs and if I am not super on top of them they can ulcerate and take weeks/months to heal.\n\nThey cannot test specifically for Behcet's but they can rule out most other things. Medication helps a whole lot. Go see a rheumatologist stat. They can do more tests to confirm.", "New drug, Tocilizumab pending FDA approval for Behcet's disease  Hi BD BD zebras! :) My Rheumatologist talked about this new drug pending FDA approval for refractory uveitis associated with Behcet's disease. It is an IL-6 inhibitor. I hope this makes you as excited and hopeful as it made me! :) Fingers crossed it gets approved soon and on the market, as it may be an option for some refractory patients.  \nBest in health to all! **Effectiveness of tocilizumab in Behcet's disease: A systematic literature review**\n\n_We identified 47 patients with Behcet's disease treated with tocilizumab. The mean age at tocilizumab administration was 36.9 years, and 55% of the patients were female. The mean disease duration was 99.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f61.4 months, and all patients had refractory disease in response to prior conventional and biologic agents. Clinical response to tocilizumab varied based on the target organs. Tocilizumab improved almost all patients with ocular (24/25), neurological (6/6), and vascular (7/7) involvement, as well as secondary amyloidosis (2/2). Tocilizumab was also effective in reducing glucocorticoid dose in almost all patients with ocular (19/21), neurological (6/6), and vascular (7/7) involvement. Further, glucocorticoid-free remission was achieved in 11 of 21 patients with ocular involvement and in 3 of 6 with neurological involvement. However, tocilizumab was not very effective for other manifestations, showing clinical improvement in only 8 of 21 patients with oral or genital ulcers, 6 of 14 with skin involvement, 4 of 11 with articular involvement and 3 of 4 with gastrointestinal involvement. Of note, tocilizumab even worsened oral or genital ulcers in 6 of 21 patients and skin lesion in 2 of 15 patients. No new safety signal was reported._\n\n(\n\nThis is very exciting - it seems like it will be a better treatment for BD patients with ocular/vascular/neuro involvement than current anti-TNF treatments. If it becomes FDA-approved for BD, it also means insurance will not fight to cover this as well!!", "if you touch your face, you can get coronavirus ", "do i have behcets? (18F) i have been getting periodic vaginal ulcers since i was about 11-12. i have been tested for herpes through blood test and swab, among other diseases and all have come back negative. i occasionally get canker sores in my mouth as well. i usually get sores when i am sick, and most recently i got one two days after my covid booster shot. i have been to countless doctors about this issue and no one seems to be able to tell me what it is. my gyno said that it could be behcet\u2019s, but i do not have any other physical issues other than occasional eye pain, which makes sense bc i get migraines sometimes. i am also half black and half white, and none of my ethnic groups are where behcets is usually found. i am kind of at a loss now because it has been years with no clear answers. i have been told it could be herpes by a few doctors, but every test has been negative including a blood test. it also does not look like herpes since it is a canker sore on my labia and always in the same spot. it also does not react to acyclovir, and only heals with steroid cream. can anyone tell me if they think i have behcets? i just do not know what else to do.", "BD and Family Planning Hi All! I am wondering about other\u2019s experience with pregnancy or childbirth while having BD. Were you able to stay on your meds? Did symptoms get better/worse? Any complications especially regarding clotting/bleeding? This is a big concern for me because I have history of DVT (for the record I was on hormonal birth control at the time, though no idea if that was a direct factor). My Rheum says that I should be fully in remission before I consider getting pregnant, but I am nearing 30 and no sign of remission in sight. Any insight or personal experiences at all are greatly appreciated! I am trying to get a sense if I should plan on other alternatives to biological children if it is too high risk. Thanks! \u2764\ufe0f I had children without being diagnosed so I probably was in remission during the pregame but after I got hit hard.  This autoimmune group got me into remission with diet ( Best of luck!  30 is still young but I get it. Thanks for the info! I checked out that group but $3k is steep for a diet program. I imagine it is essentially an anti inflammatory diet like whole30 or Mediterranean diet? Just get the book for $10.  Basically make smoothies of 75 dark leafy greens (kale, watercress, spinach, arugula, etc) then 25 percent fruit and anti-inflammatory herbs (tumeric, ginger, clove, rosemary) eat as much as you need to hit your calories requirements.  No salt.     She has a ton of free info online.   You can eat avocado.  It is not fun at first (way for strict and nutrition dense than Whole30) but you get used to it and it works.  Well it did for me. Just got it on kindle! So it worked for you after 6 weeks? Or have you had to maintain that diet to stay in remission? Depends on how intense your issue is.  I somehow caught mine pretty quick so it only took 2 months but then again I have the Neuro one so I am not in great shape.  She had blood clots from her Lupus and it was about 4 months.  You can watch this too for free.  Again do your research but a lot of diets (including Whole30) and research brought me here and I now enjoy it because I am at a level of health I did not think was possible   Oh and take omega 3s in algea or clarified fish oil.  She will mention it in the book but that is so critical. Hey there SSK-\n\nI am 40 and started hormone therapy around 38 for 6 months (pre dx) and my naturo felt it was fine to keep going although I was def not in remission. I was not at my worst nor my best, middle. But when my worst flare of my life hit and the hormones were adding to my complications, it was agreed I just needed to pause to get better before I could go back to trying. Better but certainly no one said remission. Cuz who knows when that could be! Just better. And only you know what your better looks like. My new rheum said she felt azathioprine had \u201cmore\u201d research behind it sayin it is fine for me to stay on while trying and during pregnancy. My GP said similar but to go off 3rd trimester. I have heard mixed things. At 30 you have a ton of time! But everyone is diff and it is great you are thinking ahead. Fertility testing would be a good place to start to see where you are at, BD aside. Also, several docs have said to me getting pregnant will most likely minimize any/all BD symptoms as the hormones usually serve well in creating optimal health for baby. I appreciate all the info - I better get to the grocery store! Thanks for your thoughtful reply! I figured that the same hormones in birth control that cause clotting are also elevated during pregnancy. My symptoms are def minimized and managed pretty well with my current cocktail of Humira and Azathioprine. My doc says hard no to Azathioprine during all of pregnancy, just FYI! That is good to hear about what your docs said about remission, btw. I just worry that this disease can evolve at the drop of a hat and I am anxious about what could be lurking around the corner, especially when putting your body through something as extreme as baking a whole human! Haha right?! It is a whole other ball game. So your doc say no to Aza during all of pregnancy-good to know but what about during the period of trying to get pregnant? Which for me will involve hormone therapy. And when \u201cthey\u201d say to avoid when trying to conceive, what technically terms trying?! Like what time period? So if I am going to try to start trying again in 6 mo, what is the point of going on Aza right? Why do you take both? Did you have the neg side effects from Aza like hair falling out, nausea, photosensitivity, I cannot bare the thought of having to avoid all sun forever or full body sunblock. Also, did you have to avoid people when first starting to risk exposure to infection? Or is that still the case for the u? It is making me feel afraid to go outside! I am not sure what the protocol is for stopping \u201cpre conception\u201d but I can certainly ask next time I go in! I have not had any side effects from Aza, I honestly have not noticed any difference period so I think I am going to ask to stop taking it. I already wear full body sunblock otherwise I burn so that was not a big deal to me haha. My doc added it to use in conjunction with Humira every 14 days. Humira def helped me (more so than any other drug) but I still have symptoms. Apparently humira and aza work well together especially for GI issues. This has not worked for me personally, so I think I am going to see if I can take Humira more frequently, because I notice symptoms in the second week before my next dose. Interesting. I was on an IV regime Of glutathione and B 12 every two weeks and I noticed similarly that if I was not doing them regularly I would see a big difference in energy levels n flare symptoms 2 weeks later! Glad to hear you did not have any side effects from aza &amp; great humira is working! Is it possible they are not sending me straight to humira cuz it is more expensive? Where do they do the injections? At a rheum office or you do it yourself? Good that you are listening to your intuition about what to take or not. For people like us, I have had years of docs guessing and not listening to me. So before I jump on a hardcore med, I do my research! Btw-if you want any insights on AIP, I know it like the back of my hand and happy to offer support or recipe ideas! It is a crucial part of my life &amp; have fun recipes or ways to get creative diet wise makes it tolerable!", "Diagnosis Help? How do I get an accurate diagnosis? Which exams should I get? Hello,\n\nI am a 24 years old female, so far I have severe asthma, skin issues, allergies, digestive issues and a rare kind of epilepsy. I also have a lot of mouth ulcers since years or maybe decades, but I NEVER thought it was an issue since I got used to them. I just assumed I had a very sensitive mouth or I had a bad reaction to toothpaste... I also have bright RED gums and mouths / inner lips, but I thought it was just a mild gum disease or that I brush my teeth and gums too much to the point it might bleed (I have perfect hygiene but I brush my teeth way too much).\n\nToday I had what looks like a cold sore, I was shocked and I had a nervous breakdown and I did not want to get oral herpes and did not want to infect myself elsewhere or my eye area, and did not want to infect anyone else or to my future baby if I ever get pregnant, and I know that herpes (even cold sores) is more severe for those who have a weak immune system. I know cold sores are very common and for most people it is not a big deal but it has complications for some people. The nervous breakdown was not only about the cold sore, but I heard almost five bad news this week and this was too much to handle.\n\nHad digestive symptoms for the past 10 years, I thought at first I had Crohn's disease (bleeding) and no one took me seriously except ONE doctor who tested me for Crohns then celiac disease, but the blood test for celiac came negative. I had an abdominal ultrasound exam 10 years ago and a few colonoscopies and the doctors said nothing was wrong and they said I have IBS. Any medication for IBS has zero effect on my issues, I have tried them all. I do not react to any special food (including spicy food, hot sauce and vegetables) except dairy, milk, but I do not think lactose intolerance causes bleeding, and I often cut off dairy. The bleeding came back since a few months, almost every day. I am going to do another abdominal ultrasound exam obviously but I live in a very small town without a car so I have to wait longer to have the exam, especially since the pandemic. But my doctor does not think I have Crohns because my previous colonoscopies were normal. So he said there is no need to do another colonoscopy.\n\nI spent a week at the hospital a few months ago to find the causes to my fatigue and my epilepsy, at the end of the week after the blood test the doctors said I had some kind of inflammation and I \"might have autoimmune disease but we are not sure so do not freak out, and we do not know which one, we will talk to other doctors and if if it is severe I promise you will receive a phone call when you will be back home, if you do not have a phone call it means it is okay, we will see the other blood test results\". I never had any kind of phone call.\n\nBut right know, I have a \"cold sore\" and SIX mouth ulcers on the lower inner lip, I am not even talking about the rest of the mouth. I just realized I had so many mouths ulcers. They are usually not very painful but it might be because I got used to them and I have very high pain tolerance. I had severe kidney infection last year and it was not until it got really bad that I called emergencies service at night. Not because I do not care about my health, just because I do not feel that much pain so I usually assume it is a mild issue. And so many doctors told me \"it is in your head\", or \"you are probably anxious\" so I do not really feel like my issues are \"real\", I am scared to talk about health issues now. Took me a decade to be properly diagnosed with epilepsy (even with exams like EEGs), until I had a prolonged seizure and almost died.\n\nMy close cousin (male, the same age) has diagnosed Behcets, and even got blind. So I never wanted to ask my family about it, because I thought it would not be fair for him, that he has worst issues than mine, so I should not complain so much. His illness was a huge trauma within the family so I denied my close symptoms for years because I did not want to cause even more drama. I was even convinced it was not Behcets and stopped reading about it. But since my nervous breakdown I am not so sure, the more I educate myself about Behcets and the more I think I might have it... I read about it since a few weeks. Our parents are from a country where Behcets is way more prevalent. My husband thinks I should really get tested because of my mouth and digestive issues. Sometimes I have red skin lesions on legs.\n\nI am going to see a doctor in a few days, what should I tell him to be sure I will be taken seriously? Which exams should I get? Should I ask for a short admission in a Behcets service right now (in another town) if the diagnosis is confirmed? I took pictures of : the \"cold sore\", all the mouth ulcers I could capture, the bright red gums and mouth. Just to have some proof in case it is gone for a few days.\n\nThank you for reading, I am looking forward for any advice. Happy New Year by the way! Just so you know I will probably be busy tomorrow and I am not sure when I will be on Reddit, but thanks in advance to everyone.", "Does anyone smell smoke? I have olfactory hallucinations at the start of a flare up. I smell smoke that is not there. Anyone else have similar? I smell burnt toast every so often for a few moments, then it goes away. I have been told it is due to inflammation or allergies. Thank you, good to know! Only after I spark up a fat joint! \n\nKidding aside, sometimes when I get a cold/the flu or are in the middle of a particularly bad bout of insomnia, I experience something similar to what you are describing. I would not exactly say it smells like smoke - but like something is burning. Yes, cigar smoke to be exact. It is so strange.", "Otezla, colchicine, prednisone\u2026 questions! 22 male from Chicago, got diagnosed with behcets two years ago at both MAYO clinics in Minnesota and Florida. Currently on otezla twice a day, colchicine twice a day and prednisone whenever I feel a flare up coming up. My rheumatologist is recommending remicade injections. Has anyone here gotten / been on the remicade injections? Kind Of scared of the side affects and been having a hard time lately mentally with depression and anxiety. \n\nAny input would be much appreciated!!\n\nMuch love and hope everyone is doing well and enjoying the summer!:) I have not had them. But I have a question for you\n\nHow is the otezla work for you. \n\nFor me it is like a miracle. I have not had an oral ulcer in almost a year. (26F)The colchicine worked for me, it manages the mouth ulcers very well for me. I take the Humira injection every seven days. Humira is a biological injection just like remicade. I initially heard of remicade from a psychologist, when I asked my rheumatologist about it he suggested Humira instead. He said it had less risks associated with it. I find that has also helped tremendously, it helps keep the ulcers on my skin (arms and legs) away. It also helps with other behcets symptoms too and crohns and rheumatoid arthritis. I think it is probably the thing that keeps my Behcets under control. The only thing that reallllly bothers me is the burning sensation you feel from the citric acid they use as a preservative. Honestly though it is not that bad when I think of all the good it does me. I also use Oracort on any genital ulcers and that also works like a charm. Those are probably the three medications that work the best for me to help manage the Behcets.\nWishing you all the best and I hope you find something that works for you.\n\nEdit:Clarification I am on the same meds, I used to be on Imuran but otezla has fewer side effects so I switched and it seems to be working well. Did the rheumatologist say there was a medical benefits to going on Remicade or is it more for symptoms?\n\nAre your symptoms holding you back from things you need/want to do? It sounds like your rheumatologist is trying to get you off prednisone entirely. If you are on Otezla+colchicine and still need to manage breakthrough flares with prednisone, then it makes sense to try anti-TNF therapy. Anti-TNF treatment is becoming the focal point for Behcet's due to the success+remission rates - so Remicade/Humira have become go-to medications. \n\nIn theory swapping colchicine+Otezla+prednisone for Remicade should be safer in the long run. Less side effects, less chances of adverse events, etc. \n\nI have been on Remicade for a year now. My BD is largely managed now after we got the Remicade dosage dialed in. Every facet of my life has improved - mental health, physical health, energy levels, etc - it is been a great experience. I have not had any side effects outside of a couple mild infusion reactions. Also - my depression/anxiety was baaad when my BD was active - it got mildly to moderately better after the disease was managed.", "Might have it though no official diagnosis Hello everyone I am Evaristo 27 I am new here. I been having symptoms of this disease I do not have ulcer but I did had multiple cerebral venous sinus thrombosis I saw behcets can cause this. I also have phlebitis and Uveitis. Also I have the hla-b51 I heard that causes behcets. I never was diagnosed and my doctor and my rheumatologist said I do not have it. But I am having second thoughts. There is a quite a bit to unpack here. So CVST can occur, it is generally a symptom that is classified under neuro behcets. Thrombosis in behcets is different and is generally caused by damage to vessels rather than thrombophilia, they are sticky and do not migrate in the body. It is usually treated with immunosuppresives rather than thrombolysis or anticoagulants(although sometimes both are used to cover all bases) A small percentage of BS patients present with CVST without fufilling the ISG criteria for BS. So it is possible, but im not sure you will get an actual diagnosis until you exhibit more classical symptoms  or a doctor feels strongly that yout cvst was resolved by immunosuppressants, but that again does not fulfill the requirements according to various behcets establishing  guidelines. For instance 95 plus percent of BS patients get oral ulcers, though it may not be the present at first manifestation of disease. I feel for you, but on the upside CVST in BS has good prognosis generally.\n\nEdit: actually you prob fulfill the ICBD criteria. 2 points uveitis, 1 point for vascular lesions that is three. Add another if you consider CVST as neuro. Go so rheumatology and get evaled.", "Has anyone had psudobulbar affect as a symptom with behcets? Psudobulbar affect is a uncontrollable burst of emotion like laughing or crying. Feel like I am being called out.\n\nI mean, I never considered it a symptom related to behcets. Its that a thing, or are you just asking?\n\nThis is actually kind of throwing me at the moment, because lately.. I have got a lot going on in my life right now, and just randomly bursting into inconsolable and frankly, confusing tears, or laughing like a wild animal.\n\nI just thought, and honestly just kind of believe I am just super over tired, but I am also being treated for BPII... I am so happy you answered this. Thank you this is actually kind of helpful for me. I am diagnosed with Behcets and I honestly thought I had antiphospholipid at first since a lot of my symptoms go along with it. I have uncontrollable laughter from time to time. I have been wondering about the mental affects of Behcets and I thought it was the Behcets in my mind but I also had a severe lack of sleep at the time it was happening. Sorry if this is too deep but Have you asked who is helping you with your mental health about the psudobulbar affect with BPII. Stress can also cause these emotions, and Behcets is very stressful.\nJust a thought. ", "Atypical behcets - diagnosis without normal symptoms? Wondering if anyone else here has been diagnosed with behcets without exhibiting any of the normal symptoms. I realize in theory this cannot be a \"real\" diagnosis as the points criteria will not be satisfied. In my case, I have a history of periodic fevers/chills concurrent with a blood clot (the first episode, no other clotting factors) and major swelling/redness/erythyma nodosum in the affected leg (subsequent episodes). I seem to be responsive to high dose corticosteroids.  My rheum thinks I have behcets, but I suspect a different autoinflammatory disease as I have no other classic behcet symptoms (uveitis, ulcers, etc) I too only display a few of the behcets symptoms, but was diagnosed by Dr.Yazici in New York as having behcets. You could have the disease if you display at least 3 symptoms from the larger list. I have ulcers, erythya nodules, and passed the test where you are stuck with a sterile needle and get a bump as a reaction a few days later.  Thanks, yazici will not see new patients off the street, his partner is 3 months out if you are a new non-internal patient, I am going to see a different rheum at NYU in a few weeks which at least gets me into their practice. Best of luck. I hope you feel better soon or get into remission. I waited a while to go see yazici,  i traveled from the Midwest to see him years ago. I used Colchicine to help thin my blood, if youre experiencing clots. idk maybe ask your docs about that if you have not already.  thanks...i am on coumadin right now and my clot is at least stable, it is taken years for me/doctors to figure out that this is a rheum issue, not heme. my pcp (at a top nyc hospital) did not understand why i wanted to see a rheum! Really have to be your own advocate with these things... Best of luck. You really do need to be your own advocate or find one person who asks great questions to go with you to every doctor appointment. The medical system is so complicated in the US. What helped me was having one notebook dedicated to medical notes from doctor visits. Feel free to reach out if you want to pick my brain...  Yep that is what is written on my paperwork. A typical Behcets . Normal ANA and normal rheumatoid factor. Took forever to get a diagnosis but they finally did genetic testing that proved I did have it so it is atypical", "Affecting my mental health My BD has affected my mental health in so many ways and it is very frustrating. From having recurrent vaginal ulcers that constantly worry me to the point of getting STD panels every 6 months to the way it is affected my brain, causing mood swings and severe depression, it is very hard to handle. Doctors are not sure what mental health medication to give me as I do not react well to a lot of drugs and have had 3 suicide attempts. Advice? I do not do well with antidepressants but responded great to ketamine infusions.  It is expensive but was totally worth it for me. There is so much more out there than traditional ssris. I got my first big flair when I was a teenager in peak puberty. I was always so scared that it was stds when it was really just ulcers. Years later I had multiple suicide attempts and was hospitalized. I know it is not easy having this disease. Your emotions are in constant limbo. I have been on depression meds for 10 years with some bad and good reactions. Low dose zoloft works well for me paired with smoking the right weed. I think what helped me the most mentally was being very intentional and figuring out root causes of my mood. I learned how to compartmentalize and gave myself mental boundaries. Really try to handle yourself with some grace. Try not to compare yourself to others around you who are not sick because they will never understand. I hope you get to feeling better. Psilocybin? 3 attempts over 12 years, medications and psychiatrists for 17. I have tried pretty much all of the conventional treatments. There is a panel that tests you for genetic contra/indications to prescription medications. I have not done it, however I have spoken to multiple people that have. They report it to be quick and painless, and can be ordered by your physician or psychiatrist. \nWhat works for me: Cymbalta - highest dose (pain, depression) Neurontin - midrange dose (pain, anxiety) Remeron - lowest dose (Insomnia, GI upset) Minipress - midrange dose (Night terrors, Recurring nightmares) I have not thought of getting a panel done for that but I am definitely going to talk to my doc about it! Really glad that I am not alone. Thank you so much Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f I am going to look into this! I have always wanted to do it, just never seemed like a real possibility I would have to give it a try, I love that idea Ketamine can be a highly effective treatment for depression, especially for those who have failed multiple other therapies. For those with a scientific-medical bent this a good collection of peer-reviewed scientific papers on the subject:\n\n( You are definitely not alone. I was diagnosed with Behcet's as a teen. Between the genital sores, oral ulcers, golf-ball-sized cysts on my face, and one pupil being twice the size of the other from being on eye drops for uveitis, high school was a freakin' nightmare. Severe depression, crippling anxiety and later substance abuse and suicide attempts. It was rough.\n\nDoctors prescribed several antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and other psych meds not limited to starting with the first letter of the alphabet. Few made me feel better. Several made me feel worse. Eventually, after a decade of letting doctors try and fail to help me, I decided to take things into my own hands.\n\nI started extensively studying neuropsychopharmacology (the study of how drugs affect behavior/thoughts and how they work in the brain/body). Nerdy, I know. But I was determined to find something(s) to make me not hate every second of every day. My academic background is in clinical psychology and I would already exhausted all potential behavioral treatments to no meaningful end. So, after doing tons of research, I began experimenting on myself with a variety of substances: plants, pills, powders, and potions. \n\nLong story short, it took me several years to find the right combination of substances. But now my mood is good, my anxiety is manageable, and I am mostly able to live a happy and productive life. Now, I am not suggesting you do what I did. I am just sharing MY path out of despair to let you know it is possible. For years, I thought I was destined to be miserable till the end of time. But by keeping an open mind and a willingness to try new things, I eventually got to where I wanted to be. \n\nI am not going to share everything I take here. What works for me may - but probably will not - work for you. Our brains are all so vastly different that there are no one-size-fits-all treatments for any mental illness. For example, some people have great results with SSRIs. Me, I have been on a half-dozen serotonergic antidepressants and none of them did a thing for me. What I will say is that I take a combination of vitamins, minerals, drugs, and plants for depression, anxiety, sleep, and pain. \n\nWhile I am not going to suggest any specific substances, I do suggest you get some lab work done, if you have not already. Check vitamin and mineral levels, especially vitamin D. I would also get complete hormone and thyroid panels. And then go from there. Best of luck to you. And never forget: you are not alone. Oh, I published a blog post not too long ago about ( if you are interested. Have you considered killing yourself boo? Psilocybin is also a very powerful inhibitor of tnf a, making it a very strong and unique anti inflammatory. It may actually control the behcets better than other medication on top of also being a great antidepressant. I take a small dose once or twice a week, not enough to really feel a trip. I also take a larger dose once a month with a full on trip.\n\n", "Do I have behcet M here\nSo I am from the Mediterranean region.\nHad anterior uveitis last year.\nHave frequent migraines\nI remember I had some mouth and throat ulcers\nLately I found a boil (red with white head) on my lower stomach and it is painful\nI also noticed that the upper part of my shaft is actually sticky like the fresh is kind of wet even if I am sure there is nothing there.\nI also noticed some redness on shaft and gland of my penis, like a rash, knowing that I am not sexually active but it could be due to friction.\nI also have hop joint pain since 3 years now.\n\nDo you think this could be Behcet?\n\nWhat is the first steps I should take?  Possibly! Sounds like you have a lot, if not all the symptoms! \nYour first step is to see your primary care doctor or a rheumatologist Usually it effects extremities primarily with sores. Would not hurt to consult rheumatology", "Did anyone had trouble finding a medication that helped symptoms ? Hello everyone. \nI am a 21F and English is not my native languages so I am apologizing for any mistakes. \nIm here to ask anyone if they can relate to my situation and maybe give me some advice. \nCurrently I am bedridden because I have the worst joint pain I have ever had, I have lots of mouth ulcers, it is like I feel pain everywhere in my body and I feel so tired and exhausted of this. \nI tried and I currently am on prednisone but it is not helping. I already tried colchicine, hydroxycloroquine, otezla, Adalimumab and etanercept. My doctor told me that Adalimumab would help me but I had a weird reaction and I almost died due to it and I had to stop taking it after second dose. The same thing happened when I tried etanercept at the end of last year. When I had to stop etanercept a few weeks ago my rheumy told me he did not know what else to do and he promised me he would call me. So, it has passed almost two months and nothing. \nSo I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience where they keep getting bad reactions with all sorts of medications. I am desperate to find something that helps me, right now I reached the point where I cannot stand the pain any longer and I have no idea of what to do and how to cope with this. Hey! This is a really interesting list of medications that your doctor has put you on - my doctor started with colchicine and azathioprine (Imuran) and he said those were the first line meds for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. Colchicine helped but did not solve the ulcers, but I did a full titrate process on Azathioprine that took a few months and it barely helped. I went from like a 9/10 pain every day to like a 6/10, but I also made radical changes to my diet and behavior and I think those had more of an influence than the medication. I just started Remicade last week and am really hoping it will help! The majority of people on this Reddit seems to have decent results with either Remicade or humira.\n\nI am no expert but I would talk to your doctor about that list since as far as I know (others please correct me if I am wrong!!!) they tend to be the first choices for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s treatment. Hydroxychloroquine is more common for Lupus.\n\nHope this helps!! It took me two years to get a diagnosis and I went through several doctors. My new rheumy diagnosed me more than a year ago and he got my first on hydroxycloroquine, then humira (adalimumab) then otezla and then etanercept.  The thing that he cannot explain is why I keep having weird side effects from the medication. Humira and etanercept did not help me at all with my symptoms and the side effects were pretty brutal so it made sense to stop them. \nHere they do not usually start with biologics due to their price. My doctor only decided to try them because he said my case was pretty severe. \nIs azathioprine a biologic ? He told me he was thinking on putting me now on a biologic that was not a TNF but I cannot find any info online about those options. \nThank you for your answer ! Remicaid was the only thing that works for me.  I officially do not have behcets but I get all these symptoms.  They just say I have Crohn's as that is what I was diagnosed with first.  I am allergic to azithroprine (Imuran).  So when I was bedridden I was off remicaid, and had  bad tendonitis and arthritis and erythema nodosum. They had me take colchicine and Imuran, and when I had the allergic reaction, I was then given 150mg of steroids injection and epinephrine, this seemed to magically clear up everything over night.  It is been under control since and I am.back on remicaid.  I wish you luck, pm me if you want to discuss or just vent.  The pain and being stuck in bed is horribly depressing and unreal sometimes. Thank you for your answer. This is being extremely hard on me. I am in college and I have finals now, which means I have to study and I also have to drag myself to my university to do the finals. I do not know for how long I can keep doing this and pushing myself. Hot baths and compression wraps were key to controlling pain, and hydrocodone. For me, as I was taking too much advil and tylenol daily at max dosage, and it lasted for over 7 months so I had to get something safer for long term.  I was able to get a handicap placard which might help you even in the smallest way.  I also had extreme swelling so my shoes would not fit anymore as well, if that happens just keep with compression where you can and as others suggested ask about remicaid. Over the counter pain killers never worked for me but my doctor never gave me anything to manage pain. I do not feel any relieve at all from prednisone, I only feel bloated. I am  already doing hot bathes and I have been sleeping with hot water bottle on my joints. \nFor what I have seen online right now remicaid is a TNF biologic and my doctor believes those will not work for me since I got bad reactions to Adalimumab and etanercept. Remicaid is an anti TNF, yes.  And obviously if they say that then yes that might be the case.  Whatever it is worth I went through 4-5 anti TNF and only remicaid works.  It was a miserable time bc I had to suffer just waiting for things to maybe work and nothing even resembled working.  I think I tried entivio, stellar, humira, and one other.  I was only off remicaid previously because it gave me shingles in my eye, fun, so we stopped it till it was better and then suggested less intensive anti tnfs.  I was told remicaid is like the shot gun it hits everywhere and everything.  Where as some of those others are more targeted, which is probably why they did not work for me because I have some areas of issues. \n\nSteroids only helped but in bigger doses which really hurt.  Like 45-60 mg.  But it did not actually make any of it go away, just sort of decreased so symptoms.   I would look at what others suggested with Imuran and it was recommended that I try methotrexate with it, but honestly that drug scared me a bit so I keep it on my reserve list.  I cannot speak for Imuran since I react to it. Thank you so much for your answer, I am definitely checking out imuran. \nMay I ask what is your worse symptoms ? To me it is joint pain and mouth ulcers and sometimes I get uveitis in my eye. Hmm, that is a tough question.  My joint pain and tendonitis was definitely the worst I have been off.  I have pictures of it as I was trying to find doctors who would help me.  I am a slim person and me feet were basically shapeless blobs, my calfs were twice the size and I could not move my legs anymore because it felt like I was tearing all the tendons, they were not flexible anymore.  I got a wheelchair, and had to use bed pans and lost 7 months to this.  The erythema nodosum on top of my swollen legs made it excruciating.  \n\nHowever each year I get entirely new symptoms.  Not related to the last year.  So since July I have been experiencing what seems like uveitis.  But doctors cannot see anything wrong.  It is just painful and frustrating and I get headaches from it a lot.  It is not worse that the joint and tendon pain though.  That was a while other level of pain and depression.  I get boughts of joint pain now and then, but it is not like it was.  Rashes are a thing of mine, but they are just annoying  I have had 6 surgeries for abcesses which were bad at the time, but I do not get those anymore now either.  Mouth ulcers were God awful, I would get 30 or so at a time for years, I could not eat or drink well.  But those have not been around for a few years now (2014). Part is because I am on remicaid, but things still creep through each year.  Each time I get any feelings for the above issues I get so worried because not sure if it is coming back.  \n\nUveitis would be more concerning as it is damaging. My arthritis they said was not damaging just really painful.    In all honesty if the pain is causing you to take tylenol or advil daily, talk to your doctor about it because those are not safe for daily long term use. Damn, I really relate to some of the stuff you described. Sometimes I get weird rashes with no apparent cause and my doctor thinks that maybe is behcets but apparently it is not typical. \nFor uveitis you can take steroid eye drops and that usually prevents damage on your eyes.  They can also check the back of your eye to see lesions, so maybe you could ask your eye doctor to check it out. \nI do not take it daily because it does not really help but the pain affects so much my daily activities and it sucks, I am still young and I feel like I cannot keep up with my friends and I am always too tired to do stuff. \nI am just waiting for my doctor to call but he seems like he ghosted me lol. Yeah you are the first I have really spoken too that seems to have similar issues so it is nice to hear (as sad as it is for you) that someone else is having similar issues.  I honestly feel like doctors just do not know what to do with me.  They did look at my eyes what seemed like extensively, even did an MRI as they were suspecting MS.  Nothing.  I unfortunately cannot take steroids in my eyes easily as I am a responder so my pressures go up and creates a risk of glaucoma.  Fun.  They say they do not see any inflammation so I guess I am just in pain, but it is everyday since July.  Sorta sucks.  I am okay with it if it is not causing damage I guess. It is not intolerable pain.  \n\nDid they test your rheumatoid factor and ensure your arthritis is immune driven, not causing damage?   \n\nThanks for silver btw! I am really sorry you are dealing with this but it makes me feel less lonely to know that there is someone out there who understands. It is also hard to deal with all of this alone, no one in my life understands what is it is like to live like this and I feel pretty lonely most of the times. \nBut if it hurts you it must have a reason for it. I know it is hard because sometimes this disease presents itself in strange ways. Maybe a prednisone shot would clear out that inflammation? \nCan you see a different doctor or something? I saw several doctors and they misdiagnosed me and one even implied it was all in my head. \nMy rheumatoid factor and ANA came back negative but most of the times I have the inflammation markers very raised. \nIf you ever need to talk to someone feel free to message me, it would be a pleasure to talk to you and hear if you need to vent. ", "How to deal with hairs? Apologies in advance for the grossness of the question, but I am wondering if anyone has any advice on how to deal with hairs getting stuck within genital sores?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now I have unfortunately got one stuck in a really hard to reach place and it is unfortunately got quite a few hairs stuck in there. I do not want it to stay that way as it heals, but I am also dreading the pain involved in pulling them out. Any advice? hey, Not sure if you have seen/heard of these, but when my lesions were at their worst I got this ...

Had Bechet's disease since I was 11, diagnosed at about 14, but had every specialist since doubt the diagnosis until they see me have a flare. Most of my symptoms are under control, but the body and joint pain. I am waiting on a call back from the rheumatologist, but good lord am I in pain.\n\nTwo weeks ago I fell over in a hole in the garden, jarred every joint down my right reg and my back. Twisted my ankle with a minor sprain and dislocated my dicky knee all in one go. Could walk short distances after a week. Now it is getting worse again! and spreading. I am currently on 6-mercaptopurine (a derivative of azathioprine) and allopurinol (I was getting liver toxicity from it, the allopurinol changes how it metabolises but is risky).\n\nI was on celebrex (celecobix), but I had a prolonged period of nausea and gut pain and had to stop it. Pity, because it was great. Paracetamol does nothing.\n\nWhat do you guys do about it? Have you tried Epsom salt in your bath? Warm not hot water and a good long soak. I find that, combined with topical anti inflammatory gel is helpful, it means I can save the good painkillers for the really bad days. \n\nElasticated bandage or even flight socks of you have them will support the joints and suppress the swelling a bit Sorry forgot to mention, my doc has been known to prescribe a low dose of diazepam for my worst flares and it takes the edge off even though it does not help the inflammation. ok, will try the bath. I am a bit crazy about avoiding anything possibly addictive because the behcet's has hospitalised me with abdominal pain of \"no known origin\" many times - which is on my government health record - and that combined with any addictive drug prescription leads to people assuming I am a drug seeker. I get you. I cannot take opiate painkillers because I got addicted to them when my old doctor gave me the uk version of OxyContin and kept me on them for 2 years. Withdrawal is hell so steer clear. \n\nSteroids- prednisone- work amazingly for short term during a bad spell. Also you could ask for a betmethasone inhaler, it is the steroid one asthmatic people use and squirt it directly onto the mouth ulcers. It dramatically shortens the length of time you have them but some doctors are funny about prescribing it because it is not licensed to be used that way. Mouth ulcer wise, I am set - I have a compounding script for clobetasol propinoate .05% mixed into orobase. I put it on when the ulcer's first turn up and they are gone in 12 hours. Gone are the days of liquid diets, xylocaine jelly and jumping on and off prednisone! It was completely life changing and amazing.\nWill probably have to go back on the steroids for the joint pain though, depending on test results. I have tried the betamethasone inhaler, but it was not much good in my case. I am about to start infliximab, so steroids and topicals are pretty much my only option at the moment. Thalidomide has been the only thing that is ever worked for me but I am not allowed it anymore due to failing the nerve conduction tests. \n\nThe constant search for meds that work is probably one of the worst things about Behcets treatment. It is just so trial and error. \n\nHopefully you will find a combination that works for you- this sub has been a godsend in terms of info and not feeling like such a freak.", "Possible behcets The past week has been terrible for me,  I have been in and out of walk in clinics with a final all night stay in a hospital.  Ive been have swollen red eyes oozing pus for 3 weeks switching back and forth from one eye to the other,  and the passed week my mouth has filled with ulcers,  back of throat,  uvula,  insides of cheecks,  right behind my lips and my lips have swollen up like a bee has stung me.  My lips are bleeding from cracking. I have had lumps form inside my mouth amd cover over with ulcers. I have had ulcers come and go all my life and just put it down to fatigue or infections.  My skin has always itched on my forearms and oozed a clear fluid and scabbed over(very localised pimple size area) I often get myself in minor nasea fits that only last for 2 or 3 minutes then disapear.  The hkspital said it was behcets and that I would have to return later after a blood test.  Now i realisethat my symptoms are not as severe as the majority of the people here,  and my potential flare ups until this point have been very minor in comparison.  I just wonder the opinions of people who have been diagnosed.  Does it sound like behcets?  I understand there is a needle test.  The location of my blood test has not resulted in a small bump.  Is that the test I have read about? How do your joints feel? Are they testing you for crp and sed rate? \n\nDo you genital ulcers? Erythema nodosum? Please do not minimize your symptoms. It sounds like you have been suffering tremendously. It sounds like Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. I hope you get some relief soon. To give you some hope, right now I have been in remission for a few years. I suffered with monthly flare ups for about 10 years beforehand. The right meds have helped me tremendously. I still suffer from fatigue and other minor symptoms but overall I feel great. It totally sounds like Beh\u00e7ets. Joints are fine for the moatpart,i hqve had lots of back issues anf neck issues but im prettysure they are un related.  I also have no genital ulcers,  although every now and then i get a break out on the head of my penis with what looks like a rash that is red and white circles.  I have not had this issue for many years now though Have you ever had the rash biopsied?\n\nJoints are Usually a big component in a flare, or state of inflammation. And will be in the wrists and ankles for most. \n\nThere are many other conditions that can also cause excess mucousal ulcers. B12 deficiency (please have them check and anything under 350 is cause for concern) and crohns, as well as being iGA deficient too.

But everyone is different So milk is a very common auto-immune trigger for lots of people. I would recommend you read/ try the Autoimmune Protocol (or The Plant Paradox if you are vegetarian) and try to figure out what your triggers are because you likely have some.\n\nMy flares are worse when I eat most common trigger foods, but I do not think I have Behcets so take that with a grain of salt. Gluten , lactose and sugar increases my pain. I dont think it triggers a flare but it does not help. Also lack of fiber/vegetables. Diet is the biggest trigger for me. Over the last year since I was diagnosed I dramatically changed my diet and saw huge improvements.\n\nGluten, sugar, polyunsaturated fats and oxalates are the most inflammatory foods. They definitely trigger flares for me.. I am almost sure I could control my symptoms by total elimination of those foods and cut out my meds.. but I wont do it yet - still need to compile evidence. \n\nFor example, I went months this year with no symptoms but that is been in combination with meds and a very restricted diet..so cant tell which one is doing the better job (or whether its both). \n\n*my diet, as I am not vegetarian, is normally heavy on meat, zero/v low carbs, fresh seasonal fruit, all dairy included (but full cream, full fat greek yogurt, butter..etc.. all the more natural versions of animal based foods.. not modified)\n\nThis Christmas I have intentionally allowed myself the normal, gluten filled, sugar filled crap foods of Christmas to see if the meds can keep it all at bay. So far, the only things I have noticed since I reintroduced those foods are my mood and energy levels (way worse since putting sugar and gluten back in), some mild stiffness in my neck and shoulders, and my skin is definitely not as clear as it was. I get sinus congestion with gluten for sure.\n So far, no ulcers though so I am impressed. But when I compare this way of eating to how incredibly optimal I felt before christmas, I am now glad it is over and look forward to returning to my normal sugar/gluten/oxalate free life. \n\nCheck out the Autoimmune Protocol, the Wahls Protocol, the Carnivore diet and Sally K Norton for a wide variety of information about the link between food and autoimmune diseases. I have tried tons of different diets and food does not seem to play much of a role in how active the Behcet's is. That being said, the healthier I eat, the better I feel in general. I eat lots of dairy, cannot get enough gluten, and eat a lot of other things that set off a lot of people. So it is all about figuring out your own genetics and what your body can take. \n\nThe best way to figure out what is good/bad for you is to do an elimination diet. Cut out everything but meat (for example). Then, one by one, slowly introduce foods back into your diet. If something upsets/flares you, you will know what. Best of luck. Be well! Diet is definitely a trigger for me. Most issues stemming out of over processed foods. \n\nI was doing a very strict Keto diet about a two years ago, lasted about 8 months, and it was the best I have felt while being mostly \"sedentary\" since my Behcet's first started showing it self 27ish years ago. \n\nCurrently, trying a somewhat laxed Mediterranean diet and avoid all over processed foods and anything with added sugar.\n\nIf I may, what type of flares are you experiencing?  Overall, inflammation? Ulcers/sores? Skin irritation? I ask because switching hygiene products to avoid  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) has help me reduce much of the outward appearing flares. The stuff is in toothpaste, body wash, shampoo, laundry soap and so many other things. I was diagnosed young (12yo) and struggled with it a lot. When I got in high school and began smoking my behcets was gone for almost 10 years. When I got divorced I decided I would improve myself and quit smoking. Within months of quitting it was back and worse than ever. Took me years to actually figure out the smoking cessation was what caused it. I decided to start smoking again to help (bad move I know but I was desperate) it did not help. \n\nBut I did find out.\n\nMelatonin is an absolute no for me. I took it for years thinking more sleep would help my condition. I come across an article one day talking about melatonin and how it could cause ai flare ups. I quit taking it and had a huge improvement within a week, in severity and frequency of flare ups (which was almost constant) it is worth a shot to try.\n\nI have also tried taking melatonin many times since and every time I have a flare up within days. Including currently because I am having gi issues and read that melatonin can help with that.", "Diagnosis help Hi all, \n\nRecently I have been having massive flares of mouth ulcers, where they cover the inside of my lips and cheeks. It is absolute agony, cannot eat and can hardly talk. Looking more into this disease I have noticed I have been experiencing other symptoms but not put two and two together until now. I have suffered with mouth ulcers my whole life, my mum even took me to the gp as a child. Ive suffered joint pain in both knees since I was about 13 and used to see a rheumatologist. Recently I have been having eye inflammation where I cannot open my eye in the morning because it is so painful. \n\nI have been to the doctors recently and they just fob me off saying use over the counter gel and take pain relief. \n\nI was just wondering how everyone else went about getting a diagnosis. The pain is honestly debilitating and I need treatment but I do not know how to push for a diagnosis!  \n\nThank you in advance for any help and advice! \ud83d\ude0a Get a referral if you need it, or just schedule an appointment with a new rheumatologist. Tell them you have reason to think you may have Bechet's, and you would like to rule everything else out.\n\nThere are not really specific tests for it, but there are some genetic markets, and the skin prick test, that can sure lead one way or another.\n\nI do not know if steroids clear up \"ordinary\" ulcers so quickly, but my RA said if they responded and healed as quickly as I said they did it probably was, since we could not find any other reason for them.\n\nSeriously, like every time I would get an oral ulcer they would take at least 6 weeks to heal, genital ulcers even longer.. but day 2-3 on prednisone they were all but gone and healed. It was like magic.\n\nI am on some pretty minor maintenance meds now, with a supply of prednisone handy should I get another severe flareup, doing pretty OK.\n\nIf you have eye involvement you need to get in front of an ophthalmologist who specializes in eye inflammation, uveitis and the like. I was referred to one by my RA, and honestly, the eye doctor I saw only sees uveitis patients, and from what I learned, sees nearly every bonafied Bechet's patients in my state and the surrounding states, and was actually the one who suggested the genetic testing (I had one of two markers they look for, which is not a diagnoses so much as point to the likelihood of it)\n\nIn my case I can actually trace family history to the actual Silk Road, Bechet's is also known as Silk Road Disease.\n\nGood luck! Oddly enough l have an excellent GI doctor that did research and discovered  l had Behcets. Not all doc's are willing to do that. Since it is a relatively rare disease, few doctors are up to speed. When you see the rheumatologist, explain your symptoms and ask them to rule it out. You may have to talk to alot of professionals before you find answers. I wish you good success! Do not give up!\ud83d\ude42 Thanks for your help, I will definitely ask my GP about using prednisone. I have around 10-15 mouth ulcers rn and it is unbearable, I am still in shock that they will not give me anything for them! When I mentioned the eye inflammation to my optician she said it is probably just dry eyes and to use eye drops. There was no further investigation. It feels like I have to kick up a fuss for any doctors to do anything or they just brush it off! Thanks for the reply! Definitely going to have to try and get through to my doctors because it is unbearable, I need treatment not just over the counter mouth gels \ud83d\ude22 There is a very fine line between self diagnosing yourself and being your own best advocate...\n\nFor the oral ulcers, I have also used Trinolone/Triamcinolone acetonide .1% paste (dental steroid paste). The prednisone was really for a very bad flareup, with lots of different kind of inflamation all at once. It should not be nearly as hard on your body as a straight up prednisone regimen, and doctors do not like putting people on prednisone long term due to some pretty hardcore side effects.\n\nEveryone who sees a regular run of the mill ophthalmologist is going to get the dry eye diagnoses first it seems. Just kind of seems to be their go to, try treating it first, and come back if it does not get better kind of thing. You really need to see an eye inflammation specialist, and honestly I found mine via a direct referral. I will honestly try anything to ease the pain at this point! Seems like it is a little easier in the states, trying to get referred for this stuff on the NHS is such a fight, it was hard enough to get seen by a dermatologist for acne! Thanks for the help \u263a\ufe0f From the minute I thought I had it, to a probable diagnoses was ~3 years.\n\nI needed a refferal to the RA, took a month to see my GP, a week to get the phone call to schedule the RA for an appointment 3 months later.\n\nAppointments were 4 months out for the eye specialist, but I was put on a waiting list for cancellations and no shows, and I was able to see him in 2 months instead of waiting the full 4.\n\nMy RA recently changed practices, and I have been calling every other day for a month to talk to scheduling. They are just really, really backed up.\n\nI spent nearly half my yearly income between doctors betwen insurance payments, copays, doctor visits, lab work, and prescriptions the year I was diagnosed.\n\nI am on the most inexpensive drug regimen, without insurance runs around $750/mo, with insurance its ONLY about $250/mo. Should I need Remicade/Infliximab injections.. well I will probably never earn enough to even consider it.\n\nIf I was wealthy I could have traveled and seen someone much faster, but I make a very average wage.\n\nI will be in debt to my local hospital system for the rest of my life.\n\nIt is not wonderful. Do not believe the hype. Oh wow, I always thought American healthcare was more accessible with shorter wait times especially since you guys pay for everything! Apologies for assuming!  \n\nI first saw a rheumatologist when I was around 16, I am now 25 almost 26 and still no real answers. \n \nHoping now I am presenting even more symptoms more frequently it will not be as difficult this time \ud83d\ude2b Please be aware that even with meds etc. it can still be miserable. For me any anti inflamitories cause ulcers in my mouth. I cannot use aspirin or ibuprofen, not any of them. It makes it hard when your joints hurt so bad. Voltaren gel, used externally helps some. I am miserable as it is and having to take time out work so it cannot get much worse, at least with a diagnosis I will actually receive some treatment even if it does not end up working at least I can say I have tried it, at least I can tell my employer I have this and that is why I have taken days off We have this issue, where young people do not go to the doctor for anything if they can help it, because its expensive and lots of entry level jobs do not include health insurance.. So we catch stuff late.\n\nThen all the specialists are clogged up with older people with severe problems now that they can afford it, or eventually get the closest we have to state run health insurance at 65 1/2, then they can finally get treatment for lots of chronic issues.\n\nIf you want to get cosmetic surgery of any kind, you can nearly just walk in though...\n\nI would personally rather wait an extra few months than have the psychological burden of the debt. I do not know how long people typically take to get diagnosed, but I had vague symptoms including mouth ulcers for a few years and then got some really gnarly bouts of uveitis. Once I got diagnosed with uveitis things moved a lot faster for me and after getting implants in my eyes started Humira...all within about 5 months. I also had some reoccurring stomach ulcers but never saw a GI doctor, skin lesions (that looked like chicken pox almost) and mouth ulcers. My PCP brushed me off, but once I started loosing my vision I was seeing a whole bunch of doctors very quickly. My suggestion is to see a ophthalmologist while you think you are having a flare of uveitis. When you saw the optometrist did they look into your eyes? My ophthalmologist said its pretty recognizable to any doctor who does a slit lamp eye exam and my optometrist was the first one to catch it and refer me to a more specialized doctor. Ask for something like magic mouthwash. You gargle it (I have been told to swallow it too when I get ulcers on my uvula and down my throat but it is not the most pleasant thing) and it is typically a combo of a steroid, lidocaine for pain relief and nystatin. I have used it when I am in between meds and it does not necessarily get rid of the ulcers but it can help with the pain. For your eyes, are you seeing an optometrist or opthamologist? Is it green by any chance? I have had a mouth rinse before, it was green and it did help somewhat but with how bad my mouth is atm I do not think it would do much \ud83d\ude2b I see an optician every two years for my usual eye test, make sure my prescription has not changed, last time I went (6 months ago) they said my eyes looked fine and it was probably dry eyes causing the irritation. The eye irritation does not happen often enough for me to have gone back it is mainly my mouth that is causing me the most trouble! I will still mention it at my next gp appointment, see if they will refer me and get another eye examination done! After 10 years I finally got a BD diagnosis today!!! It was hard\u2026 I found a great doctor finally here in Los \u00c1ngeles who specializes in oral lesions\u2026 I feel your pain! Are you in the United States? You do not need a diagnoses to use FMLA if so. It is none of your employers business the details, just say it is medical. I think the rules are different for small businesses like under 50 employees though, but look into FMLA if you are in the states. I am from the Uk Did your blood tests show any abnormalities? \n\nI saw a new (horrible) rheum who did not even know what Behcets was and tried to convince me that since my connective tissue disease panel was negative I could not possibly have it, but Behcets is a vasculitis! Not a connective tissue disease!! So I am just curious to see someone officially diagnosed and their lab work results Ugh I was hoping this would be my situation. I have been having issues with oral ulcers, joint pains, and skin lesions for several years. Recently was diagnosed with some severe uveitis, but instead the new rheumatologist I saw said I was completely \u201chealthy\u201d because my blood work was relatively normal. It is so frustrating because she did not even know what Behcets was and kept comparing it to lupus, which is not even remotely close! I am sorry that was your experience! I just walked in to my first rheum appointment and she told me she thinks I had behcets, and then retired and my new rheum said that is likely true. At the infusion clinic I go to they always tell me they have never had anyone with my condition come in, though! Maybe get a second opinion? Uveitis cost me a lot of vision. I tried to get a second opinion and unfortunately chose a rheum with the shortest wait time. I found out why she had a short wait time! She was so dismissive and told me I had herpes, despite it being ruled out multiple times. We are your labs always normal? I am sorry to hear that! \n\nNo, not really. There is not one test for behcets and I was negative for both HLA b21 and b27 but I always had high CRP and SED rates, high white count, vitamin deficiencies from stomach ulcers, and I had a bunch of skin ulcers to show my rheum when I first saw her. And mouth ulcers. Hmm interesting. I am always in normal range for SED and ESR, but my white count is always elevated in a flare. Thanks for the insight! Yeah my CRP has been as high as 100 and my sed rate has been even higher in a bad flare so I am not sure if that changed the way my rheumatologist saw things? ok, so truthfully I stopped paying so much attention to labs and such once I found a doctor that actually took me seriously, and had pretty much ruled anything out..\n\nI was positive for one of the two genetic markers they were looking for, HLA-B51 is the well known one, and unfortunatly the eye doctor who suggested the tests was out of network and I do not seem to have digital access to the result.. but I was positive for the \"other\" one, but my googlefu is failing me in trying to look it up, it was a bit fringe, and I believe the doctor I was seeing was part of the research group.\n\nAside from that, i had abnormally high inflammation markers in my blood, but again I am afraid I am just not sure of the terminology, aside from they were \"through the roof, no wonder you are so miserable!\"  :| Definitely makes it easier to confirm things! I think I definitely have a mild case but it does not make it any less miserable lol Sure, misery is subjective! I always feel lucky I do not have bad mouth ulcers because that sounds horrible to have often. In bad flares I get them but they are not the first thing to come up. Ugh I had a great doctor, but then I moved and I have already struck out twice here on rheumatologists. I am so glad you found a good one!", "Who diagnosed you? I have been struggling with vaginal ulcers for around seven years now. I also get ulcers in my mouth and my blood vessels in my left eye burst constantly. I was originally diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa, but I believe it is actually Behcet\u2019s. My obgyn told me she cannot make a diagnosis and that I should see a pcp. What type of medical professional diagnosed you? I have seen people say pcp, obgyn, rheumatologist, neurologists, etc. I am just really struggling for help and want answers so badly. A rheumatologist dx me but I was referred by an ophthalmologist for recurrent uveitis. Hi :) I have BD. I saw multiple specialist.  Behcets disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, so other conditions had to be eliminated and then had to meet criteria. First, PCP just said it was stress, then he referred me to Endocrinologist because they thought it was hypothyroidism, nope. Then went to consult with my OBGYN who found a cervical ulcer during a exploratory surgery. Saw a GI specialist and had a colonoscopy to eliminate Crohn's disease. Finally, it was a Rheumatologist who put the pieces together and diagnosed me. My amazing Rheumy also treats me, he is wonderful. After I saw a hematologist, Opthamalogist and neurologist from BD complications. I do recommend starting a medical journal to track symptoms over time; this will also help your doctor as you are treated since different BD patients respond differently to different medications. Hope this helps. Best in health to you. Feel better soon. I was diagnosed by a dermatologist. You may have some luck with that considering you have a lot of skin symptoms. Take some photos of your flare up ulcers to show them in case there are none on the day of the appointment. Also try to see a derm that specialises in autoimmune diseases if possible.\nThe derm heard me out and went over my history with me and then pretty concluded it was behcets, she sent me to a rheumatologist, an opthaneurologist, neurologist and gyno after that but it was more to check for the extent of damage caused by the disease to see if there was anything they had to treat apart from what they were aware of. If you can, going to a large teaching hospital with many specialist departments makes a huge difference, the doctors are more inclined to discuss your case amongst each other and they will listen to another doctors objections even though they might not listen to the same thing coming from you. It is also much easier to keep everyone on the same page since all the specialists are using the same patient file and can look up everything the other docs did and said about you. They are also more likely to know each other and it is easier for them to get it touch with each other. I have doctors call other docs I have seen mid appointment for example so they can ask the other doc why they did xy. I pretty much knew I had an autoimmune disease but didnt know which one..symptoms were too varied and random, though my own research led me to suspect BD. As we all know, docs are not likely to take your word for it, so I started by doing a full health check up with PCP at a hospital that offers physicals from head to toe. They check eyes, blood, urine, do chest x Rays, everything. Then you sit down and go through all your symptoms and results from all bloodwork and everything. The PCP then refers you onto other specialists within the same hospital.\n\nFirst try, he told me I might have an Autoimmune Disease, but overall my results were good and to stop stressing. I even had genital ulcers present at that moment, but he still wasnt willing to recommend any further testing. Saw a gynaecologist in the same hospital that day who tested me for Herpes and then when it came back negative said \"You need rheumatology\".\n\nWent back a year later, when I had very abnormal growth of a cyst on my arm that was not a cyst after all and had to be surgically removed (turned out to be a super rare presentation of molluscum contagiosom..which is so random but autoimmune diseases are weird) and insisted that I have the same physician look at it and redo my physical .. basically I just built up my medical file over the previous year with pictures of every weird thing on my skin, every flare of my eyes, kept a record of it all. He conceded at that point that I needed a rheumatologist and referred me right away. \n\nRheumatologist confirmed Behcets immediately based on my file and photos.\n\nTLDR; You really need to state your case. If you are not getting supportive recommendations get a new team. Behcets is really a team effort with so many disciplines involved, but rheumatology should be sort of at the centre of your treatment plan. Hi, everyone! I saw a new dermatologist today and after a short conversation and showing her photos, I was finally diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. Thank you all so much for the info. I have been dealing with Beh\u00e7et's since I can remember (in other words, 14 years), I always had fever, mouth ulcers and neck and throat inflammations. Every month we went to a pediatrician, they gave me antibiotics, a sick note and send me home.\nBack in 2017 I started presenting genital ulcers, my mom took me to gynecologist twice and she said I was scratching it, I told her it was not it but she did not believe me, suggesting maybe I did it without noticing.\nMore ulcers appeared, and I just started ignoring them, they were painful but gone within a week.\nWell, this one time I waited a week, than 2 weeks and it suddenly grew enormous, a 2,5\u00d71,5 cm genital ulcer in a small girl. I showed my mom, she was shocked\nThe day after we went out in downtown to see an exposition and she took me to a big hospital nearby.\nWell, who diagnose me was the gynecologist from this hospital, surprisingly. She called a rheumatologist for confirmation, but she was the one who bat an eye in me and suggested behcet. Obgyn took a peak and then she kept asking her coworkers . Then a doctor came down and finally told me . But it was obgyn who first questioned my symptoms. Thank god she did not just assume she kept asking for help and got it. I would see multiple docs and just explain", "Anyone ever tried the AIP diet? I am about to start the autoimmune protocol diet. I am wondering if anyone else with Behcet's has tried this and if so, what were your reactions? Was it difficult? Worth it? etc, Any help would be much appreciated!", "Recently diagnosed, zero carb diet? Hello all! I was recently diagnosed with Behcets. I have had canker sores pretty consistently for the past 12 years and for the past 5 months have been dealing with a genital ulcer that has been quite possibly the most painful experience of my life. My doctor misdiagnosed me with herpes at first, which I just knew was wrong, and blood tests confirmed this. After doing some reading about autoimmune and inflammatory issues, I came across the zero carb/carnivore diet. Was wondering if anyone here has had any experience with it or just any diet alterations in general. Thank you all!!  I did a zero carb diet for a month. It worked great. I had no symptoms and had more energy than usual. Unfortunately I love sugar and carbs so I went back to a milder version of my previous diet, which still helps a lot.\nSugar is probably the biggest day to day trigger that I encounter so cutting down on that will help the most. This gives me so much hope!! I am starting zero carb tomorrow. I am in way too much pain to the point where I do not care what I eat as long as I feel better. How quickly did your symptoms go away? And anything else you have seen that helps symptoms?  I had to go back to a plant diet, with zero carbs. It is definitely helping. Fwiw.  Plant diet meaning what exactly?  Sorry, I meant plant based. Veggies, fruits, seeds, nuts, legumes, etc. No dairy, no meat. As fresh as possible so no canned or frozen and obviously French fries are not a healthy option, so maybe roasted potatoes. 3 months is a good starting goal as to whether it is working for you, and if you want to quit or keep going. Also I am GF so no bread for me but others can have it.  Oooh so quite the opposite of the diet I am planning on, but still no gluten. I think that is the main thing  Yes, so I am interested to see how a diet pretty much opposite of mine works. Ill update you! Hi /umontanamtn, when you did the HSV testing. Did you ever do a PCR DNA swab test? Western Blot? What was the timing of your symptoms vs test? Just curious\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have suffered with horrible horrible bouts of canker sores for many years, in the last 3 years they have progressed to my throat, and have had them without any break since that time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOtezla helped slightly, but had way too many side effects. Ultimately after bouncing around through many rheomutaological programs, I was told that mine is most likely \\_not\\_ behchets -- but since it is so hard to diagnose, it is a waiting game for me to see if I get more symptoms. All of the HSV testing I did was negative. Sorry to hear that you have gotten that 'last' one and a subsequent confirmation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding diet: Interestingly, they do tend to occur in relation to diet -- especially sugar. I am curious if there is a link between bile reflux and behcets. I wonder if bile refluxing from shit food is actually exacerbating the symptoms we get. I have had mild luck with diet. It took about a week and a half, mostly for my body to heal itself. And cutting down on dairy can also help with symptoms. I have been diagnosed with behcets and on active treatment for 8 years and honestly, I have tried every diet and nothing made me feel significantly better. I just try to make healthy choices and be as active as possible. In the long run what I eat does not affect my symptoms.  Has any treatment helped particularly? Or have you noticed it is gotten better over time? ", "Any of you all gotten the vaccine yet? I know that the pneumonia vaccine has a really really bad interaction with bechets, and I have not heard anything about COVID and behcets. If you have gotten the vaccine how have you been feeling? No I will not get it .I have allergic reactions to pneumonia and flu vaccine so no I do not get any vaccines and I am not going to get to covid vaccine either. Yes, I already got the flu vaccine this year and will also vaccine for covid as soon as I can! I got the moderna shot in December. Pretty bad muscle pain, mostly in my back and injection arm, the next day. Was completely back to normal 2 days after the shot. Get my second shot on the 26th. Pfizer vaccine. I had a stiff arm for a day but otherwise feel fine. My second vaccination is due next week. My RA wants me to get it ASAP, but it has not been made available to me yet. Wait, the pneumonia vaccine is *known* to cause a bad reaction in behcets people?? I recently got it and it was AWFUL. 104 fever for 2 days, heart rate in the 140s, sweats, chills, nausea and vomiting, arm pain so bad I could not move it at all or even wear clothes that touched it. I ended up in the ER. My whole upper arm is still red and mottled a month later. \n\nI am too young for the vaccine and only got it because my doctor recommended it *due to* my behcets. Wtf. There\u2019ve only been a few studies, but they were all very conclusive, to the point where it is agreed you just should not get the pneumonia vaccine if you have bechets I got the flu and pneumonia vaccine in 2020.\n\nMy doctor made me stop my treatment for a month before taking the pneumonia vaccine because she said that the medicine that I was using was not good with the vaccine. She did not mentioned about Beh\u00e7et being the problem, just the treatment.\n\n\nAnd about the Covid vaccine I am not sure I will be taking it soon because of the Trump wannabe president here in Brazil. Do you mind sharing what treatment you were on (and temporarily stopped) when you got these vaccines? I am on Humira and am wondering if I should stop before I get the vaccine. I asked my doctor of course, just waiting to hear back. \n\nThank you! _\"to the point where it is agreed you just should not get the pneumonia vaccine if you have bechets\"_\n\nCan you provide those academic studies? This comment is getting dangerously close to breaking Rule #3 - No Unthoughtful or Dangerous posts. Sharing personal experiences is fine, but providing unfounded claims about vaccine safety without primary source evidence is getting into the danger-zone. Oh! So sorry about that. The issue is specifically with the pneumonia vaccine, as far as I am aware, I have not seen or heard about the issue with any other. \nHere is the article where I first found it: \n\nHere is the cited study:  It is all good - thanks for the links! Very interesting - there seems to be a non-trivial amount of academic research around Behcet's and streptococcus bacteria (which causes pneumonia) - seems like there are reports of everything from hypersensitivities to increased risk of infection. It looks like this was a suspected underlying cause of Behcet's at one point, but that theory has largely been discarded over the last decade. Good to know though - definitely worth talking to a rheumatologist before getting the pneumonia vaccine as a Behcet's patient - as someone else pointed out, it might also be contraindicated with certain treatments as well. \n\n\n\n I am on Remicade and asked my rheum about it and he said there should be no issue with the vaccine since it is not live. Supposedly it will be much like the flu vaccine for us? Yes I was told the same thing! It is not a live virus, rather an mRNA type vaccine. I need to educate myself further on what that means exactly, but at least I know I can be on humira while getting vaccinated. Thanks for the reply! I got the vaccine (Moderna). 12 days out from shot #1. Not having severe symptoms to the point of needing ER but still having chills, low-grade fever, dizziness, headache, nausea on &amp; off. Others seem to be faring much better than me. Seems like this is just a personal reaction??\n\nEdit: Also FYI Behcet\u2019s Centre of UK recommends people with BD get the vaccine (at this time Pfizer is the only one approved in the UK so it is the only one they can recommend) -(", "Encouraging words Hi all, I barley post on here since I try to stay off social media but I wanted to tell you all your on my mind during thing holiday season!

Cheers!", "COVID-19 hi i am an F21 living in brooklyn new york atm. i am taking otezla AND colchicine to deal with my bechets but am scared with the recent COVID-19 outbreak. anyone out there dealing with fears around this? when do people think they will lock down the city? \n\ni would love to create a sense of camaraderie in these trying times\n\npls comment \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99 My wife has it too and wondering if she would be at higher risk with Corona... Im in California. I am terrified tbh. I am not sure how severe it could get for people with Behcets but I know that last time I had a cold I spent a week in the hospital because it turned into Meningitis. I do not have health insurance atm and if getting sick does not kill me it will leave me with tens, if not hundreds, of thousands in medical debt. We (my wife and two young boys) live with my wife\u2019s parents in a multigenerational house (10 people all together) and so the risk of people bringing it home seems rather likely. I am scared. I was diagnosed in October so I have never really experienced having to deal with other sickness alongside having Behcets. \n\nSorry for going on about it. I guess I did not realize I needed to talk about it. Ha. How are you feeling? Thanks for making a post! Ok, so first of all, I am not a doctor so ignore everything I have to say... CALL YOUR OWN DOCTOR AND ASK!!!\n\nBut while you are waiting, I am a super nerd with OCD who is done a lot of research into all of this so let me try and re-assure you with my layman's understanding of what I have found out.\n\nThe real issue here is not whether you catch this virus or not. We are **all** going to catch Covid19 eventually. The problem is, those people who are at high risk (the elderly) will often need intensive support from the medical community. What we are currently trying to avoid is the entire country contracting the disease all at once in one giant spike. If that happens, our hospitals will quickly become overwhelmed (see italy) and some of the elderly that could have survived the infection with the right care, might not because we run out of ventilators and such. So what we are trying to do with all of this isolation is slow down the infection rate so it spreads out over time, and gives the medical system the breathing room it needs to handle the influx of cases.\n\nAs far as you are concerned personally, your immune suppressants are not going to make you any more susceptible to catching Covid19. It is crazy infectious already. If you come into contact with it, you are almost assuredly going to get it. In fact, I have read that the primary debilitating symptom of infection is that it infects your lungs and your immune systems over-reaction damages the lungs and reduces their ability to transfer oxygen to your blood. I am wondering if our immune suppressants might be helpful in that, but from what I have read the doctors just do not know enough so it is up in the air. Where they could become a problem is in secondary infections. The second problem with Covid19 is that after you contract it, if you progress to viral pneumonia and end up on a ventilator, you could develop a secondary bacterial infection of the lungs. In that, our immune suppressants would be a problem. But by the time you got to that point you would be under the direct care of doctors and they would know what meds you were on and if you should stop them. On the bright side, having an autoimmune disorder works in your favor here. I do not know if you have ever gone off your meds before but holy shit my immune system is insane. Good luck bacteria, my immune system is like a nuclear war when it gets pissed. \n\nAt your age, you are very unlikely to suffer really terrible symptoms from this. The real problem is you could catch it and pass it on to someone that really is at risk. Avoid your elderly friends and family to keep them safe. Behcets could put you at elevated risk if yours involves your lungs. If you are on meds and that under control, I would suspect that you are going to be ok. \n\nRemember, the social distancing and isolation we are all doing now is to support our elderly and at risk community members. You are very low risk and will almost assuredly be fine. Good luck! Ended up in Prince George, BC for a geography conference at the same time as world women's curling. Bunch of international teams were staying in the same hotel as me, including a group from Italy.\n\nJust holed up with a bottle of colchicine and turmeric, hoping nothing exciting happens. I am concerned also. I tend to get pleurisy (lung inflammation) whenever I get a cough, so the respiratory symptoms of this worry me. I am on colchicine and currently fighting off seasonal flu. \n\nI do not think doctors have enough information for anyone, let alone the small subset of people like us with autoimmune diseases. But I think we have to assume that we are at higher risk, depending on what particular inflammatory symptoms we are prone to having just normally and prepare for those to be amplified if we catch COVID and our bodies go into overreaction mode. \n\nBest to take precautions as if we are in the same vulnerable group as the elderly and those with heart, lung disease etc. \n\nThe best thing to do is the most difficult one - try not to be stressed about it! Stress is a big trigger for flare ups for me so I need to manage the concern and precaution with good sleep and diet. \n\nStay healthy everyone! You are not alone. I have BD and am on methotrexate,  colchicine and prednisone. My parents are both MDs and my brother is a doctor at UAB hospital (helping with Corona patients, testing, etc). I was warned a month ago this Corona outbreak could be an issue. At that time (February), I ordered respirator masks from China and started to stockpile my meds. It has been a terrible flu season here, my kids have had both A, B and strep throat, hence I had already been practicing social distancing. My husband is working from home and we have adjusted other activities as well (kids are out of school). I have eliminated all vectors besides my husband leaving our house to get food. The last place I want to go is the hospital, so I am prepped to live like this until the \"curve is flattened.\" Medical professionals that are close to me are saying could be 9 months to a year. \n\nBest to all of you! Cheering you on as we plow through this uncertainty! You are amazing. Will you be my best friend? Sure? But, I am practicing social distancing so... back off!!! lol I am coming over to lick your face.... I am in Michigan right now and we have 54 positive cases as of yesterday. I also have underlying lung issues, which scares me. I am noticing my mouth ulcers are flaring up from all of the stress right now. I am glad I am not alone in how I feel! talking to my rheumatologist tomorrow can let you guys know what he says please do! hi! have you spoken to your dr. about the use of prednisone in emergencies? i have found that it turns things around for me when things start to get really bad. i know it works for others too. \n\ni was wondering if taking pred preemptively or in the case of contracting COVID-19 would be beneficial... fingers crossed! lmk if anything does happen! He told me that me (M22) is equally at risk as anyone else my age, which is low risk. He told me that me (M22) is equally at risk as anyone else my age, which is low risk.\n\nso you should be good too! :) So you should be good! taking pred right now would cause your body not to be able to fight the disease.... you should probably just not take any meds atm and have your awesome immune system just kill it quick. at least that is what i am doing..", "Freaking out about Colchicine overdose stories I have just been prescribed colchicine 0.5mg a day, but saw someone say somewhere that it is \u2018easy to overdose on\u2019 and there is been instances of people overdosing from a therapeutic dose. \nCan someone reassure me this would be impossible from 0.5mg once per day? \nI also then read that this was more relevant years ago when the normal average dose for colchicine was much higher. \nThanks :)", "Fatigue!!! Help!!! I take Colchicine and it greatly reduces my symptoms. I have severe fatigue and  hoping to hear about plaquenil or something helping with that. Has anyone found fatigue relief without a stimulant? I use one now and it makes my hear race and flip flop.", "Plaquenil/hydroxychloroquine Had an in depth discussion with MD today- decided against Otezla for now just because I am hoping to get pregnant in the near(ish?) future... opted to try Plaquenil. She said this med has very little literature for Behcets but is first line defense for Lupus related apthous ulcers. Curious if any of my other bee-shits sufferers have had any success with it or tried it? I have been on it 8 years, since I was diagnosed. It is helped a little with my joint pain and stopped my mouth ulcers entirely, like occasionally I will notice I have one at breakfast and it will be gone by lunchtime etc. It made me sleepy for the first few months, which is not a normal side effect, and I still get intense dreams and some occasional hallucinations as I am falling asleep or waking up (which I think are normal side effects). Like so many other rheum meds, it takes several months to get into your system enough to start working.\n\nYou have to get your eyes checked once or twice a year (or less? I have moved a bunch and every doctor seems to want something different); I have never had problems due to the plaquenil, but my ophthalmologist has found unrelated eye problems because I was getting checked so much, lol. Thank you for this! I am happy to know it is worked for you and you have done well on it! Finding the right medication is a battle, it seems like. It is tough for sure. I was fine with just plaquenil and short bursts of as-needed prednisone (I still had occasional flares with severe joint pain + throat and genital ulcers) for 5 years, and then it was like the disease completely changed for no apparent reason. I am on azathioprine now as well and still do not feel like I have a great grip on what to expect.  But I definitely do not miss the mouth ulcers!! Yes! I am on this and have experienced a huge improvement in my joint pain and nose/mouth ulcers. I have had weight loss surgery so I am hesitant to take anything harsh on my tummy and I take this with my supper because it hurt my stomach when I took it on empty tummy. I am also on dapsone which is an old school medicine labeled also for leprocy\u2014which has helped my scalp sores. It is not perfect but it is now manageable vs inability to get off the couch. The plaquenil has not caused any major side effects though. Yay!! So happy to hear this for you and have a good report about this treatment! I took it for a couple of years, it just was not effective for me. My daughter also has Behcets and Plaquenil works well for her.", "Bladder and kidney symptoms with flairs. Is this a thing. This is my last few weeks of symptoms. I have no formal Behcet\u2019s diagnosis Not diagnosed with Behcet\u2019s but many suggestive symptoms.

Deep legions x 7 ... Sore, itchy, form a red lump with deep painful pustule that is super super uncomfortable until bursts then peeling shallow ulcer type sore that makes look like an ice addict.\n\nNausea and a couple of small bouts of alternating diarrhoea and feeling constipated.  \n\nThen...\n\nIntense bladder pain with full bladder, passing normal amount of urine but so so painful. This lasted 3 days then developed extreme flank pain and nausea with low grade fever of 37.5 with aches in knee joints, ankle joints. \nSelf treatment with increased fluids and ural thinking it was uti \n\nSaw gp - presumed uti. Started on broad spectrum oral antibiotics.\nUrine MCS turned out negative - no growth\nBloods showed slight increase in WBC, neutrophils and monophils. \nCRP slightly elevated at 13.\n\nNext day back to GP with massive pain in kidney, swelling over flank. Pain in groin. Sent to ED.\n\nCT KUB okay but small bit of calcium in bottom of one ureter and maybe sediment of kidney stones in bladder. They were not sure. \nCRP now at 49 \nAdmitted and treated with IVAbs for suspected pyelonephritis but urine test still clear and WBCs retuning to normalish. \n\nStill in a lot of pain in flank and nausea ++ \nSent for rigid cystoscopy and ureteroscopy.

Addition info regarding workup:\n\nDermatologist did ANA testing thinking I might have Sjorgens or lupus but not reactive to those. Just autoantibodies present to thyroid (I have hypothyroidism). \n\nOther bechety symptoms are eye dryness and I had episclerotis once or twice. Are you a girl? I develop kidney stones very easily. Not sure if it is related or not. I know some people report bladder issues, especially those like me who also have diabetes (pancreatic diabetes potentially related to Behcet's). So I would not be surprised if there are correlations there. I just do not think they know enough about this disease. Yes I guess I missed the cervix part omg\n\nAnyway, I have had some bladder issues! Sometimes I cannot even pee. It is very scary. I drink tons of water, especially after intercourse. I stay away from NSAIDS-I have had a kidney stone and I am pretty sure it was from ibuprofen. \n\nAnyway, I am wondering if my problems are from endometriosis or not. Could this be a possibility? Absolutely a possibility. I have adenomyosis and suspected endometriosis. \n\nAlso, co incidentally I take ibuprofen for the andenomyosis. \n\nHm. Food for though. Thanks! It is suspected I have those too! \n\nAdenomyosis can be cured with a hysterectomy if you are up for that. I also use a TENS unit for mine. \n\nHave you seen an excision specialist? Even as a kid I would always get kidney pain when I would spike a fever (fever due to a flare but I was not diagnosed yet). Not sure if it is related to Behcets, but I have not gotten any other answers yet. I have a behcets diagnosis am also hypothyroid, have bladder pain off and on, had kidney involvement, have relatives with sjogrens, get pustules on my chest, mouth ulcers, had labia ulcers in the past, and have had pericarditis for over two years. I am 34. I am sorry you are experiencing all of this. \u2764 I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis because of my behcets. If blood flows there you can get issue. I have had lung, heart, brain, spine, bladder, kidney and now pancreas issues. I am so sorry it really sucks. I have Behchets and have had uti like symptoms and pain in my kidneys for years.

Brother diagnosed with Behcets sleeps for 3 days Hi dear people,\nFTP; on mobile.\n\n\nMy brother - \"B\" - (now 36yo) had (I do not speak English fluently, I will translate somethings literally) \"Cerebral Tuberculosis\" 2 years ago. He had complications but he got better. But recently, he developed more and more *severe* symptoms and was diagnosed with Behcets. There is one doctor that is not sure due to B not presenting classic symptoms.\n\n\nOne problem with B is that he is (he is always been) strongly averse to admitting ANYTHING \"bad\". He is visibly very different, compromised, symptomatic, but he says precisely this: \"I am getting better, it is just my leg.  \n(He cannot even walk alone, and invites me for events, then he sleeps, and he has an explanation that excludes sickness - I am not angry at all, I am very sad and extremely worried about him)\n\n\nHe is been presenting, too, a unexplainable absolute NEED to sleep: he sleeps for 3 or even 4 days, being woken only to be fed. *I have not found any information about it*.\n\n\nThen, when he wakes up, he stays up for like 2 days, and has symptoms of psychosis (extremely agitated, speaks to no one, sits in front of the computer - he is a very competent programmer, and is very lucky to have a supportive workplace; he is not working now, and even with the medical documents, his temporary disability was denied, but we are going to have it questioned through the judicial system)\n\n\nFor now, I would be immensely thankful for some, any information about the symptom of sleepiness. He is on medications, he does not mention pain.\n\n\nBut, for example, he is always loved to play with his son (5yo). This week his son visited him, and kept calling him to play, but he could only SLEEP. IMO, it is clearly a neurological manifestation (he has psychiatric symptoms too, but it is not one of them), and/or a side effect of medication. But we are lost about it. He just sleeps 6 times more than normal sleep, and he absolutely CANNOT CONTROL it.\n\n\n\nI would appreciate any help and advice.\n\n From what you have explained here, it seems to me that your brother might be suffering from the after effects of the \"brain tuberculosis\" you described. Behcets most commonly causes mouth ulcers and skin lesions, among other things. It seems your brother is very sick, but if he does not have ulcers in his mouth or painful skin lesions, then he is probably not suffering from behcets. Im sorry for your situation, but I applaud you trying to help your brother. Keep looking! I am not familiar with cerebral tuberculosis at all.  However, several months before I started experiencing Behcets symptoms I had a period of 4+ days where I could not get out of bed or do anything but sleep.  I was experiencing extreme ulcers downtown and had no clue what was going on.  To this day, there is no way that I can accurately describe it but it was the catalyst for all of my Behcets symptoms.\n\nHow long has your brother been having these sleep episodes?  Is this common? Has he been to the doctor about it?  It could be after affects from CT, random Behcets flare up, something unrelated or mentally.\n\nIs he on any psych meds?  Recently come off any psych meds?  Some of those will zonk you out and make you feel exactly like you described (can do nothing but sleep).  There are also sleep conditions that psych\u2019s treat.  Hope you reply, I am curious Thank you so much for your clear sighted answer. I am now organizing as best I can all the data to take it to the consultation with a great psychiatrist (TMI: my doctor of 7 years), she will see him this week. \n\n\nI am answering some things now, then I will come back later to finish, feel free to ask more if you want:\n\n* he is not on psych meds, he tried several different types and had terrible reactions to all of them (not all the same reactions)\n\n* He is been to a rheumatologist and to a neurologist; the latter diagnosed Behcets, the former did not write a ICD (necessary to get disability)\n\n* he is waiting to continue physiotherapy (due to an error of communication it is been postponed for one month - too much!)\n\n* now he is taking immunosuppressants, corticoids and a vitamin complex\n\n* he is had incontinence, but I do not know if it is a constant, but he was medicated for it\n\n* when he was at the CTI, his entire digestive funcion was compromised, he felt he was swallowing but he was not, he had to be fed through an incision in his neck (sorry for the wording, it must be weird)\n\n* both the rheumatologist and the neurologist attested he has inflammatory meningoencephalitis\n\n* the neurologist added that it is repetitive and it persists after the last episode; \n\n* the neurologist wrote he has: cerebellar syndrome (causing balance/ steadiness difficulty), double hemiplasia (causing motor difficulty/ difficulty in mobility), cognitive deficit (causing difficulty in self-care and in decision-making). The neurologist wrote, too, that he is in a phase of therapeutic adjustment using immunosuppressants and motor rehabilitation  Thank you very much. He has skin lesions on his chest and arms \"only\"...  Hi,\n\nThe exhaustion your brother experiences is a classic symptom of Beh\u00e7ets. \n\nSince the body is reacting to nonexistent infection, he might feel like he has the flu. The pain and lack of appetite associated with the illness may be compounding the fatigue, since of course, your brain and body need glucose to function optimally. \n\nIt is an awful disease and I would not wish it on my least favorite person. \n\n\nDo you mind if I ask meds was he placed on (if any)? \n\n\n(Been through 19 years of this scut) Sorry I am just now reading your reply, but this is wayyyyy out of my knowledge arena. Sounds like Behcets is not his main problem. So sorry for this. Wish you all luck and answers ASAP  Thank you, your reply is important, it sure helps. Thank you, your reply is important, it sure helps. Thank you, your reply is important, it sure helps. It sounds like your brother has neuroBehcets, I am so very sorry. Thank you. This happens to me when i am really sick even if I dont have ulcers. One time i slept for 28 straight hours. I used to fall asleep in class and out in public without any control. Its his bodies way of trying to repair itself. I dont have much advice because when this happens to me i just have to sleep it out but it does not last forever. Thank you very much. After thinking again, for the millionth time, it still seems to me that it is what you wrote: \"his bodies way of trying to repair itself\".  \n\nAfter about a month taking quetiapine/ seroquel (the latter apparently worked better), he is alternating between phases of sleeping a lot, sleeping normally and no sleep for two or (less) three days.  \n\nThe rheumatologist (\"uber\" specialized, decades of experience), IMO, seems to  attribute too much of his symptoms to his willpower. I just observe him and it is very clear, IMO, that it is his body needing xyz (sleep, no sleep, to talk a lot, not to talk, to concentrate on the cellphone, etc.). I carefully repeat my opinion when others, IMO, put too much pressure on him blaming his mood, will, desire, volition (or lack thereof). Hi, hope all is well. Im not sure if this is connected or not but I was also on seroquel when I was sleeping too much. I still struggle with extreme fatigue but I have been more alert since I stopped taking seroquel.   Hi, thank you very much. There have been changes, he started taking lamotrigine too, and upped the dosage of quetiapine to 200mg. But... last week for the first time he stopped sleeping too much and started to sleep a few hours per night; and now, when he does not sleep, he becomes very aggressive towards whoever is taking care of him. He is a mess; he has outbursts, moments of acute aggressiveness, and a disconnect with reality and his condition  \n\n.  \n\n", "Red spots covering parts of my skin Hey everyone\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am hesitant to call these rashes because it does not seem right, but I noticed yesterday that most of the side of one of my hips, the adjoining thigh, and the opposing ankle area are covered in red spots. I have more sporadic ones on my back and calves as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of these do not cause me any pain or itch or any sensation at all, the few that do hurt seem to have a whitehead on them, and mostly hurt when I am walking. The rest are just little bumps surrounded by red skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I did not know about behcet's I would think my ankle and hip had been eaten alive by bugs based on the look of them, but the lack of itchiness and the sheer number of them make that possibility unlikely. I am also in the middle of a oral and genital sore outbreak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone seen anything like this with their behcet's before? I get them really badly on my face, and randomly on other parts of my body. I do not think their one of the hallmark symptoms of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s but they fall under the \u201cskin lesion\u201d symptom. Google erythema nodosum. It is one of the symptoms of Behcets. Wow some of those pictures look just like it. Thank you\n\nExcept that mine for the most part are not painful. That is awful to hear, mine are thankfully mostly on the lower body I have had a flare up of it several times. It is not particularly itchy or painful. I get them on my face, chest, and back pretty bad.

I will consider your project for a day and get back to you. *saved Thanks Unfortunately, I do not really have time for that.

I just graduated with a degree in psych and i would be happy to help!", "Question about systems. Please help. Does anyone experiance olfactory hallucinations? I often smell a smoke odor when l'm having a flare?", "Is there anyone who has gone through pregnancy after a Behcets dx?  I would like to know this too! Not after, however my pregnancy helped to support my diagnosis. I had a few severe bouts of genital ulcers. My doctors all thought Herpes immediately, which I have been tested for many times and I do not have. Prior to pregnancy, they were not convinced, but after that I was diagnosed fairly quickly. I am glad you got a dx!  So ... I guess if you can help provide info so I can prep that would be great!! Yes. Dx in 2008, had a baby in 2013. Ask me anything. Sure, I can try! I have both Beh\u00e7ets and MS, and I went into complete remission, save for the mouth ulcers/genital ulcers, until I gave birth. I stayed in remission of all, except the mouth ulcers and chronic headaches/migraines, until I finished nursing 25 months later. Then, it all came back. My daughter was born at near 42 weeks (I ended up being induced) and had a normal vaginal delivery (it went fast once induced!). Daughter 8lbs 5oz at birth, and very healthy (and hungry, good gosh!!!). Good luck to you, and ask any questions you may have! :) Pregnancy and delivery went well? Yep! Currently 16 days postpartum. Not really. It was a rough pregnancy. Mini-flares and idiot doctors. I was hospitalized 4 times during the pregnancy. \n\nI have a really good team and a great rheumatologist. So when I got to the OB world it was a stark reminder that they know nothing. My first appointment with maternal fetal medicine left me educating this supposed \u201cbest doctor in (my city)\u201d. \n\nHe asked me how long had I had herpes and immediately ruled out a vaginal delivery. I flat out asked him if he had even read my chart. Claims he did and insisted on talking about my herpes. \n\nHe had no clue about Behcet\u2019s and thought the genital sores was herpes. I had to get my rheumatologist to explain the basics. Because I was not listened too when I explained Behcet\u2019s. \n\nI naturally have low blood pressure so when my BP creeped up to normal/high normal OB was not worried. My rheumatologist was and insisted I push for 24 hour urine. Which showed I had preeclampsia with normal BP. Since this \u201cbest in my city OB\u201d decided to not read the report I walked around for another week complaining of my symptoms before my water broke. That is the same day OB decided to read the report showing my kidneys had pretty much stopped working. When I got to hospital I was rushed into surgery for c-section. My son was big, 10 pounds and 1 ounce. Which may have been because of the pred I was on during the whole pregnancy. \n\nPostpartum my body healed quickly and gave me 8 months of almost perfect health and then I had huge flare. Would I do it again, yes, My biggest take was listen to your body and fight like hell if you know something is wrong. I listened to these experts and they almost killed me and my son. Push when you know something is wrong and start educating your team early on because they just do not encounter this often and the literature sticks with just oral and genital sores. We all know Behcet\u2019s is so much more. \n\nOh and this: I had a hell of a time finding an OB. Mine immediately asked me to find other. Because this was too much for their office. No other office would take me. I ended up with the practice of the major university close by. Even when I was hospitalized early on in the pregnancy no OB would even want to come in the room to see me even though I was under the care of neurology. It was only after I signed a waiver stating I would not try to be his patient would he even see me. Most OB\u2019s were too afraid to deal with Behcet\u2019s. I am in Florida and OB\u2019s have crazy issues with insurance here so it was a factor in who was willing to be my doctor. \n\nPls forgive any typos, mobile, no sleep, been up since 3am. Thank you so much for sharing!  I know every body is going to be different but it is good to know it is possible.  We are planning to start trying this summer \ud83e\udd70 Thank you so much for sharing, I greatly appreciate it. I am still at the stage where I have to explain everything to most of my drs. It sounds incredibly frustrating while pregnant.  Thank you again Do you care to share how it went and reactions with hour body?  Any other tips and tricks? Good luck to you! xoxo I feel like my Behcets is mild compared to many. I get mouth and genital ulcers and episcleritis. I do not take regular medication for it but have clobetasol for genital ulcers and will take prednisone if the flare gets really bad. I had flares throughout the first trimester and into the second. The flares were not terrible, but they were low level and constant. I used the clobetasol when needed but that was it I was put on aspirin at the start of the second trimester just in case it would help. \n\nOther than the discomfort from the flares in early pregnancy, Behcets had no impact on my pregnancy. What is a Dx?  I have been doing IVF for 4 years unsuccessfully until finally an embryo transfer took on Jan 19th and I am exactly 7 weeks pregnant today. I have not had ulcers in a few years thankfully Do they connect headaches/migraines to Behcets? I thought they were separate They are a commonly seen symptom that many with Beh\u00e7ets experience, chronic headache/migraine, as far as I recall, used to be a diagnostic criteria for Beh\u00e7ets, but in recent times that was removed. Still very common for Beh\u00e7ets patients to suffer relentless headaches and migraines. Dx means diagnosis.  Congratulations!! That is good to know!  I get them 1-3 times a week, sometimes more Not alone friend. &lt;3  Have you tried emgality or aimovig? I used to experience 2-3 migraines a week too, and now I only get about one per month. Emgality works wonders for many of us! Not all of course, but worth discussing with your doc. Little late to this thread but I have had behcets since I was 16 (diagnosed at 20) and had a baby at 30. Honestly for me, pregnancy seemed to keep a lot of my symptoms at bay. My OB was thankfully familiar with Behcets and said because your immune system is down so that the baby can develop without interference, most auto immune diseases tend to be better during that period of time. She said to anticipate a flare after delivery but I did not have much of a flare up until I weaned from breastfeeding.\n\nI think everyone is experience could be wildly different, just like pregnancy is in general. I did have migraines throughout my first trimester but they seem to be hormonal for me normally, so that was not shocking. \n\nAsk me anything you want to know!! My neuro actually just decided to try Botox Gotcha! I was on Botox for about a year for migraines too before I switched to emgality. The Botox was effective for me too. Best of luck! Thanks!!  I will also look into that I just had my baby in December and it was the greatest 9 months of my life, my Beh\u00e7et\u2019s went almost into full remission for the first time ever. I wish I could be pregnant forever. I felt like shit again at two weeks postpartum", "How long do your genital ulcers last? And questions about eye pain. I have had an outbreak of extremely painful apthuous genital ulcers for going on 4 or 5 weeks now. The viral culture tested negative for herpes, and since I have been celibate since the last time I had a negative std test I highly doubt it is herpes. (But I suppose it is not impossible; I plan on getting a blood test to settle the issue. Hopefully doctors will at stop obsessing over the idea that it is herpes...) \n\nAnyway, herpes outbreaks are not usually supposed to last this long, and if this were herpes it would be a 5 week long recurrent infection which would be even more unusual; I have had what I now recognize as genital ulcers before, but never this bad or persistent. (I always assumed it was an ingrown hair or 2 causing extreme genital pain a few times a year... I was so naive lol)\n\nHow long do your BD genital ulcers last, in total?\n\nI also run the gamut for other behcets symptoms; joint pain/swelling, fatigue, skin sores/pustules in weird areas, and most importantly mouth ulcers. I used to get them at least once a month, up until a few years ago when I started plaquenil for an as yet undiagnosed condition. My only consistently positive blood test is ANA. (And yes, I probably have something else going on.) My gf once got me numbing mouth ulcer gel as part of a birthday present the canker sores were so bad for a while. I had a canker sore under my tongue just last week...\n\nLastly, my eyes have been burning up all week; they feel awful. They are not red, and I have not had any vision changes other than maybe something with my right eye which hurts more... maybe some floaters/less peripheral vision. But it is always been my worse eye an I am being hyper vigilant about these symptoms, so idk. I have not rushed to the dr because last time I went to the ophthalmologist for a flare of the same eye pain/symptoms she could not find anything wrong, so I have been hesitant to find out once again there is no obvious reason. I will make an urgent appointment on Monday, rest assured. The pain has not gotten better like last time, and with all my possibly diagnoses having eye inflammation as a possible complication I know I need to go. \n\nAnyone else have eye pain like me and find it to be a non-uveitis complication of BD? Maybe sinus related? Or neuro? Would like to help but unfortunately I never experienced eye pain or genital ulcers, which gives an idea on how differently this disease can affect people.\nIf you experience vision loss be careful as it could be a papilledema, although as far as I know it does not cause pain. If this is the case it can be easily seen with an OCT exam, so I would advice seeing an oculist since **IF** it is your case then the earlier you treat it the less problems it causes. Having autoimmune issues can cause dry eyes, and dry eyes can cause some pain and floaters. Honestly it is hard to tell without testing if you are really experiencing a significant loss of peripheral vision (bc the brain is rad and makes up for a ton of lost vision). When I get uveitis I mostly get knock my socks off pain...like the first time it happened I thought my eye was going to fall out my skull and I made a home-made eye patch and then had to keep my eyes dilated non stop for a long time because my pupil would not dilate correctly. \n\nThat said, def contact your Optha and keep telling her that you are experiencing these symptoms. Ask about severe dry eye if they do not see anything I have chronic dry eyes, light sensitivity and on occasion burning. Invest is a good eye drop ans see if that helps. Also Benzocaine topical or things like Orajel can also be used on genitals. I hope this passes for you soon. :( Thank you!", "Confused about Beh\u00e7et\u2019s diagnostic test? Hi all,\n\nI have been dealing with some issues around diagnosis. \n\nSo a couple of years ago I developed oral and genital ulcers alongside Erythema Nodosum down my legs. This lasted a while and I was in hospital for treatment. However, the ulcers and erythema faded, leaving me with chronic pain that had stayed with me ever since. \n\nI occasionally get mild erythema every so often but nothing as severe as I had before. \n\nNow I am in the process of being diagnosed with endometriosis and during a gynae appointment she noticed an area of skin on my vulva that could be turning into an ulcer. She is pretty convinced that I have Beh\u00e7et\u2019s, as was my GP. \n\nHowever, at the time (2017) hospital staff ruled it out as I did not have a positive Beh\u00e7et\u2019s blood test. Now I am majorly confused as I have seen that there are no conclusive tests for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s and my endo doctor is going as far as to say I have Beh\u00e7et\u2019s now. She believes they got it wrong.\n\nDoes anyone understand the Beh\u00e7et\u2019s test and why my doctors in rheumatology previously ruled it out? Hi there, there is no test for BD. usually a host of tests are ran to rule everything else out- HSV, lupus, crohns, celiacs. \n\nAlways get copies of your tests and bloodworks. Half the time, people cannot read them correctly. \n\nAs for the pain you are speaking of, is it in the joints or overall? Hi, thanks for your reply!\n\nI have chronic pain down my shins, exactly at the points where the erythema Nodosum was. I have had all sorts of medication and acupuncture but it has not gone anywhere. \n\nI just cannot understand why Beh\u00e7et\u2019s was ruled out...\n\nThey definitely said I had tested negatively for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s but who knows what they tested me for- I was getting bloods taken multiple times per week at that point. I will see if I can get access to these blood test results. I am a scientist with clinical experience and behcets \ud83d\ude1c if you want to dm me your results. I could help if you like. \n\nBehcets was ruled out for me by a few docs early on too. We are all a bit different. Thanks for this, so kind! Hopefully I will get access to these results ASAP. There is zero \u201cblood test\u201d for Behcet\u2019s. You definitely need a good rheumatologist. Make sure you can get your records from the hospital as the symptoms and treatment matter more than their blood tests. It took me two years to be diagnosed, mostly because I fought the diagnosis so that was on me. My primary care doctor kept insisting and running all the other tests to rule out other diseases. When I finally saw the rheumatologist she said you need to have 3 distinct markers for a BD diagnosis, I had seven. That is when I started to believe. I also get severe nerve pain from having ulcer outbreaks for decades before finding out what this was. Get to a rheumatologist ASAP. They will have a completely different discussion with you than your primary docs were. You will definitely if you have it or if possibly you have another autoimmune in addition or in place. Advocate for you and I am betting they will listen. Good luck! Hi, thank you so much for this. Yes it was a rheumatologist that I saw and they had no answers. I was not aware of the markers for BD- I will need to look this up. Seeing as I had 2 types of ulcers and erythema Nodosum I am not sure how I would not have passed...\n\nI am also so tired of advocating for myself tbh! I have suspected endo and it has been awful trying to get doctors to take my pain seriously. I am finally getting a laparoscopy soon (COVID permitting) so I just have fatigue with the medical system rn. You are right though, I should keep pushing for this. I was seen by a rheumatologist and I have no clue why they dismissed Beh\u00e7et\u2019s! I definitely need to get access to my medical records as something is not right. I still get erythema flare ups and now it looks like the ulcers could be back \ud83d\ude2d Ya got to push because the doctors are not going. I was loud and proud and maybe I irritated someone but I got my diagnosis and treatment!", "Question about size of sores Hi! I was diagnosed with bechets last year after a particular bad set of genital ulcers that also happened to be my first onset (17F). Since then, I have gotten treatment and everything been going pretty great recently, but remembering back to how painful everything was, I started to wonder what other people's experiences with behcets is like. Specifically, how big are your oral and genital ulcers on average?\n\nMy oral ulcers are fairly small (5mm-0.75mm) on average, but jeeze, when I had genital ulcers I had two that were 2.5 cm in length.... I recently got another oral ulcer (my first one since I started my current medication, which is hella impressive cause I normally constantly have on in my mouth) and didnt even notice until a brushing my teeth and i felt a slight sting. Had an appointment today and they were like wow, how did you not notice til now? It is big! (it is my average ulcer size) and Im wondering if is actually considered big and i have a high pain tolerance or if my doctors are upplaying it because im still technically in the pediatric ward  Most Behcet's oral ulcers are \\~10 mm in diameter. However, much larger ulcers that are excruciating painful are not uncommon. Currently, this is what my mouth looks like (\n\nThis is just one of a number 1-2 cm ulcers that cover a lot of my buccal mucosa and extend into my throat. The areas of white tissue that are peeling away are dead (desquamated) tissue that is sloughing and exposing the bright red underlying ulcer. I am currently unable to eat *anything* and am confined to staying nourished and hydrated by sipping Ensure through a straw. In fact, I can only drink liquids after using lidocaine viscous to numb my mouth and throat. So, Behcet's ulcers can vary considerably in size and severity.", "Nasal ulcers in behcet\u2019s ? Did anyone experienced nasal ulcers in behcet\u2019s?\nOr nasal ulcers are a sign of lupus? I have BD and yes I get them. Thank YOU! I asked YOU this because google says are  specific only to lupus Yeah idk what is that about. I definitely get them in and around my nose. They suck. Lol. I get these too ;) I also get them, although thankfully not frequently I am not sure but for 2 months straight my nose was bleeding heavily non stop for at least 30min every single morning.. everyday.then I got the worst flare up of my life. It stopped now", "Joint pain management So my Erythema nodosum seems to respond well to CBD oil luckily.  It is like a miracle.  6 months of not walking because it is taken over my legs and feet and a week using CBD oil topical cream and I can almost walk fine (legs still look shitty, but not much pain).  \n\nHowever, my arthritis/whatever it is pain in my joints (runs along the length of the bones too) is at an all time high.  I wake up from night sweats and in a shit ton of pain in my wrists and elbows, hips and femurs (runs from hip all the way down my leg).  I have tried Advil, Tylenol, Percocet and a combo.  The only thing that gets it under some control (where I can bend the joints with some pain) is two Percocet (5-325) and two Advil. Compression helps some but not enough. I am losing a lot of sleep because of it and ugh, I was happy to get EN under control and now this!!! How do you all deal with it? Tips and tricks? I wish I had a high does of Percocet but he just started me on it and I do not want to go asking for more even though it is not working. Peeked back at your last post\u2013 you are on colchicine and sulfasalazine, correct? A different immunosuppressant *could* help the joint pain more\u2013 I have had slight success on CellCept, some do well on Methotrexate or Imuran (but those might not be great with GI problems). The best joint pain relief I have gotten is from biologics. I am supposed to be starting Rituxan soon, we will see how that goes. For pain management, there is a wide range of non-opioids that doctors are less stingy about prescribing. Gabapentin/Neurontin, Lyrica, Tramadol, Savella, Cymbalta, and cyclobenzaprine fall into that category. I have some experience with all of those except Savella, if you want more detailed reviews. Bear in mind that none of those address the inflammation *causing* the pain, which is where immunosuppressants and biologics come in. Also, have you been taking the CBD internally at all, or just topically? Great to know it works for EN! I am stuck using entivyo for now till they rule it out not working (10 more weeks) because they still think it is my Crohn's causing my issues. \n\nI did not do well on tramadol, it magnified my symptoms.  I am pretty much stuck with what I have medication wise for now, so hoping home remedies might help.  I am using the oil under my tongue too.   Ugh, 10 weeks is a long time to suffer with untreated symptoms. And is not Entyvio gut-specific, i.e. it would not address musculoskeletal symptoms? Yeah, tramadol is not great for me either. I would call the doc who prescribed the Percocet, and tell them it is not helping enough. You could also mention the OTCs (tylenol and advil) you are taking, since those can cause organ damage when combined with other meds and an inflammatory bowel disease\u2013 might help to grease the wheel on getting better rx pain management. ( supplements from Green Mountain CBD helped my joint pain a ton. Heat and ice sometimes help, too. Hope you get some relief! Thank you. I will look at those. ", "At what age were you diagnosed with Behcets? How did you suspect it? My wife shows all the symptoms except ulcers. Her mother was diagnosed with the disease in her 30s and we have been told there is a strong hereditary link.\nWe did the blood work and everything came back negative. Our primary care Dr said there is not enough evidence to \"label\" her with the disease yet. I am just trying to gather info on how to come out in front of it, should it really be Behcets. We suspect it is because of her genetic disposition and also because my wife have had a myriad of health issues that came and went unexplained. I have had mouth ulcers since age 2, I was always sick as a child and doctors told my parents for years I was experiencing \u201cgrowing pains\u201d until I was about 15 my back pain was out of control and I developed erythema nodosum, I saw my first rheumatologist at 15, I was not formally diagnosed until I was 18, I saw 3 different rheumatologist including dr Yusuf Yazici at NYU. I have slowly progressed with symptoms since then \nI have gi, oral and genital ulcers, erythema nodosum, Malar rash and pathergy, Ibs, fibromyalgia, arthritis and chronic pain and fatigue, uveitis, and migraines.\nI am 26 now, I have been resistant to all treatments (I started trying medications since I was 18) I was diagnosed at age 28 after many years of Dr visits and blood tests. \u201cNo, I do not have HIV\u201d. \n\nMy ophthalmologist actually handed me an article out of his ophthalmology magazine. It was one of those here are the symptoms, guess the disease articles. I immediately knew this was what I had. He is a good doctor. He spent his personal time going back through old articles. \n\nI recently started Humira and it is been really great thus far, although I am now blind in my left eye due to years of uveitis. I have had some serious issues with PEs and a clot in my heart as well. Hopefully the Humira helps. I was 26. Went to the ER because I felt like crap, was coughing for weeks and it hurt when I wiped. They said it was herpes ( that was a fun 1 am convo with my husband) but hospitalized me because of the size of the ulcers and one becoming necrotic. Once they ran the labs they realized I have never had herpes in any form. Then Beh\u00e7et\u2019s was mentioned but did not get a definitive diagnosis. Took 4 more years to get a doctor to say \u201cyes you have Beh\u00e7et\u2019s\u201d. I was 22, my whole life I have been sick more often than others. After years of fatigue, swollen glands, aches, pains, swelling of my hands and legs. I was \u201cdiagnosed\u201d with tentative lupus at 20. \n2 years later I developed tachycardia, mouth ulcers 10+, skin rash, other ulcerations. My doctor told me I probably had herpes and it was my lupus. My mom did research and came up with behcets, then we asked the doctor to test for it, lo and behold that is what it is. Doctors near me do not even know what behcets is, so now I am finally going to see a specialist this week.\nI was also diagnosed with narcolepsy following this. Which with the behcets made getting the narcolepsy diagnosis even harder. It is been a blast. I was 23 when diagnosed by a local GP who brought a student in to show how \u201cinteresting\u201d my case was. I am now under the care of a Rheumatologist. \n\nMouth ulcers all my life and vaginal ulcers started around 14 years old. Uveitis occasionally. Joint pain and inflammation almost always. \n\nI currently take Prendisolone whenever any vaginal ulcers appear and Colchine twice a day. \n\nAs far as I understand having reoccurring mouth ulcers was a mandatory criterion. This disease has no known biomarkers to test for, and so the diagnosis is more of a process of elimination. I am sure you are aware, seeing how your mother in law has the disease, but behcets can manifest itself in many ways and different people have different symptoms. I  was diagnosed this year, when I showed my first symptoms and they all happened at once in the span of a week. I had migraines, joint pain and ulcers. The joint pain (knees, feet, back and neck) was so severe, I could not walk. I ended up going to the ER multiple times, and got sent home before they finally gave me a spinal tap and realized i had meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord). At first they suspected a viral infection, but every biological sample they tested came back negative. After ruling out other possibilities, I was diagnosed with Behcets. I started on a low dose steroid, prednisone, and now take azathioprene, which helps keep my immune system in check. So far, I have only had a minor flare, which subsided after taking the steroid again. Even though my form can be very serious, since it affects my brain and nervous system, I have been quite lucky so far and am still living a normal life. I wish the best of luck to you and your wife!", "Anyone still here? I recently was told that the mysterious illness that has been bugging me for the last while is almost certainly behcets. \n\nIt would be cool to talk to another human being whose affected by it as I have felt pretty alone in this for the last four years. \n\nI am 20M from Canada and was hoping I could chat with some people about their experiences with this condition.  I;m here. What was happening to you in these last 4 years?\n Hey there! Nice to know the sub has not died. \n\nFrom what I can tell I have a pretty mild form of the condition. I typically only get the mouth ulcers and fever accompanied by muscle aches and pain. The symptoms are not terrible and are easily managed by taking a 50mg dose of prednisone at the onset of symptoms. \n\nI had been going to specialists for a long time and no one had been able to figure it out. Recently my vision had been blurry with things I can only describe as \"floaters\" hanging out in me eye. \n\nBecause of all the symptoms I reported they said it is likely that I have behcets. \n\nAre yo affected by this condition? If so could I ask you a few questions?  Hey howdy!\n\n26F, the whole shebang. Questions welcome via PM or here. 23f from the US here and I have behcets, pretty aggressively too, I have never been in remission and I have done dozens of trials of medications. I have just about every symptom of behcets and most recently developed reoccurring uveitis. Feel free to message me. I know it is different for you because you are in Canada but I was also just legally declared disabled here after a 3 year battle with our social security administration.  Hi, do you know how much time does it take for a neuro-behcet's patient to recover? I have been taking the pills for more than a year now and only just recently I have been getting a little bit better. I just want to be myself again. I have neuro-Behcet's. What do you mean by \"recover\"? For me it is about controlling the disease. I have been on Remicade before and recently started Humira. DM me if you would like to talk. ", "Western vs. Silk Road Behcet's   (\n\n\"Review of the literature clearly demonstrates a distinct difference in the prevalence of intestinal BD and other criteria in patients along the \u2018Silk Road\u2019 and in patients not directly associated with the \u2018Silk Road\u2019. We defined Western BD as cases from North America and Northern Europe and compared important criteria to traditional BD (Table 1). Intestinal BD has a prevalence of 50% in Western populations and is considered rare in traditional BD (( The prevalence of oral aphthous ulcers and genital ulcers is similar in Western and traditional BD (( Likewise, skin manifestations characterized by papulopustular lesions are similar in the two populations (( These clinical manifestations are part of the ISG criteria. The remaining two other ISG criteria, eye lesions and pathergy phenomena, are much less common in Western BD. Only 10\u201320% of patients in North America and Northern Europe demonstrate the pathergy phenomenon compared to 50\u201375% of patients in more endemic areas (( Ocular disease occurs less frequently and is less severe in North American and Northern European populations (( Intestinal Beh\u00e7et's disease, while not on the ISG criteria, is significantly more common in Western BD (( Thus, the ISG criteria may not be sensitive enough for Western patients with BD.\n\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that susceptibility to BD is strongly associated with the presence of the HLA-B151 allele. Of note, up to 81% of Asian patients with BD who live along the \u2018Silk Road\u2019 express this allele. Conversely, only 13% of patients with BD in Western countries express HLA-B151 (( Environmental factors such as ubiquitous antigens and infectious pathogens, including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C, parvovirus B19, and Streptococcus sanguis, have also been implicated as factors in the diverse clinical manifestations of patients with BD (( Scientists have hypothesized these antigens may trigger a cross-reactive autoimmune response in patients with BD.\"", "Recurring genital ulcers, undiagnosed but suspicious So about 2 years ago I woke up one morning with ulcers in my genitals, obviously panicked and went to urgent care where the Dr said they had not seen anything similar but ran STD testing anyway, everything came back negative. Right before the onset of the ulcers I was feeling kind of sick, mostly nauseated and achy. Fast forward to this past June I had another flare, similar symptoms of feeling ill and achy and then feeling some sort of itch in my vagina that I though was an oncoming yeast infection but then woke up with sores. Both times I had gotten a similar itch (although its not really an itch like I feel the need to scratch, not sure how to describe) thinking it might be a yeast infection coming, also both times I was under a lot of stress and experienced similar illness symptoms prior to the ulcers. Obviously went to urgent care for STD testing again, Dr said the same thing as before and all tests came back negative. Now yesterday I got that same \"itch\", had been feeling nausea a couple days ago and feeling lethargic and achy/ generally not well the last few days. Woke up with sores today. I plan to get another STD test because I have had sex without a condom once since the last test, just to rule it out but this feels more like the previous flare ups. I dont really get oral ulcers or eye lesions but I do always have random bumps on my body, the other day I noticed a bunch of small red bumps in my shin which I thought was weird but didnt think much of it. Both times I have had the genital ulcers they last aboout 1-2 weeks and the pain gets progressively worse until they start going away, they also seem to start out like small red ulcers then almost scab over. Any advice would be appreciated because I am panicking its an STD even though this flare follows all the same symptoms as the last 2. Hi there, I am a fellow Behcet\u2019s patient here and if you are really curious, you can possibly request from your doctor to run a HLA-B51 gene test, it is consistent with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease/syndrome.\n\nBased on your symptoms, it is pretty similar to what I have as well, genital ulcer &amp; what you describe as red bumps (and it feels like a bruised pain when touched - erythema nodosum: it is just a fancy name for tender bumps under the skin). As for the eye lesions, please please please be careful about it, do take note of floaters in your eyes (if you do not know how it looks like just Google image \u201cfloaters\u201d). I do have mouth ulcers since I was very young and it is just recurring, but if it came out of nowhere then it is a clear sign of inflammation. However all these symptoms are a result of inflammation of the blood vessels, typically areas of the sub-mucosa level.\n\nOpinion:\nI am not a medical professional that can give any medical recommendation/advice, but I can offer you the pathway I took, but obviously please clear yourself off STD first because we do not want to joke about that. \nIf you want to further investigate into your current symptoms, you can get more laboratory test done such as testing for white blood cells (neutrophils, basophils &amp; eosinophils), and inflammatory markers (CRP &amp; ESR). These blood tests can be done by your GP/Specialists (depending on where you are and how much subsidy you get, or insurance payouts). If all of them are elevated due to no reason (no recent infections/fever/etc), try to get your GP to refer you to specialist (rheumatologist OR dermatologist, and if you need it for your eyes, an ophthalmologist, however get your rheumatologist/dermatologist to refer instead, they are in the medical field, they know who their trusted colleagues/well known specialists).\nThese specialists will do their diagnosis from there because there are many different disease/syndrome/disorder that presents very similarly with slight differences, and they require monitoring of symptoms over time. \n\nTake this with a pinch of salt:\nPersonally, my stress levels are very very closely associated with my flare ups. So if you find that you get these symptoms days following a stressful period, try your best to learn how to manage your stress levels and monitor closely. With the amount of information bombarded to you above, I believe it is going to stress you even more. But do not be afraid because you will not be facing this alone, there are many Behcet\u2019s warrior out there facing this issue together with you and I just hope as a community we would be able to help one another. \n\nI wish you well! All the best! Opinion: sounds exactly like my symptoms in the months before I finally went to the rhematologist and deduced I had Beh\u00e7et\u2019s (she said there is no test for it).  I thought it was a yeast inf or something else until my OB said \u201cthis is inflammation\u201d. I had been diagnosed with Uveitis the week prior and my eye doc told me to see a rhematologist immediately.  You would never think joint paint, vaginal ulcers and foggy eyes would be related.  \n\nI did not have an STD you probably do not either. But behcets is so rare most regular docs never see it or have to diagnose it.\n\ntips:\n\u2022no more wiping- pat yourself\n\u2022cotton underwear to allow air flow.  \nLess Moisture the better\n\u2022get an Rx steroid cream \nMix the cream with neosporin and apply sparingly.  \n\u2022during bad flares I have resorted to Throwing oragel in the mix to numb the area. Try Epsom salts diluted in a really warm bath and soak for the genital ulcers. \nI use no fragrance Epsom salts.. they help to speed up healing I find. \n\nAgree with everything said above. I think most of us have had a few STD tests before getting diagnosed - every doc will want to test for herpes\u2026 and for us, every test is just negative. Very frustrating! Thank you so much! Thank you so much! This is so frustrating but I called my GP today and mentioned behcets to him last time I had a flare up so I am hoping he can at least help me figure out what it is or how to treat it Thank you I was wondering about epsom salt but I was afraid that might irritate it more. I will try this tonight! You need to get a referral to a rhematologist. Your GP does not know how to diagnose or treat Behcets.  You really, really, really must get in with a rhematologist. I understand that but he is aware of behcets and I am sure he could refer me to a rhematologist though. If not would not he at least be able to prescribe some sort of steroid cream until I can get into one? Yes. That is exactly what I did. Just do not use it too much. Use 1% hydrocortisone when u can. My vaginal symptoms (I know the exact itch you are describing here) and joint aches were some of my first symptom.  It was not until a very severe flare at 28 that the eyes and mouth part started too. Thank you for the response. I did notice the evening after posting this I ended up getting really red eyes and they felt inflamed?? If that even makes sense. I also had a slight sore on the corner of my lip but it went away the next day. What is interesting is these flares have only ever happened when I am otherwise feeling Ill, do you experience this? I actually ended up testing positive for Covid the 2 days after the ulcers broke out so Im wondering if it is because my immune system just cannot keep up with everything", "People that had behcet's since childhood, how did the symptoms develop? Hello, I am a 14-years-old girl and have been presenting Behcet's since I was a baby. I think I heard once thta people who got Behcet's from a young age usually have worst development of the disease as they grow old, and I have got worried and curious about it since it seems to be happening to me (at a slow pace but still happening.\nPeople who had the rare childhood Behcet's, specially adults, how did the disease develop in you? What are your symptoms now and back then? My 15 yr d daughter suggested I join this sub to answer your question. Hopefully I can help. \n\nI am 42, have been diagnosed since I was 18 but have had symptoms since a young child. For me I do not think my symptoms have got progressively worse, just different. \n\nI started with weird fevers and mouth sores as a child. I would often get super cranky and unreasonable.  As time progressed I started getting genital sores, that is when they suggested Behcets. They checked my eyes and i had damage in one of them consistent with Behcets, however i have had almost zero issues since then with my eyes. I had neuro symptoms a lot when my kids were little. I then had pleurisy, stomach and urinary issues as they got older but not usually at the same time. While I was pregnant I would have a brief respite from symptoms but the moment I would give birth my symptoms would come back with full force. Right now my biggest issues are arthritis and throat sores. \n\nSome of the things I have learned are that medications that did work will often stop working over time but that there are a lot more medications now than when I was young.That just because my major symptom is one thing now in 10 years I may not have any problems with that at all. That stress and worrying are my biggest enemy and are often the biggest contributing factor to me flaring and that although my life has not been like others, it is been a really good life. \n\nIts so hard to judge what you will go through by others. Even harder is the not knowing. As a teen you have the same worries as your peers with the added stress of, \"will i even be able to do any of that.\" My advice would be to get a good therapist that can help you focus on the good possibilities and outcomes as well as to help you not dwell on the \"ifs\". I hope this helped. I was not diagnosed until college, but had tons of symptoms my entire childhood: constant fevers and achiness, mouth ulcers,  genital sores long before I was sexually active, and fainting, which I now assume was from neurological Behcet's. You would think that all of these would have pointed a PCP or any of the specialists I saw to Behcet's, but trajectories like mine are unfortunately common.\n\nI guess one of the scariest thing about this kind of illness is the inability to ascertain how it might progress... I have had ups and downs over the years, and I do not know if I can confidently say it is better or worse with time. My ulcers are definitely less frequent now that I am on medication, but other symptoms like arthritis seem so much worse.", "Just started Colchicine and it made me really sick. Supposed to be going in soon to discuss other options. What are your opinions? I was just diagnosed after ~13 years of being dismissed and misdiagnosed. My rheumatologist already noted that colchicine would probably not work for me due to the severity of my symptoms (which include biweekly recurring oral and genital ulcers). However, I started Colchicine (2 x daily) and it caused severe abdominal pain, nausea, constant diarrhea for over a week and a half. My rheumatologist told me to discontinue and we will try another medication.\n\nHe has mentioned Otezla, Humira, and Remicade. Based on my symptoms which include body aches, fatigue, painful joints (wrists, hands, knees, ankles), genital and oral ulcers, eye pain/dryness, stomach pain, and diarrhea, what medication do you recommend or have you had results with? My flares are recurring biweekly. Basically as soon as ulcers begin to heal, I have another outbreak and it is body aches, fatigue, joint pain - everything all over again. I am just trying to find some relief. I did once a day to start, two seems harsh, are you taking it after food? I had bad stomach pain when I was on colchicine and nsaids. Otezla also has abdominal side effects, I am not sure about the other two. Both meds' side effects get better in time,  but it seems like you are already mid-forever-flare, and those are both more long term. I usually get steroids during a flare, either prednisolone pack or a shot. Sorry you have been miserable! I honestly would not write off colchicine just yet, there are ways to make it work I think. As the other commenter said, start on a lower dose (with Dr's permission) and work your way up. Also, I have found that taking fiber tablets with my meds helps A LOT with the diarrhea symptom. I have to take 3 tablets a day to get sufficient relief of my symptoms, which is pretty hard on the stomach. I also take 40mg of omeprazole at night and take my medicine with food. \n\n**The meds I take that have helped:**\n\n* Plaquenil, gives me about 20-30% relief, specifically of fatigue. Takes a looooong time to work, (up to a year, but I had some relief at a month in.) and may not work for Behcets, as I probably also have something else. (Sjogrens?) But it is worked for me. \n\n* Colchicine, gives me another 30-95% relief of skin symptoms and 30-50% relief of other symptoms, depending on disease activity/stress levels.\n\n* Celebrex, relieves a further 40-60% of my joint/tendon pain, but I have to take it every day for significant effect over time. Missing a few doses basically sets me back to 0%.\n\n* Of course, Prednisone. Used sparingly, can interrupt a flare nicely. Brings up me to 90-95% relief of all symptoms. \n \n**Honorable Mention:**\n\n* Otezla. Unfortunately it only has given me ~10% improvement of ulcers, really not sure it is worth it as fatigue has been a big side effect for me and that is a deal breaker. It is supposed to take 4 months to work, so I am hanging in there.... It made me sick for the first week. I smoked a little weed and it helped get through it. It worked really well for me. I have the more vasculitis and extream joint pain side of behcet's. It really helped with my rashes and mouth ulcers too though. Omg steroids are life during a flare up. Lol \u2764 I had the same problem with Colchicine, and have very similar symptoms to you when in flare. I do not think Remicade did much for me. My current combo that is working pretty well includes Otzela, Plaquenil, and Cimzia. Otzela stops my ulcers cold from the day I started it, but it can be harsh on the stomach. I only take half the recommended dose a day and that helped. My joint pain has decreased considerably since I started the Cimzia too. I tried taking before and after due to the nausea and everything it caused. I was taking 40mg of prednisone daily and saw no relief from my symptoms. I think it made me mostly feel sick/twitchy.\n\nI have read a little bit about otezla but it does not seem to be as widely discussed as colchicine. I was concerned since it says online the colchicine can cause damage to organs and diarrhea /stomach pain were indications of that. I started with one pill a day, but had significant GI symptoms.   My doctor told me to take 1/2 pill every other day to begin with, then 1/2 pill daily.  I am now on 1 pill a day.   I did not think I was getting much relief out of the colchicine until I went off for a brief time before a surgery.   My symptoms were significantly worse without it,   I was happy to be back on. For colchicine, I get bloodwork done to check the organ stuff. \n\nOtezla was only recently approved for Behcet's, it was originally for psoriasis. My Dr says it is much safer than chemo. I started it 10 years ago and had severe diarrhoea then I had to stop it after 2 days, but now again I would start it with single dose and see if it still cause issue to me or not. There very few alternative and colchicine seems to be doing good in behcets. Let us see how it goes for me would start this in 2 weeks. I agree. Colchicine was a life saver for my oral ulcers after slowly working up to a tolerable dose. I was getting 4-6 ulcers every two days, and it basically took the frequency down to one every 6 months. Please introduce Remicade to your doctor!!! It is an infusion. My s/o is 26yr old male. Remicade is the ONLY treatment that helps him. His Behcets is severe. He has all of the symptoms you have listed, but the same genital sores are all over his legs and starting on his arms. He was denied treatment through his insurance because he just turned 26 and there is an issue with the insurance (even though he has the medical card aside from his parents insurance) we are struggling.

How are all of these connected to Behcets?  * **HLA-B51**: folks with this gene are significantly at risk for Behcet's Disease. If you have BD-like symptoms and test positive for HLA-B51, then you will be diagnosed with Behcet's. This gene is the only consistent diagnostic marker we have for the disease right now. You are positive for HLA-B51 based on the labwork above!\n* **ANA**: Anti-nuclear antibodies, it is traditionally a test for lupus, but it can be high in other autoimmune diseases. It is not unusual for more severe BD cases to also have a high ANA, but do not read too much into that. Every rheumatologist will perform an ANA on you at some point, it is one of the most common rheumatological tests.  \n* **Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies**: This one is interesting, ( indicates that the ASCA test can be used for Crohn's, UC, and BD as a low quality diagnostic tool. There are some correlations between those diseases and testing positive for ASCA. Thanks for your reply! I am trying my best to not play doctor and hold out for my appointment next week but it is hard. I have been dealing with this for 10 years so it is actually somewhat relieving to know I have been right about it all along. I am not the first commenter but i know that feeling all too well. Visited  3 docs with that paper. I have more than 3 mouth sores a year, but they dont last and clear quickly. I have folluculitis mostly on my legs that is pretty much there year round. And then i have a whole slew of weird  peripheral neurologic, skeletal musclar pain, frequent chest pain, migraines with aura and a bunch of non specific symptoms. The most competent doc said no behcets, the 2 eh doctors said i prolly had it and recommended otezla. I fell in a rabbit hole and needed confirmation that alot of the symptoms i wad experiencing werent vasc or neuro and got alot of useless testing done and irradiated myself to possible cancer. The anxiety and fear made me have a nervous breakdown at work and the united states is an unkind shithole to workers. 2 years later im not sure i have behcets. I hate that paper. I maintain american rheums fucking suck at this disease and dont understand how and when to test for hla b51. Hla b51 is the only consistent marker of behcets true. The odds of getting behcets even in endemic regions are very small. 8-42/10000 in turkey, by far far the region with highest incidence of behcets. Hla b51 is purported to increase your chances by six, so in the region with the highest rate of behcet, it is 2.5 percent with hla b51. No diagnostic guidelines that i know of use hla b51 for diagnosis. It is not a diagnostic test. From my understanding hla b51 is very common in some region, estimated to up to 20 percent of some populations. If hla b51 was a strong absolute indicator of behcets then many people would have the disease. I think its just some low hanging fruit for some clinicians having to deal with a very complicated and vague disease. I have read quite a few epidiomiology studies on behcet that  cant even agree on whether hla b51 predicts a more severe disease course or not, results back and forth between yes and no statistical  significance \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Yes - you are correct - this is an important nuance. It is currently believed that the gene HLA-B51 only confers a higher risk of having BD - it is not diagnostic or deterministic of BD by itself. The presence of HLA-B51 + having BD symptoms is typically an easy diagnosis in clinical practice though. \n\nBut yeah, to your point, the research on HLA-B51 paints a very complex picture. There are _strong correlations_ between HLA-B51 positivity and certain populations (Turkish, Japanese, etc), however these correlations fall apart in those of northern European descent. HLA-B51 positivity correlates more to genital/oral ulcers + eye involvement, but usually does not see gastrointestinal involvement. \n\nA non-exhaustive source list for the above, haha, mostly if anyone is curious in this research rabbit hole!\n\n* (\n* [The influence of HLA-B51 on clinical manifestations among Japanese patients with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease: A nationwide survey\n](\n* (\n* (", "Behcet\u2019s and covid !!! I might have covid, my all households are positive, and for sure i m too. I have mild flu Lime symptoms for 4 days, mild headache, a Little fatigue and my throat hurts sometimes. Now i feel dizzi when i move my head suddenly. I might Also have behcet\u2019s, is not an official diagnosis, But i think i might have it like 90%. I Take no Medicine for behcet\u2019s and since the flu symptoms started i m taking paracetamol. I do not feel Bad right now, no fever, But i m afraid i will start getting worse day by day.  What i m afraid of is blood clots, it seems that covid may cause blood clots and behcet\u2019s too So i started to Take baby aspirin . \nAs i Dont feel very Bad i will isolate myself But not go to the hospital. \nAny advice? Please help me If you are not taking immunosuppressants and/or steroids you should not be at any higher risk. I got a letter saying that it puts us in the highly vulnerable category? I am of course not a medical/public health professional, but I have asked my rheum a slew of questions. Thinking of it on a scale, someone with an autoimmune disease is at higher risk than someone in perfect health, but the scale of that depends on the severity of the symptoms you experience and their nature. Then medications make the biggest difference. Something like Colchecine has little to no impact, Azathioprine increases your risk but not so severely to be labeled \u201chigh risk\u201d unless you are taking steroids like Prednisone regularly. End of the line treatments like TNF inhibitors do put you in the high risk category.\n\nIf you have had previous concerns about blood clots I highly recommend reaching out to your rheumatologist to measure your risk, but otherwise I think relaxing and focusing on healing is the best way to go. Are you in England? I know the NHS classified as more vulnerable. This exactly. My rheumatologist also told me that all the medication I currently take for my Behcets would be given to me if I got covid. Also agreed that Behcets itself would not be at higher risk . Yes I am, they class Vasculitis as high risk. Is this not the case in other countries? We have a much board range of high risk in the us. This is the list we go off of for possible increased risk. \n\nAsthma (moderate-to-severe)\nCerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)\nCystic fibrosis\nHypertension or high blood pressure\nImmunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines\nNeurologic conditions, such as dementia\nLiver disease\nOverweight (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2, but &lt; 30 kg/m2)\nPregnancy\nPulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues)\nThalassemia (a type of blood disorder)\nType 1 diabetes mellitus Research has found that those with vasculitis are at higher risk of myocardial injury when suffering with Covid-19. There is also greater risk of secondary complications, such as lung disease, either as a result of the disease itself, or from the immunosuppressive treatments.\n\nI think partly why we are at risk is linked with cytokines and the risk of cytokine storms, as research is increasingly finding a link between the Beh\u00e7et's response and cytokine activity.\n\nOf course, as Beh\u00e7et's is rare, there is not much research out there. That is probably why there are differing opinions on how at risk we are, no one really knows.\n\nOriginal poster - Saying this, I would not worry too much though, I remember someone on here saying they had it and they were fine, they just felt like they had the flu. Seek help if you feel you need to though. Get well soon.\n\nreferences:\n\n Your doctor can run a test called a D-dimer. It can tell if you have clots or not. An alternative to aspirin is a supplement called nattokinase. BUT do not take two blood thinners together and talk to your doctor about taking anything new, including aspirin. I have Behcets and had covid. I do not mean to scare you but I have heart damage to three of my heart valves and some long lasting neurological symptoms. BUT I also have systemic lupus, scleroderma, and am on chemotherapy drugs for those conditions. I do not believe the Behcets contributed to any of these issues, and I never had any clotting. I encourage you to discuss your fears with your doctor. The most important thing to remember is that COVID hits people differently. Completely \u201chealthy\u201d people end up on ventilators and high risk people do just fine. It all depends on your viral load and how your body responds. I would encourage you to wear a mask even at home if you are around other people who should also wear a mask. Try to keep your viral load as low as possible. Stay positive! It is scary but most people are doing okay. In France, where I was recently diagnosed, they told me I am in the high risk group. But I had a bad flare, I was hospitalised with meningitis because I did not know I had Beh\u00e7et so I let it run until then. So of course, I am currently taking azathioprine, prednisone, colchicine and aspirin...\nI have been decreasing the Prednisone gradually in the past weeks, while increasing the azathioprine. They still put me in the high risk. I am now at my parents in Portugal, and I have been taking all the cares about this. \nI agree with the other comments here, I think it depends on many factors, but most importantly, you should discuss this with your doctor.\nAlso because for now you feel fine, but many people start to feel very bad suddenly from what I hear... I do not mean to scare you, but I believe everyone should be mindful and careful. Aparently healthy people that catch it, feel just fine in the first days, and then all of the sudden they go to the hospital with pain breathing... And many people that end up with tubes etc, develop neurological issues after. My father has a friend that is in that situation. She talks to you now and she makes lots of breaks to think about the words she wants to find... She reads one sentence of a book and she struggles to understand it. She was perfectly fine before, she caught covid in march and was intubated.\n\nTalk with your doctor.", "Vasculitis I went to bed last night after starting a new medication for headache prevention and saw my legs had this bright red spots all over the calf, thigh and ankles. I freaked out and thought it might be an allergic reaction so my family asked me to go to the ER to be sure.  I did and they said it was vasculitis.  I have never had this and now I am dealing with my PCP - who I think is generally useless - after many debates today she finally let me make an appointment with dermatology for Friday to look at my legs and wants me to do more labs to prove it is vasculitis.   I am upset because she said I have to start prednisone asap if my CRP is elevated.  Honestly, I have so much trouble with prednisone and really really do not want to use it ever again.  I am already on Remicaid and I think it is fading quickly on my legs.  Can this just go away? Can I ask for other drugs? Should not my remicaid be preventing this?  I am so upset my body just decides to bring on new issues.  I feel so overwhelmed that I just wish I never went to the doctor. It depends on the dosage you are taking, but sometimes Behcet can be more agressive than usual and you need Prednisone for a time to deal with stuff...(besides your usual drug).\nIt is the same for me. I take Imuran and Prednisone right now, and I am slowly reducing the last... But my doctors already explained that there is always a chance I need to put the Prednisone back.\nMy treatment aims to keep me only on the Imuran (azathioprine) for the next 3 years (at least), since so far with 100g and reducing the Prednisone, it seems it is working. I started this with meningitis and vasculitis on the eye, and ulcers in the moth btw. Last year.\n\n On my last appointment, last week, the rheumatologist was quite happy with my progress and I went from 60g of prednisone to the current 7 (per day). Soon I will stop... But..... He told me, suddenly this can change and we need to rise the prednisone again.\n You see? So I really think it is very much related with the \"agressivity\" of your flares... I understand it is a pain, but maybe you will have to bear with it. I currently struggle with the moon-face thing :( makes my self-esteem a bit low. So whatever your reason is for not wanting, I understand!\n\n Still, from what I get, being new to this, you really need the Prednisone for it, or something of the sort (corticoid). \nFor example, just to tell you how serious it can be, it is been 8 months since my vasculitis, and this past monday I went for my ophthalmologist check up, and tho it is fine now, I still have tiny blood vestiges in the retin of my eye! Pigmentation change in the left eye and all. Doctor told me I could have gotten blind if I had waited a bit more :/\nSo, it can be quite serious.... in that sense, you should try to endure it, for your health I think...\nOf course, I would say you should talk with your doctors and ask if there are alternatives, explaining why you are reluctant taking prednisone again. Maybe there are! I dunno much.\n\nI hope you find a solution, and I wish you luck!\nMaybe you can update this when you have your answer? :) I would like to know too.\n\n(Sorry for my English btw, I am not eng-speaker!) Thanks.  I find Prednisone makes me feel really bad, my skin hurts all the time, headaches, and extreme weight gain (I know these are normal) and I already have bone density issues from past Prednisone.  \n\nI just wish they were willing to do tests first to see if it is serious or just passing by (acute vs chronic). I have not even had labs or been seen by anyone other than ER fix and she is trying to break out Prednisone as the go to.  It is frustrating.  But in the end yes I can see  Prednisone being needed if it is more serious. You mention that about your bone density...\nJust this week I finally dropped a *** load of supplements for that. I still take calcium every day, it is a chewing pill called calcitab.\nI took potassium, vitamin D and D3 and once per week another thing - alcaline phosphatase (? I am doing a literal translation of this one). My rheumatologist has a very big worry about this stuff, he often publishes papers about it, so it is something he always monitors on me.\nDo you take something for that? If not, I would advise you to also ask about it. \n\nMy skin does not hurt, but yeah. The weight gain, and not only that, but the fact that specific areas of the body get all swollen :/ I used to be proud of my jawline T.T let us just say, not anymore....... \n\nMaybe you should see a rheumatologist that specialises in Beh\u00e7et. I keep seeing here that a good rheumatologist that actually knows this, can be a life changer. Mine always discusses things with me first, explains everything, we talk about options and how I feel about the current stage of treatment etc. I do blood tests once per month.\nI did X rays, tac, you name it. Each time I have a new symptom, I have his phone number and we discuss it over WhatsApp and then if he thinks we need to check, he sends me to the urgency but meets me there. So he does all the tests imidiatley, I do not have to wait since I enter through the urgency, and he can see if it is a tiny flare or the thing kicking in once more.\nHe also redirects me to the necessary other doctors, with a proper file/diary of everyyyyyyyyythiiiiiiiiinnnng. Dermatologist, ophthalmologist etc. He never prescribes anything without proper testing, and he is adamant on taking me off the prednisone asap.\n\nAre you in the EU? Do you have free health insurance or something of the sort? :/ Because then there is that problem that I keep seeing here when it comes to find good doctors....", "Keeping mouth 'clean' appears to help *Quick disclaimer: I am not a trained medical professional, so this is a layman's pr\u00e9cis of what I have learned about the mouth and Beh\u00e7ets! Please do not take this as medical advice. I have omitted the names of the drugs used.*\n\nAfter spending a bit of time at the Beh\u00e7et's Centre in London, and talking with Prof Farrida Fortune quite a bit, they are investigating a promising lead in keeping Beh\u00e7et's under control.\n\nA link to a paper I could find on the topic (for anyone who is curious!) is ( (not paywalled), but from my conversations with the docs at the Beh\u00e7et's Centre, and from a bit of reading around, I came to understand the following. I am totally open to anyone pointing out that some (all!?) of this is not completely correct as I am not medically trained!\n\n* There are these proteins called ( floating around in your mouth, and they appear to be one of the first lines of defence in your immune system, especially where your mouth is concerned.\n\n* When a TLR recognises a microbe that is not going to be good for your body, it signals to your immune system that something bad might be about to enter the battlefield.\n\n* As soon as your immune system gets the signal, for people like us, it goes into overdrive, like a maniacal rogue agent, and starts hacking away at things it really should not be. Like giving a psychotic blind man an axe. And we all know how that story ends.\n\n* Prof Fortune and her team have been experimenting with a combination of a steroid, an antibiotic, and an antifungal used together, dissolved in water, to be used as a mouthwash. The idea behind this is not to 'turn down' the TLRs, as (if I am at all correct here) I am not aware of a way to do this, but rather to keep the mouth as 'clean' as possible to try to stop the TLRs picking up on any foreign microbes that may be present. \n\n\nThere will be other things oral things that this treatment addresses, so I daresay this is just one effect of it, but I found it interesting to read about.\n\nI make and use the mouthwash whenever I feel symptoms arise (whether ulceration, fatigue, or whatever). It makes ulcers go away within a day or so (vast improvement, even when compared to prednisolone and immunosuppresants alone), and generally helps me get back to 'normal' a lot quicker. Using the mouthwash when I am not feeling any symptoms to hold them at bay. I am quite amazed.\n\nWould be interesting to hear if anyone else has tried a similar treatment.

Im doing it on march and i would like to know if that would be enough to know if i have it or not.\n\nSorry if it was too long and ty for reading this i hope i have a nice day yall Hi :) I have the American version of Behcets disease; I am in my late 30s and am happy to share what I know and my experience. Behcet's disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning in order to be diagnosed other diseases must be eliminated.  After eliminating other conditions,  one must fulfill the criteria, however all criteria does not have to be fulfilled. Pathergy test may be used for diagnosis criteria, but even a positive pathergy test is not conclusive. If you have a first degree relative, I do know that you have a higher incidence of disease, in which case you could look at genetic testing for HLA-B51 marker. Symptoms can often be confusing and take years to come fun circle. I did not have the full onset of symptoms until my early 30s. Something that helped me to get diagnosed was keeping a health journal with pictures (I still use this tool to track my flares and reactionsto meds.) It provided a timeline of symptoms and the pictures allowed my doctor to see symptoms that seemed unrelated such as: livido reticularis rash, swollen hands, facial lesions, erythema nodosum, herpetiform ulcers in throat, Raynauds phenomenon etc. \nThe Vasculitis Foundation is also a good resource to learn about the disease, diagnosis, treatments, etc. Link is here \n\nHope this helps. Best to you.

I was not on anything else at the time but I was almost in remission for two years while on Humira, without any other medications. Humira has worked wonders for me. I have been on it for 8 months now, and started seeing great results after 3 months of being on it.\n\nDuring those 3 months I was still on colchicine but my rheum eventually took me off it since I was doing well with Humira.\n\nFor reference, I had to try Otezla and Colchicine before Humira and I am glad I did.

I m 25 and i was also diagnosed with behcet\u2019s 2 weeks ago, But i will have a second opinion , as i do not believe this. I am feeling well, But scared FOR my life as YOU do. You are not alone in this! I m from Romania, and here the medical costs are not So high like in other countries, But there are people who still can not afford medical care. \n     You are lucky that you have your bf who really loves you and together you will get through. My biggest dream Now is to become a mom and Even with behcet i can do it. I v read stories of people who lived happy and normal lives with this disease and they have beautiful families. You will be fine! SEE the bright side of all this, you still have all your life in front of you, there are people who die every moment from terminal ilnesses. You will not , we Both will not, So lets be happy. \n     I m here with you and right now i try to encourage you, But i am not doing my best.

Its a journey but the feelings you have right now, are a valid and necessary part of that journey. \n\nSo when I am this overwhelmed I find it helps to have practical steps that break down what seems totally unmanageable into more manageable chunks. \n\n1. You can live a totally normal life with Behcets. We dont always live in pain...symptoms will come and go and with time, you will learn how to best manage them in ways that work for you. Having said that, this subreddit is great for practical advice on tips for healing ulcers etc. If you have specific questions, ask! Everyone is here for you ..we have all been through it. \n\n2. To get through your current bad flare up  you need some medical help. I do not know about the expenses side of seeing specialists (I live outside the US) but to help speed up your chances of seeing the RIGHT doctors, its really positive you have an actual diagnosis. So many of us have spent years and countless money seeing the wrong doctors and being misdiagnosed. As soon as you can, get yourself a doc who will prescribe steroids to help you through the ulcers flare, and then he/she will probably recommend going on long term medication.. these help! Some of us are on immunosuppressant meds and anti inflammatories and/or steroids or combinations of these. There are also stronger meds that are very effective, but usually rheumatologists will take gradual approaches to treatment starting lightly and adjusting or adding in time. It takes some time to figure out what works. \n\n3. Examine your diet! Do research about anti inflammatory diets... if you are interested in knowing more, ask and I will offer suggestions of what to begin reading. \n\n4. Try not to be so stressed about the diagnosis. I know it is a vicious cycle - stress is a trigger for flare ups so we are not supposed to get stressed - but it is damn stressful so we get stressed - then we stress about the fact that we are stressing! Try to relax and not feel afraid for your life. Things will get better, you will heal, and you will live a productive, active and normal life! \n\n5. Sleep... meditate...listen to healing affirmations on youtube, anything! But try to give your body the chance to physically rest. \n\nI hope you find some comfort in everyone is posts... and some practical steps for beginning your healing - physical, mental and emotional. You can do this :) There are some really great comments here - you can definitely find resources to help you out. &lt;3\n\n\nI just want to add that stress is a major trigger for a lot of people with behcets. I know you have a lot to worry about right now, and I am sure it seems bleak. Just know that it will get better, and you are not alone. Managing your stress levels can help you feel better and reduce reoccurrence of flare ups. Hang in there. You have got this! You are not alone! I am so sorry this is happening to you. I have no idea about health insurance as I have free healthcare in my country (as we all should!). I would recommend doing some research and seeing what kinds of financial support you can geet. I bet there are loads of charities who help people like you. You could even crowdfund if you have to.  I know it is hard, but you have to think positively. Stress will only make your symptoms worse. The best of luck &lt;3 If your behcets is showing so many symptoms you may have been actually sick with it for a while now and it may have put you in a state of unbearable stress. You sound just like me around the time I first started getting taken seriously by doctors. My nerves were just soooo shot and nothing that normally worked to help me talk myself out of spiralling worked anymore. If it is possible, see if you can get a prescription for amytriptaline or nortriptyline. It is an anti depressant that works on the nerves through out your body. In SE Asian countries where doctors are very experienced with behcets almost all the patients are given amytriptaline as well or some kind of mental health therapy. It is recognized as a really significant component of the disease. I was put on nortriptyline and made all the difference it really helped me feel grounded and as if i could handle things it also took away a lot of my fatigue and pain. That feeling of rotting away, falling apart or that I was about to be snuffed out, like I could not gather the strength to face my challenges - turned out most of it came from being physically sick, it was like my body told my brain to feel that way. \n\nIf you cannot get that specific type of anti depressant the more common ssris may help to, just probably not as much. \n\nSo yeah, you sound just like I did and I do not want to give you a big lecture on what attitude to have. I am telling you what worked for me just in case it also works for you. \n\nSomething to watch out for with behcets is people who have it always talk like they are in danger and kind of treading water and they need to fight off all these threats, I have a theory that that kind of feeds the disease. Your immune system is in overdrive because it thinks you are always on the verge of getting infected and dying, that is what behcets is. So anything you can do to feel safe opening up and relaxing will help you long term. If you have had bad experiences with setting boundaries that can feed the type of stress that gives you flares ups. That is like, a complicated topic I do not want to get into it but it is something to keep in mind. Try to do something at least once a day that will help you just feel the opposite of needing to fight and protect yourself from everything and slowly you will start to feel so much more able to cope. People with behcets often spend years feeling like they are infected or sick with 10+ things and by the time we get a real diagnosis that feeling about ourselves can be deeply ingrained. Just remember it is not true. Also that is the good part of having behcets, your immune system is actually too good,  if you have anything weird going on in your body it is probably just behcets, it is just the one thing not 50 things it is all just behcets and behcets is not lethal, anything going wrong in any part of your body can pretty much be fixed with the same drugs. You are less likely to catch colds or get cancer because your immune is in overdrive not under drive. \n\nSome other tips, if you are concerned about medical costs a lot of supplements can help with it. I am not in the US now but when I first started having flare ups I was, and I had good experiences with the following products - berberine, MSM, dmso, prenatal vitamins (so your body has extra material to repair nerves and skin) lastly try out some Dr Christopher brand products they are very affordable and easy to get on amazon, avoid anything to help with your immune system cause it is usually geared to boost your immune system which we do not want. I used the Dr Christopher tissue and bone supplements and tissue and bone cream, very good for aptheous ulcers and also pretty decent anti inflammitory.\n\nDo not freak out at the long list, you will not die if you do not get every single thing. I am just listing all your cheap helpful options, I do not use all these things at once or consistently.  It is all just cheap stuff that either takes down inflammatory response or helps your skin and nerves recover nice and fast. You do not have to get the most super duper best brand either and these things will still help. I am also not saying that you have to get into to all the natural healing woowoo stuff and be afraid of doctors. See the doctor and happily accept their drugs. It is just if you only have an inkling of a flare up or they are only treating your main issue and ignoring other things you have all this handy cheap stuff at your disposal to help you feel more comfortable and prevent things snow balling.\n\nSo yeah I hope I do not sound insensitive like I am making everything sound easy. It is just I started off getting behcets in a foreign country when I was broke all alone and for about 2 years I felt like one tiny thing can go wrong any second and it would be THE END but life just went on and now honestly I do not even mind having behcets. It is kind of like having fibromyalgia but with physical symptoms you can rub in peoples faces so the HAVE to take you seriously. Also not as scary as having diabetes or crohns or like a shit tonne of other diseases that hit people in their 20s. I caught covid recently and it was not as bad for me as it was for my husband who is healthy. I cannot help wondering if it was because the extreme immune response from having behcets just just pummelled it into non existence extra quick. Thanks for your advice. I am going to look into everything you said. I caught covid as well and for me I believe it triggered me because I have not felt the same since and then suddenly got this flare up. I am glad you guys are ok! Thank you so so so much I feel a lot calmer now !! Thank you so much! I want to be a mother too. I will pray we both become strong mothers one day.

Saw some great advice on here. Just offering my thoughts and prayers \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a at my worst I thought I was going to end up dying from a stroke before they figured out what was going on with me. I have two toddlers. I remember just crying in the middle of the night from the physical and emotional pain &amp; thinking why would God be so cruel to take their mommy away when they are still so young. I have a very strong faith in God so I was struggling with that. But I learned as every lesson in life has taught me that for me just have to have faith. Not pushing that on you ..just my story. Thinking of you. And I hope it turns around for you like it did for me and to hold on to whatever keeps you happy and going \ud83d\ude42 I believe in god and believe someone or something is watching over us. I am so happy to hear your story because it gives me hope and help me calm down. I hope you have a long life with your family and your babies are so lucky to have you.

Be well \ud83d\ude42", "Hello, I am nearly 2 years into a diagnosis, although it is not yet confirmed I am being told repeatedly that it looks like Beh\u00e7et's Disease and I have some questions; I also suspect my medical use of cannabis has delayed my realization of this disorder. In my teens I was diagnosed with early onset arthritis. Then I was sectioned and diagnosed with C-PTSD (which heightens my chance of Auto-immune disorder by 30ish %). Early twenties added Carpel tunnel. Mid twenties IBS and Arthritis. Late twenties Rheumatoid Arthritis and Rheumatoid Lung disease.   \nThen I started taking Cannabis medically for my Mental health disorder. Oh boy did that provide relief. I hit the ground running and worked like a horse for a few years but ignored symptoms like blood clot looking bruises appearing on my legs and mouth ulcers appearing. Mostly because I had 0 pain from them or the Arthritis because of the Cannabis.   \n\n\nNow I am in my thirties and one day I woke up unable to move. Sometime's I spend hours with stomache cramps so bad I eventually throw up. The Utevitis thing is by far the worst, Light disables me, I can barely open my eyes and they just stream liquid. Sometimes there is blood in the discharge.   \nI mean honestly I am bleeding from so many places it is unreal now.   \n\n\nSo far the NHS has confirmed I do not have cancer but they are just giving me waiting lists to shove cameras into me. I have read loads of research about this disease now. I am seeing lots of statements that Diet can have a massive impact on the flare-ups of the different symptomns and really I am asking for help in some kind of relief. I have a lot of work building up that I have to keep delaying. I have been on a liquid diet for 5 days which has helped but at this stage I am insanely nervous about booking anything up with customers because the day comes and I wake up partially blind.  \n\n\nThanks for Reading, you are a real one or one of my 43 followers that stalk me without response.", "Just following the symptoms Not diagnosed with Behcet, diagnosed with POTS, always told there was either underlying injury or potential auto-immune since I did not grow out of it (30yo F). Current cardiologist thinks maybe POTS misdiagnosis. \n\nI have been having increasing amount of migraine-type headaches over the past 3-4 years. This past weekend I had the worst headache of my life, it lasted 2 days and can only be described as traumatic. As I am recovering, my whole body aches/feels like I have been through a very serious episode(pots makes you worn out/sore sometimes - but no pots symptoms, just the headache). I realized then that I had a sore in my mouth, and as I researched this I came across Behcets. I have had cancer soars on and off, but never thought it could be related to my other symptoms. I also get unexplained rashes, they come and go across my chest/shoulders/back and I had one the day before my headache onset. It did not hurt or itch, and left quickly, I thought I was having a food reaction or heat rash. Now I am wondering if these are common Behcets symptoms? Tonight I have chest pain and extreme joint pain in hips. I have always had joint pain and chest pain - the chest we have assumed related to the cardiac stress from POTS. \n\nJust wondering if any of this sounds familiar to you or if I am chasing symptoms down the wrong avenue. To have a rash, mouth sore, traumatic headache and joint pain all in a 4 day span seemed like some type of episode to me... Behcets or not...thoughts?\n\nI do not believe in being a webmd dr, but from past experience pcp\u2019s can be tough to convince you are not mental when your symptoms are varied. You have to be your own health advocate.\n\nAny feedback helpful. Thank you! I think the problem is lots of things, including nothing, can cause mouth sores but my rheum mentioned to me it is more likely Behcets if you get lots of ulcers at once. During a bad flare I can get 5+ sores in my mouth, tongue and down my throat and I also get them up my nose and on my arms and legs. If you are really concerned Facebook has better communities for Behcets than Reddit! :) hope you get some answers soon Beh\u00e7et's is pretty varied in symptoms, although usually sores are the make or break when it comes down to diagnosis.\nBeh\u00e7et's sores are pretty much constant, the maximum time I have been without one has been 5 or so days. Then in my case joint pain was also together with serious swelling and redness. \nI also had the unfortunate eye involvement, but usually that is more down the line since when Beh\u00e7et's got \"woke up\" (for me it took 5 years).\n\nMight be Beh\u00e7et's, might not be. A good indicator is the HLA-B51 allele test: it can confirm a possible diagnosis but does not rule it out if negative. I have Bechet's and Autonomic Dysfunction both diagnosed and currently being treated. I see both a Rheumatologist and Cardiologist and have not only POTS but other types of dysautonomia. I have learned to differentiate the flares and adjust my medications as needed. So, it is possible to have both but, they are treated differently. I think it is important to have the right medical team. Agreed, the eye involvement is 100x worse than anything else for me.", "Oral Ulcers/Abcesses Entire Life, Seizures, Pink Eye - Does This Sound Like Beh\u00e7et's? 24/F Hi,\n\nStats: 24/F Caucasian never smoked, do not drink \n\nI have had recurring throat issues for as long as I can remember. Over the course of my life I have probably had strep throat about four times and scarlet fever (the rash) twice, despite the myth about only being able to contract the rash once. I have also been diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. I am extremely allergic to dust, dogs, cats, and shellfish.\n\nI got my tonsils removed when I was 17 and recovery was some of the worst pain I have experienced. The doctors said my tonsils were the size of walnuts and the largest they had ever seen.\n\nWhile the number of times I get sick has significantly reduced since the surgery, I still have recurring issues with mouth ulcers. I am dealing with this as we speak, which prompted me to write this.\n\nI get ulcers not only on the inside of my lips and gums, but DEEP in my throat. Currently I have a large pus pocket (it literally looks greenish yellow) deep in my throat at the base of my tongue on the left side. My throat also looks blood red around the pus pocket and my uvula looks erect. Also, this probably does not matter much, but I do not know how great my doctor was who performed my tonsillectomy because she admitted to knicking my uvula and now it is weirdly little and crooked.\n\nIn the past my ENT observed my recurring ulcers super deep down in my throat with a light and tools and prescribed me an oral rinse meant for people with mouth cancer to swallow, but it honestly does not help me much.\n\nEvery doctor always says I must have a \"virus,\" even the ENT that removed my tonsils, but no one can ever tell me WHAT virus, what *kind* of virus, or how I could have contracted such a virus or if it will ever go away.\n\n\nOther things that may be helpful:\n\nI had mono once as a teenager. Perhaps this triggered my Beh\u00e7et's? Also, during this time, my boyfriend that gave me mono cheated on me with a girl who had a \"chronic sore throat.\" She literally carried a bottle of throat spray on her at all times the whole time we were in high school.\n\nI am notorious for contracting pink eye, and have battled with bouts of pink eye and various eye infections since I was a child.\n\nI have had 2 grand mal seizures throughout my life. My seizures began in adolescence and I was diagnosed with parietal lobe epilepsy, which to my understanding is an extremely rare form of epilepsy. \n\nI have not had a grand mal as an adult *knock on wood* because my Keppra largely controls my seizures.

Hi everyone! \n\nI (17F) have had Behcets for about 10 years now (only recently diagnosed, told for several years by doctors that they had no idea what it was) and only recently found this sub a few weeks ago. First of all, thank you all so much for creating such a helpful sub, I have learned so many good tips. Maybe there is a pose on this sub that would answer my question but I have not found it yet so I thought I would ask you all for help. \n\nThroughout my years with this disease, I have never really developed ways to deal with the pain from the mouth ulcers, which are one of my worst symptoms. My ulcers will bleed and then the blood will dry on my lips suddenly overnight, making it impossible to open my mouth and therefore eat or drink. I am not able to drink water as it is too painful, only milk. Tldr, they are very difficult/painful and I never learned ways to help the pain, only to grin and bear it and lay in bed crying trying to not think about it. Do any of you have any tips for reducing pain with severe mouth ulcers? I have tried oral anesthetics from the drug store, ones for babies all the way to extra strength, with them either severely burning or not working. I have also tried drinking milk to coat the ulcers and help the pain, but it does not help. And if someone has a generally quick help that does not require a visit to the doctor for a prescription that would be excellent, as I am having a very bad flare-up right now and would love some relief.\n\nThank you so much!", "Ulcers recurring in same spots? Hello everyone: \n\nI am newly diagnosed with behcets. I got my first attack 6 months ago that began only in my mouth. I woke up one morning with 8-10 huge sores covering the roof of my mouth, tongue, cheeks everything. Since then I have been getting subsequent attacks roughly every 4-10 weeks apart and they seem to be triggered by physical or emotional stressors. My most recent flare happened after I pulled my back working out. I felt fine up until that moment and then after I hurt my back I started getting itchiness all over my body and my mouth started burning and tingling. The ulcers appeared the next day and were the worst they have ever been. I also got a few patches of eczema on my legs and 2 ulcers on my vulva which hurt like hell :( My question is, my ulcers come back in THE SAME EXACT SPOTS in my mouth every time I get a flare. Even when they are healed between attacks, the places in my mouth where they were are very sensitive. Is this typical for behcets? Do other people get the ulcers in the same spots every time or do they move locations? Also, should I expect for this to get worse over time or should the flare ups happen less frequently over time? I am not currently on any meds for it. I use Oracort and magic mouthwash when I get the lesions and hydrocortisone on the rashes which seems to be fine but my doctor is considering oral prednisone to take when I get the flare-ups. You definitely need to be taking oral prednisone as needed. Also ask about colchicine. You might need a DMARD as well. That will be up to your rheumatologist though. There are lots of options out there depending on your tolerance. Hey, thanks for the response! I plan on asking my Rheumatologist about that at the consult. Would you be able to comment on the ulcers recurring in the same locations though? Thanks! Mine are always on the tip of my tongue.  Mine do tend to come back in the same locations. I have had the oral ulcers since I was a toddler, and my early 20s were the worst (and when I was finally diagnosed). Prednisone was my lifesaver, but it is gotten better over time and I have learned more about what can cause flare ups. Mine usually come back in the same spot. Also, they were very linked to my hormones. Every month, like clock work, I would get ulcers in the same spots. Not sure of your gender, but might be worth looking at. Thank you, that is really helpful to know it is not just me. I am a 24 year old female. I started getting my ulcers when I went off birth control pills 6 months ago, and similar to you I noticed that they were happening within days of getting my period. I have since got an IUD and do not really get a period anymore. They have only come back once since the IUD was inserted (when I hurt my back). For my vaginal ones I get prescribed betamethasone. Highly recommend!! Colchicine has helped with my flares. I also have fmf so I am on 1.8mg of that a day. I know for bechets the max recommended is 1.2mg but with fmf you can go up to 2.4mg which is why I was dosed that way. I love prednisone and find a high dose def works for me  ..but my doctor has said it just is not an ideal long term solution because of long term side effects. Just depends on situation of course. Once we got the right medications and dosing I have needed it less..and I guess that was the goal or best I could hope for. My Bechets causes ulcers in my mouth/throat/vagina &amp; erythema nodosum &amp; My fmf causes Inflammation in my lungs/heart/appendix. Both inflame my joints and cause rashes so never know which is causing it lol. Good luck to you \ud83d\ude2c\ud83c\udf40\n\nAlso my flares come like clockwork with my monthly cycle and exercise triggers my raynauds. I was told that is normal. I cannot get rid of it just manage severity :) Yea I get ulcers on the right side of my mouth only. Inside of the right side of my lips and top and bottom of the right side of my tongue. I also get a huge rash only on the right side of my abdomen. Never on the left. Joint pain is all over for me but as far as ulcers I get them in the same damn spot for a week at a time with maybe three or four days between outbreaks Hello there. My diagnosis appear 5 months ago. I begin using corticosteroid called prednol, cholshisim and imuran. Corticosteroid doses begin 98 mg per day now its 8 mg a day and i will stop taking soon maybe in a month. But imuran will be for 2 years and colshsium forever.", "Behcets + Addisons Disease Hello all, hope everyone is feeling well today. I am wondering if anyone here with Behcets has also been diagnosed with Addisons Disease. I have had Behcets for 9 years and have had it mostly under control for the past 3. About 3 months ago I started experiencing new symptoms; headache, nausea, extreme fatigue, constipation, dizziness, increased low blood sugar, etc. I finally typed a few of these into my Google search yesterday &amp; the first thing to pop up... \u201cAddisons disease\u201d. Reading all the symptoms &amp; information about the disease, it makes sense. I have an apt next week with my Rheumatologist to discuss, have blood work &amp; likely get a referral. \n\nI would love some feedback from anyone who got Addisons after getting/having Behcets. Hi, yes. I was diagnosed as a result of a decade of prednisolone. Have you been on steroids as they can cause Addison\u2019s disease. It is very easy to diagnose with a cortisol blood test. I would caution against diagnosing from the internet though as many things cause those symptoms. Good that you are getting a referral. If your cortisol is low (mine was 31. A healthy person is 119-618nmol/L) they can refer you for a synacthen test and get you onto hydrocortisone to manage it daily. You will get an emergency injection and training on how to use it. It take a while to bounce back after having been ill for a while but my life is sooooo much better now, I did not realise how little energy I had! Keep us updated on what happens and feel free to ask any questions. Great news - the doctor confirmed it is not Addisons but extremely low vitamin levels. I was very happy to get those results back. Thank you for your feedback and I wish you well in your journeys. That is great news. It is so easy to find all sorts of awful stuff on the internet when we have been left in the dark with no answers so I am really glad they were able to pinpoint something that can be readily resolved and managed. Now you know what to look for you will be able to get help more quickly should your vitamin levels drop again.", "Potential Behcets Diagnosis Hi Everyone! I have been dealing with a few strange health issues for the last couple of years and have been looking for answers. My rheumatologist is now leaning towards a behcets diagnosis due to recent symptoms. Things started with a very bad case case of erythema nodosum (both legs were completely covered, lasted for 3 months, could hardly walk because my ankles and knees were so swollen).  I began experiencing bad arthritis and severe back pain, horrible headaches and chronic fatigue (this is ongoing, I struggle with these symptoms daily or 2 years now). Around this time I also got Bell\u2019s Palsy that was accompanied by pretty bad eye pain although I cannot remember if I was ever diagnosed with anything specific relating to my eye but the doctors thought the eye pain was unusual with Bell\u2019s palsy. Shortly after recovering from Bells Palsy, I started fainting regularly, experiencing lots of dizzy spells and vertigo episodes in my sleep. I have had a myriad of tests done and did discover (about 2 years ago) that I have a genetic marker for behcets which initially sparked the conversation with my Rheumatologist. At the time I did not have any genital or oral sores so we ruled it out for the time being and just kept monitoring my symptoms. Flash forward to now, I have started getting outbreaks of extremely painful oral sores.  This has happened about 3 times in the past few months and each time there are about 5-8 sores in my mouth that last for about 2 weeks. \n\nMy rheumatologist is pretty certain I have behcets, although it seems to be pretty mild. I have been doing research and trying to learn about the disease. A lot of what I have experienced over the last couple of years seems to line up with a mild case of behcets but I have not found anything that links the fainting/dizzy spells/vertigo with behcets. Has anyone experienced symptoms like this? Or Bell\u2019s palsy and behcets? I have suspected Behcets too and I get dizzy often. Ugh Hi and welcome. I just wanted to point out that it is certainly possible to have Behcet's AND something else - potentially many something elses. Most (but not all) of what you describe does sound like Behcet's, though. I have Behcets and also suffer from vertigo. I was just diagnosed with superior canal dehiscence which showed up on a CT scan of my ears which is likely the root of my issue. Unsure if it is related to behcets or not but I would suppose it may be worth getting your ears checked out. Certainly a possibility, your rheum seems to think so. I would not get too worked up about hla-b51, it increases your risk multiple folds but depending on where you live the incidence is so rare that a multiple fold increase is negligible. The genetic marker is not diagnostic. You want to look at the various diagnostic requirements. Oral ulcers, genital ulcers and eye involvement are the classic triad. Ask your rheum to test for pathergy. EN would definitely count here. Your other symtomps may be relevant but need more investigation. Cranial neuropathies are a clinical manifestation of neuro behcets(bell palsy). I am not sure if they would need an mri that has typical behcet findings to attribute it. Anyways dont jump to conclusions, it is a very rare disease in most areas. Its also good to know in case you have an emergency to let them known possible behcets so they know where to look.", "Research Survey on Behcet's Hi, there, everyone. I checked with the moderators here and they told me that it would be OK if I asked you all about this. My name is Kim and I am the owner and head therapist at Movemental (located in Los Angeles, CA). I am looking for help with some research I am doing to improve the process of identifying, treating and healing autoimmune conditions and conditions that have been diagnosed sometimes, as often the case with IBS, Graves' or others, wrongly as Behcet's or other autoimmune conditions. The goal of this research is to use the findings to educate medical and mental health professionals about the current confusion and frustration that people can experience when navigating our health system. I have created a research survey with the hopes of gathering information on people suffering from Behcet's and showing the need for improvement in how people with Behcet's are treated by those they go to get help from.\n\nThis is not a marketing ploy or an attempt to recruit clients.

I get them pretty bad in my hands making my dexterity incredibly poor. I have been seeing a number of doctors lately to address the slew of issues. I started humira and a beta blocker. The tremors seem to have lessened, but I think it is from Humira and not the beta blocker. Thoughts? Personal anecdotes? I have them. I am on propranolol and it has helped a bunch. I doubt Humira is the one helping! \nMy students point out my tremor. It is embarrassing That is the odd thing, I started propranolol and humira around the same time, but I have stopped the beta blocker a little while ago. I noticed tremors returning, I took my humira shot late because of some cyberattacks on the medical\nSystem where I live. I took the shot yesterday, it was due on Tuesday and I noticed my tremors diminished significantly. It seems so odd to me. That is super interesting! What is the main thing you are taking Humira for?\n\nAlso, are your tremors constant or positional? Do they worsen under certain circumstances?\n\nI am about ready to try a biologic. My stomach is trash. My body hurts 24/7. I am done with this dumb disease. Never tied the two together.. I am really not sure its Behcets in my case, but something to consider for sure.\n\nVery slight, just the last year or so. I thought it was one of my psyc meds... I have intention tremors and have since developed an ongoing tremor in my hands. Propranolol helped with the intention tremor somewhat but once I developed a relatively constant tremor nothing helped. Now we keep very tight control my Behcet\u2019s to prevent worsening of the tremors and other neurological issues I have. I also have to avoid certain medications associated with movement disorders to prevent risking further complications. \n\nI was on Humira for a few years and did well Behcet\u2019s wise. It sadly stopped working for me but many folks are lucky for a long time, or even get remission :) I have them as well I just thought is was from a medicine I was taking but I stopped the medicine about three months ago and I still have them so it must be the Behcets , just one more thing to add to the list of symptoms. I am on Humira for Behcets, which is not FDA approved, so my rheumatologist has been struggling with my insurance company but I finally got approved for Abbvie Assistance  Program. \nThe tremors are constant, thought I only started having them about 2 years ago and the initially were episodic. They have gotten worse over time, and I do notice they get worse with low blood sugar-no duh-or if I do not get great sleep. I did pick up the beta blocker again today. \nWhat is a biologic?", "HLA-B*51 vs IL10? I have had a \"Mystery illness\" for decades now. It is been getting progressively worse to the point that I am almost unable to function anymore. Whatever it is, it is in my brain, my eyes, etc...\n\nI have an appointment coming up in a week where I would planned to try and argue my Opto-neurologist into the idea that I am having chronic shingles/herpes outbreaks neurologically. Because I keep getting these sores... you can see where this is headed right? Well at some point I uploaded my genome to Promethease and got my report and Bechet's showed up. I would never heard of this before but, yea, bingo. I get mouth ulcers, genital ulcers, I tested positive on a TB skin prick test years ago and my doctor was extremely confused. They re-tested me for TB antibodies and it was negative so they dropped it. Then recently I tested positive of a Syphilis FTA-ABS test, which is a crazy accurate test. Well I have read both those tests will flag positive if you have Bahcet's. \n\nMy mouth burns, cold sweats, the insides of my ears hurt, I have double vision, any cut I get turns into a psoriatic lesion for months. Confusion, memory issues, fatigue, anxiety, the works.\n\nBut, on the genetic test the thing that came up was rs1518111(A;A) which is the IL10 gene variant. It does not look like I have the HLA-B*51 gene. Am I correct in believing this means I could have the milder form of the disease? Have you had a PCR DNA swap of your ulcers? IGG/IGM testing for HSV1 &amp; 2? If those are all false, you might consider a western blot to rule out herpes simplex. Yep, been tested for all of that. Update? Curious to see how things went.   \nI am in the middle of getting a confirmation on Behcets as well. The doctors were very dismissive... would not listen. I made a very big pest of myself. At one point I put in a formal request for all of my MRI records (which they are legally obligated to provide) watched a bunch of youtube videos on how to read MRIs... wrote down all of my symptoms and which nerves would have to be involved if the real problem were Behcets attacking my brain. Funny enough, all of my symptoms correlated with a specific point in my brain stem. So I went back to the MRIs, look at that spot and found a lesion they had not mention in my results. So I went back to the doctors, but they were incredulous that the radiologists could have missed something so important. They finally relented and ordered another MRI (I think my 10th? I have lost count) and specifically mentioned what I would found. I got the results back and indeed, I had a lesion in the spot I would found, and the radiologist looked back at my old MRIs and sure enough, it was there to, they had missed it. So now I am diagnosed with neuro-behcets and just started Methotrexate. It is only been a few days but it is working wonders already. They said that this is so rare they asked if I would be comfortable donating my body to science. I have the paperwork on my desk now. I do not think this is actually all that rare... I think they are just incompetent at diagnosing it. All the signs were there and obvious. I was deathly ill, blind in one eye, 24/7 9/10 migraine with no medical training and I was able to find it. Lazy incompetent doctors are the problem. I read all your symptoms and it is like \"Are you me?\" Lol. I have been fairly ill most of my life. As well as in pain my entire life. I did not realize until about a year ago that not everyone aches all of the time.   \nI recently had a horrible bought of uveitis and mouth ulcers. I have had increasingly worse migraines over the past year, one of which lasted 9 days. They put me on all sorts of triptans that did not really help. I have now had a fever since July 14th. I had half my face go numb, forehead and cheeks. Followed by tingling, pain and weakness in my left arm and leg. Along with palpitations. It felt like my body was shutting down. I ended up at emerge twice. When I was 14 I suffered from meningitis that almost killed me and they have no idea how it was contracted. I also self diagnosed. They now have me on colchicine and I am waiting to hear back from a specialist. I would not get overly focussed on a diagnosis. That is probably the hardest part and not all that important. Just try and get the doctor to agree that you have *something* autoimmune. From there the treatments are all about the same. They are all treated with basically the same meds. They are very reluctant to diagnose Behcets because it is exceptionally hard to prove, so if you push that too much they are just going to resist. But it is a lot easier to generally call it \"Autoimmune related\" and treat you. Most of the Behcets folks I have talked to on-line went that route for months, and after months of the meds helping, or not helping and logging symptoms the doctors usually relent and give you the diagnosis. Sometimes it can take years. They are just covering their legal liability. But as long as we are getting our meds, I think I can tolerate it. I am in Canada and it is been pretty good since I have a really good family doctor. They determine last month that I do in fact have an autoimmune disease and told me as such. I was not even thinking that until he told me tbh. I pretty much just thought my heart and kidneys were failing. Lol. I asked which autoimmune disease and they said they didnt know but already sent away the referral for a rheumatologist. Waiting can be up to a year though. They have tried a lot of pain killers and nothing even touches the pain at all. They did prednisone for 5 days and i did not feel relief until day 4. I mentioned Behcets after not seeing them for 2 weeks and he said I tick all the boxes. He said we could do prednisone again but that it pretty much helps with all autoimmune and then makes what you have harder to diagnose. :/ I also said I do not want prednisone a few times. So he said we will try the colchicine. And that it only work for a handful of things. He believes in behcets and said we will know in 4 weeks when the medication is at its top performance. So have they diagnosed you now? Have they given you something for relief? Honestly, I am not sure. Without a blood test its hard to call anything a \"diagnosis\" the radiologist is calling it neuro-Beh\u00e7et's in my chart. My primary care doctor is simply calling it Beh\u00e7et's. My psychologist says it is clearly behcet's, and she wants me on the right meds so she can take me off the riddlin she put me on to combat the fatigue. But the person that matters, the rheumatologist, is still being very cautious. He calls it behcet's in his office, he is treating me for behcet's with behcet's meds, but I do not think he is actually officially said he would diagnose me. But at long as I am on the right treatment plan I am not going to complain.\n\nI do not know how the Canadian medical system works, but here in the US the system is basically a flow chart. If you tick the right boxes, they get you in. So I knew my triggers and basically triggered a flair intentionally right before a doctors appointment so she would see it first hand at its worst. She freaked out, made calls, I got in within a few days. Mine attacks my vagus nerve which makes my heart race so I brought that up a lot. Then when I was in there I intentionally thought of stuff that got me excited to drive my heart rate up so when they took my pulse it was even higher than normal. lol \n\nAt one point a nurse took my blood pressure and it was way high and she said \"oh, that does not seem right, let us retake that\" and I was pissed. Wtf you just retake measurements until you get what you want?!? And I remembered from some YouTube video years ago that clenching your butt drives up your blood pressure so that is what I did. It was so high the 2nd time she almost sent me to the ER. lol\n\nI did not do any of that when I got to the actual rheumatologist, but whatever it took to get there I did. It is a stupid system. Things definitely sound a lot harder in the US. \n\nI also have had the same with my heart. They have had me where a halter monitor for 24 hrs twice this year. And where as my blood pressure usually sits at 115/70 the times I had these attacks and ended up in emerge I was sitting at around 140/90. I have never had blood pressure this high in my life.  \n\n\nIt is actually really weird reading the stuff you wrote because it is identical to what I have experienced. It is freaky but comforting at the same time. Lol. Because I did at one point also have a doctor essentially try to tell me it was all in my head.   \n\n\nI have also been the same as where I do not even care what it is at this point I just want to stop being in 24/7 pain and stop feeling like I am dying. Most recently I have redone my will, made sure all my insurance is in check and I have been going over recovery position and 911 steps with my oldest.   \n\n\nI am also lucky that here in my small town I can get in to see my doctor same day. So when at my worst I was able to see them immediately. I refused the prednisone but nothing else works. I was starting to get suicidal so here is hoping the colchicine does something.   \n\n\nI think I knew about that blood pressure thing, Lol. It is crazy thought because even at the ER what can they do? Pump you full of prednisone? I do not even know. I had not even heard of Behcets until a week ago.  \n\n\nMy main concern right now is being unable to work. I currently work 2 jobs to support my kids and pay my mortgage, I miss so much between the migraines, heart and generally feeling like my body is shutting down. I need a diagnosis to apply for disability when the time comes, if it comes. Because with out a firm diagnosis they wont help you. And it is likely it will take a year.  \n\n\nAlso I just want to add that this is shit. Lol  \n\n\nWhat genetic test did you do? I was most recently looking into ( And then you run it through another data base?  \n\n\nI am sorry if I am talking your ear off and asking to many questions. Lol I did 23andme, then exported the raw data and uploaded it to a service that analyzed it for me.

Hope that things turn around pretty quickly. Please keep us in the loop on this! Hope so too! Any updates on this? I will have my blood rechecked tomorrow:) They say not to get any inflammatory markers checked for two weeks post-vaccine because this has been documented! I will try to find the articles, but my rheumatologist echoed this as well. It should go back down! It definitely did \nHowever, I got it rechecked two days ago and it is back into the 20s Ugh I am so sorry. I had the same experience with mine bouncing around. My doctor thinks it is definitely related to the Covid-vaccine but obviously enough is not known :( hope it goes back down again for you!

So maybe it is not behcet's, but it is something. Up until a few weeks ago they were treating me like I was crazy.", "5 years finally diagnosed Hello to all, I am so happy to have run across this forum. I was recently diagnosed with Bechet's from an awesome Dermatologist who was an absolute God send. For years I had complaints about joint pain, ulcers, abdominal pain, headaches, fatigue and the list goes on. Had doctors that wanted to send me for a mental health evaluation. Told I had herpes many times with negative results, smh. Even to the point my husband began to think my pain was not as bad as I stated because of doctor's assessments and if just could not be that bad.\n\nWithout this provider my world would still be a rollercoaster. Currently, I am taking Colchicine and Prednisone to try and control my mouth and vulva ulcers. Even with these medications I still have new ulcers coming. I am only about 3 weeks in control management treatment however.\n\nLooking to see what meds have helped control ulcers for others.\n\nThank you. I take Imuran. Colchicine helped my inflammation but imuran dropped the hammer on it. My kidneys also did not like colchicine. Word of warning about imuran, it made my hair fall out and me throw up like baby chemo. Those symptoms did stop and my hair is growing back now and I feel a million times better. Congrats on getting diagnosed, Most people think, \"How could you be happy about being told you have a chronic illness?\" But we know the answer. After years of suffering, finally discovering the cause of that suffering can be extremely liberating. \n\nPersonally, I got terrible oral and genital ulcers for just over 10 years in my teens and 20s. Then, they just kind of went away on their own. I have had several major symptoms since then (clots, etc) but no more ulcers. So I do not have any useful advice for what to take. What I can offer is a message of hope. Things will (or at least very well could) get better own their own. That being said, you should absolutely do exactly what you are doing - reaching out and looking for something that might help you NOW. \n\nWelcome to the club. Best of luck to you. Be well!  Did colchicine have you with frequent urination or why did not your kidneys like it? Agreed, that feeling of validation was awesome after all these years. Hate what I have to deal with but invisible illness can wreck havoc on a lot your life. No meds controlled the ulcers at all for you?? I have been dealing with these ulcers for about 3 months non-stop now and I am just over it this point. Nothing like in the past where they would just go away. Thank you so much for your reply. We tried everything available at the time (late 90s/early 2000s): methotrexate, colchicine, various mouthwashes, prednisone, methylprednisolone, dapsone, 3 or 4 different antibiotics, and probably a couple more I cannot recall. Nothing helped, unfortunately. But this was before biologics and some other newer treatments that seem to be very effective for many people. Make sure to check your toothpaste ingredients and find one without sodium lauryl sulphate. It has been shown to irritate mouth mucosa and lead to ulcers. Definite improvement for me when I switched. Yes, one of the first things that was changed. Any medications? Did you make any changes to your diet? I use colchicine during flairs for ulcers. But I do not get many anymore. I have actually started intermittent fasting and have lost 40 lbs. It has been a game changer with my Behcet's. Yes on the frequent urination but mostly because it made me thirsty. No the combo of the colchicine and the ibuprofen just caused kidney function damage. Thank you, I am not taking ibuprofen but frequent urination has definitely been an issue since starting colchicine. I was going to to ride it out and not say anything, just wanting relief more than anything but I guess I may need to. Are they any foods that you eat specifically for inflammation? Are they doing regular blood tests to keep an eye on everything? I have a follow-up this week to see if we need to go to 3 times a day before I do that I will ask for some labs to make sure everything is on track if he does not say it. It is been about 3 weeks since I started them 1 a day for about 1 week then he instructed to go to twice a day. I was going to see if if it would just go away after my body adjusted but reading your reply, I will be saying something.. Getting rid of the pain and burning feeling outweighed everything for me. Yes, eventually. But it had little to do with Behcet's. Actually, the years in which I cleaned up my diet (less carbs/sugar, more protein), I was already in remission. I try to stick to a high-protein, medium-fat, low-carb diet. But I do it for overall health reasons (and vanity, if I am being totally honest lol). I definitely understand. I was on colchicine for 2 years twice a day for pericarditis and I was still struggling so much daily. The peeing thing was so secondary it did not did not register until the primary issue got under control.", "Corona Anyone know of a person with corona and bechets.

Ever since I was 2 weeks old, I had ulcers covering my mouth and they quickly spread to my throat/stomach as I got older. Having these ulcers is an everyday occurrence. I never go a day without pain and was misdiagnosed time and time again. My vision gradually got worse in my adolescence and I cannot depict a single thing without corrective lenses. Once I got covid in feb 2020, the symptoms of the disease became much more aggressive. The arteries of my extremities are now hardening and my feet/lower legs are mostly purple, ice cold, and numb. Running is one of my hobbies but it is almost impossible for me to enjoy now. It also is starting to affect my kidneys (mostly when I flare). I learned this after doing a MRA w contrast and renal ultrasound. Beginning summer 2021, I started waking up to dried blood in/on my mouth and throwing up a moderate amount of blood daily. I have been on prednisone for long periods of time, methotrexate, antivirals, etc- and now I am on Otezla. Besides the awful GI side effects, I think it is decreasing the number of ulcers I get. Lost a lot of weight since starting it. I also keep a strict diet to prevent flares and see my rheumatologist regularly. I try to manage my stress but have a busy schedule due to work and school obligations. \n\n***Actual Question***: Have any of you gotten your wisdom teeth removed while having Behcet\u2019s? Any time I go to the dentist for a routine cleaning, it triggers a flare. I want to avoid this procedure at all costs but my impacted wisdom tooth is creating so much scar tissue/inflammation that I cannot close my mouth without gnawing at my cheek. The area is covered in ulcers ofc. To be honest, I am absolutely terrified of how my body will react after the extraction of 4 teeth, considering the fact any minor cut or accidental bite of the cheek turns into a whole flare. What was the aftercare and healing process like for you? How long did it take to recover? I work overnight shifts and go to college during the day so I need to anticipate how much time I will need. I hate asking for accommodations of any sort and try to privately tough the symptoms out. It is very difficult to explain this disease and the severity of it to anyone since it is so rare. Often times, the reaction is \"but you do not look sick\" or them being grossed out when I show how it manifests. It is the loneliest experience. \n\nThank you for reading and I appreciate all of you! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.", "Has anyone had this experience with a flare? Hi all! Just curious for some input with others experiences: \n\nI have been diagnosed with Behcets for about 3 years now and I have been on remicade nearly 2 (and I was on Humira the first year). I have been doing pretty well overall- uveitis and pericarditis were my two big issues and those are cleared up. I am still dealing with GI inflammation and anemia but that has been going on for years now. I sometimes still get arthritis but it is usually right before my infusion. \n\nAll of this to say- yesterday I was feeling okay. I wobbled and fell down in a parking lot. No big deal, My ankles hurt last night but I was fine. Today I feel like I am in a full-blown flare.

But in the end, it was worth it.  I got diagnosed in Grade Ten I was 16 Years old. I had flare ups earlier in my life but got misdiagnosed, as I lived in a small town when I had my first flare up and they had no idea what it was. Grade Ten was the year I moved back to my home city which is a lot bigger, and I had my second big flare up and ended up in the hospital that year.

Welcome to the group!! I felt the same way when I found this subreddit after my diagnosis last year.\n\nI also suffer from neck and hip pain during flares. It gets pretty bad and I lose sleep over it, and the only remedy I have found to be effective is cannabis. I take CBD oil twice daily (cbdMD has great tinctures), and I also use a topical mentholated CBD cream (Shikai) when I am extra sore. I personally like to apply the cream while stretching or practicing yoga. If you live in the US, both companies should be able to ship to you. I also consume THC as needed for other symptoms including anxiety and GI upset.\n\nOtherwise I am taking azathioprine and colchicine daily and prednisone as needed. Hi :) I have BD too. It is a very unique disease and having a community helps.\n\nI am on daily meds to reduce flares; just started Imuran, colchicine,  aspirin and prednisone. Still struggling with remission and have flares about every 6 weeks.\n One thing that has really helped me is doing daily dry sauna treatments. I found some evidence this helps patients in combo with chemo drugs. Here is the link to the article:\n\n\n\nThis does not work well for all BD patients,  but I have Raynaud's phenomenon and it works for me. I do 140 F for 30-40 minutes every morning (hubby bought me a 3 person home sauna) and do stretching exercises for added citculation and movement therapy. It really helps my hips and back. Will also supplement with CBD as needed. When I am consistent with the heat therapy, I am in less pain overall.\n\nHope this helps.

Apparently Mitigare is (somewhat) covered and also has a copay plan from the pharmaceutical co, but my question is, is Mitigare as good as Colcrys?\n\nI understand they are both colchicine, but Colcrys is FDA approved for FMF and Mitigare is only approved for gout. \n\nPeople that have used both, did you notice any difference? I am especially curious about side effects.", "Covid Vaccine I just got my first shot of the Moderna Covid vaccine yesterday and wanted to make a quick post for anyone who had the same fears going into it.  Going in to the vaccine, I had 2 oral ulcers but no flair or anything else going on. The shot was completely painless. I did not even know she gave me the shot and sat there like a fool til the nurse told me to go. I had no other side effects the rest of the day. This morning, I felt like I got hit by a bus. I have crazy muscle pain all over, bad headache and injection site swelling. Despite the side effects, I am still glad I chose to get the vaccine. I am a little worried about shot #2 as that is the one that generally makes people sicker than the first. I get shot #2 the end of January and I will report back. Thank you so much for sharing. Hope you feel better soon and I will be looking out for your update.\n\nDid you get special OK from your doctor/rheumatologist to go ahead with the vaccine? \n\nAnd are you on immunosuppressants? If you dont mind me asking... I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine about a week ago and aside from arm pain I had almost no side effects, but I am a bit worried about the second dose as well. Thanks for the update! Yeah, I got the okay. I have been off immune suppressants for about 5 years and very rarely will use a prednisone taper if anything pops up. I have been pretty lucky that I have not had a serious flair in years. I usually only get a few oral ulcers here and there nowadays.\n\nIt is now been over 24 hrs since I got the shot and the muscle pain I was experiencing has gone down a lot. No headache. Just a little achy and tired and a sore arm. Fingers crossed for an easy second dose! Thank you for posting this. I am on immune suppressants and need to find out if I can get the vaccine from my rheumatologist. Thank you for sharing! And yes, please report back after getting the second shot. Thank you so much for sharing! What meds are you on? Right now I am actually on nothing. At one point I was on colchine, plaquenil and immuran all together. I have been lucky enough the past few years to ween off all of them. Following Thanks so much for sharing. This helps give me a sense what to expect, although I realize everyone is different &amp; all reactions will be different. I am scheduled to get the vaccine on Thursday. \n\nHaving a mild neuro-Behcet\u2019s flare out of nowhere today after being in remission for the past year, so I will postpone if I am still flaring by tomorrow eve. Waiting for your post. I had my second dose on Tuesday and did experience more body aches and flulike symptoms than I did with the first dose, but nothing too serious. Hope yours goes well! Oh my, sorry to hear that but at least it is not too bad. I get #2 on the 26 (I think) I will let you all know how it goes. Hah! I did not realize I had replied to you in both threads. Hope it goes well.", "How uveitis feels like? I recently Felt a loss of vision in my right eye that comes and goes along with driness in Both eyes. \nI m Also wearing weekly contact lenses with lower diopters because i was in a hurry when i ordered them and i ordered -3 \u00eendreapt\u0103 of -3.5.  Maybe are the lenses that are causing me this blurry vision or not. Anterior uveitis was pretty painful in my experience - almost like I got hit in the eye. My eye was red and my vision was pretty blurry. Posterior uveitis was not painful but I was missing big chunks of my vision so it was still pretty noticeable. \n\nSounds like you might just be experiencing having strained eyes. My eye involvement was a totally painless edema of the optic nerve. This gave me a scotoma which rendered me temporarily blind in one eye. Cured with Prednisone and now it is slowly getting better, got to about -6 since July.\n\nOne day I was fine, the next I woke up blind. Did not feel anything. That eventually led to my diagnosis. I have got anterior uveitis at the moment. The first night I noticed something odd I was watching TV and stopped being able to look directly at the telly as it was sending a searing pain back through my eye into my head. The next morning it was still happening and I noticed my eye was very red and painful and extremely light sensitive. Every time there was a change in the light I would get the same searing pain. It took a few days to diagnose, my optician could not find anything wrong but referred me to a specialist  who said definitely anterior uveitis. I did not think it was affecting my vision overall until doing a sight test with the optician and its actually considerably worse/more blurry. Am now keeping my eye almost permanently dilated and dropping in steroids every couple of hours... sincerely hope you do not have it as would not wish this on anybody! You can see , but it is very blurry like you know it is a person but you cannot see their face or read signs , sometimes if it gets bad you might see the faces squeezed like a snap filter . Very weird experience Before I get diagnosed with Behcets, I had a sharp stabbing pain in my left eye and my eye was bright red. At first I thought it was just a dry eye due to lack of sleep, too much electronics, etc. but I was lucky it was gone in two days. The second flare was not that easy, I had eye pain, headache and blurry vision so I went to ophthalmologist and he suggested that I should see a rheumatologist. That is how my Behcets story started :) unfortunately to get rid of uveitis I started cortisone and Humira. It helped with the uveitis but now I have a tiny cataract in my left eye. After 3 years I only use imuran and I feel fine :)", "Fatigue &amp; Brain Fog Hi you all. Happy to find this group. I am 55 and was diagnosed about 6 months ago after years of weird symptoms. I take Otezla now. It is helping. Flare ups seem milder. \n\nThe worst part is the fatigue and brain fog. People do not get it. When it washes over me, I am overcome with pain like I am getting the flu. \n\nI have taken Adderall for ADHD and it seems to help with fatigue and Brian fog. Does anyone else take adderall? I suppose you have read medical research on Adderall.  If not, I recommend starting there.  I took it for years as an adult.  \u201cIt is relatively safe\u201d I was told.  It is completely a nightmare drug that causes pathological dysfunction of the brain.  Of course it helps with \u2018tiredness\u2019 in the immediate sense\u2014 it is an amphetamine.  For me, if I could I would go back and choose to have never touched it. Thank you! I am similar in my approach to meds. Spot on. My experience with adderall/ritalin is that it is borrowed energy - taking it would get me back to normal for a day or two, but I would pay the price with a minor flare later that week. \n\nThe reasoning behind this is that ritalin/adderall both increase oxidative stress (ROS generation) - which is one of the major disease pathways in Behcet's. Both substances have also been linked to a worsening of symptoms in those with autoimmune vasculitis in the long run, which makes sense from a mechanism perspective. ( ( ( That being said - there are BD patients who do take low-dose amphetamines to combat fatigue successfully - it is probably related to disease severity and treatment profile, but there are not studies on this topic for BD. \n\nInterestingly, I have been taking Modafinil for ~2 months - it is been helping SO MUCH once I found the right dosage. I take 100mg first thing in the morning during weekdays and it makes me feel very close to my pre-illness self. It is not \"speedy\" like ritalin/adderall - rather it just removes the fatigue/brainfog. There is also quite a bit of research that modafinil can reduce autoimmune-induced neuroinflammation - ( ( ( ( The American Behcet's Disease Association (ABDA) also recommends it for chronic fatigue in BD. ( I have been on 20mg adderall since June. I have had a Behcet's flare-up since August... Never thought they could be related? Now I am curious with these other comments.", "Finally I got an appointment with Johns Hopkins After about a year and a half of monthly rheumatology appointments with my local rheumatologist and his conclusion that I have behcets. I finally got an appointment with Johns Hopkins. So happy. Cannot wait untill July when I get to see them and maybe get a definitive answer as to my condition. Congratulations,  and good luck! How did that diagnose it as behcet? I know this is late but I just found this group - I go to Hopkins too! I found them last year after seeing a lot of awful private practice Rheum\u2019s. I love my doc and I am so happy I found them! How did it go for you? I am supposed to go on the ninth but I am going to have to reschedule As I am currently out of the country for work. Who are you going to see (if you do not mind me asking)? Also, make sure you cancel with enough notice because I think they have a 3 strike rule where they \u201cfire you\u201d as a patient Eric Gapud \nHopefully they will understand that I am on a mission with the airforce and I do not have control of that. That is my guy!!! I LOVE him. Good luck to you! Nice I will update after the appointment", "Otezla Update Hey there!\n\nI just took my PM pill. I have been taking Otezla for ten days now.\nI have not gotten any new sores since beginning treatment, and all but two have healed.\nMy side effects have been very manageable. The GI issues are mild. With Otezla and Advil I am feeling pretty great!\nI am weary, only because the idea of no longer living every single day with multiple mouth ulcers just seems too good to be true. Unfathomable.\nI would love to be able to get braces now and have a smile I am not embarrassed of or in pain with. Fingers crossed!\n\nJust a reminder, Otezla has an incredible patient assistance program. I get my medication for free and delivered to my door. Major thanks to the Redditor who pointed me the site. Hi! I am very new to my Beh\u00e7ets diagnosis but have been taking Otezla for 2+ months for psoriatic arthritis. Strangely enough, I was diagnosed with Beh\u00e7ets after starting Otezla. My mouth sores exploded about 3 weeks into taking it and are finally gone, but I wanted to leave this comment in case anyone else reads and it discouraged with Otezla. I noticed a huge spike in my psoriasis and PsA around this time as well so I am almost wondering if my immune system was giving one last fight before the meds started taking over. Anyway, since then, my mouth sores and Beh\u00e7ets rash have cleared and my joint pain and energy levels have improved beyond my expectations. This truly is a wonder drug so far. Thank you for this comment! I have high hopes for this medication. I have two sores at the moment but they are small, and I am still in my first month of taking Otezla.", "Ahcc supplements in undiagnosed behcet\u2019s ? I had my first symptoms that are pointing to behcet\u2019s back in june, genital ulcer, joint pain. Normal blood test. Now i m symptom free and i feel very good. \nI m taking ahcc for curing hpv for 2 weeks. Do you think this can over stimulate my imune system and empower this posibile disease? If you have HPV then that is probably where the genital ulcer came from. \nAs far as AHCC goes, I do not know about it myself, but from the quick search I did it is an integrative medicine, so you should be fine.\n\nWas the joint pain also with swelling? Did you have frequent mouth ulcers in the last 2 years or so? How frequent is the joint pain and have you ever had eye problems or inflammation of other soft tissues? (genitals, gum, tonsils etc...). There is no blood test for behcets, so I am not sure what you mean by normal blood test? Do you have mouth ulcers regularly? Had any genital ulcers before? It sounds like you might just have had some bad side effect from your medication or its just an ulcer from the HPV. I know there is no tests for behcet\u2019s, But there are certain blood tests that can point towards other autoimmune diseases. My first and last genital ulcer was back in june along with joint pain that lasted until september. I m taking ahcc since two weeks ago. I had no medication back in june. And hpv is causing ano genital warts, not ulcers. Genital herpes is causing some lesions that can Look like behcet\u2019s ulcers. I m negative for herpes . I know that hpv is causing warts not ulcers, a gyno checked me up back in june when the ulcer appered and told me that lesion was not caused by hpv.\nI was feeling daily joint pain in the summer, then just once in a while. I had mouth ulcers in the past 2 years, But i wasnt concerned about them. I researched AHCC years ago, also for HPV. As you mentioned in the comments, genital warts and Behcet's ulcers are easy to distinguish from one another. So it is good that you understand the difference. \n\nThere is quite a bit of research to suggest AHCC can treat HPV. Unfortunately, the effect it has on people with autoimmune diseases like Behcet's has not been studied. So there is no way to know for sure if it will aggravate your condition. \n\nHowever, based on my research and experience, I think you should be alright. In fact, it is possible the AHCC may actually improve your condition. \n\nI am a big fan of \"alternative\" medicine and have experimented with a number of plants, supplements, and other substances for a variety of reasons. After trying a few other things (like ACV, tea tree oil, etc), I decided to try AHCC. It is high price tag made me want to try other things first. I took it for months, got rid of my HPV, and did not aggravate my immune system at all. If anything, I felt better in the months following the treatment. \n\nInitially, I had the same concern as you, that it might aggravate the Behcet's. I even went so far as to email the leading AHCC-HPV researcher. She told me what I told you: there is no way to know for sure what effect it will have. But I ultimately decided that the risk was small and it was worth trying - and it was.\n\nI hope that helps. Be well!", "My S/O and Behcets My sweet love. He is 26 years of age. Male. Vibrant and loving. Believer of the Lord since he laid on his death bed a few years back. He is treated with Remicade every 8 weeks, (bimonthly). But starts flaring up with mouth ulcers, genital sores, and painful blisters all over his entire body, at 6 weeks. So for two weeks, he is fatigued, weak, and in pain. We got a call that he was denied by insurance for his treatment. We are supposed to wait two weeks before we hear anything. But we cannot wait. We have made phone calls, hopefully we hear something Monday. He is distraught, in so much pain, and running low on hope. His body is eating itself and the sores are spreading like crazy. Remicade is so expensive. I am trying to find any information for a homeopathic treatment. His doctor send in prednisone and another treatment. Nothing works but Remicade. Remicade is over $2,000 per treatment. Why? Why is this? He is suffering. I do not know what to do.  I found this community on here. Praying for everyone else that endured this horrible disease. I am doing well on low dose naltrexone:  I had a similar problem with Remicade - it wore off after six weeks. My rheumatologist changed my infusion schedule to be every six weeks instead of every eight weeks. That works like a charm - I do not get breakthrough flares between infusions any longer. \n\nAlso - if your insurance is playing games with Remicade, then check out Humira. They are basically the same - both monoclonal antibodies against TNF-Alpha - the major difference is Remicade is half-mouse/half-human while Humira is a fully human antibody. Plus Humira can be injected at home. The general guidance is to try Remicade first, then switch over if you develop anti-drug antibodies, but some rheumatologists prefer prescribing one over the other. \n\nThe providers of both Remicade and Humira offer assistance programs that make it affordable for individuals - I believe you can call them up. \n\n\n\n Our health care system is tragic.\nI am so, so sorry. Check out enbrel too!! Not as similar, but still highly effective in Behcets. Thank you so kindly!! We will absolutely discuss this with the doc. I cannot thank you enough for the information. I am curious if you do not mind me asking, what are your flare ups like? My s/o gets blistered scabs everywhere, and they take about 2 weeks to heal. Lots of red patches on the face. He has that every morning though. He gets them in his mouth and feels them in his chest. Have you tried humira? How long have you been diagnosed/how long did it take for them to get the proper diagnosis? Thank you so much!! I am happy you are doing well!! Take care! He finally got his treatment. Thank you dearly for the support. Absolutely!! I wrote about my experience with Behcet's on the subreddit last year - ( Those skin symptoms seem terrible - mine were mouth ulcers, acne-like lesions on my body, and granuloma annulare on my hands. I can relate to the fatigue, pain, and all that mess too - it is bad!\n\nI had the disease for 2.5yrs before being diagnosed and treated (age 26-28) - it was a nightmare getting a rheum to take me seriously. I have never been on Humira, but it is largely the same drug, so it should work about the same. Oh I am so glad! I wish him the best!", "Please help. Ulcers/symptoms? Hello all! This is my first post here and I would really appreciate some clarity. I have only just became aware of Behcets and wanted to ask a few questions because most (if not all) of my symptoms match up looking back on the past several months. These vulval ulcers - do these have a habit of reappearing and disappearing so quickly?? I have been driving myself MAD in the herpes forum after having received many negative IGg blood tests until 17 weeks and weird symptoms that do not seen to match with herpes? It is currently my cycle and I had some burning pain when I urinated, so I looked inside and took a photo to see a white sort of ulcer on my vagina canal? This is not a one-off as I have had what looks like skin peeled off on my anus that will heal in a day (if not a few hours sometimes!). I have been told that herpes does not follow this pattern and it has its own forming and healing stage which these sores just do not do? They appear then disappear? I would appreciate any insight. Thank you again!  I cannot figure this out on my phone from my nursing text books, do not think I can attach photo. \n\nI have behcets but was diagnosed after 3+ months of mouth ulcers. Check out lichens disease as well for a differential diagnosis that effects skin tissue of vulva. I hope you find healing. Thank you kindly! I had bloods and swab done for HSV1&amp;2 and all came back negative, so will look into these other sores to see if they look similar. Wishing you well :) My ulcers do not disappear quickly unless upping my dose of prednisone.. they do however come on extremely quickly and worsen quickly \n\nThat is not to say what is happening to you isnt it because we are all different! Sorry this is late but as someone mentioned earlier, lichen planus is important to rule out! See a dermatologist if possible, as LP is more likely if you are not experiencing many systemic symptoms. Genital ulcers are rarely a presenting factor in Bechet\u2019s disease. I have lichen sclerosis as well as this sounds like that more than BD ulcers. Triamcinalone can be used for both I believe. That is been helpful for me,but a gyno or dermatologist would be able to help you diagnose/treat this.", "Behcet\u2019s and Pregnancy ", "17F, just diagnosed with behcets Looking through this sub, I feel really grateful that my doctor was so knowledgeable and knew what to look for. First time I mentioned mouth ulcers at a casual check-up, she swabbed them for testing and they came back ANA+. She then referred me to a rheumatologist but at that point I did not have any other major symptoms yet so they did not have a clear diagnosis for me.\n\nFast forward a few months and in June, I suddenly get skin issues and ulcers in less favorable parts that get big. I go to another check-up for the ulcer on my lower vulva, doctor immedietely lets me know to get back in contact with my rheumatologist and that it likely behcets. I go and have another appointment, they confirm that these and some other symptoms all lead to a high likelihood of behcets and I have been prescribed medication that will hopefully aid symptoms.\n\nI feel lucky my doctors knew what to look for, and that I did not have to go through a decade of pleading for my case to be heard like a lot of you- In fact, my doctor was the one to inform me I did not have herpes when I thought I did. I thought since I was a kid I had herpes because everyone said that is why you get mouth ulcers, and I heard you could get that from sharing drinks (as I have never kissed anyone/been sexually active before). 18F here, congrats on the diagnosis! it gets better from here, i promise. Welcome to the club! Early diagnosis will make all the difference. Took them just over 10 years to get mine. It will be Ok. Thank you for the support :) Let us hope the steroids clear everything up! Yes, I am very fortunate to have an early diagnosis, and I hope it means that flare-ups will be much better in the future! Thank you for your kinds words :)", "Help with pain Hi, I am currently in the process of diagnostical procedures for auto immune and auto inflammatory disease. \n\nSo far everything including ANA profile has turned up negative for me. I had an ESR of 32 which reduced when I started taking SSRIs before my consultation with rheumatologist. I seem to be exhibiting all the physical symptoms for Behcets including mouth ulcers, genital ulcers, folliculitis etc among the few which all seems to be someway or the other linked with my psychiatric condition. I am still awaiting HLA B51 result. I consulted the Rheumatologist day before yesterday and he started me on plaquenil, sulfasalazine and naproxen. My sciatic pain and body fatigue has reduced drastically. I only get the pain in the start of the day and it gradually reduces.  But suddenly there seems to be an persistent pain in my upper left back at a certain point. It is like constantly there even when all other symptoms has reduced. Today I had a close call with panic attack during MRI which seemed to have aggravated the pain more. I tried heat pack which worked for few minutes, laying on my left side which worked for few minutes as well then my sister applied pressure on the point which really helped to reduce and almost completely stop the pain. But I started feel a heat cold sensation in my left arm and my chest started to feel tight. After sometime the pain returned and I took plaquenil as last resort. The pain persisted until I fell into nap. I remember waking up in between sleep and not feeling any pain even when I was laying on my back side. Now as I woke up fully, the pain has returned and a tight chest feeling. My MRI results for lumbar scan came, in which I seem to have a 'diffuse annular bulge at L4 / L5 causing minimal thecal sac compression'. Everything else is notmal. I am not sure what is happening. Is it my psychiatric condition? Does anybody else have any tips to reduce the pain? Hi there,\n\nI sympathise with your situation as a Behcet's sufferer and hope that you continue to get support from your medical practitioners.\n\nThere are a few things you could consider to try to alleviate some of the issues you are experiencing.\n\nFirst is selective mineral supplementation, which is far more important and potent than people realise (mostly due to the poor efficacy of multivitamin tablets).\n\nI highly recommend:\n\n**Magnesium glycinate**, **citrate**, or **threonate** (avoid oxide, as it is poorly absorbed and basically useless). Studies show that magnesium deficiency affects up to 80% of adults in the Western world due to poor soil health in growing our crops. Studies also show that Magnesium is a vital component in nerve signaling, muscle contractions, heart function, intestinal and brain function. I can say from a personal point of view that Magnesium glycinate has completely alleviated 90% of my ectopic heartbeats, alleviated some chest inflammation and stomach pain. It also helps me sleep and significantly reduces anxiety. Out of the plethora of drugs I have taken, Magnesium glycinate genuinely made an impact on my life.\n\n( \\- Magnesium and Inflammation\n\n( \\- Magnesium and Anxiety/Stress\n\n( \\- Magnesium and Cardiac health\n\n( \\- Magnesium and Sleep\n\nNext up is **Colchicine**\n\n**Colchicine** is drug made from an ancient plant called Colchidae. It is one of the oldest medications in existence (used by the Romans for gout). Many people who have Behcet's take Colchicine and it is a fantastic anti-inflammatory drug. It works to reduce inflammation similar to an NSAID but in my opinion is more effective for Behcet's sufferers. It is also great at reducing chest pain caused by inflammation.\n\n( \\- Colchicine as an anti-inflammatory\n\n( \\- General overview of Colchicine\n\nNext up is **Lysine**.\n\nA well-known amino acid for dealing with cold-sores, it also helps some Behcet's sufferers with their ulcers due to the inhibition of Arginine (which plays a role in our ulcers and inflammation).\n\n( \\- Lysine and herpes (herpes expression is similar to Behcet's ulcers).\n\n( \\- General overview of Lysine (which is cited)\n\nAfter that I would recommend **Vitamin D** (1000+IU), **B6** and **B12** for general supplementation for a Behcet's sufferer. Having an inflammatory disease takes its toll on our bodies, and we deplete vitamins/minerals faster than healthy adults.\n\nHere is a good guide to pro-inflammatory foods and how to avoid them, as well as how to reduce inflammation through lifestyle changes:\n\n( \\- **IL-6** is one of the main markers in Behcet's disease inflammation.\n\nAs for medication, your doctor will best ascertain which to put you on based on your medical records. But I hope something listed here can be of help! I agree with everything /u/FluorideFirst said. I take magnesium glycinate and vitamin D daily. Colchicine I have been on in the past. But none of that is going to help your pain in the short term. \n\nPersonally, for years I have been using two plants to alleviate my pain: cannabis and kratom. They work better than the opioids I was prescribed for a decade. \n\nI am not saying what you should or should not do. And I know there are legality issues with those substances in some places. But they are worth considering if you are looking for effective, natural pain relief. They have worked wonders for me. I support your balanced wording on cannabis and kratom. I think it is an individual choice at this point, as there simply is not enough research on kratom.\n\nOn CBD there are obvious signs that this could be useful. As for dosage, method and type that remains to be seen. I have not tried it (yet) but I am sure one day I probably will. Unfortunately, I do not get anything out of CBD alone and I have experimented with lots of dosages. However, I know people who find it immensely helpful. Given it is safety and availability, it is worth trying. \n\nI really try to discuss kratom and cannabis as balanced as possible. A lot of people talk about them like they are miracle cures, but they are not. Neither are without potential side effects. However, I understand why people feel that way. When you are in pain for a long time and something as seemingly benign as a plant takes that pain away, it feels nothing short of miraculous. For me personally, kratom and cannabis have both been absolute game changers. But they are certainly not for everyone. Still, whenever someone asks about pain relief (or one of the many other Behcet's-related symptoms kratom and cannabis help me with), I like to throw them out there to at least be considered.", "Mouth ulcers are killing me Anyone else want to jump off a cliff because of how bad the mouth ulcers hurt? \nI am practically (&amp; sometimes actually) crying for the last 2 days. Do not know what triggered this flare but it is ruining me. New to this diagnosis, it is been about a year. I did not test positive for the gene but I have the ulcers &amp; eye irritation. \nI am taking 20mg methotrexate for about 9 weeks now &amp; everything was fine with the exception of 1 or 2 small sores. Now all of the sudden there is like 12 &amp; they are big &amp; so painful. Using the \u201cmagic mouthwash\u201d but that relief last for like 8 minutes. \nWhat does everyone else do when you are stuck in this misery? There is a product I get on Amazon called HurriCaine Topical Anesthetic Gel. It helps to numb things. Hope you feel better! Thanks! I will look into it. What I am using is a lidocaine, antacid mouthwash mix. It is by prescription so I imagine it is pretty potent. It works, but like I said, not for longer than 8 minutes. \ud83d\ude15 Ask your doctor for a corticosteroid oral gel. It covers your ulcers and I can say as someone who has huge dime sized ulcers and flare ups that it reduces from weeks to just days. Usually 2 days and I am feeling better. Okay! Like clobetasol? What is your oral gel? Ive tried gels that somewhat adhere to your ulcer but when I have like 10 at once, it is useless. It leaves white strings in your mouth &amp; really does not seem to help at all. I have tried practically everything &amp; I still just suffer through it for like 2 weeks, sometimes more. I would practically rather be sedated than to deal with the constant slicing &amp; stinging pain. \n It is Triamcinolone Acetonide Dental Paste USP 0.1% - it is generic so pretty cheap. Comes in a tube. This stuff works really good, it will not stop the pain (it is not really a 'coating guard') but will heal much faster as the steroid will knock down the inflammatory response and start the healing process. Thank you! I will be calling my DR first thing Monday to ask for this. \ud83d\ude00 Xylocaine spray from the pharmacy but hurts when you apply it otherwise Cocaine for instant relief for like 15 minutes, but not a obv not a viable option. Tried pretty much everything one the market hope that helps. I remember when i first started taking the azothioprine i got a really bad flare after a few weeks. I think it might just be the body reacting to a new treatment and it should pass. Though I am not sure since there is such a large delay in your case. You should probably ask your doctor. colchicine worked instantly for me and a friend. just take about 2-3 pills every day and you could be clean. and ask your doctor ofc. you could also look at Prednisone for a temporary fix. Is your doctor familiar with behcets? Call your doctor and try to get a course of prednisone! High-dose steroids are the only thing that shake me out of a flare. I used a liquid lidocaine, it was clear and thick.  I liked it much better than magic mouthwash because it lasted a bit longer, but also bc I was able to reapply like constantly.  (Maybe I am not supposed too?). Anyway it lived on my body and I used it often.   This too!  It did work for me, even know I just kept getting them, it helped clear them out much faster. Thanks! I will ask. In the past I have tried 60 mg prednisone for two weeks &amp; it did not do a damn thing \ud83d\ude44\nAlso had an infusion (250mg) once &amp; it helped like the very next day but the next time I tried it, nothing.  I took the colchicine (colcrys) for about a month to no avail. I failed dapsone to as that made me really ill &amp; my skin &amp; lips turned blue! Then I was on azothyaprine for about 6 weeks then all of the sudden I would throw up after every dose. I have been on methotrexate for about 8 weeks now &amp; I thought it was helping but then this happens!\nThank you for your advise, I might have to just wait it out \ud83d\ude29 Thank you! I will ask about this too \ud83d\udc4d wow! i just started taking azothyaprine for about 1 month and have been feeling very nauseous lately and very tired, did this happen to you to?. My mom took methotrexate a while ago and it wasnt any good, she switched to Humira (via injection) and she has been feeling great since. Yes, I have only thrown up 5 times in my whole life (I am 31). I have a tough stomach I guess &amp; I do not get nauseous really ever. At first I thought I ate too much pasta &amp; was just feeling really ill. Then the next 4 days I threw up about 40 min following the azothyaprine. I felt awful for like 4 hours afterwards. The one day I skipped it because I forgot it at home when I went out of town. I felt just fine that whole day then the next day I took it &amp; threw up again. So I stopped. \nI used to take Humira about 7 years ago for psoriasis but stopped clearing my skin after about 2 years so I switched to a different biologic. \nI see my dr today &amp; I will ask about something else since this methotrexate is not working &amp; it is just making my hair loss worse \ud83d\ude15 I feel your pain. It is incredible how much the mouth ulcers hurt and how exhausting it is to hurt everyday. \n\nI take colchicine everyday and now I gave fewer and smaller mouth ulcers but I still get them and they hurt like a bitch. When I get a really bad flare up, I take a Zpak and prednisone and that stops them from growing, spreading and they start healing. \nI use orajel but it only helps for a limited period of time. Hello, my friend has Behcet's disease and has suffered for many years. He has been free of flare-ups for about a year or more now. He has been taking a daily supplement of White Maeng-Da Kratom. If he misses a dose or goes without for a few days, the ulcers come back quite quickly. It is relatively cheap. Buying it powdered is cheaper than in capsules, and you can make tea out of it. If you decide to get some be sure to get it from a trusted source. The only strain that has reliably helped him is White Maeng-Da.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps. I noticed that my ulcers get worse especially when I eat processed food, salt, sugar or fat (do not know how to call it, it includes butter, oil, etc). I also avoid cheese, eggs, meat and alcohol (beer seems to be the worst to me). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNB: I was not diagnosed with the Behcet disease, but my doctor mentioned it and I had multiple symptoms since then. \n\nWhen the pain is too intense, I have some anaesthetic cream called Dynexan which really helps for maybe 30mn / 1 hour. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck with these, I hope you find a solution since your post ! How much does he take at a time?\n\nI have tried it. .but the sheer quantity I was recommended to take was just absurd. Like, 16-20 00 caps worth. My ENT gave me an Rx for Tetracaine lollys. They are super effective, one dumdum sized lolly lasts for 2 or 3 days. He took 2-4 capsules at 500mg apiece. Although I should mention he quit a while after my post, said the Kratom sapped his energy in a depressive kind of way. Prefers to control his flare-ups with diet and lifestyle work as best he can. Minimal dairy (besides eggs) cheese and butter are ok in small amounts, but no milk, no fruit ever (besides bananas). Plenty of protein. Lots of vegetables and whole grains, fish is great and makes him feel great he says. Lots of turmeric. Water and coffee for beverages. Regular exercise (resistance training not cardio, cardio simply hurts his joints) and plenty of sleep (although it is never \"enough\") and staying hydrated.\n\nI am sure you have heard most of this before. His flare-ups were worst when he was eating like shit and drinking all the time and generally living poorly. He gets them occasionally now, but they are not nearly as severe or long-lasting as they used to be. His diet and lifestyle have really improved a lot. Thank you so much for the reply, you never know with these old threads.", "A quick thank you to this awesome community  I just wanted to say that I have listened to your podcast, all the episodes all the way through, twice, and it really helped me through a terrible hospital worthy flare. I cannot wait to get your book! You are truly an inspiration! Thank you from the bottom of my heart. That really means the world to me. I have been overwhelmed by all the kind words about the podcast and especially the book, but they never loose their meaning. If anything I have done has helped you through a flare, that is really the highest compliment I can get. So thank you again for the kind words. I hope you like the book!", "I think Behcet\u2019s may explain a whole bunch of my misery. I am 39f, anglo-Irish heritage living in Australia. \n\nI am enduring a reoccurrence of a major ulcer on the back edge of my tongue which is extremely painful and causing swelling down my throat, impacting my speech and swallowing. \n\nI only just got over a painful ulcer on the tip of my tongue. I am getting these about every 3 months or so. They start as tender nodule deep in the tongue then seem to move a little to the surface of the mucosa and form an AGOnisingly painful ulcer. \n\nDespite a background in nursing I spent yesterday with Dr. Google trying to work out how to avoid these and started reading about Behcet\u2019s. \n\nI hate the trap of self diagnosis but there are a number of recurrent symptoms that have me thinking I may have this: \n\nRecurrent mouth ulcers\n\nRecurrent eye problems over last few years \n- dryness\n- x2 episodes of sclerosis\n- swelling of eyelids with easily burst blood vessels around eyes if I cry of vomit\n- floaters\n- ocular migraine (aura only occasionaly progressing to headache)\n\nSkin problems\n- facial \u2018acne\u2019, some normal pimple type things but many years struggling with painful lumps that seem like a cystic acne but tend to turn into a crater when healing rather than ever have pus filled core or anything. These \u2018zits\u2019 are super painful. \n\nCervix\n(History of cervical dysplasia CIN III treated with LLEETZ and cone biopsy 17ish years ago. No abnormal Pap smears since then HOWEVER... \n- 5 years ago I had a Pap smear and GP told me my cervix looked \u2018ulcerated\u2019. She referred my to a gynaecologist who looked and said nothing was wrong and that cervix can look ulcerated with scarring the treatments I had had years ago. In isolation from other symptoms, this seamed like a fair explanation at the time. The gynae exam was about 3 months after GP described ulcers. \n\nAchey joints that seem to flare and resolve. \n\nExtensive family history of autoimmune disease.\nMultiple relatives with relapsing/remitting MS, psoriatic arthritis. \n\nI have had several episodes of neuralgic pain and parasthesia which seems to flare, had MRI and neuro consults to rule out MS and transverse myelitis, all were clear.\n\nOther history, \nDiagnosed with bipolar, was on lithium for 5 years but currently unmedicated for this. Diagnosis is under review. Probably more PTSD and anxiety/depression - who known. Mostly psychiatric symptoms are under control but with high stress I get some weird inflammatatory flare with skin break outs, eye swelling/soreness and lately mouth ulcers + sinus pain on one side and face feels \u2018puffy\u2019 with fatigue, lasts about a week and a half then settles.\n\nAlso have\n allergies: dust pollen etc \nHypothyroidism with + autoantibodies. \n\n.......\n\nI think I need to speak with rheumatologist! Oh and interestingly, earlier this year I had burst all the blood vessels around my eye crying and my eyelids were swollen and puffy for a week or so, but I developed ?psoriasis or eczema on my eyelids. Just would not heal. GP gave me a short course of prednisone which helped the eyelids but I remember at the time thinking how great it had been in healing to \u2018acne\u2019 flare I had at the time. \n\nI am suspicious the spots I have been treating as acne maybe autoimmune ? bahcets ... No matter what it is, I think a Rheumatologist is your next logical step. I am sorry you are going through this. I am only two months into my treatment so I have not experienced much positive change yet but there is hope for improvement! You have a lot of the same symptoms I do. The biggest difference I noticed with the\"acne\" like spots and actual acne is that they do not go away quickly. They last like 2 weeks+ and are extremely painful to touch, and a somewhat large area is raised. \n\nI have oral ulcers that are frequent and many, I have the same aching joints, dry eyes, weird bouts of fatigue that lasts a week or 2, and somewhat frequent headaches. \n\nIts safe to say your next step will be a rheumatologist however usually behcets is a disease that is diagnosed through exclusion so the doctor will likely be doing a bunch of blood work for other auto immune diseases.  It might be a while before you get to a final answer. \n\nFWIW otezla has worked very well on the oral ulcers although it does seem to have some mild stomach irritations from time to time. It took trying about 7 or so other medications before I have landed on this one. Good luck! Ugh. I just look a pic of my tongue  to see the ulcer properly and realised it is one massive on and at least 2 small ones near it. \n\nYour face spots definitely sound like what I have. I am sorry you have such similar stuff going on.\n\nHow long did it take for you to be diagnosed? Thanks. I will get a referral and join the waiting list I suppose. \n\nI plan to speak to GP about it in the next few weeks. \n\nSeems like so many symptoms that overlap with Behcet\u2019s it is uncanny. Officially diagnosed it was probably 3+years. It took a while to get to a rheumatologist in the first place then once I did they ran a lot of tests, and tried to rule out things like lyme disease, lupus, and a bunch of others. \n\nIts odd, it being so uncommon I feel like my experience with even rheumatologists has been frustrating. Even though they are specialists this is not a common disease, at least in the usa, so in my case both rheumatologists I have seen locally it seems I am the only person they have treated with this. The first one hardly seemed like he cared to research or look into it at all in between visits. I would suggest you make sure you get someone you like or try more then one. \n\nDepending where your live there are doctors that specialize in behcets as well. I ended up in New York City at NYU Langone health to see the specialists there, and it was very worth the visit. However I would narrow down things as best you can locally before taking that path. It was helpful to me though because I am only a few hours away. Like /u/awfulmcnofilter said, I think you should consult with a doctor, particularly one who specializes in something like rheumatic or infectious diseases, or a specialist likely to at least be aware of Behcet's like an ophthalmologist or a dermatologist. See what they have to say and go from there.\n\nWhile Google is no substitute for actual medical advice from a professional, I love it. I was diagnosed with Behcet's over 20 years ago and between all the weird symptoms, skin problems, and everything else, Google has been my best friend. For a lot of minor issues like certain skin symptoms, I have been able to figure out what they are and treat them with OTC meds without having to waste a specialist's time. But in your case, see a doctor and go from there.\n\nI hope you figure out what is up with you. I also hope it is not Behcet's disease, but it certainly sounds like it could be. Best of luck to you. Please let us know what you find out, even if Behcet's is ruled out. Take care and be well! Thank you for the kind words and sound advice. ", "I had my active genital sore biopsy 31 f, undiagnosed for BD but my doctors suspect it. I grew up having regular canker sores and just used dental paste when I need to. In 2015, I had my first genital sore outbreak and my primary care did not know what it was since all my results come back negative. Every year since then I would get genital sores. \n\nFinally went to ER and lucky to encounter an infectious disease Dr who is sure it is not herpes and mentioned that I might have BD. Now I am followed by a dermatologist and gynecologist, waiting for a call from rheumatologist. \n\nDermatologist took a biopsy of my active genital sores last week. TLDR: Yes, it stung like hell when he gave me local anesthesia then cut 2 pieces off for testing! What results should I be expecting? I have another 4 weeks pending results. I am on doxycycline now because dermatologist think it might be chanchroid There is a small chance that the biopsy will come back showing some sort of vasculitis - roughly 20% of BD biopsies show vasculitis as the cause, which makes a BD diagnosis a lot more certain. However, 80% of biopsies show general inflammation or folliculitis, which is also common across healthy patients, so biopsies have fallen out of favor in clinical practice when BD is suspected. \n\n\n\nI went down a similar path you did - Infectious Disease to Rheum - and generally ID/Derm really like biopsies. Rheumatology may glance at the results, but will largely focus on your symptoms + how they respond to treatments. GI doc is good too. If that gets you in sooner. Look into sebaceous adenitis and fordyce adenitis too if your tests are not conclusive. (", "Finally got diagnosed and was able to pick up a steroid cream! I want to double-check with you guys that I am planning on using it right. After 6+ months of genital ulcers I finally saved up the money to see a rheumatologist and got the diagnosis and a script for Triamcinolone. The doctor did not really give me any info on how to use it but the pharmacist told me to use it twice a day for a week and to not let it get into the wound itself. Does that seem accurate to you guys? So that cream is actually a dental paste but has been approved for other ulcers. I personally slather in a HUGE layer of Vaseline on the ulcer when I know I am going to be walking around or doing any other activity. Then use the paste when I have time to sit and let it sit Ok makes sense! I have been putting the cream on before bed. Does vaseline really work for you? When I tried it when I first got my ulcers, it hurt when I was applying it so I switched to lidocaine. Sadly it is going to hurt either way :( the Vaseline is just to form a barrier so I could use the restroom True.\n\nI have another question if you do not mind. The doctor did not really explain what the cream does. Is it just good at preventing sores from forming if I apply it when I first feel the inflammation? Or does it actively combat existing sores when applied around them? I use that same cream for mouth ulcers. It sucks btw it is nasty tasting. It works wonders my ulcers disappear in about 24hrs after applying it. this is crazy. i just went to my regular dentist here, told him i have behcets and i wanted a cortisone cream, he said sure and wrote me a script for tramcinolone...no questions asked. also free living in germany. crazy how different countries handle these things. i only use it rarely when the ulcers are bad, i try to use as little medication as possible. i kind of like having a super strong immune system. minor genital/mouth ulcer doesnt phase me too much", "New neuro symptom? My right ankle feels wet all the time. It is not painful, but it is super annoying. Has anyone felt something like this? Is it even worth telling my rheum about? I do not see him again till December. I would mention it just to see if s/he has any insight into the cause. My left foot feels like it is in frozen water all the time. Occasionally the nerves actually affect the vascular system and it is cold. I have significant neuro involvement. I get weird nerve like sensations in my leg and feet too - never got a neuro Behcets diagnosis, as it was not life threatening or anything, but my foot would feel hot, literally like an oven on the inside of the sole. Super annoying. \n\nDefinitely mention to rheumatologist. For what it is worth my heat sensations just stopped after a while. Behcets can be so random", "No Official Diagnosis but Otezla offering help. All,\n\nSecond time I have posted here.  I have been dealing with constant canker sores for about 2 years now, 3 or more at a time. When one heals, one comes.\n\nI have been seeing a dermatologist and she mentioned Behcets about 6 months ago.  About a two-ish weeks ago, I started a trial of Otezla even with no official diagnosis. I have had no cankersores since starting. \n\nI see my dermatologist soon for an update but...do you think this means I have Behcets?\n\nOther symptoms include:  night sweats, cold feet, tension headaches, growing pains - compression pain (between ankle and leg) and sometimes it feels like stuffy joints. Yea that is been my life for ten years. \n\nOtezla is the best though", "Frustrations, Questions, re evaluation? New Doctor? Our usual rhuemalogist is booked out for 4 months, we still have not gotten my wife on Humira, we missed a infusion appointment due to Covid and we left message after message to get in rescheduled and never got calls back... finally after saying \"do not transfer me there\" they actually transferred me to right area and we got an infusion appointment scheduled again.\n\nI am wondering if I should be switching health care providers, it sounds obvious to do this but, it is been almost 2 years now and my wife is still on prednisone. During this time has never been under I would 8 mgs. Her doctor has asked from bone density tests and they must have turned out fine cause we never heard about them again? \n\nIt was not always bad though, when we started on remicade things started looking up! We were actually scaling back her prednisone and I we may have made it to 8 mg's before covid hit us both. \n\nI will call my rhuematolgy department and yell, that is the first thing I will do. But a lot of this is my fault too, english is not my wife's first language but. I just really want her healthy and off prednisone... Imuran I believe she felt very sick after trying. It is been a long process and we bought a house somewhere in here too.  \n\n\nBooking covid vaccines: \"does patient take immunosuppressive drugs\" pops up and I am thinking \"Damn this could have avoided had we gotten her on humira or something along those lines...\"\n\nThis is mostly me rambling so as you can see I am jumbled, what should I do to keep my doctors in line, keep myself organized, get my wife back to 100%... Wait she is on remicade? You cannot take remicade and humira at the same time I thought? I have been on imuran since late last year and it can make you feel like crap at first. My hair fell out, I vomited, I had to eat small snacks to keep from throwing up. You have to stick with it, which sounds horrifying, but I feel much better now that my body has adjusted. It took several months. I have no idea? I think it is a different med though now that I am thinking of it... but she has not tried Humira yet. That is the one we tried I believe, came in a giant pill? Yea she just about died she could not do it... maybe we will have to try again.... Remicade is an infusion medicine given every 4-6 weeks. You cannot be on remicade and humira at the same time (at least I was told that). They are both TNF blockers/biologics. Look, humira and biologics in general are imunnossupressive drugs so in terms of the vaccine I do not think it is that different from prednisone. \nIf she is on prednisone for so long she should be tested for her vitamin D levels and she should also take vitamin D supplements because that would help prevent some serious side effects.\nI do not know where you live but my doctor is from a public hospital and I never had to deal with that kind of bullshit. \nAlso, you should know that most biologics can be taken at home, including humira. Typically, a nurse teaches her how to take the shot in the first couple of times and then she can do them at home, although is good to be able to contact the nurse in case she has questions or any problem arises.\nBest of luck. I would not call it a giant pill. It seem fairly normal sized to me. It may not work for her. Everyone is different. If she almost died I would say do not try it again lol. If she only figuratively almost died because she could not tolerate the nausea, that is a bit different.", "Possible symptoms? Hello! I have experienced recurring mouth ulcers all my life (generally have a few every month) and over the last few years I have been experiencing folliculitis/acne-like bumps on my legs, face and neck/shoulders around the same time.\n\nDoes this indicate possible Behcets? I do not really have any other symptoms to go along with these, but they do overlap somewhat and I am struggling for any other explanations (the ulcers are rather bad!) \n\nMany thanks Mouth ulcers are the pits!  I am sorry you are dealing with painful crops of them. \n\nHow about joint pain? Other inflammation? Bowel issues? No genital (or anal or other soft mucous lining) ulcerations? Iritis or other eye issues (possibly misdiagnosed as pink eye)? Reynaud\u2019s? \n\nThere are other immune issues that can also cause mouth ulcers.  Skin problems come along with these too.  It is hard to say and so many individuals vary in their experiences with BD It is very possible, but it could be many other diseases also. I do not really have any of the other symptoms, apart from very slight eye redness at times and sores in my nostrils. Interesting to hear about the possibility of other immune/inflammatory issues, the doctor has always dismissed my ulcers as 'genetic' and it goes no further, but I will ask about inflammatory possibilities.\n\nThanks for the reply and the information! Thank you, are there any others that could present these things? Behcets is the main one that crops up but I would be interested to look into others My rheumatologist mentioned both Crohns and Lupus, fortunately they can be easier to diagnose, or rule out, than Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. Are you seeing any rheumatologists or other doctors right now?\n\nOh also check out other forms of Vasculitis, there are quite a few. Sjogrens can cause those types of symptoms. If ulcers are constant they are not generic, it is just that since there is no cure for them, doctors do not know what the hell to do.\n\nMy ulcers have been called \"lack of vitamins\" for my whole life until I got diagnosed with BD and now I do not have any... Ulcers if reoccurring are always an indication that something \"bigger\" is happening. Doesnt mean it has to be serious like BD, it might be some very slight health issue, but still, something is there. Hi, I was where you are. Continuous mouth ulcers, various skin oddities. Beh\u00e7ets was on my radar for a long time. Docs ruled out Chron's via Endoscopy and Colonoscopy. ANA negative, always has been. Lupus ruled out. All else looked normal (apart from my other disease, which is mostly unrelated). It was not until I had genital ulcers show up that Rheumatologists were ready to discuss Beh\u00e7ets, and I was diagnosed.\n\nMy advice, take lots of photos and journal. Push to see a Rheumatologist now to discuss, if not diagnosing Beh\u00e7ets, at least they should be able to help with the mouth ulcers. It took a long time for a diagnosis. Good luck.", "My struggle with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s I am seeing a Beh\u00e7et\u2019s specialist from NYU Langone and colchicine has helped prevent oral ulcers but I still get them when I am under a lot of stress.\nI take higher than normal doses of colchicine &amp; when it gets really bad, I take extra colchicine and prednisone.\n\nDifferent meds work for different individuals &amp; each individual has varying types of symptoms. I have had different symptoms since 2005. It started out body aches, swollen lymph nodes, oral ulcers and  extremely painful ulcers in my lady bits that felt like I was being branded by a cattle iron. Now, I mainly get oral ulcers that can last more than a week at a time &amp; swollen lymph nodes in my throat. I have been dealing with painful recurring oral ulcers since Christmas and I currently have 2 painful ones right now. :(\n\nI recommend anyone who needs help to read all the posts &amp; comments in this subreddit to glean what information they can. Keep a journal with dates, symptoms and the duration of symptoms to help your case. And keep all records of tests- even ones with negative results as a process of elimination. Granted, a good doctor will want to test you all over again. \n\n***VERY IMPORTANT*****\nStart off by making sure that doctor you plan to make an appointment with has treated a person with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s before. If they have not, how the heck will they be able to help you? They will not &amp; it will waste your time &amp; efforts.\n\nI suffered from 2005 to 2019. I finally got help from the NYU specialist only because I had to move to NYC with my boyfriend for his job. In small towns in Oregon, no one could help me &amp; I had to educate my doctors there about it. Even in NYC, before I found my specialist, doctors acted like I was crazy until I was able to show them my oral ulcers and blood tests show that I have HLA-B27 &amp; HLA-B51, which according to my specialist is still inconclusive as to whether or not I have Beh\u00e7et\u2019s or Complex Aphtosis.\n\nIt sucks really bad &amp; it is exhausting but we have to be our own advocates. We have to do our own research to find help and answers and go to cities that have doctors who have treated patients with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. I thought HLA b27 was an AS related marker. \n\nMy doc tested me for HLA b-21, as she said some people with Behcets will have it, but I do not. She said it is more likely to be positive in people with Behcets who are from the \"traditional\" ethnic background.", "Update post: Thank you to this community for support guidance. I am finally on the right track! Original post here: \n\nTo say I am lucky to have started regular medication is an understatement. With the current state of the world and the timing of my sudden outbreak, I have been so anxious about losing my job due to my outbreaks rendering me sick for days every other week.

My wonderful dermatologist has decided to label me as a Behcets suspect and start regular medication of colchicine. I always thought it was so weird that I would get mouth ulcers ever other week my entire life but no doc gave it a bother beyond stress, except my current dermatologist.  I guess in combination with the folliculitis, pelvic pain and vulvar ulcers the picture of my inflammation seems aggravated now.

Thank you Reddit community for all the detailed info it really helped me speed up the process with my doctor.", "Mouth ulcers in tongue daily Hello, \n\nI have not been diagnosed but this is the first time I have come across a disease that matches my symptoms. One of the worst are ulcers...especially on my tongue. Lately these past couple of months I have been getting them daily. Every morning on my tongue filled with ulcers and a couple hours later they will be gone only to return again the next day. Is this usual of behcets ulcers? \n\nThank you and appreciate any help. I have never heard of ulcers healing so quickly. Do you have any other symptoms When I get them on my tongue, or anywhere in my mouth really, they last days to weeks. Never had them so short or go away and return. I have joint pain especially in knees, rashes, stiffness, blurry vision and the ulcers are always there just come and go. I thought I had hiv forever now but tests keep returning negative and an online doctor told me to look into this. I am going to see rheumatologist in month but am so confused as to what I am feeling It is been weird lately, I have had them before and often which usually they last a while too, it is recently where things have been so strange where it is daily come and go It is a confusing disease. There are not tests for it, but the rheumatologist will rule out everything else\n\nHave you tried zinc lozenges? They helped my sores Thank you, I have not tried them. I will go to store now and get some. Same. They are frustratingly slow to heal. Is it more likely that they are still there but you notice them less during the day? I get that. I use bonjela teething gel on them. Works a treat and tastes like banana. I will look into that. It is like they just disappear after a whole and come back later. It is weird. I am going to add photos  Photos of the ulcers if anyone wanted to see for more info. Are these relatable? Mine never look like that. Have you been. Checked by a dentist? Maybe they can biopsy these I never thought of asking my dentist about that. I have a cleaning coming up and will point it out. It is just weird cause they really do not bother me like my usual canker sores. These are just there painless and plentiful haha See, no way they are canker sores. Canker sores are always painful. I will be curious to know what these are!! Maybe they are just your tastebuds or something! What you describe is not common, however, I experience it myself. If you look closely, you will likely notice that the ulcer is still there, but that the inflammation has dramatically decreased.  A good way to test for this is to rinse your mouth with peroxide or drink a carbonated beverage, or other acidic drink. Odds are you will feel some stinging at the site of the ulcer that has \"disappeared.\"  I often have ulcers that become inflamed and painful in a matter of hours only to quiet so much that they are almost undetectable.\n\nIt is very important that you and your physician know the character of the ulcers. Behcet's ulcers are almost always aphthous ulcers (aphthae). You can get a good idea of how these look by doing a Google image search for \"aphthous ulcers Behcet's.\"\n\nIt is important that if you have Behcet's you get diagnosed early. Early treatment can minimize long-term damage and decreased the frequency of flares. Behcet's is notoriously difficult to diagnose because there are currently no laboratory tests and biopsies of the ulcers show changes that are typical of many diseases that cause aphthae. Seeing a rheumatologist with experience in treating Behcet's can be a big time (and misery) saver. While Behcet's is most often diagnosed by the persistence (and progression) of a constellation of signs and symptoms over time, sometimes there are shortcuts. An example of this would be a good response to treatment with colchicine or apremilast (Otezla). A dramatic positive response, particularly in the setting of unremitting disease is a strong indicator of the presence of Behcet's.\n\nIf you are young and male it is particularly important to get diagnosed and treated early because Behcet's often has a much more aggressive course in young men. I hope this helps. Thank you, I am seeing rheumatologist soon. I also was wondering if these ulcers might be oral hairy leukoplakia and if that also is common with behcets but so much going through my mind. Your PCP and certainly your rheumatologist will be able to tell what kind of lesion you have usually by simple visual inspection. Leukoplakia is most often caused by local irritation and is typically confined to one or two lesions. It can also be an indicator of oral cancer or of systemic diseases. Hairy leukoplakia is typically seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV or in Epstein-Barr virus infection (aka mononucleosis). Hairy leukoplakia lesions are almost always benign and often respond well to antiviral therapy as long as treatment is continued. It is also worth noting that most leukoplakias are not painful which is in sharp contrast to the aphthous ulcers seen in Behcet's.", "Neck Behcets (17,F) I have been diagnosed for 4 years and have never had behcet's on my neck until now. Has anyone else experienced a flare up on their neck and do you have any treatments you can suggest? What exactly do you mean?  Like what symptoms on your neck are you experiencing? If you mean the pseudo foliculitis, yes. I almost always have at least one spot on my neck and nothing I have done has helped them. However I started taking imuran recently and have not had neck spots since. Are you experiencing pain/stiffness/inflammation in your neck muscles? Or actual behcets ulcers/sores on the skin? My symptoms are almost all neck and brain stem. I have throat ulcers, neck stiffness and inflamation. For me prednisolone is quite effective for overall behcets. I also use cold compresses to make the inflamation less painful and eating cold food can be really relieving too... I tried immune but it did not seem to help thanks tho. Its sores that are just starting Sores mostly It has not helped me with other things so who knows. You probably just need to bring it up with your rheumatologist. &gt; pseudo foliculitis\n\nI have had this as well, but mostly on my back/shoulder/back of neck area.  I also got what seemed like cystic acne there too, but more like  ulcers from what the doc said.  I was able to get it to go away by using a combination of \n\nNeutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Spot Treatment Gel - for the more ulcer like spots\n\nand Neutrogena Rapid Clear Pads with Salicylic Acid  \n\nThis made even some of my rashes go away, but mostly all the sores and bumps I would get.  I also cannot use Imuran as I am allergic so this combo of stuff helps most my skin issues that pop up.  I use the wipes daily in those areas still (5 years later) and it is never come back. I will have to check this out I have not gotten them on my neck but just dealt with a new sore on my foot. It stuck around for 2-3 weeks. Soaking in an epsom &amp; tea tree oil foot bath seemed to trigger the healing process. May not work for everyone but give it a try if you can.", "Recent diagnosis- joint question Background: Hello all! I am from the US. I have had recurrent oral sores since being a teenager, in the past couple of years I have noticed chronic persistent pustules/pseudo folliculitis on my legs. I have been pretty miserable for a couple of years  frequent unexplained chest pain, constant headaches, eye floaters, occipital like neurlagia symptoms, knee joint and leg pain in general, always tired, cannot keep up with peers partying/work/gym. I am also turkish/arabic. So the USA in general is pretty awful at this disease. 1st consult tested for HLA-B51(it is not diagnostic), i had to explain to him what the pathergy test was. Anyways after i got positive hla-b51 i started freaking out booked multiple consults at renowned university hospitals in california. All of them are in agreement that it seems mild, 2 of them prescribed otezla which i am currently on.  Knock on wood i have had alot of imaging and labs and i have always been clean so far.  Sometimes I wonder if I kind of pushed for the diagnosis because i have a really shitty lifestyle/mental ilness that may explain alot of those symptoms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1.I often get joint and calf pain, are you guys's knee joints obviously swelled? Like mine are very mildly swelling and rheum and PCP look at them and think they are normal but they hurt quite a bit? Is this your experience to, or is it obviously like Swelled?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.I am a pharmacist and to my misfortune delved really deep into behcet's medical literature, being a hypocondriac focusing on the most catastrophic outcomes. I am a dude so more susceptible bad outcomes of the disease(vasc/neuro).  Anyways I read a Vascular behcets review that suggested that a uk vasc surgeons guideline suggests doing yearly CT angiogram to make sure vasc is fine(and imaging during flareups).  It sounds aggressive but because of how dangerous aneurysms can be it makes sense. So I consulted our \"best\" behcets specialists in the USA (NYU langone) and asked the rheum if  that is what they did. He said no, they do not go fishing for stuff with imaging. Wondering how you guys experience is with routine imaging for Behcets that has not manifested severe symptoms yet. I am scared of vasc because i have a family history of clots and a confirmed rare genetic thrombophila(factor v homozygous and heterezygous prothrombin- i am the luckiest of dudes.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for being wordy! Cannot help it being a clinician! Hope to hear from you guys's experiences! ohh sorry diag 34 yrs old, currently 35. Otezla only. male. I did not get knee pain but ankle, and they were VERY MUCH swelled, so much even putting socks on would hurt.\n\nAs for the angiography I did do them but because I got eye involvement (left optic nerve edema which rendered me temporarily blind in one eye), so the tests were to check the stage of the edema, not so much of BD as a whole.\n\nAlso remember there is no direct cure for BD, you can only cure the symptoms taken singularly, and there is no test which gives an idea of how the illness is doing, that is why diagnosis is so hard. As for neuro BD, my Rheum made me take an MRI, and after that told me it is not and if \"cured\" the disease cannot evolve into it.\n\nItaly, 18, M, on Humira. Makes sense. Thank you for sharing! So have just about every symptom you have started. Knee pain started about a year ago, but joints have been mildly painful for years now.  My knees are very visibly inflamed while hurting. \n\nSo have had lots of oral ulcers, get eye floaters sometimes, headaches fairly often, have folliculitis often in flare ups, other random eye issues, have somewhat frequent back pain in both lower and middle back, and during flare ups I am usually unexplainably tired for days at a time sometimes lasting a week or more.\n\nThe few things that have me concerned are I have light headedness and hand tremors from time to time, and the eye issues although I have not had anything really serious with eyes I am also on otezla and must say it had helped immensely with the oral sores but not so much with the inflammation. Thanka for sharing! Sounds like we have similar symptoms. Btw i forgot to ask in questions. I always wake up from sleep sore, neck pain, chest pain somtimes headache do you have that too?", "You all get cold extremities? During the winter it seems like my hands and feet can never quite get warm, regardless of how many layers i throw on. I have been wondering if it was related to behcets so I figured I would ask all of you. My foot gets painfully cold. I use a heating pad. Hell yes. My hands and feet are always cold.  Even with socks on in bed Yup. Feet might also turn blueish from the cold. Yep, my feet turn purple and go numb. I have to put my feet in the bathtub with hot water to get them warm. Then socks and heating pad. I was dxd with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to Behcets. It leaves your extremities cold, skin discolored and tingly or sore. My feet! Even if the rest of me is sweating my feet are soooo cold. I can  go to bed in just my underwear but I have to have socks on lol. Sometimes I have to have a hot shower to warm them back up but it takes quite a while.   \n\n\nI do not  g et that in my hands, just my cold cold feet! I always assumed it was just poor circulation. I recently tried alpaca wool's socks and they did wonders! At some point, I even wanted to take them off because they were so hot, altough I was outside on a cold day. Yup. I also have big trouble with my body temperature, if its slightly cold for other people, i am usually shivering and same goes for heat, I will often wake up in the morning either shivering or laying in a pool of my sweat, especially when i am having a flare up, then its pretty much every night Yes. Weirdly, I have learned that socks actually make my feet cooler. I think it is a circulation issue. But when the socks are on, my feet are freezing. If I am wearing UGG style boots with no socks, my feet will actually warm up. I was floored when I figured that out. Yes but it is probably due to my abnormally slow resting heart rate (33-40 bpm) not behcets at least in my case.", "A couple of questions Hey all,\n\nI am a life-long canker sore sufferer now in my early 30s. My canker sores have always been annoying, but never really debilitating until this year. Since March, I have had 3 canker sore flareups that included both regular sores in my mouth but also really painful sores in my throat and on my uvula. These flareups have been associated with fatigue and weakness, even though I am getting plenty of rest and minimizing stress.\n\nI have seen several docs including an ENT, and I just this week got a referral to see a rheumatologist. The ENT wants me to get checked out for Behcet's. \n\nIn the meantime, I am curious if you all think my symptoms sound like Behcet's? I have not had sores anywhere but inside my mouth (i.e., no genital sores or rashes on my body). I typically have dry/sensitive eyes but I do not think I have noticed any particular worst pain or inflammation during flareups. My family is from Italy and I likely have ancestors from other Meditteranean countries. Between flareups, I feel healthy and have no other symptoms.\n\nMy second question is how you all manage in your personal and professional lives? My symptoms really wear me down to the point where it wears me down to do even basic house chores. I am an active person and I want to push through it but I fear that any additional physical stress will slow my healing.\n\nThanks and I hope you are all hanging in there. I have read through many of your posts and I can tell that you are all serious fighters and I find that really inspiring. Sores and fatigue are indeed BD symptoms, but I honeslty do not think it is Beh\u00e7et just because of the fact those two are the only symptoms: BD usually also causes joint pain/swelling/inflammation. \n\nAs long as living with BD: since I have been put on Adalimumab I have had no symptoms whatsoever, apart from general fatigue, so living with BD is completely possible.\n\nWhile it is true that BD is more frequent in Mediterranean countries, that does not change the fact it is very rare: I am from Northern Italy and almost no doctors knew about it. The incidence numbers are still pretty ridiculous (around 2.4 cases in a million) so your ancestry I do not think is going to matter much.\n\nHope you will find out what is affecting you! Pretty regular minor cankers around puberty, a few genital sores on and off, but did not realize that is what they even were at the time, probable Crohns diagnoses around the same time.. Everything was pretty much in remission during my 20s, while I was drinking and using speed pretty regularly (i would get a rare canker then, but physically survived pretty unscathed) \n\nAbout 35 I started to get debilitating canker sores on my soft pallet and uvula. Had to be hospitaized twice due to dehydration and malnutrition (would stop eating and drinking for days to nearly a week, nothing was helping, i could not numb the sores enough to get a meal, or swallow water, or talk.) \n\nI suffered through doctors for a 6 months or so, no clue, no cure, no treatment other than \"magic mouthwash\" antidepressants, and fist fulls of Ibuprofen and Tylenol.\n\nAfter the 3rd biopsy!!??!?! and before I had my uvula removed, I discovered Behcet's, and after convincing my GP to let me try a round of steroids (I had a sore on my scrotum the size of a half dollar coin, in the middle of the hottest summer, and more oral ucers than ever) everything cleared up in like 4 days.\n\nI have been seeing an RA since, and i am on a combo of Imuran, colchicine and Prednisone and now only get the tiniest sores..\n\nI also use a topical steroid on the vasculitis spots I get on my extremities.\n\nHonestly, I get some pretty bad joint inflammation now and again, today I can barely walk, but its nothing, NOTHING, compared to the 6 years of random severe and unexplainable sores.\n\nEverything hurts, but at least I can drink my tea with lemon.\n\nTo the second question, i work for a dispensary and consume massive quantities of marijuana. Probably not helpful for most, but it gets me through the bad days.\n\nThis is my main, I forgot the login for my alt. Probably delete this later. See if you can convinced our gp to prescribe some oral steroids. 30mg per day for a week. See what happens. Thank you for your response and for sharing your story. It sounds like the moral is to get to a rheumatologist ASAP and start investigating this rather than waiting for it to get worse. One concern I have is about side effects of medications, given that between flares I feel normal. Can you please talk a bit about how you handle your meds? Thank you for your advice. I did not talk about my joints because I do not consider my joints to be any worse than the average person my age. What I do have is a high propensity to get tendinitis. I play a musical instrument as one of my hobbies but I have had to cut back my playing big time over the last few months. I do not know if tendonitis falls into the joint pain category, but I suppose that since it is the inflammation of my tendons it could be related.\n\nCan you please share a bit about how you manage your medication? Do you have bad side effects? During a flareup earlier this year I was prescribed an oral dexamethasone rinse and it cleared up my mouth ulcers in days. They came back about a week after I stopped the steroids but once again went away with the steroid rinse. I am a bit wary about steroid side effects, especially with long term use, but I suppose that a good doctor should be able to help me weigh the pros and cons. Forget what I said. If you know that a steroid is helping then you should get on a non steroidal option. Azathioprine, Methotrexate, Otzela, Mycophenalate even Colchicine to start. There are so many options. I am on Infliximab and it works wonders. It is a pretty strong immunosuppressant though so something lighter may work for you. Ok thanks. Do you recommend the non steroidal option because it is more conservative and probably better for long term use? Exactly, should not use steroids long term. I am still weaning right now. I have been on the for two years trying to figure out what works. One more month. RA and an ophthalmologist who hopefully has some extra study and specialty in uveitis.\n\nMy RA sent me to an ophthalmologist who ONLY sees uveitis patients, even though I had not had any eye problems yet! Reason being, he sees pretty much all the Behcet patients in my state (when it involves the eyes it can go bad quick), and he actually is the one who brought up the two genetic marker tests (they are not 100% at all either way, but there are two different markers they can look for to help narrow down what might be going on). I had one of the two markers they look for.\n\nMedication wise..  I am not even sure the Imuran is doing anything to be honest. We just raised my dose, I do not feel I suffer anything from it. The colchicine I had to halve my evening dose, otherwise i was waking up with severely urgent bowel issues, but it does not seem to bother me when I take a full dose in the morning (I take .6mg in the morning, .3mg in the evening)\n\nPrednisone is a godsend for symptoms but the most troublesome side effects. I am pretty stimulated on it, wild mood swings, water weight especially around my face. I am a heavy guy, but it makes my head look noticeably larger. Crazy hunger. And my gallbladder is angry ALL THE TIME. Dunno if I had gallstones before all this, but I do now, and I really need to have it removed.\n\nI am pretty much nauseated all the time.\n\nStill better than soft pallet cankers and genital sores though! :| Adalimumab is a self injection once every two weeks. It takes a bit of time to start giving its benefits so usually you are also put on steroids in the first period (usually 2/3 injections).\n\nSince I started the medication all my symptoms stopped and the only side effect I have is fatigue: three to four hours after the injection I feel extremely tired, reason why I do them on Friday afternoons. Apart from that a general feeling of tiredness after doing pretty much anything physical, but I will take that any day over mouth ulcers, joint pain and (in my case) testicle inflammations... Long-time BD sufferer here.  Good advice on this thread.  \n\nAs far as managing symptoms, it can be very difficult.  Be patient and kind to yourself.  Meditation, healthy diet, a loyal pet companion, and exercise.... but exercise is tricky....   from my experience, if you engage in any sort of prolonged activity then inflammation takes over.  That evening and the next day (or more) can be hellish.  Regular, even, light exercise like casual hikes through the woods is my speed  (I am a nature lover).  I take walks almost daily, though when inflammation hits, I must take days off in a row.  My athletic fur baby keeps me engaged all day with regular backyard ball-throwing sessions.  I used to try more vigorous exercise routines but I realized that the \u2018natural exhaustion\u2019 we gauge ourselves with as we exercise is TOO MUCH for a BD person.   That is my personal experience.  I end up with uncomfortable vascular burning (like neuropathy pins and needle feelings in my shins and arms, feet and hands) and prolonged recovery, sometimes even triggering a further flare up with ulcerations and other manifestations.  \n\nDo you experience Reynaud\u2019s?  I see a lot of BD folks do.  With that I feel like it is best to keep my body temperature even, that includes not over heating in addition to never getting too cold. Even slight body temperature changes are disruptive to my systems.  \n\nIn terms of work, I medically retired from teaching because the stress caused me countless debilitating flares, back to back. My quality of life was much lower than a non-BD my age.  Being off work and able to sleep when I need to and spend all day in controlled, low-stress situations has improved my general health like no pharmaceutical has been able to offer.  I still have frequent flare ups but I am better able to manage them because I do not have to juggle work responsibilities too.  I do take steroid burst therapy as needed and utilize a wide variety of topical medications to ease the discomforts. I have tried long-term maintenance medications but they are not right for me at this time.  \n\nBest wishes.  I am here for you. Mid 30s Female.\n\nI hear you on being wary of meds when you feel fine in between the flare ups\nI was hesitant to go the mediated route, but if it is Behcets, most likely you will find that you need to do SOMETHING. You will reach a point when the flares outweigh the good in between months.\n\nI am on colchicine and Azathioprine (and prednisone steroids during the flares). To be honest, I am not yet convinced that the meds are doing more to keep my flares at bay, than controlling my life through diet and stress reduction. But, I cant truly prove that because I am on them, and now not willing to go off because I am scared of getting those bad flares again. \n\nI will say...i think the meds make them a lot less severe and therefore quicker to heal. \n\nYour tendonitis could definitely be exacerbated by the BD, even if its initial cause is your musical instrument\n\nI tend to think of Behcets as inflammation from tip to toes.. and anything that ends in \"itis\" can be caused or made worse if you have Behcets.\n\nIt is like other people's regular is multiplied by 10 with us... regular exercise soreness feels like being hit by a bus.... regular tired feels like exhaustion.. \n\nBut yes, the in betweens can be perfectly normal and therefore very misleading that can convince us we surely dont have this disease. Thanks for your insights. Regarding exercise, I used to be a high level athlete but over the last year or two I struggle to exercise without being worn out for days. I am not to the level that you are describing but I feel like I may be somewhere on that spectrum.\n\nI occasionally get Reynaud's symptoms although I have not noticed them in a few years. I was told by a doctor that I had Reynaud's sometime in 2015 and he just told me to wear warmer clothes. I am quite sensitive to the cold, to the point where my friends and family tease me about it. I guess this might explain some of it.\n\nI am sorry to hear about your pain and discomfort. I hope that you are able to find a treatment that is right for you. All the best. Thanks for your advice. I think you make a good point about reaching a time when the flareups are frequent enough to need medical intervention. I do not think I am as bad as some of the people in this subreddit, but my symptoms definitely have caught my attention this time around and I am going to take this seriously.\n\nCould you please elaborate about diet and stress reduction? Do you have an anti-inflammatory diet that you are on permanently, or just during flares?\n\nThanks again. Sure, lots of us have talked about this and opinions vary. As much as I wish I could say plant-based and vegan and environmentally ethically friendly vegetarian diets work, they do NOT for me. A long process of elimination dieting as well as research and my own soul searching finally landed me on a heavily animal based diet - grass fed (as much as possible) beef, lamb, fish, eggs, cheese, butter and full fat greek yogurt. I also eat some fruits - grapes, bananas and blueberries. The only vegetables I eat are zucchini, cauliflower and onion/garlic. The only carbs I will eat are rice occasionally and gluten free crackers.\n\nBut if you want to know what categories I have eliminated it comes down to sugar free, gluten free, low oxalate foods (oxalates are only found in plants and are inflammatory foods..research Sally K Norton if you are interested in learning more). \n\nThere is a lot of available research out there on diets that help autoimmune diseases such as the carnivore diet (I would consider myself carnivore-ish), and paleo diets. The overriding principle is that we should eat more like our ancestors did and avoid all the processed foods, including vegetable and seed oils, polyunsaturated fats and all refined sugars. \n\nFor those people who can live vegan or even vegetarian lifestyles and survive with an autoimmune disease, I am honestly jealous. So many plant based foods are inflammatory for me (and many others, it turns out), but society isnt encouraging of eating loads of meat these days. So, I am careful how I approach the diet question and generally go with \"that is awesome if that works for you and you are thriving\".\n\nAs for stress reduction, ive drastically altered my lifestyle- mostly thanks to Covid and working from home. But ultimately its come down to accepting that I have Behcets, that I am limited to what I can expect my body to do physically, and that I am entitled to rest and choose foods and activities that make me feel well. \n\nSounds so simple, but it is actually been a huge deal - prioritizing eating well, sleeping and slowing down. Thank you, I really appreciate you sharing all of this and I will take it into consideration moving forward.", "Ask your doctor about otezla I was recommended this drug by a specialist at Mayo Clinic. I am a 25 yr old male diagnosed with this horrible condition in 2013. For years I have tried to manage this condition with prednisone and azathioprine with varying effectivity. I want others to know that this relatively new option may be something you may want to look into and bring up with your doctor. My daughter has been on Otezla for 2 years now. It had done a really good job controlling her oral ulcers until recently. I highly recommend anyone trying it. She did continue to have occasional flares but she went months at a time without a single oral ulcer and when she did have a flare it was much shorter. Unfortunately, like most things with this disease, nothing works forever and we are having to look into changing meds again. Any suggestions? She has already been on all the TNF inhibitors and all the basic meds, plus steroids all the time.  Everyone is different but at one point I was taking low dose prednisone (5mg) alongside imuran (150mg) for many months and it was effective. I have also treated moderately-severe flare ups with taking a single dose of 60mg of prednisone and felt that it was effective at preventing the flare up from getting bad. I wish there was a treatment that was effective for all but it will take trial and error to find what works for your daughter.", "Behcets and Pregnancy Hi All!\n\nNew here and looking for some advice.\n\nMy wife is pregnant with our first and although we are very very happy my wife is dealing with insane nausea. We did the dating ultrasound today and are pretty sure she is about 4-6 weeks at this point.\n\nA little background:\n\nMy wife was diagnosed with Behcets back in August. She was initially admitted to the hospital and diagnosed due to genital ulcers. She has not had ulcers since and was taking colchicine. We have stopped the colchicine for the pregnancy due to undecided recommendations from our doctor. The symptoms seem to be somewhat at bay for now although nausea is a usual symptom that she experiences but nothing like she is experiencing now.\n\nThe last 3 weeks have been absolutely horrible. She is always nauseous and pukes a minimum of 2 times a day (most times it is more mixed in with the dry heaves randomly throughout the day). She has been in bed for 3 weeks and has missed 10 days of work. She cannot function whatsoever. Laying in bed is pretty much the best she can do.\n\nShe has been prescribed Pyridoxine/doxylamine (Diclectin) and Ondansetron (Zofran). We have also tried Gravol.\n\nWe have oil diffusers with an array of different oils, tried preggie pops, lemons, candies, teas etc. the list goes on and on. \n\nI feel helpless, useless and sad... I want this to be awesome joyful and fun for her, but that is proving to be very difficult.\n\nAny ideas? Thank you in advance :)\n\n I am not pregnant (yet) but we are working on it. I have BD, so your post caught my eye.\n\nI got off of colchicine in July because i knew I would not be able to take it during pregnancy.\n\nI do not have any suggestions for nausea but I am wondering if it is possible she is had the flu?  \n\nIs she having ulcers downstairs?  I know when I have a flare up....night time is the worst.  I have found that oragel helps to numb the area and allows enough relief to sleep.  Also, Neosporin has helped heal the area.\n\nI hate that I do not have more to offer but Behcets SUCKS and it helps to know you are not alone I am not excluding that it could be a mixture of the flu for sure.\n\nHas the colchicine been working for you? My wife does not notice any changes when she takes it but that does not mean it is not working.\n\nCurrently no ulcers! Which is awesome. Her doctor gave her some topical steroids that she uses anytime she feels that one is coming or trying to form. It seems to work well and keep them from starting.\n\nBehcets does suck! It is been a tough past 6 months I was diagnosed when I was pregnant with my second child. The only thing they would prescribe for me was Vicodin for pain.  I did not feel at all comfortable taking that while pregnant, so I just dealt with flairs for the entire pregnancy. I am still not sure how I got through it.  So I have no advice there, except rest as much as possible. \n\nAs for the nausea...Benadryl can also help . And it sounds weird, but the smell of rubbing alcohol (or those little alcohol wipes that they clean your arm with before a shot) can temporarily overwhelm your system, and can give some quick relief. Do not huff obviously, but it works for a quick break.  And have you tried the ginger lollipops?  I have heard good things about those (Source:  tricks learned taking care of someone on chemo). ", "Feeling discouraged, isolated, and frustrated with chronic illness - not so quick rant *possibly triggering* Hello Beh\u00e7ets Reddit, \n\nForgive me, I need to rant, and I feel like this is the only place that people can really understand or sympathize with these experiences. I am 23/f, diagnosed, and kind of in the midst of figuring out treatment. I am currently taking colchicine and in the process of starting methotrexate and (possibly?) Remicade. Anyways!\n\nThis past December I was admitted to the hospital after a severe flare-up, December was my finals (I am a student) and my university basically told me either I could figure out a way to finish weeks' worth of work that I missed while sick/hospitalized or drop my entire semester. I also left the job I had just started, it was pretty physical and I just could not keep up. I managed to finish the semester from bed and as I started feeling better I started looking for another job. \n\nFast forward to now, I have started a new job I like and the new semester has started, and I was feeling ok and lone behold, my joints started aching, mouth started flaring, and now I am in a full flare-up, with this fun new edition of hand ulcers (anyone else experience this?). I feel like I cannot keep up with school with all the days I need to rest and I feel like I am not valuable to entry place workplaces because of all the random time I require off when I get sick. \n\nI just want some kind of treatment to work. I know I should probably start some kind of anti-inflammatory diet or something (does anyone have any recommendations?) and maybe light exercise but it is so frustrating to spend so much time dealing with my health and still feel like nothing is working. \n\nI am so sorry if this is depressing for anyone, I just feel down.", "Contacts or Lasic? Hi all,\n\nI am a longtime lurker, first-time poster. Was diagnosed about 10 years ago, but have had symptoms my entire life. I am wondering if anyone has gotten specific information about the advisability of wearing contact lenses or getting vision correction surgery. I have only had an ocular ulcer once as far as I know, but I do have frequent uveitis and dry, irritated eyes.\n\nI have a great rheumatologist, but she did not feel comfortable making any recommendations in this area, and I have seen several optometrists who were not familair with Behcet's, so I have largely been left to interpret the minimal studies on my own. Have you found contacts to be irritating, or been advised against correction surgery? Idk about Behcet\u2019s and LASIK but I do not recommend getting it as I have read recently that it is not as safe as they once thought. \n\nContacts are a bit more harmless. Glasses seem to be the best bet. I am extremely nearsighted and went blind from Behcets related illnesses (got my vision back last year). Contacts have been a lifesaver for me, particularly since I am so near-sighted, Lasik may not be available for me (as stated by several optometrists, ophthalmologists, and neuroophthalmologists). To give you an idea, I am -13 and -14 in my right and left eyes for glasses. Definitely do a Lasik consultation so you can get specific recommendations based on your vision and needs. Behcets affects us all differently. Good luck! My personal experience with this disease tells me to not fuck with my eyes at all in any way shape or form.\n\nIn my case in my mouth and skin anywhere I get an injury is a potential place for an ulcer or lesion. I have had a couple surgical procedures on my legs and all the incision sites are just horrific especially during flare up.\n\nI just would not want to risk any kind of incision or damage to my eyes except to maybe save them.\n\nAnyway glasses for me. My understanding of lasik \u2014  your eyes have to be stable for a certain amount of years for best outcome..my husband had it done over fifteen years ago (does not have bechets or anything). I was never a candidate before being diagnosed with bechets because my eyes continued to worsen. I rarely wear contacts from dry eyes. So I have embraced glasses \ud83e\udd13 good luck. Sorry I cannot be more helpful. I had my lasik corrective surgery about 5 years before my Behcets symptom aggravated enough to result in a diagnosis and regular medication (I am still medically a suspect because I do not have uveitis). Regarding getting the surgery, it is definitely invasive enough that it could cause further issues, however I was on steroids after my surgery. Idk how significant was it at preventing further issues during the healing process. I also had to confirm I had a stable defect before I could qualify for the process and had to wait a couple months to confirm my vision was not constantly getting worse.", "Cherry Angiomas I have a lot of very small ones that showed up about 5 years ago. Just curious if any others diagnosed have cherry angiomas show up. I have had a few since childhood (mostly on chest and two on forehead), but I never thought to connect it to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. Interesting. I wasnt sure if it was connected or not. But it does have to do with blood vessels so I thought I would see if anyone else had experienced them. I do. I was told they were \"angry blood moles\". I was pretty pissed when Behcet's finally came up. The majority are on my torso. A few here and there on arms and legs. Always have had them since childhood; have become more numerous the past few years. Come from a medical background family, but they never put 2 and 2 together. Is this a known behcets trait? It was something I was just curious about as to weather others with behcets had experienced this. As far as I can tell it is not accepted as a trait. Since both are from the inflammation of blood vessels, though, I would say that there is a correlation between the 2. I have one on the tip of my nose. Hate it. I am sorry. :( I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good Ah do not be sorry, one thing this disease has taught me and that is to just get on with it Me too lol. I just keep it clean and it helps I am sorry lol but i feel so much better now i know im not the only one lmao I know me too! (And I am sorry too) Ever been called Rudolph? \ud83d\ude02 shit hurt when i was young No but I was way bigger growing up. I noticed it bled easier if it ever got scratched even a little bit. I know that is not always the case", "HLA b51 negative. It Could still be behcet\u2019s, right?  Sorry I am answering with a question but what is HLA b51? Is an atingen that has been found to be Associated with behcet\u2019s disease I am negative, doctors are still calling it Behcet's though. What are your symptoms ? Oral and genital ulcers, pimple like legions on my arms and legs, mostly legs, and the odd severe joint pain now and again. ( from the American Behcet's Disease Association (ABDA) is amazing - Dr. Santos discusses the association of HLA-B51 with Behcet's around the 9-10 minute mark. If you are working with your doctor on diagnosing potential Behcet's - I recommend watching the entire video - it is very approachable despite diving into the weeds a bit.\n\n**Short answer:** HLA-B51 negative cannot rule out a potential Behcet's Disease diagnosis, while being HLA-B51 positive can make the diagnosis much more definitive. This is due to a strong correlation between those with HLA-B51 mutations and the disease in Turkish populations. It is believed that most North American and Western European cases of Behcet's are HLA-B51 negative. Same here. But swap pimple and genital ulcers for eye involvement. I am taking medication now and am almost free of any symptoms. No oral ulcers is like being reborn I am an European male and strangely enough are positive to HLA-B51. But yes, being negative does not mean Beh\u00e7et's is impossible, it is just that being positive is a confirmation if you already show the symptoms. I m european and negative Yes it still could be behcet's. Doctors told me that they take any HLA-B5 as an indication as well. Oh wait you are the same person from the other day. Honestly with how recently your symptoms came up, the infrequency of them and the negative HLA-B51 I personally think it might not be Beh\u00e7et's. I feel like your doctor is a bit rushing it for whatever reason. Remember that the treatment for Beh\u00e7et's is pretty tough, so you want to be sure that is the problem.\nI would honestly cure the symptoms on their own (your knee pain and ulcerative episode), and wait a bit to see if they come up again. It took me 5 years of reoccurring constant mouth ulcers and arthritis before it developed into something serious (optic nerve edema) so a few months of observation should be totally fine. HLA holds our genetic information about our immune system. Like JetSetKyle said the association of HLA-B51 and Behcets is close and used as a marker for diagnosis.  \n\nI am HLA B51 Positive and have other genetic markers for RA and Sorjens. These markers just help doctors identify the possibility of why your immune system is responding the way it is. Agreed, behcets is a life long disease and the first onset of symptoms occur during the teenage years with all symptoms appearing in your 20's. If any new symptoms or ulcers happen after your 20's it is very possible it is not Behcet's but another autoimmune disease or disorder like the following : \n\n* Ulcerative Colitis\n* Crohn\u2019s Disease\n* Coeliac Disease\n* HLA-B27 Seronegative Arthritis \u2013 eg ankylosing spondylitis\n* Reiter\u2019s Syndrome\n* Stevens-Johnson Syndrome\n* Sarcoidosis\n* Multiple Sclerosis\n* Immune Deficiency Diseases\n* Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE, lupus)\n* Rheumatoid Arthritis\n* Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome\n* Lyme Disease (Borrelia burgdorferi)\n* Food Intolerance and Allergy\n\nAll of these have ulcers present in their diagnosis", "Behcet\u2019s symptoms since 2007, diagnosed in 2011, and experiencing my first major flare out of a 5 year remission. Happy to answer any questions people may have about Behcet\u2019s. My first flare started mildly with face an oral ulcers in 2007. I experienced major flares once per year until about 2010. At that time they progressed to every three months and as often as three times in a month. My symptoms have progressed to face, mouth, nose, hands, wrists, feet, ankle, genital, anal ulcers (as well as random places elsewhere), joint pain, light sensitivity, and fatigue. My last major flare was in 2013, and I had a medium flare in 2014. I was basically flare free until 5 days ago when I had a full-blown flare. I previously have been on colchicine, prednisone, and Simponi. I now am on Enbrel and azathioprine (and prednisone during this latest flare). \nTl;dr: Feel free to ask me anything about the disease, symptoms, flares, pain management, medications, etc. I have been living with it for over 10 years, so I am happy to help anyone else struggling. It is a pain in the neck of a disease! How long have you been on the enbrel and azathioprine? Did you start after the recent flare-up, or have you been taking it while in remission?\n\nI was diagnosed last week. I have been getting oral ulcers every month or two since I was in high school (at least 10 years), but the last 2 years I have been getting frequent (like, several times a month) flare ups of low grade fever and feverish symptoms (aches, fatigue) along with the ulcers, and severe uveitis that just pops up overnight a few times a year.  It is taken a long time to get a diagnosis, even though my docs have been suspecting Behcet's since the beginning. Right now I am on a high dose of prednisone after a bad uveitis flare up a couple weekends ago (had to get IV steroid infusions too), but I am going to be starting remicade this week. I am hopeful it will supress the eye symptoms and the fevers/ulcer flare ups without the side effects of prednisone. I have had BD for 15 years or so. Blind in my left eye and was hospitalized 6 years ago for clots in my lungs. LPT: If you have Behcet\u2019s, at some point get lung pain, and your doctor diagnoses you with having pneumonia, there is a good possibility it is actually a lung flair and NOT pneumonia. This was the case with me. Instead of taking prednisone like I should have, I took every antibiotic imaginable (which killed my digestive system for years). That is what landed me in the hospital. Improper diagnosis and when left unchecked, my lungs got destroyed and I almost died. \n\nI have never been on one of the biologics. Do you find they have been a big help? What about side effects. I am thinking about becoming more proactive with my treatment. I just hate the hospital now and get high anxiety whenever I have an appointment.   I started Enbrel in 2012/2013, and I think it was the main reason I went into remission for so long. Simponi did not help at all though, so every biologic is different. The main side effect I feel from the Enbrel is fatigue the following day. I just time my weekly shots on a day when I know I can be tired the next day (I.e. injection on a Thursday or Friday). I agree with you about the hospital anxiety. I still feel anxious when I am seeing new doctors, but I try to have regular internal med and rheumatology visits every 3-6 months and those do not cause anxiety for me anymore. \n\nThanks for the tip about the lungs. I had two embolisms during a flare in 2008, which likely had to do with the Behcet\u2019s. It is unfortunate doctors do not have more experience with the disease, because us patients have to go through the run around.  I started azathioprine in 2012 and Enbrel in 2012/2013. I think the Enbrel was the main contributor to my remission. I also have feverish and flu-like symptoms during flares like you. It is so frustrating how long it can take to diagnose the disease. \n\nI hope Remicade can get you off prednisone. I was on prednisone for over a year and it is a nasty drug. I have heard of a lot of people having success with Remicade, so good luck to you! How would you describe your skin ulcers?  Also, ever get any rashes?  I have had a rash on my neck/shoulder chest, breast area for over two months and no one can figure it out.  It is fine sandpaper like and turns red like a sunburn at night, itches some. Cannot figure out if it is something else entirely or another side effect of inflammation.   My skin ulcers are red blotches anywhere from a quarter-inch to an inch+ in diameter. They usually are not raised, but after 3 or 4 days they can become scaly, open up, or pustule, which is very painful. At the beginning, they feel hot and sting, like a bad sunburn. They itch a lot too like a sunburn. I can send you a picture if it would help.  I am being evaluated for Behcet's. Waiting on all the test results and genetic marker to come back. Working with a dermatologist and rheumatologist and seeing an Oral Medicine and eye doc in the next 2 weeks. What will the Oral Med doc determine and help with?\n\n I had 3 flairs of mouth sores and the last one was bad to where lips, tongue, glands, throat, cheeks all swelled and had sores. Unbelievably painful. Could not talk for a month, eat or drink. And like many others, was misdiagnosed 3x, given wrong medicine and those docs were no help. I did a bunch of research and stumbled upon the rare disease forum who pointed me to see a dermatologist. She has been wonderful and was the doc who immediately considered Behcet's. I have never heard of this disease but told by the doc. I am on prednisone and 2 weeks of colchicine.\n\nThanks for offering your experience and help! I am so sorry to hear about your flare ups. Colchicine is supposed to be very helpful for mouth ulcers, so hopefully with time yours will go down. When I have mouth ulcers and it is too painful to eat, I will take a swig of Maalox. The pain does not entirely go away, but it offers a coating on your mouth and throat that at least makes eating easier. Double bonus, it can be helpful if you start experiencing GI problems. I would ask your oral med doc about Magic Mouthwash as well. My dentist prescribed me that for flare ups. It is a lidocaine solution so if totally numbs your mouth, but you need to be careful not to swallow. I hope you start to get your symptoms under control. Behcet\u2019s can be so painful and it can take a long time to find the treatment that works for you. Keep your head up and talk with as many docs as you can! Best wishes.  Thanks! I have Magic Mouthwash and it did not help. Every time I used it, it caused more issues. Maybe something in it I reacted to.\n\nWith the two meds the sores have been slowly disappearing. What I found helped was using 5% lidocaine to at least allow me to drink for minutes at a time.\n\nThank you for your help! I am glad to hear sores have at least been going down. How are you know? Best to you  The sores went away. Tapered down to 20mg and colchicine 1x a day. This week my husband had a heart attack and stress levels went up a bit and a few mouth sores appeared while I was tapering down to 10mg pred. Doc put me back on 20mg for 2 weeks and colchicine 2x a day. He is home now and doing well and the stress level is less so I am hoping it will continue to get better as I can sleep and rest up again.\n\nI see eye doc tomorrow and get the rheumatologists results Thursday. Still waiting on the immunofluorescent test from the derm.\n\nThank you for asking. Im having a genital ulcer for 2 months now..diagnosed and tested for STD but all came negative..took strong antivirals and antibiotics, but nothing seem to work..im taking now a topical cream called Furicin.. \n\nso my doctors thinking that i might have a bechets syndrome..in the last 2 years i was diagnosed with Vasculitis..then never came back..\n\nLet me ask if how long does it take you to heal your genital ulcers?\nPlease reply.. im in a great depression/stress right now if this is going to heal.. I am sorry to hear about your ulcers. When I have ulcers, my doctors immediately put me on prednisone and my ulcers can still take about two weeks to heal. I would ask your doctors about getting a prednisone shot then orally taking prednisone for a few weeks to taper off. I also use lidocaine jelly (2%) before using the rest room to help with pain. The jelly is easily prescribed from any doctor as well (usually only creams are offered OTC, and you definitely do not want to be applying cream on those areas). Hope this helps and keep your chin up! It will get better, just be proactive with your doctors.  By the way im still not sure if i have a bechets..but based on my own symtoms im diagnosting myslef as a patient of bechets..by the way my Genital is really tiny..tiny but it wont heal..looks like hsv on first glance..but it isnt..i dont we dont have a test for bechets syndrome here in PH..how did you find out you have bechets?can you describe me what your genital ulcer looks like?maybe a direct message would help?thanks for the reply..i really appreciate it because im at lost now and really needed help..", "What do you eat while flaring? Please get out of here with that autoimmune BS diet, that is not that point of this post. \n\nWhat are you physically able to eat while flaring?\n\nI had a pause in flares due to steroids and I woke up yesterday with the next round of oral ulcers starting and today I have about a dozen and a half. Tomorrow I will probably be over two dozen. \n\nWhat do you guys eat? I have never really found much I can eat, so on top of being in pain with a bloody mouth, I get hangry. My go-to is usually rice with a load of butter because that is about all I can handle. \n\nWhat makes you feel full when you have a hard time eating? I know it is going to be unpleasant no matter what because there are literally holes in my mouth, but it would be cool if I could find something that has a little more substance to it!\n\nThank you! \n\n(Would prefer if only people diagnosed with biopsies and/or on meds respond -- nothing personal, I just find in a lot of posts here that people think one or two mouth sores is Behcet's and as many of us know, one or two does not even register with us!)", "How are your teeth? I have about 5-15 sores in my mouth every day, and this has been going on for 20 years.\nTry as I might I just cannot keep up a healthy dental routine. Sores on my gums have led to receding gums and I swear my teeth have shifted.\nI decided to make an appointment with my dentist to see what it would take to have a healthy smile. Aside from having my palate widened I will need to look into implants or dentures or god knows what to keep me going.\n\nHas your teeth taken a beating because of Behcets? That sounds like hell. I have never had double digits, but the edges of my tongue that are in contact with my teeth were in constant pain and it would be really hard to brush. \n\nMy dad who had similar symptoms told me drinking green tea really helped him and it worked for me. We drink this particular brand everyday:  \n\nGood luck my friend I recommend this so often I sound like a drug rep...but have you heard of otezla? It is the only FDA approved drug to treat oral ulcers from behcets. My oral ulcers went from constant and numerous like you, to one or 2 a month total. \n\nAlso, cbd oil seemed to work well for my oral ulcers, but not for ulcers or skin inflammation anywhere else. I have heard about this drug. I currently do not have insurance so a prescription of Otezla would cost me $1,900. Insane!\nHopefully it is something I can afford once I get back on insurance. I will definitely start chugging that green tea! Thank you! Oof yeah my mouth used to be like this. Started taking humira about 2 years ago and do not get canker sores anymore unless I miss a dose. My gums have gotten better but teeth are still very misaligned. Yes the price is f-ing insane.  I was told $1500 after co-pay, $4K with no insurance. That makes me so mad. You have a couple options though. \n\nMy rheumatologist gave me free samples for something like 8 months. At my checkup (every couple months), he would hand me a bag full of the free sample starter packs the drug reps give to the doctors. I know all doctors are not that awesome, but it would not hurt to ask. \n\nAlso, otezla has a zero co-pay program. I have been on that for a few months now. Aside from a some kind of hiccup which caused them to try to charge me one month, it is worked perfectly and has been completely free. Every month I do a short phone or online survey about my symptoms, and they deliver the med to my door, all for free. Either ask your doctor for the info about this, or just go to otezla\u2019s website. I think you can sign up there too.\n\nEdit to add: you probably have to have a prescription from your doctor before you can sign up for the free co-pay thing. So talk to your doc first. This is great info! Thank you! I will look into Humira. Thanks!  I hope it works out for you. Let me know how it goes! I am 27 now and I have been getting mouth ulcers (up to dozens at a time) from Behcet's for as long as I can remember. Was finally diagnosed about 6 years ago. But growing up, my mouth hurt so bad that I had a lot of trouble brushing my teeth properly, resulting in a lot of dental issues. I have had too many cavities to count and at least 5+ root canals. This disease really set me up for what seems like a lifetime of dental problems. I am actually going to the dentist next week to start getting some work done now that I have sorted out my insurance and my Behcet's is for the most part in remission thanks to Humira. I feel your pain and truly wish you the best of luck! I took Otezla for years, but had to stop a couple years ago because of GI problems. At the time I was so hopeless and it changed my life! My ulcers were not controlled by colchicine and imuran and the long term prednisone use was horrible. Otezla let me go off all other meds including prednisone and now I do not take it anymore and I am definitely in remission. For Otezla my doctor enrolled me in the compassionate use program directly with the Otezla manufacturer and I received it for free for years and had an RN through the program as a case manager. This may be late for this but for anyone else who may find this later. What worked for my mouth ulcers is propolis extract. I do not think it decreases the frequency of mouth ulcers but it treats them miraculously for me. It takes a day or two to completely treat them. If used when the ulcers are onsetting, it is more effective and stops them before they are formed. Also take excess vitamin C, i use 3000-5000mg vitamin c daily which helps me with symptoms. Best of luck, you are not aline, we are not alone. \n\n Thank you for this!", "Feverishness and mood swings, allergic to all foods, ear issues? Genetic testing? Recommendations for specialist? Hi folks,\n\nLike many of you, I have been to many doctors struggling for a diagnosis. I have one Rheum who thinks Behcets and wanted to start injections and drugs, and other doctors who look at my bloodwork and say I am 'normal' (Despite ANA being 1:160 and despite Behcets not having bio-indicators/blood indicators)\n\nSymptoms are massive bouts of oral canker sores for 3 or so years (have died down with the use of oral steroid Dexamethasone), persistent sore/inflamed throat and varies in intensity and does not respond to medication or steroids, ocular hypertension (increased eye pressure, 27 left eye, 25 in right), constant ear fullness and discharge/otis media after eating most foods and especially in the morning, crunching of the ear with ear movement, chronic fatigue/low energy, low body temperature (96-97 F), mood swings, and chills without fever, and what was similar looking to a erythema nodosum where my shin meets the foot, terrible memory/retention, terrible focus. Negative prick test. Negative allergy tests. All other bloodwork within normal ranges. HSV/Herpes simplex 1 &amp; 2 negative by IGG/IGM and western blot. EBV/Ebstein-barr positive a few years ago with high titers.\n\nThis has destroyed me physically, mentally, and emotionally. I used to be a strong individual with few fears. I have become a caustic, negative, anxiety-ridden overanalyzing mess. I push people away with the neediness that stems from that. I find myself using faux-arrogance and crude humor to cover up all the bullshit going on.\n\nI have points where I am close to my older self, upswings, where my creativity flourishes, I am inquisitive, and ready to tackle the world, and explore, and try things, and meet people, LISTEN to what they have to say, be present in the moment. I LOVE THAT PERSON - but he has not been around in a while. I want to live in the present/live in the moment again.\n\nDoes any of this sound similar to what you guys are experiencing? I am so lost and do not really have anywhere to turn.\n\nHave any of you found a specialist on the West Coast (US) that I might be able to fly to and review findings with?\n\nHave any of you looked at genetic testing for this? I have read that people in the US do not typically do not show markers.\n\nThanks,\n\nnnh Fuck. Now my vision is blurred and my eyes hurt and are red :((", "Prednisolone, PRP or kortizon injection? Hi everyone,\n\nDo you use prednisolone regularly or when needed only? I am not sure if it is better to use it all the time despite its side effects. I am having a very stubborn tendinitis in my achilles tendon at the moment and considering regularly using it. I use prednisolone only if I have mouth or genital ulcers since I do not want to get depressed or gain weight.\n\nI am 29F. My symptoms started around the age of 8 when I was having extremely stressful times. My knees were swollen if I do not keep my legs straight. I was frequently having mouth ulcers as well. \n\nAt the age of 16, I had genital ulcers, like 10 of them at the same time, each the size of an hazel nut. Were very painful, I remember crying from the pain every time I had to pee. My mom took me to a gynaecologist. This gynaecologist thought it was an STD. Told me to let my \"boyfriend\" know so he would go to the doctor as well, in front of my family. I told them I was a virgin and never had a boyfriend. Nobody believed me. By that time I was living in my home country, where the virginity is very very important. They (my family and this gynaecologist) put me through virginity test. She saw that I was a virgin. Then she told my family the hymen is intact, but still this is transmitted sexually. These were horrible times. \n\nI moved out from my family's house when I was 17. Moved out of the country when I was 22. Here where I live atm, I have a reumatologist in the public hospital. Time to time I get joint inflammations on the knees or ankles and kortizon injections to them. However, this ankle joint has not been improved for a year now. I was suggested PRP but it is so expensive and I do not know if it works. Any suggestion is appreciated.\n\nThank you.", "How to get the help I need - misdiagnosis? So I do not know if I have behcets.  I think it is very possible, but my rheumatologist said no, because I am not middle eastern.  That was her ruling.  My PCP said it was likely, and my GI does not have an opinion nor care much about anything.  \n\nI was diagnosed with Ulcerative Proctitis in 2010 (means inflammation was only in rectum).  For last 7 years my symptoms have always changed each flare I get.  Making it hard to deal with. No drugs have worked for me except remicaid (had to stop because I got shingles in my eye)  which for mild colitis is a bit overkill. My colitis symptoms have been blood and mucus in my stool, no diarrhea, no weight loss, minimal abdominal cramping (none nowadays).  Urgency and frequency increased due to the mucus. But normal stools.  \n\nIt was later changed to Crohn's because I got fistulas and abcesses and other \"complications\" like mouth ulcers.  I have had mouth ulcers since I was very young.  I get on average 5-8 at a time, on bad days I get 30.  When old one heals I get new ones so I can have them for a month or longer.  Mostly on my tongue (tip and sides) or near my tonsils.  I had many cases of tonsillitis in my 20's prior to my colitis diagnosis, I think it was 5-7 cases, one or two a year.\n\nSo my mild Crohn's, still only the rectum area, causes such severe secondary issues.  I have erythema nodosum, 3rd flare in 4 years.  I get it sometimes when my Crohn's is not flaring. This time it is so bad I cannot walk anymore.  I think I have 30-40 nodes over my feet, ankles and legs. I now have arthritis too, in ankles feet knees and severe swelling in ankles. I have been bed ridden for 6 months now because of these secondary issues.  These issues are new to me in my 7 years of Crohn's diagnosis and they still say my Crohn's is mild.  I am trying new drugs entivyo but if it is not Crohn's it will not work.  I also get skin lessons (like deep cystic acne that hurt and scar and take months to a year to heal - on my legs, arms and back, so not normal acne places). \nI recently noticed sores on my vagina, which I do not know are pimps or something else.  They are red spots and come and go, they hurt and sting when touched. \n\nI know behcets can cause Crohn's like symptoms so I am wondering if they got my diagnosis wrong and if so how/who do I go to get to listen?  Dermatologist? Second opinion from a rheumatologist? Anyone else ever have a fistula with their behcets?  I just cannot help think that this is why I do not respond to medication, because we are trying the wrong ones and want someone to rule it out for good reasons not because it is rare or I am not the right race. Ugh. Hi! I am going to write you a looong reply tomorrow, because I am about to fall asleep. But, in the meantime: 1) your rheumatologist is a bologna sandwich\u2013 unfortunately, the vast majority are when it comes to Behcet's. Behcet's is well documented in populations with negligible to no middle eastern ancestry. It was first described in Turkey, nicknamed the \"Silk Route Disease\" for a while, and somehow those associations became the only thing med schools teach about Behcet's. Tomorrow I will add links to some of the many epidemiological studies that show the prevalence of Behcet's in people of European (and other non-Middle Eastern) descent.  Oh, and so I can link you to better resources and doctor recommendations, what is your location?  Cannot speak on what else you may have, but you definitely have behcets. Mouth and genital ulcers, en and skin lesions, multiple cases of tonsillitis etc you sound EXACTLY like me. Find a new rheumatologist, yours is an idiot for telling you no because you are not middle eastern, I am a half German half Italian blonde haired green eyed fair skinned girl and I have behcets lol  Ok, that makes me feel better (sorta, not that I want behcets, but that someone has something like me).  In Crohn's world I feel alone with my severe joint pain and EN, since it rules my life, not bowel issues.  I dont connect with people and their symptoms and  feel like mines such an off case and that is just how I am. \n\nDo you also have any bowel issues such as blood it mucus? And this might be TMI, but what do your genital ulcers look like?  My SO described mine as small red dots, which do not sound like ulcers, but zits do not come and go this way. I tried googling images to compare, but a lot of misinformation out there.\n\nIs your EN and joint pain bad?  I hate it, it rules everything for me right now. Walking out now f bed to the bathroom makes me cry sometimes.  I am in Colorado (US). I am mostly northern European decent, female.  I find a lot if my doctors are bogus when it comes to my issues.  I have been directing my meds for sometime now because they are to lazy to read about EN.  Ive diagnosed my own EN and they at least admitted to not knowing what it was and googling it in their office.  She confirmed with pictures.  I would hoped they do a tissue biopsy to be sure because it is uncomfortable suggesting to your doctor what you have and them just going with it. I at least got the to give me colchicine for it, but not seeing any improvement yet.  I have had multiple endoscopies and colonoscopies and they found some mild colitis and general inflammation in my GI tract, yes I experience GI issues from pain, diarrhea, mucus and blood and just sensitivity, it can be a symptom of behcets to have GI distress and behcets often causes issues similar to other autoimmune conditions without having that full blown condition!\n\nMy genital ulcers sound just like yours, the first time I got one I thought there was no way it was an ulcer because it did not look like much of anything other than a red mark but it was excruciating!\nI get them about every other month, either on my vulva or like right in my butt crack(LOL) and they just look like a little bright red dot that stings if you touch it, they do not usually get too big or get any white/grey like my mouth ones, I usually only know they are there because I will move a certain way and get a shooting pain down there lol \n\nEN was my first progression, years ago I got my first en \u201coutbreak\u201d and I woke up with about 50 lumps in my legs and I could not walk because my muscles were so tensed up. Now I get like one or two en lumps on my shins a month, they often just appear as very sensitive mystery bruises now (which is common for en to do) and I get TONS of ulcers and skin lesions on my face almost monthly I will have a big red swollen cheek from an ulcer or just some sort of behcets lump lol\n\nMy joint pain and exhaustion has always been the words for me, the other symptoms I am so used to they hardly bother me they are just normal not but the pain in my hips and legs is horrible and I have excruciating upper back/shoulder pain that I spent years trying to help and it is just my behcets (which is untreated) so there is nothing I can do \nI have had to be carried to the bathroom because it was too painful to walk so I definitely feel you.\n\nI am really 100% sure you have behcets and you have an extremely similar case to mine which unfortunately seems to be mild (no neuro involvement or MAJOR organ issues) but still aggressive. Feel free to ask me anything, I definitely suggest you see a new rheumatologist, I have seen 5 different ones, I even went to NYU to meet with the leading behcets researcher from turkey before he went back to do more research! My rheumatologist now is amazing and she continues to try and give me any possible trial medication she can throw at me in hopes of some relief. \n\n-Ashley  Wow.  It is exactly like you describe.  I get them in my butt crack too, thought that was weird.  Sucks wiping because it is like using sand paper.  I am sad but relieved to hear someone with such similar issues.  I want a better doctor, it is hard finding good ones.  \n\nHave you tried Remicaid? I only suggest it because prior to this new flare I was on it and felt like a normal person.  They will not let me back on it because I had shingles in my eye, which can come back with immunosuppressants. Sadly that could blind me.  \n\nThe fatigue is real.  When I tale Tylenol or Advil or Percocet though it makes me like new (until I walk).  But in bed I feel full of energy lol. I brush my hair and I am exhausted afterwards. I also struggle with fevers on a daily basis.  Probably from inflammation in my joints? They sit around 101-102.  My rheumatologist is just waiting for my GI to get my gastrointestinal inflammation down and said the rest of my stuff will go away when it does.  I have been waiting since September and they said that have to give it 10 more weeks before we try something else.\n\nHow do you pick your doctor's? Do you just pick one and hope for the best? Do you look for something they studied in particular?  &gt;I am sad\n\n( hopefully it will cheer you up :).\n___\n I am a bot. use !unsubscribetosadcat for me to ignore you. I get what you mean, it is really nice to know someone else is out there haha\n\nI have been on remicaide and I did well for about 3 weeks and then all of my symptoms returned for the rest of the 3 or 6 months I was on it (do not remember) \nI also got shingles, on my legs through lol. \nThey took me off it and said it just was not working since none of my symptoms subsided and they could not raise my dose at all because it is dosed by weight/age. \nI have been on remicaide, imuran twice (on it again now to try and help with my uveitis but it is not working) colchicine, steroids, cellcept, plaquenil, methotrexate, lyrica, savella, nucynta, neurontin, celebrex, Percocet, oxcodone, and tramadol and one of them have worked for me lol \n\nFatigue is the worst, sometimes I just cannot get it of bed or stay awake at all, sometimes I wake up feeling great but then an hour later I cannot hold my head up.\nI can barely walk more than like 3 blocks without needing a break and sometimes I will be able to walk around fine but then the next day I cannot move my legs, it is so unpredictable.\n\nWhere are you located? This past January I actually won my disability case so I collect social security and do not work because of my behcets.\n\nI am on the east coast in New Jersey, my first rheumatologist was at the children\u2019s hospital in Pennsylvania when I was like 15, from there I just picked a guy who was close to me and he wound up treating me for about a year before he gave up on me , his office left me a voicemail one day saying \u201cdr.xxx feels he can no longer help you and recommends seeking treatment with someone more familiar with your condition\u201d which led me to my doctor now who works for Cooper university hospital which is a big hospital in this area. \nShe is actually from Lebanon and I believe her profile may have noted behcets experience when I found her, she was recommended by a few different doctors too  Oh wow. You are me. I feel for you. I am in CO near Denver. I will look for one eith behcets experience or maybe with just call around.    Thought I would chime in to mention I am so white I tan under moonlight. Your doctor is working under some very outdated assumptions, I think they may have been proven wrong as late as last century. Yeah. I found a doctor (rheumatologist) here who has behcets listed as one of their specialties so I called for a 2nd opinion today.  Probably will be a month or so before I get the appointment but that is doctors nowadays.  So I was diagnosed with bechets last year. I am a 16 year old white kid and my whole family is from Northern Europe. However when I got the DNA test the marker came back positive. I personally suggest asking your rheumatologist yo perform a DNA test. I was misdiagnosed for several months as just have really bad staph. I hope this helps. What is the DNA marker they test for? I was told there was just the needle prick test and that it is not really reliable.   I just wanted to chime in and say that while I have not been diagnosed (besides being told I have some kind of arthritis, vaginal lesions, digestive lesions not consistent with Crohn's, erythema nodosom, and a litany of autoimmune complaints) my take away is that it is more important to get treated than diagnosed. Keep pushing to try all the biologics available and hope one works. As far as I can tell very little about the immune system/ autoimmune illnesses is actually understood in a way that makes diagnosis meaningful. This is true. As far as I know I am already being treated in a similar manner, as I am on colchicine, sulfasalazine.  I guess for me it is just finding a doctor I can trust to listen and not let their ego in the way of treatment. If they would admit that it was a possibility and that it did not matter because we would treat them the same, then I would be more willing to go with that.  It is her lack of care or consideration that makes me upset. I have called some new doctors at least and see if they agree with my course of treatment regardless. That is great news! Good luck! The genetic marker is called HLA-B51. Unfortunately, most Behcet's patients of European descent do *not* test positive (and still have Behcet's). The diagnosis is always clinical (based on observation and history of symptoms). Lab tests, like biopsies of lesions or ulcers, can support the diagnosis. The pathergy (skin prick) test is indeed unreliable\u2013 for example, mine was negative at the time I was diagnosed, but years later became positive. The most widely used diagnostic criteria is described here: ( So, recurrent oral ulceration + two or more additional symptoms. Note, however, that this list is far from comprehensive, and a good rheumatologist will consider all available evidence. In my case, that evidence included extensive GI ulceration, arthritis, high fevers, migraines, seizures, biopsies of GI and genital ulcers showing vasculitis, and the exclusion of viral/infectious causes for my symptoms. I was \"lucky\" insofar as I needed to be hospitalized for almost a month for my first severe flare up, and that led to a faster diagnosis than what most BD patients go through. It is much improved with the advent of patient support networks, though. \n\nFeel free to send me a message if you want to chat more about the diagnostic process, treatments, doctors, etc. I used to admin for a large BD support group, and can probably connect you to other patients near Denver. I so understand the frustration of doctors who will not listen. Especially when they clearly do not understand your illness. \n\nI hope you find a good drug therapy soon! Yeah I went into the hospital cause I would had these massive quarter sized ulcers all over my inner thighs and they were not healing so the doctor asked if I had a history of mouth sores(long as I can remember) she did some research and told me I might have bechets so they were going to draw some blood and do some lab work. Pretty much every marker was positive so they called and told me I had behcets. Basically my advice is just to get the lab work done cause it might help get you a clearer diagnosis. Thank you. After much reading and all the chat with everyone here, and many odd pics of my privates (that was an odd conversation to ask of my SO lol).  I have determined they are definitely genital ulcers, and I likely have behcets.  I am hoping this disabling arthritis/EN flare will go away soon (6months so far). I think about going to the hospital sometimes due to pain, high fevers and bad swelling, but I always think they will not know what to do for me and they will just send me on my way. \n\nI might take you up on that offer for support near Denver, at least maybe after my new rheumatologist appointment.  I really hope the appointment goes well! If not (or either way), you can try searching the doctor registry on the American Behcet's Disease Association's website, ( It looks like there is a rheumatologist named Dr. Huang listed in Denver. If you have not come across it yet, GI inflammation and ulcers can also be caused by Behcet's, and can be misdiagnosed as Crohns/UC. A biopsy can usually distinguish between the two, but not always. I also get chronic fevers from BD, as well as arthritis and EN. Even with a solid diagnosis, I am also reluctant to go to the ER for bad flares\u2013 but if your fevers persist and pain is unmanageable, it is sometimes worth the hassle. Remicade worked wonders for me, but as you have experienced, the side effects and complications can be unmanageable. Not that you are there quite yet, but be aware that it can be dangerous to re-start Remicade after you have been off it for a while, because you may have developed antibodies to the drug (this happened to me, and resulted in cardiac problems). There are a lot of other drugs that can work, however. Feel free to ask for suggestions to research/bring up to the rheumatologist. Good luck with your appointment!  Thanks, I was wondering if there were registries like that!  I did not see his name in my search.  I basically have a fever everyday now, it sucks.  Life is pretty hard right now due to the extreme pain.  Unfortunately I have stopped and started remicaid twice already, so hoping it will still be good for me.  Or at least another drug will. \n\nI had a shit day yesterday and feel like I am slowly becoming paralyzed.  Had so much trouble getting up stairs, not just because of pain, but more so I did not have the strength to keep going. It was rough.   I would also be interested in any recommendations in Colorado I only found two docs that had experience with behcets in Denver.  There may be more, I just went with those two.  \n\nDr. Stephen Murphy at Denver Arthritis Clinic.  I did not have the best experience with him, as he basically just told me to go back to my GI and other rheumatologist, but I am struggling to get people to look past my initial Crohn's diagnosis.  It is frustrating still, I even pointed out that my colonoscopy does not have the hallmark shape/markings for Crohn's as my GI said.  My other doctors also \"forgot\" to send my labs to this guy, so he said he had nothing to go off of till then and was not interested in seeing my pictures of my genital ulcers, mouth ulcers, leg swelling and nodes.  So he may or may not be a good recommendation... \n\nThe other was a lady at National Jewish Health.  Did not go see her.\n\nI gave up getting someone to listen because my GI started to agree with me and is on board with treating me how I see fit. Also, my symptoms magically went away one day, but are now coming back.  Got about 6weeks symptom free (no drugs worked).   He wants me to try Stelara for now, but I can switch to anything else as I choose.  I have a standing order of colchicine at least, which supposedly helps behcets and seems to help me. \n\nGood luck.  Also, I found getting drugs covered under a Crohn's diagnosis is easier than a behcets so I am not eager to switch it. At least that is what I was warned of online by internet strangers...who knows I could have both (fml).   I know I am necroing this pretty bad, but I am undergoing a similar experience right now. I am white as white gets, with mostly UK ancestry, and I have been dealing with an especially 'difficult' case of 'Crohn's' for 17 years. I have had symptoms that go above and beyond Crohn's, resistance to meds that work for most people, confused doctors that either gave up on me or told me to my face I was lying about my symptoms, 8 major surgeries and complications due to some of them, and more. I have had just about every symptom of Behcets possible, and I went to a rheumatologist and she told me it is a very big possibility that I had behcets and not Crohn's this whole time. I am going to see a specialist at NYU soon, so hopefully I will get a final word there, but after 3 near death experiences, PTSD, chronic pain for 6 years, and having my life basically put on hold indefinitely, it would be nice to know what the real problem is for once.\nAnyway, I hope your case turned out in a way that could help you. I know what you have been through, and I sincerely hope it gets better for you. I glad to hear that!  They said because I do not have eye involvement they will not consider it behcets, so that is that for me.  I am glad I do not have eye involvement, but 8 months later I have tried, Humira, Entivyio and now onto Stellara and none seem to be working so far.  Only thing that ever worked was Remicaid and I cannot take it. I did get a second opinion, but he did not care to see any of my labs, pictures or previous medical records, he just said he would go with the opinions I already got... so l'm just putting it on hold for now and hoping things get better b/c yes, our lives get put on hold.  My pain is coming back in my tendons and I am just hoping it does not get as bad.  Let me know of the specialist you see in NY, maybe I will consider it sometime. Its doctor Yazici at NYU. You should not stop, keep looking. A good doctor should never just accept the opinions of other. That is just pure laziness. The fact that he didnt listen to you or review your history is a MAJOR red flag. Also, just because you do not have eye involvement now does not mean you will not. ", "Must Read: Dietary and Nondietary Triggers of Oral Ulcer Recurrences in Beh\u00e7et's Disease  I never found any triggers.

Hi,\n\nSymptoms without pain?\n\nFor the last 3 years I have been having many symptoms which I thought all was linked to each other and they maybe are as my neurologist has referred me to a reumatologist because she suspects behcets. \n\nAt the moment I have 5 mouth ulcers but did know until I looked with my phones flash light. But I do not feel any pain?\n\nFor 3-4 years I have been having slight red skin on small patches on my penis, not ulcer but just red skin sometimes burning feeling. Everywhere I am looking for informations is about painful sores, only 1 of 10 doctors that I saw could confirm unspecific balanit so discrete is redness.\n\nJoint pain, muscle pain that comes and goes, can not lock right knee. Stiff hip. \n\nLast year weakness of right leg and hand. I think I see muscle waste also of palm hand and right foot.\n\nThis summer I have neurological symtoms twitching, restleg syndrome, numbness feeling face and leg.

Been 2.5 months we neurological symptoms and I feel the urgency to get dx.\n\nMy questions is does anybody else have ulcers without pain? \n\nHave anybody here had neurological symptoms?\n\nTake care What else has your neuro run other than an MRI? Sometimes my sores are not painful. \n\nIs tomorrow your first rheumatologist appointment? See if prednisone helps. \n\nI suspected MS. I was actually having seizures Yes it is my first appointment. \n\nForgot to mention that I am born in Sweden but my parents are from Turkey have not got any result of gene result. \n\nI also have constant bladder urgency. Hi, \n\nI am still figuring out if I have Behcets, but I have some similar symptoms like the foot drop and neurological symptoms. I have had a B12 deficiency for sometime and it can cause neurological problems. You should ask your doctor to test your B12, especially if you do not eat a lot of animal products (B12 comes only from animal products). You can start to take B12 tablets even now and see if it helps you. This just got much worse, I have tried not to panic about my sons health but he just got another symptom. \n\nMy son who is 4.5 years old have same initial symtoms. Unexplained fever twice, complaining of stomach hurt and regular apthosis, red rash on penis shaft and today I saw the last symptom erythema nodosum on his legs. \n\nAnybody here who has it in the family? I am in panic mode..", "Does anyone else here have such intense flares that they need to be hospitalized for pain management and IV steroids?  Thankfully no. Well at least not yet. I was almost hospitalized twice back before I was officially diagnosed+treated. Not a fun time - thankfully I respond well to oral corticosteroids. I have had to be hospitalized twice, each time for about a week. I guess I am just confused, because it seems like everyone else is pretty well-managed on an outpatient basis. \ud83d\ude14 I have. I am on a good regiment at the moment but I ended up on a solid gram a day for three days IV. Steroids suck but their efficacy does not. Ugh, you poor thing. Hope you are feeling better! BD is a highly variable disease and this community is pretty small - so do not get too worried about that. \n\nTypically it is all about finding the right drug dosage or drug combo at first - which can be difficult, especially if your rheumatologist/doctor is less than open to such ideas. Then it is about cutting out triggers - for me it was strenuous exercise, alcohol, high fat meals, and caffeine. Over time you should be able to slowly reintroduce those triggers as everything is managed, but it can take a while. \n\nBut there are also folks who do everything right and still get knocked out by a bad flare. It is a constant struggle against this disease, but thankfully medical science is catching up on being able to treat it faster than I expected. You are totally right, and my logical mind knows these things. I think I just get discouraged sometimes. I appreciate you and your insight very much! Thankfully, that was a few years ago. I am on monthly IVIG so I get two doses of IV steroids with that each month. That summer after the high dose steroids sucked for sure. I was sent home on an 80mg taper! I love that steroids saved my life, so I try not to complain too much. Still, if love to avoid the high dose ones again. I had to have my blood sugars checked and everything because the steroids caused high sugar levels. I was hospitalized twice for 3 weeks each time over an 8 week period. Mouth sores so bad I could not eat and lost 30 lbs. it was while I was being diagnosed, 2 rounds of IV steroids. I tried a ton of stuff, Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, AZA, Mycophenalate, etc. Now I am on Renflexis, biosimilar to Infliximab and it seems to be doing the job. Good luck. Thank you! So glad to hear you are feeling better! I was once, before I was diagnosed, at the ER for  intense chest pain which they diagnosed as pleurisy but has been recurrent all throughout my adult life and I attribute it to BD.\n\nBut my last bad flare, I managed on my own at home and realised after a few days that I SHOULD have been hospitalized for IV steroids because it was so horrible to deal with at home, still trying to be brave for my kids etc.. I NEEDED about 5 days of total rest, a catheter and pumping full of steroids without worrying about anything else. I have since told my doctor that if I ever get that bad again I will definitely be asking for hospitalization. \n\n100% think it is necessary for real healing... that flare cost me almost 6 weeks of my life when I think I would have recovered much faster if I would had the help. I am hospitalized now; I have been here for the past 4 days. I have neuro-behcets and currently have  neuro symptoms that are currently not responding to anything. I am on Remicade, methotrexate, and prednisone. So far I have had a cocktail of neuro medicines thrown at me and my prednisone has been brought up to 60mg. Though neurology is trying to get rhuematology to raise it to it to 1000mg for 3 days but rhuemy does not feel it is rhuemy related. So, I am frustrated, but used to this game. \n\nI am getting a lumbar puncture today which will hopefully prove to rhuemy that I need the high dose steroids so I can get out of here. Sounds awful and I am sorry to hear about your difficult time. I wish you speedy and full recovery! Ohhhh, I have had extreme chest pain for a month, also went to the ER for it... they said it was bronchospasms but it has not gone away in like 5-6 weeks so far. Did they give you meds for it? When mine gets bad I have to take prednisone.. Only once 3 years back till now, now I use tab betnosol 1mg crushed with glycerine and apply it to ulcers for 2-3 days iff sores are troubling me much. Yup prednisone. Did not help.", "Wrist pain After months that my behcet\u2019s symptoms were completely gone, Now i woke up with my left wrist hurting So Bad when i move it.

It can be caused bu behcet\u2019s or is just in my head? Yep, I get pain in my hands, wrists, and knees with flares. It is a known symptom, but typical immunosuppressive treatments help resolve it pretty quickly. \n\n_Many people with Beh\u00e7et's disease have joint pain and swelling, usually in the knees, ankles and wrists. The joints can be stiff and painful for several weeks at a time. But the disease usually does not cause long-term joint damage or deformity._ ( I agree with /u/JetSetKyle. Behcet's absolutely can cause joint pain. If it bends, I have had pain in it: fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, and more. For mild-to-moderate pain, I usually find that ibuprofen (somewhere between 4-800 mg depending on the severity) knocks the pain down enough that I can function. For me, it usually resolves on its own after a few days or weeks. But if the pain and swelling get worse or do not go away after a while, I would talk to your doctor. Maybe talk to him/her anyway if this is the first time you have experienced this. Best of luck. Be well! Yes random joint pain with Behcets, including wrists for me.

Doctors have been dismissive, condescending, patronizing. I was sent to mental health over and over again. Then they found the brain tumor... But they said, oh no, it is not the cause of all your symptoms, that is still mental health... I told them where they could stick their opinions. I kept chasing testing,  diagnostics, etc... Then I started testing positive for random rare subtropical bacterial infections. Tests that were supposed to have a specificity of over 96% but I got a false positive. The doctor tried to tell me \"well that can happen\" and I said 4x in a row? So I stated looking into how you could get such a false positive and it mentioned a few autoimmune disseases. I would already treated negative for all of them, but behcet's had no test. So I started reading up on it, the oral ulcers, the skin lesions... That is totally me. So I brought it up with the doctors. \"it is just too rare\" they said. So I did my own pathergy test before my rheumatology appointment. The doctor wad trying to tell me why I could not have it. I showed him the lesions in my mouth, on my skin, on my balls and then he said \"well, maybe we could try a pathergy test...\" so I pulled up my sleeve. \"Oh...\" he said... But I did not think I had just behcet's. I thought I had neuro behcet's. But he said it was so rare, he would never even seen it before and he was a behcet's specialist. He said I should have lesions on my brain stem and I did not. I asked \"well, if you have never seen it before, radiology probably has not either. How do you know they did not miss it?\" and he just kind of chuckled because he thought I was being silly. I went home, put in official requests for my prior MRIs and got to work watching YouTube videos on how to read MRI scans and installing MRI software. The discs arrived a few days later and I spent a Friday night pouring over the scans. It took 3 hours. I wrote down all of my symptoms, then the cranial nerves that would need to be damaged to cause those symptoms. Then I scrolled to that spot on the MRI and bingo, little white dot. So then I looked at the radiological diagnostic criteria for neuro behcet's and verified that the lesion I found met those criteria. A week later I was in the rheumatologists office, showing him what is found. He just could not believe I might have found something a radiologist missed, but he agreed to order a new MRI to calm me down. I went in for the MRI and tried to get the tech to tell the radiologist where to look but she said she was not allowed to do that. So after the scan she was walking me out, I just spotted following her and walked into the radiologist office. \"my abducens nerve. The left side. There is a lesion there that I think they missed on my lady scan. Look there. She laughed \"Ok, well check it out\"\n\nA week later I got the results. Lesion on the abducens nerve confirmed. It was also confirmed on the last scan that they would missed it and it had grown since then. She said that given my symptoms it was likely neuro behcet's. Then the rheumatologist asked **me** what I wanted to do. I said \"I want methotrexate, now.\" he said \"OK\" and wrote the script. \n\nAbsolutely ridiculous. I thought I might be going crazy but I saw this story in a Facebook group I am a part of and I am really glad you got the answers you wanted! It is scary to be our own advocate sometimes. Its something I really struggle with. \n\nHave you asked your doctor about taking a biologic medicine? I noticed a big difference in my Behcets symptoms. I was going to write a long reply detailing my similar experience, but it is bringing up a lot of feelings and kind of bumming me out.\n\n\nSo instead just want to say good job and I hope things get easier for you from here. I hope you get taken seriously and get the care you need. Lots of love. Wow, I hope you see a different rheumatologist.  This guy sounds like a jerk.  Mine is fantastic, I had a diagnosis within a few months. I know I am one of the lucky few. I hope things get better for you. He is already brought it up. I am on methotrexate now which is part of the path to that. If this does not work in the next couple of months we will try something like that. I never took methotrexate, just straight to Humira. I think I can notice a difference personally, and I think people have less side effects on something like Humira. But that is just my understanding I cannot believe it took 10 years for your diagnosis. I am so sorry and I cannot begin to imagine your frustrations. I also have NBD. I am relatively new; my symtoms manifested almost 1 year ago and luckily my diagnosis was relatively quick (&lt;1 month). Stay strong and let me know if you want to talk! Fuck.

Personally, it took 11 years. I present symptoms since a few weeks after my birth, having crisis almost every month for 7 years and being medicated antibiotics. I was only diagnosed at September 2017 (11 years old) after a week hospitalized with a genital ulcer of 1,5\u00d73 centimeters of size. Well... I started having symptoms at 14 years old. I was misdiagnosed with disease after disease. Mono?, Celiac, Crohns, Endometriosis. I just kept getting worse over the years. Finally, at 38 years old. after some complications with stroke like symptoms , I was diagnosed with BD. I started meds and it changed my life. It is been a long journey. Being diagnosed brought me a lot of closure. Like...under 4 months honestly. I guess I got \u201clucky\u201d and the first symptom I had was uveitis. I have always had mouth ulcers but they did not get awful until the uveitis started. Mine started from toddlerhood, diagnosed at 8. Also misdiagnosed previously with mono, several times. Things were pretty up in the air until my pediatrician hit the nail on the head. Wow, I had no idea you can get this as a child! Personally, symptoms started at 23, and formally diagnosed 3-4 years later. \nI am 40 now. I have had canker sores / oral ulcers as long as I can remember. Genital ulcers from around 15yo or so. First MAJOR OMG I AM DYING SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH MY BODY symptoms around 35. Behcets diagnoses at 38.\n\nSo uh, 20 years or so? Symptoms started when I was 26, but was just now diagnosed at 28 - so two years from disease start to diagnosis. I had roughly 10 flares during that time period, with every other flare progressively adding classical Behcet's Disease symptoms. \n\nThe interesting part was how often I was bounced around the medical system (context: I am in the USA, and am lucky to have great medical insurance). I started with my Primary Care Physician, who refused to refer me out, but rather said my symptoms were caused by stress - she gave me the run-around for about 6 months. I then self-referred to a local Infectious Disease doctor - trying to rule out the Herpes-family viruses + anything else - it took 4 months of waiting to get in to see her. The Infectious Disease doctor ran tests, ruled out a bunch of stuff, then referred out to rheumatology - but this meant another 3 month wait.  The first Rheum could not figure it out, so he referred me out to another, more specialized Rheum - that was another 4 months of waiting. Finally this Rheum was able to diagnose and start treatment, which has worked amazing so far. \n\nMy mom has been complaining about similar symptoms for nearly a decade. She just got referred out to a Rheum because of my diagnosis, but again, it is a 4 month wait to see a doctor. She lives in a much larger city, but has the same issue with the medical system. 8 years, 15-20 doctors, lots of pain and misery. \n\nI was 18 when I first had symptoms. 32 YEARS!!! But technically, 20 years. My first ulcers were in childhood, age 7/8, the other symptoms did not appear really until my 20s. I have been on the longest medical quest since. Just got a dx a month ago! Age 40. \u201cThey\u201d say it takes an average of 5-20 years for a BD person to get their diagnosis! I guess I am the 20. That is cuz I do not present w genital ulcers and they are now more believe BD exists on a spectrum. That is prob why it took so long, because I misdiagnosed for so many years, these symptoms look like many other things and many of the symptoms over 20 years do not seem connected. But they all were. It is insane.", "Please help, writing this for my 66 year old father. 66, M. \nMy father, a generally active person, has been struggling with mouth sores/ ulcers for the last 5 months. He describes this pain as \u201cturning\u201d one day it is on the left side, one day on the right. His tongue has also become painful. His mouth has white \u201csores\u201d. He had a bad blister on his lip for about two weeks (went away with antibiotics), biopsy came back negative for cancer. Eating has become difficult. Eating anything with salt has become impossible since it burns so bad. No genital ulcers, no vision problems, no neurological problems. He had a rash for a couple of weeks, it sent away with a steroid cream. He went to a gastroenterologist who said she is pretty sure is behcets (waiting for an appointment with a rheumatologist). Please help. I call it \u201ccircling the crops\u201d. \u201cThe turning\u201d is so accurate if a phrase that if your dad had a different diagnosis, i would look into it. I am in the process if re-evaluation, so helps get a counselor, social worker, or medical advocate. It makes a lot of difference. Before, I was not sure if i was making things up. For myself, Prednisone seems to be the only thing to help with flares while they are active. For general care while having a flare what is helped me in the past has been NSAIDS/anti-inflammatory meds and numbing washes / soft foods that do not require the tongue (maybe with a straw if he can handle that?), and definitely plenty of fluids especially if there is no genital ulcers yet. \nPreventatively I am prescribed 75mg Dapsone daily for recurring flares of mostly mouth ulcers and hand lesions, with occasional other ulcers in less savory places. \nBest of luck to your dad, and I hope he gets the care and treatment he needs - He is lucky to have someone like you looking out for him!\n\nEDIT: diagnosed at 17, began having symptoms at 15, currently in my 20\u2019s Agreed! 27F here and was diagnosed around 19 or 20. I was prescribed a low dose of Dapsone daily from ages 12-18, and (I think) 20mg of Prednisone for when I would have bad genital flares. NSAIDs would help general body fatigue and inflammation as well. Best of luck to your father, I am so sorry for the pain he is experiencing. Have you had any other symptoms besides ulcers ? Are you diagnosed with bechets ? My current diagnosis is \u201cComplex Apthosis\u201d. I am currently working on being reevaluated, which is a long process. My insurance requires referrals, so i have to book a series of appointments where each doctor refers me to the next one. It takes months. Doctor\u2019s think I have Bechets, so do I, but no diagnosis yet. I keep hoping i just have a vitamin deficiency or something, but i doubt it. Has anyone prescribed \u201cmagic\u201d mouthwash? It helps when I am in an awful flare. I think it is a 1:1:1 ratio of meds you can gargle and it numbs your mouth and throat. For a while it was the only thing that helped me eat! Personally, I never found any mouth rinses, prescription or otherwise, to help with the pain. Fortunately, I have not had any major open sores (though I still get gum inflammation) in about 15 years.\n\nThat being said, I have heard from dozens of Behcet's patients who swear by Magic Mouthwash. They say it makes a huge difference. So it is definitely something worth checking out. Good suggestion! Yes, and full disclosure I am on remicade and while I still have other symptoms including mouth inflammation, it rarely turns into ulcers so I do not really consider it something I deal with at this time. \n\nWhen I did, the 1:1:1 solution I was prescribed had lidocaine in it which would help me get down a smoothie or something. It was not like 100% better. Straws are really helpful to me. When l had a huge flare and could not eat, drink or talk, we bought a \"Magic Bullet \" blender. I blended up small amounts of everything. Keep it bland.  Protein drinks are helpful too. Thanks for looking after your dad! Also, for me, NSAID's made things much worse! Just FYI. \ud83e\udd2a Brain fog, rheumatoid arthritis, migraines, ulcers on all mucous membranes, hand and foot lesions (occasionally on the body), and minimal kidney issues, cannot think of anything else off the top of my head because luckily I have not had a flare of worse symptoms in a while!\nI also developed POTS but my rhumetologist and I have not yet figured out if that is a Beh\u00e7et\u2019s based issue I have been diagnosed with behcet a few years ago, and I realized that my symptoms (mainly sores) were correlated to what I ate. Your dad should avoid inflammatory foods, such as sugar, fat, and any processed food. I would also strongly suggest that he avoids cheese, since for me, eating some would always lead to sores the day after, despite my daily medicines.", "Has anyone gotten paid to donate blood or plasma for Behcet's/autoimmune research? I was referred recently to a plasma donation facility near me that pays $185 for each donation of plasma from people with certain autoimmune diseases.  I looked through their website and applied to see if Behcet's is something they are interested in and will hear back next week.  Does anyone know any organizations that are seeking out plasma or blood donations from Behcet's patients? That is really interesting! I always wondered if we could donate blood with Behcet\u2019s", "Does anyone experience symptoms of genital ulcers the same time every year?  I flare up every holiday season, but I am pretty sure its just because I eat a bunch of sweets around this time of year. It is been almost to the day the last three years for me. Wow! I do!  Also right before my period It happens to me every January It is like BD is saying 'Happy New Year' in its own special way! Lol Mine was 100% linked to my cycle. Now that I have an IUD, my ulcers have decreased exponentially. Between that and Imuran, genital ulcers only happen a couple times per year I usually do around the holidays, too, but I think it is from the extra stress.", "How does one actually get diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s? My husband has been having flare-ups of mouth ulcers that we used to think were HSV, only to have a negative culture. When we visited a gastroenterologist, he suggested Beh\u00e7et\u2019s and referred us to a rheumatologist. \n\nMy husband gets mouth ulcers all over his mouth, and now in his throat and nose. Swallowing is so painful he is hardly eating and drinking and had to get IV fluids last night. The first two times it happened, it was contained to the mouth. But now he has odd sores on his wrist, elbow, knee, hands, etc. The sores are circular, red, and appear to have a dot in the center. \n\nOtherwise, he does not have eye symptoms or joint pain. He IS Turkish/South Asian, which was what tipped the gastroenterologist off to the possibility of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. And he has had deficiencies in B vitamins before. I do not know if that is related. \n\nI am just wondering what the outlook is here. Will he need to have a blood test done? How will we know for sure this is it? I have read through a few posts here and it seems like medication is the way to go for management. He hates taking pills, though. (As someone with ADHD, I do not mind. If it helps, it helps.) \n\nDoes anyone here take a medication ONLY when a flare-up happens? Or is it more of an everyday thing? \n\nThanks so much for any help! I am so glad this sub exists :) I am not Turkish/south Asian, but I got diagnosed after having severe recurring uveitis - my ophthalmologist ran some blood work and sent me to a rheumatologist who asked if I had mouth ulcers, which I had just started getting. I hear a lot of different stories, so everyone is experience is different. \n\nFrom the time my uveitis flared to diagnosis was around 5 months for me. In that time I had an episode of skin ulcerations that sound like what your husband is experiencing. I also had pleurisy, inflammation in my heart and also in my ears. I had a history of stomach ulcers that my doctors now think are related. \n\nAll of this to say I am on remicade every 5 months. If he does not have any major symptoms he might be able to treat just the ulcers with topical meds, but I think cholcine is used to treat the severe mouth ulcers and you have to be taking it for it to have any effect\u2026.\n\nI hope he starts to feel better! You will need the rheumatologist, opthalmologist, and dermatologist. Derm will probably need to do a pathergy test for Behcets. Colchicine is the most common medication for the disease. Minocycline worked well for my wife, but she is sensitive to antibiotics. Otezla also helped a bit, but can cause gastro problems. She is on Humira now, and it is working very well. Problem is that it is not a first line. Best of luck to you guys, as it could be a long road. Do not stop if a doctor will not treat. Look into more places. Where are you located? To answer your topic question specifically one gets diagnosed usually by lots of trial and error, over a long period of time, and usually after seeing multiple doctors. But, you have sort of skipped the line and already had someone recommend Behcets so that could speed it up if you get the necessary referrals.\n\nBehcets is inflammation caused by the body\u2019s own self, if that makes sense. Attacking its own soft tissues, causing ulcers in the mouth and usually genitals, all sorts of inflammation symptoms from head to toe for many of us. And so, to answer the question about medications to take when there is a flare up - steroids are usually the flare up treatment. In my experience when I have had a bad flare, I would be given a large dose of Prednisone for a few days and then a slightly smaller dose for a few days after that, and so on and so on.. called a Prednisone/Steroid \u201ctaper\u201d. And that works for sure. \nBut, if it is an autoimmune disease, it is really best to treat systemically - find a normal dose, consistent medication plan that will keep inflammation levels down. \n\nMost meds require some monitoring by blood work. For example, immunosuppressants which most of us end up on. The docs will want to ensure normal kidney function and other levels, so blood work every 3-6 months in my experience - depending on how well you are doing. \n\nIt is complex and difficult and his condition may not be Behcets, but certainly sounds like he would benefit from continuing the journey to finding a diagnose. Could be another autoimmune one - there are loads, and much of the information I have said above is true for other autoimmune diseases also. \n\nHope that is been helpful and good luck! Go with the rheumatologist . My GI doc called it Behcets, and rheumatologist confirmed it. Colchicine did not help me, neither did steroids. I take Otezla only when l'm in a bad flare. It is great with the ulcers, but hard on the GI system. Thank you for advocating for your your husband! What do you do for the red eyes? It is a clinical diagnoses so they will need to use tests to rule out other possible causes for the symptoms, then there are a couple different diagnostic criteria they will look for. Typically you need at least 3 major symptoms, but one system assigns points for certain ones. \n\nThere is one gene associated with it, but it is not a surefire thing, so it may be a clue, but will not get a diagnosis, so they will usually just ask about symptoms.\n\nI would recommend keeping track of symptoms &amp; taking pictures of thing like the \"odd sores\" as you described them so that they can see them in case they are not present during an appointment. I had a hard time with doctors believing some my symptoms because they were not present by the time I was seen. But when they see it, they believe it and it is much easier than trying to describe things.\n\nSince it looks so different for different people, treatment would depend on your symptoms. They usually treat each symptom as needed. So if you flare/remit and are fine for a long period of time between flares, you may just be on prednisone or something during a flare, and then off in a week or two. If you have more frequent symptoms, you may need more continuous treatment.\n\nI am glad they are sending you to a Rheumatologist. I did not get that until 10 years in. They are the ones who know about Behcet's. This is old but I hope you are still reading.\n\nI actually got diagnosed through my GI, despite having one of the best rheumatologists in the country.\n\nI reached out to my GI as a Hail Mary because she was one of the only specialists that had not done a workup on me. She found a severe vitamin deficiency (Vitamin A for me, which is nearly impossible to be deficient of without disease) and a super high CRP. We then did stool tests, where I had very, very high calprotectin (almost 7,000 -- range is 0-49) and that earned me an emergency scope the following week. I never had GI symptoms, not even a stomach cramp.\n\nAt the scope, they found hundreds of ulcers in my digestive track, but they followed in straight lines upon my blood vessels, which is a sign of vasculitis. Biopsies confirmed vasculitis and my GI doctor reached out to other GI specialists across the country she knew and asked them to take a look and they confirmed Behcet's, especially when analysed in the context of my other symptoms (tl;dr all of the Behcet's symptoms, haha).\n\nWhat have you done with the GI so far?\n\nNinja edit: also note that the sores could be related to his vitamin deficiencies and not to Behcet's. Skin issues can be related to a variety of things. If he is also lacking genital ulcers, I would say Behcet's is unlikely since he is lacking a lot of the other hallmarks. Def work with a doctor.", "Annoying doctors I have been diagnosed for about 10 years now(I am 27F). My old rheumatologist retired so I started with a new one today. She told me today that she is not convince that Behcets is what I have, even though a have had vaginal ulcers in the past (only 4 times since I was diagnosed). I also get extreme leg and arm pain, some times to the point that I cannot walk and I cry because they hurt so bad. She said well \u201cyou are getting older and maybe it is just regular joint pain, you should try to exercise.\u201d I  also ask her if there was something I could do because I am constantly exhausted and No matter how much I sleep and she said \u201cwell the the only way you sleep better is working out and eating right. \u201c I have gained some weight the last few years but she did not even ask if I currently work out or eat healthy. Which I do I just have a way less active job. It made me so mad, I felt unheard and unacknowledged, like she did not believe how I was feel had anything to do with my actual diagnosis and was just all was because of my weight. I was very thin when I diagnosed and had the same symptoms but that did not seem to matter. If for some reason my other doctor was wrong (even with 40+ years of experience and multiple patients with behcets) should she have at least tried to figure out what I did have? She just told me to call if I get an ulcer and scheduled to see me in 6 months....Am I over reacting? I need advise! I know insurance and location come into play here, but I would suggest finding a new rheumatologist. Do not forget, doctors work for you. If you are not happy with the service one provides, go see another. \n\nIf you live in the middle of nowhere, it might be hard to find another rheumy. But if you live anywhere near a major (or even minor) city, there will be several to choose from. Get your Google on and read some reviews about other rheumatologists in your area.\n\nAnd then there is insurance. This can be a pain and you might have to pester your PCP about getting a referral. But it will be worth it. \n\nSo that is what I would suggest (and have personally done in the past). It is incredibly important for those of us with Behcet's (or any chronic illness) to be able to communicate with our healthcare providers. If you feel like you are not being heard by your current rheumy, go find a better one. Best of luck to you! Pretty much had this same thing happen to me. My rheumatologist and general practitioner both retired at the same time. Both new ones essentially teamed up to try to dismiss my previous Behcet's diagnosis. Luckily, the rheumatologist retired very shortly after and the new one has been good so far and as for the GP, well, I am currently looking for a new one. I guess my advice would be to start looking for a new rheum doc. It may sound like starting over, I know that is hard for some, myself included, however, your current doc is setting you back at this point. Sounds like it is time to move on from that noise. I was just complaining to my friends and family about how tired I am about doctor's and their inability to look at things and try to see the whole picture, not just how I am today.  I actually just came on reddit now to post on one of the doctor's subreddits to see if they had methods that I did not know of to find more specialized docs and how I can find this info out (like how many cases have they treated or researched on behcets or publications, etc) and if there is some sort of better method for picking my doc b/c I am so flipping tired of trying to convince my doctors that something is wrong.  My last rheumatologist I saw (who was new to my team) said I probably just had basic inflammation - I had so many pictures of my feet (I am somewhat thin, but at the time was really thin as I was not eating at all) not able to fit in my shoes, my calves the size of my thighs, no bones to be found and I could move them due ot the pain and my arms either.  I had all of this documented and did he even look once? No.  Just dismissed me.  Just like yours.  I am so tired of this!!  You are not overreacting imo, but to them you might be because they just do not get chronic illness.  I want doctors who are familiar with rare illness, not just \"listed it as a specialty b/c it is inclusive to what they studied\", no real flipping cases, real research.  That is what we need.  I just found your post and realized how angry I am at this and used it to vent as well, so thanks!  Hope you find a doctor who will at least try and listen, even if they come to the same conclusion, at least make the attempt to hear you out and research your case. Yo I am 26, diagnosed at 17 too, so in a similar boat. Did they do the gene testing to see if you have the marker? If not, I HIGHLY recommend you get it done. I have neglected my healthcare in my early 20\u2019s\u2014I got caught up in school and just establishing a life. And it is really been the past 6 months I have started re establishing care. Having that gene marker test was a big help in having new doctors take me seriously. Yeah I had one done when I was initially diagnosed. My new doctor has the record. Plus my whole family had some sort of auto immune, my mom has unspecified autoimmune disease, one of my sisters have colitis and another one of my sisters have a over active thyroid You are still being dismissed by doctors? \nI know it is frustrating, I have had my fair share of meeting new medical professionals and they have not even heard of Behcets. \nAre you suspicious you have something else or fear you are just not receiving treatment for Behcets ? I feel that behcets is the right diagnosis, I have many of the symptoms and my previous rheumatologist had a special interest in behcets and actually was working on alternative ways to help people with it. She had multiple patients in her practice with behcets and she really tried to help and try things to try to help. Such as, she proscribed a oral liquid steroid to be used on vaginal ulcers and it actually really helped. It is just hard to go from someone so helpful to someone that dismisses me. If for some reason it is something else, that is fine but she did not even do anything to find out  except say I will see you in 6 months Oh my gosh, I know! The slowness of the medical system (especially during the pandemic) is really tough to endure. The long waits really beat you down as you live day to day in pain and uncertainty. I am actually in the process of trying humira as kind of an experimental treatment. It is hard to find a good team of doctors that will understand Behcets, but also will listen to your symptoms and not automatically categorize it as part of the chronic illness. A big fear is having odd symptoms and going undiagnosed because it is assumed it is attached to the behcets. \nHave you found any home remedies to help ease symptoms? I know everyone say to eat healthy but specifically the paleo diet has helped me a lot in the past it definitely calmed down the the inflammation through out my body. I also found that drinking a lot of water throughout the day lowers the chance of leg and arm pain, I am not sure why but if seems to help. Lastly, some times my legs get in so much pain I cannot walk and the only thing that helps is a heating pad. I literally have three electric ones and use them constantly. It does not cure anything but it definitely ease the pain, so at least I am not just laying there crying in pain. I do not think Ibuprofen or anything like that really helps and it is just more chemicals that mess with your body in different way. I try to only take it if absolutely necessary. What about you I just shared my story as well. I can completely sympathize! I have dealt with so many doctors who just completely brushed everything under the rug or act like if you are not critically ill that they cannot do anything!\n\nI even waited 4 months for a neurologist visit to be told by him \u201cIt sounds like we are chasing a ghost here, all your tests show nothing, and this is not an episode of House\u201d. He then said I might have anxiety and tried to prescribe me an antidepressant. I was heartbroken\u2026certain that he might be my only hope piecing together my confusing list of symptoms.\n\nThankfully, I did find a doctor who I have actually stuck with. Our first visit, he spent nearly an hour writing up my symptoms and genuinely seemed to want to get to the bottom of this. I have only recently learned about how similar my symptoms are to Behcets and plan on discussing it with him on my next visit.", "Overlap diagnosis of Behcets &amp; Crohn's - any advice? So today's been a big day for me in my BD journey - which started 12 years ago at age 14 (now 26F). 6 hours of seeing specialists and having tests at the Behcets' centre of excellence (London) - and the current expected diagnosis (pre test results) is an 'overlap' between Behcets' disease and Crohn's disease. \n\nCurrently getting genetic tests to see if it helps indicate one or the other - or both. Interestingly enough, apparently my Irish genes and colouring makes it more likely to be Behcets'. \n\nJust wondering if anyone else has received a similar diagnosis, and/or has any advice? Thank you! Hi :) I have BD and am happy to share my experiences and what I know. I have Italian in my family and do have the HLA gene. I have heard of some BD patients having Crohns as well. I do have Gastrointestinal manifestations from my BD and was misdiagnosed with both Celiac disease and Crohns in the past. I am treated by Rheumatologist, but we are still working on medications to address the GI symptoms. Aspirin, methotrexate and colchicine have all helped me the most. Did not do well on Otezla.\nMany of the same meds are used for ulcerative colitis,  Crohns, BD, etc. Has your doctor indicated what the next step would be? Best to you. Cheering you on in your journey and hope you feel better soon. Thanks so much for your comment! Really appreciate you sharing your experiences. It seems like there is lots of cross over between different conditions and getting a diagnosis can be seriously tricky. I have just been given Colchicine for the first time so hoping it helps, as well as a triple mouth wash and prednisolone. I am seeing them again in a few months for my results and their diagnosis, and im guessing I will be treated for Behcets' or Crohn's. I have symptoms of both, but not full symptoms of either - so it will be interesting how that pans out. My mum has had Crohn's since her 20s, and in the last year has had a flare up of all sorts of new autoinflammatory conditions which could indicate Behcets' too. So the genetic analysis will hopefully uncover something of an explanation. \n\nThanks so much! All the best to you too. Hi, I am 27 and was diagnosed at the Centre of excellence with crohns and Behcets. Professor Fortune and Dr Kidd are amazing. I have had a few different meds over the years but Humira really helps keep things under control. I have a couple of other conditions but I am so much better now. Where abouts are you based? The Beh\u00e7et\u2019s society have a FB group and an AGM where people get together which is helpful - both for info and connecting to people. Finding the right meds took time (and a lot of bathroom trips!) but I am now studying and enjoying my life. I just need to pace myself more and accept that stress will make me flare. If you have any questions just ask! Hi there! Thanks so much for your comment. I met Professor Fortune for the first time yesterday, and she was brilliant, it was the most information I have ever had about the condition and so helpful and reassuring. I am based in London, how about you? Oh that is great, I will have a look for the Facebook group. It really helps being able to speak to others with similar experiences. That is great to hear! I am hoping my new meds will help and I will be able to feel more myself. Thanks so much! You are welcome. I am in Cambridge. There are fairly regular meet-ups in London I believe for people with behcets as well- just coffee morning type things (do not quote me! But if you join the Beh\u00e7et\u2019s fb group they will be able to direct you). It is a rubbish condition and there will be hard Periods I am sure but being kind to yourself and keeping on top of meds/diet/sleep etc. Gives yourself the best chance. Thank you - that is really helpful! I totally agree. All the best! Hey there what is the FB group name?

Eating hurts. How do they feel about kissing, knowing all the chaos in my mouth? My partner and I rarely kiss\nJust tell your partner! They will probably be understanding! You have got a whole body that can be kissed :) does not have to be your lips! While my Behcet's diagnosis is not something I actively try to hide, I generally do not promote it either. Unless it becomes relevant, I usually do not bring it up. There have been women I have dated for months without bringing it up and others I have told on the first date. It depends on two things: 1. If I am currently experiencing any symptoms that will have an immediate impact on the relationship, and 2. If they bring up any health issues of their own. \n\nIn your case, number 1 clearly comes into play. Fortunately, I have not had any oral (or genital) ulcers for years. But if I had a mouth full of them like you, I would probably bring it up on the first date. Most people are pretty understanding. Those who are not, you probably do not want to be smoochin' it up with anyway ;) I would try to be honest about it if it is causing you any feelings of self consciousness! I have found (F, 27) that after telling my past partners, they have all been very understanding and compassionate about it. It is not contagious and it is not something you can easily control, so there is no harm in expressing that with your significant other. Showing vulnerability can really open doors for others to be empathetic and see that the issue is causing you emotional distress, and can strengthen your bond even more \ud83e\udd70 Honestly, this is something I am dreading. My genital ulcers look so much like herpes that it took so many doctors to look at it and believe me when I told them it was not herpes. If people with medical knowledge do not believe me, how can I expect someone else to? I got diagnosed at the start of the pandemic so I have not been dating...... before my diagnosis I was always able to hide the genital ulcers and avoid being intimate by saying I was on my period. I have not dated since 2008 when I got diagnosed. I get hell genital ulcers and they are only worsened by sex so there is no point even going there. Considering it is something that can dramatically impact your life, I feel like hiding it for any significant period of time is a mistake. If you want to try and build a life with someone, you need to know if they are going to cut and run at the first sign of crippling health issues. I think I told my partner about my issues within a week or so of us beginning to date and that was before I had my official behcets diagnosis. It was not a comfortable conversation but it made him not horrified when he kissed me and bumped an ulcer by accident so I said ow. He would just kiss half my mouth instead or give me a light peck on my nose. It also was nice to not have to explain tilting my head sideways so that the food was only on one side of my mouth. Explaining early just made everything easier. It was also nice not to have to explain the handful of pills I have to take every day. Like no I am not a drug addict, this is for my thyroid, etc. underrated comment If I want to have sex with someone, I tell them. I am also very careful with condoms and vetting partners because we are very very susceptible to STIs. I try to start new relationships off with an STI test. Like hey \ud83d\udc4b look I am clean I am so sorry. I was diagnosed when I was 16 or 17, but started getting genital ulcers when I was 11 or 12. I have had herpes tests, and had to get blood drawn every month for about 6-8 years. Having genital ulcers as a teenager was nothing short of damaging to my already weak self esteem. \n\nI have found that with time and with more confidence, I have had no issue explaining to my partners why I was uncomfortable when it came to sex. The people I was closing with were understanding and very respectful of my feelings, and once I explained what it was, they were not bothered at all. My fianc\u00e9 now is totally understanding and does his best with helping me feel better. \n\nIf someone is new in your life, I understand not wanting to bring it up. However, if you do, they should likely respect your feelings and be more understanding.

The ulcers get in the way of sex sometimes, but we either find other ways to be sexy together or practice building other types of intimacy during those flares.\n\nLong story short, the right person will see how strong you are &amp; rise to the challenge \ud83d\udc9c I am not someone who has Beh\u00e7ets but my partner does ! I am 19 and he is 20. I have been with him through his diagnosis and before we even knew what beh\u00e7ets was. I have seen the mouth and genital ulcers. I have gone to the doctors with him and listened to their misdiagnosis and telling him he had herpes. But we knew it just was not herpes. We kiss when he does not have a mouth flare up. His mouth ulcers are not generally bad, but the genital ulcers are. I do not find him gross or weird and I am not disgusted. I love him the same no matter what or how bad the flare up.

I think some people of this sub will find this information useful.\n\nCouple post down I wrote about my symtoms and my panic about my son. After that post I wrote an email about my and my sons symptoms to a Professor in Turkey specialising in Behcet and reumatologi desises.\n\nShe wrote that I need to start with a gene test for \"HA20\" which is a newly found desise from 2016, it is a mutation in our genes. Stands for Haploinsufficiency of A20 and it can mimic Behcets and also other reumatologi desises such as Lupus. \n\nI have not tested yet, because I live in Sweden and I will try to explain this to a hospital here tomorrow. I am not even sure if they have treated it before. I have not managed to found an article in Swedish about this. \n\nAs I understand, people who has been diagnosed in the same family maybe should get a gene test, as reasearcher never understood how behcets is a family desise. \n\nWell this all I know so far and hope it helps out someone. Thanks for posting this. I just looked into HA20 a little bit and there does seem to be lots of crossover with Behcet's. \n\nI had my genome sequenced about a year ago and have been picking apart the raw data. I already know I have HLA-B51 and B27. After researching HA20, there are a couple others I am going to look for. \n\nStudying genetics has changed my perspective on Behcet's disease. I no longer see it as its own unique illness. There seem to be a number of related illnesses that share common genes. That is why so many people have comorbidities (more than one diagnosis).  \n\nFor any science nerds like myself, I will leave links to two of the journal articles I found most interesting. They are both very recent (2020 and 2019, IIRC): \n\n(\n\n(\n\nEDIT: I was just looking over my notes. I would forgotten that I already looked into HA20 about nine months ago.

Every time I have posted, the answers I get are invaluable, and I feel so lucky to be able to talk things through with people who have real experience, not to mention read about yours. Thank you all x10000000\n\nMy question today: I have to choose between Remicade and Humira after Azathioprine really failing me. I am curious what peoples' experiences with these two are? Especially if anyone has tried both and one worked better than the other. I am open to either but desperate to get something that will last long term!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n:) I started on Remicade first after some research - see below. \n\n**Remicade:**\n \n* It is a 2-4hr IV infusion every eight weeks after the loading period. Requires time off work, have access to an infusion center nearby, etc. \n* Remicade can work a bit quicker than Humira due to the higher initial doses required - usually within 6-8 weeks. \n* Remicade is more likely to \"fail out\" over the course of 2-5yrs due to the development of antibodies against the medicine. This is because Remicade is a chimeric monoclonal antibody - it is part mouse, part human. The development of antibodies is random - some folks have been on Remicade for decades without problem, other people fail out within a year. \n* Antibodies against Remicade are short lived - meaning you can \"fail out\" of Remicade therapy, but then be able to go back to it a year or two later if necessary. \n* Remicade has been out for two decades and used across many different diseases, so it is well understood. \n\n**Humira**:\n\n* It is a subcutaneous injection every two weeks that you do at home! So much nicer than taking a day off of work. \n* It may take a few months to fully \"build up\" in your system, which leads to a more gradual recovery. \n* Humira is less likely to fail - it is a fully human monoclonal antibody, so the anti-drug antibody development rate is much lower. \n* That being said...if it fails, then anti-drug antibodies are very long lived. \n* It is newer, so we have less data/papers proving effectiveness. The current understanding is it works as well as Remicade. \n\nMy thought process was: 1) I do not like needles - I would rather someone else stick me, and 2) if I get VERY unlucky and develop antibodies, then I can go to Humira for a few years, then I have the option to switch back to Remicade if Humira fails too. Probability-wise either option should work just fine, so it largely will come down to preference. Been on Humira since the start and have had no problems or side effects whatsoever. It is an injection on the belly or thigh once every two weeks you can comfortably do at home. I honestly sometimes have to check if the injection happened since I do not even feel the needle (I use pens not syringes). \nThe injection is super easy to do and we will explained in the papers, you do not need to catch a vein or anything given it is subcutaneous.\nAnother user went more in depth about what these two medications actually are and how your body behaves when coming into contact with them, I honestly do not know much about this so I strongly suggest to take the time and read their very well written answer.\n\nTl;Dr been on Humira since the start and am very happy with it. Thank you!!! This is great, thank you so much!! I was leaning toward Remicade for some of these reasons - I figured switching from that to Humira would be easier than the other way around. The convenience of Humira is appealing, and it seems (?) that it is more frequently mentioned on our subreddit, but I like the idea of having 8 weeks between treatments. Plus not having to bring it home... that separation sounds nice, following months of BD being a daily theme in my house. I am really glad to hear it is working for you, you have officially given me the courage to follow my gut instinct. I did really well on Remicade for YEARS but eventually developed antibodies and switched to Humira. Humira has worked wonders for me! I am also on humira and have been for the past 3-4 years aswell as azathioprine,  nothing else had worked in the past and this combination is the only thing that has worked for me. I have an unrelated question ..where do you live? I am just curious because I did not get a choice. When my rheumatologist switched me to tnf inhibitors he said it is up to insurance &amp; they would choose between humira and remicade. He did note my\nPreference for humira as it is more convenient but was fine with either. My niece has been on remicade for the last year..hers is more severe &amp; she is so young that is it is more complex. But it is the first medication that is helped her :)\nBe well! &amp; hope whichever you choose works for you \ud83e\udde1\u2764\ufe0f I am outside of Columbus, OH so I have the privilege of OSU's Wexner Medical Center. I am also employed by OSU and insured through them, so that may have something to do with the flexibility. I am glad you and your niece have found treatment that works!", "Struggling to find answers, symptoms pointing towards Behcets? Hi everyone, \n\nCreated this account specifically to post on here. \n\nTo jump right into it, I have struggled with reoccurring mouth ulcers since my early teens, sometimes it was a single ulcer, but most of the time there were multiple large, super painful ulcers.\n\n I will never forget having 10 large ulcers all over the roof of my mouth, tongue, and gums on my eighteenth birthday - made for a rather awful birthday. \n\nOn another occasion my entire mouth was filled with ulcers and a large portion of the roof of my mouth was an ulcer, I went to ER in excruciating pain and was prescribed antibiotics for what was believed to be a strep infection. \n\nThese ulcers were written off by my GP frequently as being stress induced. \n\nI also have struggled with chronic joint pain, specifically in my neck and shoulders. Frequent migraines with and without aura (which were aggravated and worsened by hormonal BC), and awful bouts of exhaustion. These symptoms again have been disregarded by my GP, and even my close family, as I am relatively young, I also suffer from depression, which my GP often linked to my described bouts of exhaustion. \n\nI went on an anti-inflammatory diet and I was feeling quite good until recently I went through a pretty devastating break-up and found myself disregarding the diet entirely. \n\nI recently have felt incredibly exhausted and just a general feeling of malaise. I experienced a yeast infection and took an OTC pill for it. I also experienced several mouth ulcers. And then a couple days ago woke up with a really uncomfortable sensation and realized I had a genital ulcer present. \n\nI immediately freaked out as I am not currently sexually active and booked a doctor's appointment to have a swab taken. My GP said that ulcer did not appear consistent with what HSV-2 generally looks like but nevertheless took the swab. \n\nI am currently awaiting results, which should take a couple of days, but after researching and finding out about Behcets, something that has never been mentioned to me before, I feel like my symptoms are really consistent. \n\nI live in Canada and getting referrals to rheumatologists can definitely take time, but at this point I feel like I really want to voice this concern to my GP. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms to these?   \n\n\nFeeling totally lost, but thank you for reading this post and thanks for your time! \n\nHope everyone is doing well. Also Canadian here! My only real symptom is uveitis but that was what got me a referral to a rheumatologist.\n\nI am still unconvinced I even have behcets but I was formally diagnosed due to the marker in my blood and my eye condition. Apparently that is enough and so that is why I am here! \n\nIt can be difficult to diagnose with no real test but it is worth at least visiting a GP to ask about a referral. A lot of the times it is not particularly hard. From what you have said, it sounds like you do have Behcets. The diagnosis for me took a long time (probably a few years) because it is so uncommon and there is no test to diagnose it. I was tested for every other disease in the book (Crohn\u2019s, Lupus) which were all negative. Finally they diagnosed Behcets because of my frequent mouth sores and bad pain in my heels. I can relate to your mouth pain they hurt so bad and I have had 10+ at once too! I definitely recommend you try to get referred to see a rheumatologist. My primary care doctor always dismissed me or did not really help me that much, but my rheumatologist does. Good luck! Hi there. So sorry you are dealing with so many symptoms, life changes and uncertainty.\n\nI have experienced all the symptoms you mentioned (plus a plethora of others) and was diagnosed with Behcet's last year. I live in the US.\n\nI have also been benefitting from an anti-inflammatory diet, but it is not the only working solution for me (I also take Humira). When my diet is good and my water intake is high, I get less migraines, have more energy, and experience less GI issues. My migraines also get worse on hormonal birth control, but all my other BD symptoms get worse on my period, so that is a fun problem to solve. I have tried so many options and still have not found the right one... it is exhausting!\n\nI think talking to your GP is a good first step, but it is important to see a rheumatologist for a diagnosis (especially if your GP keeps writing off your symptoms) so maybe ask for a referral as soon as you can. The diagnostic process can be long, so consider talking to your rheumatologist about immediate relief options (like prednisone) until you can get diagnosed and properly treated. If you respond well to steroid treatment, your symptoms are likely inflammatory and/or autoimmune.\n\nRemember to take care of yourself (extra these days!). Self-care goes a long way and is usually low on our list of priorities. Feel free to reach out with any questions and good luck!! Thank you so much for this. It is frustrating because the general consensus around my mouth sores has always been that they are induced from stress but I have always kind of known that even though stress can trigger them I have had plenty of them brought on in healthy, happy times in my life. Started feeling like I was going crazy but this subreddit has made me feel much more sane. Yes I feel that way too! I think stress can trigger them, but there is got to be a cause when you get 10 at one time! It is tough with their being no test or cure \ud83d\ude15but we make it work! Agreed - stress is definitely a trigger for my mouth sores but it is not the only one! Any minor cut or bite or scratch turns into one (or many). I also get a lot more when I am eating sugar. And then ofc there are the outbreaks that seem completely random. You are SANE! Docs do not know shit sometimes. It is taken me 20 years to get a BD dx. Misdiagnosed for YEARS. This is sooo common in BD folks. Please, do not waste any time, go find a GOOD rheumatologist and ditch that GP! Find a better one that is willing to do the work with you. Reality is, you know your body best, docs are just really busy, BD is so uncommon so many do not see it right away, you must be persistent and listen to yourself! I just got my BD dx. 20 years later after seeing rounds and rounds of all the specialists. Again, I emphasize, a GOOD rheumatologist! Best wishes and ease n swift healing to you Great response! I second this! \ud83d\ude42 Thank you for this, I am coming to the understanding now that Behcets is so easily misdiagnosed as other things because the symptoms do not always necessarily happen at once so they are not always \u201clinked\u201d. I actually just had a mouth sore on the corner of my mouth so deep it started some minor necrosis so I think my doctor is actually finally taking this seriously and sending me to a rheumatologist. Just wishing I could speed up the process! I hear you. Big time. This journey is all about patience, patience, patience and persistence. I just responded to someone else\u2019s post, similar to yours, in re to how all my symptoms over the years were linked when MANY MANY doctors for years said they were not. Moral of the story, YOU are your best advocate. \n\nI thought all my answers would be solved when I finally got the dx but tbh, there is more to it. Now it is what medications do I try and dealing w the side effects. But stay focused and always get a second opinion. Look up BDBA that Behcets org. Very helpful.", "Covid and medications Hi everyone, who has had Covid here while on immunosuppressants?\n\nI am on azathioprine and colchicine and just tested positive for Covid.\n\nDid you guys stay on your regular medication routine ? \n\nThanks for any answers I had it last August and yes I stayed on my meds. I was taking humira and methotrexate.  However this is something you should definitely talk to your doctor. I had a very small viral load because I had been so careful. That made a difference in how sick I got. Thanks. I am double vaccinated and so far very mild symptoms. \nMoved country during the pandemic also, so do not have my regular doctors but I will do some calling around and get advice.\nThank you! Hope you are staying well", "How long do vulva ulcers last? My first episode of genital ulcers began about a month ago, which tilted me into a probable behcets diagnosis in addition to other past symptoms. I was given two medications, one a steroid burst and the other colchicine. I finished the steroid burst about a week ago, and did see improvements but right not the ulcer is still big... (to be more descriptive, it used to be a gigantic one that was on opposing sides that merged, and now it is only on one side but has split into two fairly big ulcers (both a little less than 1 cm in length). \n\nI was just wondering how long it usually takes for all of your to heal, so I know if I should be concerned or not. The mouth ulcers I had that started around the same time have already healed (though they were smaller and right now I can feel the onset of two more), but I have never had a genital ulcer before so I have no idea of the time frame that healing takes. So Vulva ulcers can depend on friction and pressure from the area. If you keep the ulcer clean (which Washing it sucks and burns )  and uncovered it will heal faster. However we cannot really walk around bottomless so they can take longer. If you can get a cream to form a barrier that is also an anti inflammatorythat helps also. Sadly you do not usually see results with colchicine until the two month mark. \n\nGood luck! I agree with the comment here. You could get a topical steroid cream - get it compounded if necessary - and it will clear up in a few days. This is a lot better than \"seesawing\" on and off oral or systemic steroids while you wait to see if the colchicine works.\n\nAlso, if you can use hypoallergenic baby wipes or toilet wipes instead of toilet paper and make sure you are wearing cotton underpants and loose-fitting pants. I find that calendula diaper balm helps them heal quicker and makes them sting less. Specifically the balm though, not creams as they can be too moist and keep it from healing. I like the ones that are beeswax based with calendula. It is gentle enough you do not end up with a yeast infection to go with the ulcer. If you do get a steroid cream be careful using it as steroids will thin out your vaginal skin over time making fissures more common. I was using a topical steroid cream, but I felt really bad burning whenever I used it, so my GYN told me I could stop and let it heal naturally for now. Is the burning normal? Should I go back to the cream? (Burning was really bad for a few seconds and dimmed into a stinging for a fewminutes before it stopped) Do you have a rough time frame for how long it typically takes to heal? (ex: 2-3 months?) I usually see the he healing process take between 1-2 weeks. But I have always got my care and treatment down to a science since I have been having ulcers for 20 years. I can feel the module come in and start treating it then. There are also some products that deaden the site but it is painful and it makes it heal faster. Some people on facebooks groups say it takes 2 months or so but without medication I had about 3-5 weeks heal time Does your personal care and treatment include medication? I have had my ulcers for 3 weeks so far (with a steroid burst having been finished), and they are still prevalent and I am worried it will take another month to heal\n\n(what i am meaning to ask is do you have a treatment process that I can replicate w/o needing other prescribed medication?) Okay, I am assuming I fall into the category of 2 months then :(Thank you for your response! I will message you! The only time I had, two years ago, it lasted 2 weeks. I could not even walk.\nBut I did not know back then, we thought it was a reaction to a spider bite and the taking of medicine with cortisone after (until then I never took anything like that, so they thought it was a reaction).\n\nI took care of it by stoping the cortisone and taking  alternative stuff back then. Omeopathic stuff. It worked, but knowing what causes, I would say you take proper medication for it. I had plenty of ulcers, bit big ones, but many many go back to the gynecologist. If it is stinging ulcers that is normal but if it is just stinging in general then it might be damaging the mucosa, which will cause more ulcers. Hi! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb\nMy first flare was three years ago. During that first flare, my larger genital ulcers took months to heal, whereas my oral ulcers would come and go relatively quickly (usually within a week). I have found now that with a little time and consistent Enbrel, cellcept, and colchicine, they do not get nearly as big and heal much more quickly.\nMy gynecologist prescribed a cream called MiCort, and it helps a lot. As mentioned by others, steroids should be used sparingly, but sometimes ya just need them.\nI hope you find some relief soon.", "Actemra (tocilizumab) treatment experiences?  What is that??I take humira. There are three immune system cytokines that are largely responsible for Behcet's symptoms: TNF-Alpha, IL-6, and IL-1B. TNF-Alpha is currently thought to be the primary cytokine responsible for Behcet's - so we are prescribed Remicade/Humira, which reduces the amount of TNF-Alpha in our bodies. \n\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody drug like Remicade/Humira, but it targets IL-6 instead of TNF-Alpha. The limited data we have on this drug in Behcet's shows that it is effective in controlling symptoms with the exception of oral/genital ulcers. This is amazing for Behcet's patients with uveitis, thrombosis, or neuro-BD that do not respond to anti-TNF therapy. ](", "Anyone else start having symptoms come back after having them controlled with meds? Hi everyone, I am 37 and have had a Behcet's for six years. I have been taking cyclosporine daily for about four. This winter I have started getting joint effusion on my right knee after only having had maybe one since starting my meds. I also have uveitis that was pretty stubborn up until the pandemic hit and we all started social distancing. The mouth ulcers never totally went away but they were drastically reduced after starting medication. But I really have not had trouble with my joints in a long time. I had maybe a minor issue last year when the seasons changed but all I had to do was test and ice it and I was fine. But this year in October it started flaring and I ended up having to get a cortisone shot and the fluid drained. I am trying to work through this. I am hoping there is not some other problem going on. I did come down with my first respiratory illness since before covid hit as most places are dropping mask requirements. I ended up with a nasty case of bronchitis. Some of my labs have been off though. The only other possibility I can think of is something diet related. My knee has started swelling again as I am writing this. If I cannot control it I will be seeing my rheumatologist.", "Diet question I dont know yet if i have behcets but i lost a lot of weight and have some of the symptoms.  Am i supposed eat what i can to gain that weight back or start eating healthy as possible to keep the flareups down?  Does diet matter with this disease? The short answer is that the research around diet was inconclusive, partly because nutrition research is really tricky. What I have done previously for myself is use a product called \"sustagen\" that has a hospital formula (not the sports version!) to help build my reserves back up after a flare. You may find it more effective to mix it with lactose free milk as its slightly easier to digest.\nI also make a point of not having too much of one source of carbs, particularly wheat and corn. I go for cereals, breads and pasta that are either a mix of grains or a grain that I do not often have - pasta made from pulses and buckwheat products.\nThis is just based on anecdotes of family members and my own experience. To this day, if I eat wheat bix I end up with debilitating gut pain.\nHope that helps. Thank you for your response! My method is to just eat as clean as possible. Avoid processed foods and lots of carbs. Add meal replacement shakes in between meals to lift your calorie intake of needed. \n\nThe Behcets syndrome society has a really good section on food and diet studies and what to avoid. \n\nSpice, vinegar and citrus juices tend to make the mouth ulcers worse and carbs, especially cereals and bread makes the stomach and digestive stuff worse. Milk (whole or semi skimmed) also seems to not agree with me but skimmed milk is fine. \n\nI have also found that exercise almost always causes horrible flare ups unless I stick to doing a small amount every day- say 20/30 mins of no impact stuff. I find diet is HUGE for my BD flare ups. No sugar, no gluten for me.\n\n\nAfter a tonne of research and trial and error, I added a lot more meat into my diet, unprocessed and grass fed, and only eat whole carbs like potato or rice. I do eat some fruit and have plain whole fat yogurt every day.\n\nIt has made an enormous difference and even healed lesions on my skin that in the past I had to have surgically removed. As in, I was able to reverse the growth of another problematic \"cyst\" for lack of a better word, by cutting out sugar and gluten and upping my meat intake. This, after I had let my diet slip due to quarantine. \n\nI mean I knew diet helped control my symptoms but I was astounded that I was able to reverse them by changing nothing else that what I ate and drank. Before my diagnoses I made very drastic changes to my diet, for weeks/months at a time, trying to find something that would help.\n\nIt did not seem to make a difference for me.\n\nOne thing was especially nice though, alkaline water. The brand with the black cap was what was available, but it felt so nice to drink when I had canker sores, and honestly just felt especially refreshing during my worst flareups.\n\nMedication seems to be helping for now, and honestly, the same water does not hit like it did when I was really bad. I mostly avoid gluten, lactose and sugar but I have period where it is hard and I gave up. I also drink green smoothies to help regulate the inflammation (Kale, spinach, green beans, cucumber, avocado, ginger , lemon, apple juice and water). Doctors never really indicated a specific diet but I did notice improvement when I reduce or cut gluten, sugar and lactose. More proteins helps too if you do sports, to keep the muscles.", "Hi everyone! Welcome! Hi everyone! I have been using reddit for quite a while now. I was surprised to see that there is no subreddit for Behcet's Disease (unless I missed it somehow). So, here it is. I created one.

Hopefully this subreddit can help people with both.\n\nIf you are here, then odds are you or someone you care about has been diagnosed with Behcet's Disease. Please subscribe to this subreddit and share it with anyone you know that may be interested. Thank you!", "Curious if anyone knows what this means for Behcets patients? If I understand correctly our inflammation is caused by Cytokines?  First time posting here. I have been trying to look for what would make us especially vulnerable to COVID since this began. Most of what I have seen/heard has been unstable ground at best. The best explanation I have heard has to do with increased blood clotting. This is interesting to me and may provide something more substantial. I am tired of arguing with friends/family, who are anti mask, about my own health conditions. Any insight would be appreciated! I know they are using trials in Israel\nWith colchicine with cytokine complications in covid. They do not really understand behcet's, or even most autoimmune diseases. They are the big mystery in medicine at the moment.\n\nAnd while yes, anyone with a preexisting health condition is at higher risk of a more server outcome from a covid infection, covid itself and the cytokine storm are not autoimmune in nature really. The problem with covid is its a real infection, and your bodies immune response is well warranted. But what I have read is that the particular part of the lungs it infects also happens to create the cells designed to calm that immune response. Any immune response inadvertently hands surrounding tissue, but in this case that tissue is what slows that response. So covid is actually harming itself but starting an unstoppable feedback loop in some people. On the bright side, this is exactly the kind of thing evolution takes care of pretty quickly as traits that kill the host get selected out pretty quickly in most viruses. Thanks for the response! So I guess a more accurate question would be if Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease shows an increased cytokine response? Or if there has been any research that connects Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease to an increase cytokine response.  If that is the case would people with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease be at high risk for the cytokine storm that makes COVID deadly. \n\nSorry- took me some time to figure out how to word the question.", "Hi!

Great guy, although his political views are a bit, um, wonky.\n\n Wut lol", "Skin and joint pain Does anyone else feel like their skin is constantly on fire when not in an active flare? I do not have any of the other usual symptoms except for joint pain which is on and off and some blurry vision with dizziness, but not of the \u2018aaaahh flare up!\u2019 kind, if that makes sense. I am trying to figure out if my skin is just residual inflammation (?) or if it is unrelated. I also have Hashimoto\u2019s which I know can cause skin problems but that is under control. \n\nJust hoping to hear about your skin experiences! Thanks x", "Advice with Triple Mouthwash (Triorasol) For context: I have had 'probable behcets' since I was about 14 (27 now). My most common symptom is ulcers and swelling in the mouth and throat, which pretty much happen every few weeks / all the time to varying degrees. I have been given triple mouthwash to take 4 times a day when I have ulcers and 2 times a day with no symptoms. I am also on two colchicine tablets a day. I used to go on steroids a lot, probably about 5 or 6 times in the last year (which I know isnt great!!). But I have now been stopped from taking them as I know have recurring shingles and it triggers nasty shingles flare ups. So they are taking a 'softer' approach to treatment. \n\nMy experience of taking triple mouthwash has not been great so far. Its staining my teeth and caused black tongue, which does not sound so bad but it sucks for self esteem. And I find it really tricky to get it to dissolve. \n\nAnyone using it and have some advice!? Thank you! I would not use that stuff. It is too harsh &amp; not very effective.  You might try swishing with baking soda. My best help comes from avoiding the foods that trigger ulcers. Over the years l've kept track and know what l can &amp; cannot eat. Have not tried mouthwash, but I have had \u201cprobable behcets\u201d for 10 years now and I can second the track your food approach. I love acidic and spicy foods but I keep them to a minimum, especially when I am stressed out. I have heard even chocolate and nuts can cause them for some people. Pineapple is a common one. I used to eat spicy papaya salad but I stay away now. I kept track of my foods in a symptom tracker app for a couple of years and went from having them once a month to every 2-3 months just by being careful. Also eating food slowly and not too hot. If I bite my lip, it is guaranteed to turn into an ulcer before it heals\u2026. Is that just me? I thought that was normal until I had my third genital flare in my mid twenties and someone finally said behcets. Thanks for your reply! That is really helpful. I have never tried baking soda so will give it a whirl. I have recently started tracking my food for dieting so will also keep note of any trigger foods! Thanks for your comment! That is great to hear it is been so effective to track your symptoms. I have been trying to eat more anti-inflammatory foods, but have not really noticed any effects (more due to lack of tracking!). My obvious triggers are stress and tiredness, and alcohol is a big no-no! \n\nIt is been super hard to get diagnosed in my experience. The most helpful thing is finding people with similar experiences! \n\nBest of luck to you! I sometimes take L-Lycine (natural amino acid) when I have particularly bad ulcers.\n\nIt is well known to help with cold sores, and it works on a similar pathway for our canker sores (puric acid inflammatory system).\n\nIn short, a key finding in Behcets patients is that we have increased Arginine in our body (which plays a part in the Nitric Oxide cycle, which plays a part in us getting ulcers+inflammation).\n\nL-Lysine directly competes with Arginine for a \"place at the table\" in cellular processes, thus causing cells to produce less of the very particular inflammatory markers that cause our ulcers. In particular, less arginine means less Nitric Oxide = Less 'fuel' for ulcers.\n\nI currently take Lysine powder as it is cheaper, but capsules work fine. It is very safe, but stick to the RDI! Also, best for short-term use as amino acids compete with each other, and by heavily supplementing one, you can deplete others.\n\nSome background reading:\n\n(A very complicated explanation of Arginine in Behcet's (\n\nThis paper (not about Behcets but about arginine and lysine) is also very explanatory of the processes - (\n\nThis is a paper that studied the significance of arginine/Nitric oxide in Behcets - (\n\nThis is a guide to one of the key inflammatory markers (IL-6 or interleukin-6) in Behcet's  and how to naturally reduce it- (", "On colchicine for a couple months, just some questions Hi guys, I recently got diagnosed with behcets and I am on colchicine for about 2 months now. I endured an extremely stressful situation about 2 years ago and I have had oral ulcers pretty much constantly since then \u2014 until I got on colchicine. I have only had 2 sores breakouts since then and they were comparatively very mild. I am just curious about other people\u2019s experiences with it. Do you ever get to no sores? Even during a flare up? I know everyone is different but I am hoping to look forward to being ulcer free. I also get sores on my genitals, usually only from tearing or stretching caused by sex. Does colchicine help with those? Also, have any of you noticed a reduction in general flares on colchicine?\n\nSorry for the wall of text! Thanks for sharing! I have been on colchicine for around 12 years, and while I still have flare ups about once every three month, they are extremely mild I. Comparison. I will almost always have 1 or 2 mouth ulcers, but you learn to not even notice them. I have the same genital sores as you seem to as well, although I also found I am usually \u201csore\u201d around the week I am supposed to get my period. (Which I usually only get 5 or 6 times a year)\n   Overall, very very happy on colchicine. I was having to be hospitalized once ever two months before going on the medication. Stay strong; you will learn your own body\u2019s triggers, and be able to take care of yourself. Mine: beer and bread. My two favorite things.\n  Side note, I started doing acupuncture a year ago with a doctor with a masters in Chinese medicine. She has done so much research in the Chinese version of Behcets, and has helped me in more ways that I thought possible. Good luck! Thanks so much for your response!! I love colchicine. I am amazed by being able to smile and eat and drink without crying or drooling lol. I will look into the stuff you said. I have been on Colchicine for about 6 months now and I have had oral ulcers pop up a couple times but the medication seems to keep them from going off the rails. They are usually gone within 24 hours. It is been pretty great for me. I will say that I have experienced some pretty noticeable hair loss that started almost immediately after I first started taking Colchicine, but I am still not positive that it is the cause. I have behcet's too and doctor once prescribed me colchicine and on next day I had severe diarrhea and stoped it since then. I have lot of ulcers most of time and mostly I ignore them untill sometime it get worse then I apply betnesol crushed in glycerin on ulcers locally and it is very effective.\n\nI really tried several time to find triggers but could not find one with surity e.g I found eggs cause me ulcers but once I did not have any ulcers I ate egg but did not get ulcers, similarly with milk. Even I avoid them.for 3 months still got ulcers.\n\nWhat I feel biggest cause is stress, sleeping pattern I also observed intermittent fasting helped lot but I lost so much weight and I had to stop it.\n\nNothing worked so far and my bad luck I got severe covid too now my lung also damaged and still recovering.\nLife has more problem with me :( I had terrible nausea, diarrhea and hypoglycemia when I started colchicine so I switched to taking it with dinner (I take the rest of my meds in the morning) and now I do not have any issues!\n\nI definitely flare way worse when I do not get enough sleep. \n\nI am sorry about that!! I hope you recover soon. Do not give up on feeling better! Thanks so much for sharing! Yeah if I get any ulcers they usually do not fully form and go away pretty fast. It is so interesting that they try to form and are stopped at that point rather than not forming at all! I have been on Colchicine for 2ish years now and it has worked wonders for my oral ulcers. I used to get them 2-3 times a month, and they would last for two weeks at a time, but I think the past two years I have only gotten 4 episodes total. My other symptoms do not appear to have been reduced too much, but the ulcers made me miserable that even just taking that away made me feel better.", "Probenecid-colchicine? I have been using colchicine to control ulcers lately and it works well but is expensive and many pharmacies near me do not keep it stocked. I am not sure why a gout med works for ulcers but I see that probenecid-colchicine is MUCH cheaper\u2026 I do not want to take a med I do not need but would probenicid-colchicine have a similar or better benefit for this? Since I do not understand the mechanisms behind it working, I am curious.", "Low-carb for Beh\u00e7et's flare-ups? So a (62F) friend of mine who has Beh\u00e7et started doing low-carb two months ago (for weight loss). Not Keto, just low-carb since she is still having fruits and a bigger portion of protein.\n\nshe used to have 3 really bad flare-ups almost every month and since she started her diet she did not get any,  it got me wondering if this is a thing? I did not find a lot of research on this when I googled it and even here i found some threads saying it made their flare ups worse so now I am wondering if it is the low-carb or her cutting something in specific in her diet? It is really up to randomness.\nBD can affect patients in completely different ways; it is up to everybody finding what works best for them. \nIf your friend found out that keeping a low carbs diet makes her feel better, then she should keep doing that, no reason trying to understand whether it is the low carbs or something she removed. For example I found out that my diet does not effect my flares, so I just east whatever I feel like eating (ofc trying to keep a pretty balanced diet, but being Mediterranean that is basically how I have been grown up, maybe a bit more leaning on the heavy carbs side, but by keeping a bare minimum of physical exercise it is totally fine). Anyways hope she gets better, for me the real deal was getting on Humira: it makes me feel a bit tired, but atleast I do not have those awful pains almost everywhere in my body. &gt;Humira\n\nShe is actually Mediterranean as well :) thank you I hope you get better too. I agree with /u/Elq3 that it is all about figuring out what works best for you. I have experimented with a lot of different diets over the years, including low-carb and (virtually) no-carb diets. Personally, carbohydrate intake does not seem to affect my flares. However, when I am eating at a caloric deficit (eating less calories than I burn off daily), I seem to be more prone to flares. \n\nI am very active and need to eat a ton just to maintain my weight. For years, I have settled into a high-protein, low-carb, medium-fat diet. It works for me. But it is all about finding out what works for *you*. \n\nThat being said, there are countless reports around the internet of people significantly improving their various autoimmune/autoinflammatory conditions by cutting carbs from their diets. There is definitely something to it - for some people. Will it work for you? The only way to know is to try. I say go for it. And then let us know how it works out. Best of luck! Worth a try. If it does not help then at least you will know I did intermittent fasting for 9 months I did not eat 18 hours anything just took water, lemon water with salts in that window and use to eat in 6 hour window. It had improved my condition very much but I started to lose my muscles and my biceps started to become fluffy and I had to stop it. I wanted to start it again with 12 hours eating and 12 hours fasting again but covid made my weak and still did not recover.", "Starting Remicade. Given methotrexate, folic acid, and vitamin d to prepare my body. Any other tips or advice? Hello! I am going to be starting Remicade within the next few weeks. My rheumatologist has prescribed me methotrexate, folic acid, and vitamin d to help prepare my system for it. Is there any advice or tips I should be aware of?\n\nI have heard some people take benadryl before their infusion. Why is that?\n\nWill I be really tired after the infusion? Will I need someone to take me to the appointment or pick me up?\n\nThanks in advance. :) Remicade was the first thing I was given for Behcets disease as my first symptom was serious eye involvement.  I have a two hour infusion every four weeks.  I do not have any side effects other than a headache about half way through and then I feel tired the next day.  I am now also on azathioprine (also called Imuran) 100 mg daily.  Do not worry, it will not be that bad! I have been on remicade for about a year now and it is been really helpful. I was on humira first but it did not control my uveitis fully. \n\nI am given Tylenol and Allegra at my infusion center before they start and I once had a mild reaction so I was given benedryl that day and for a few infusions after. I never had another reaction and I am now back to Allegra. \n\nWhen I was given benedryl I could not drive myself and now I can. It takes about 2 hours and I sometimes get a headache. Mostly I feel tired the next day. I work m-f so I get my infusion Friday afternoon and rest that night and that Saturday and I feel like a new woman that Sunday! \n\nThe mtx is likely to help prevent antibodies to the remicade, the folic acid and vitamin d is for your body to tolerate mtx better. I was on imuran but I am trying to get pregnant so I have stopped with no change in remicade. \n\nI get my infusion every 6 weeks. I bring a blanket, socks and a book or my iPad and enjoy some unplugged time! Thank you! So great to hear that a lot of people find relief with Remicade. I am hoping it is the golden ticket to all of my symptoms too. I have not yet had kids of my own and have been looking into fertility related issues with all these drugs and so far I have not seen anything negative or that it has an impact whatsoever. Actually really comforting to know that information and that Remicade can be continued into pregnancy. One of my concerns is being stuck in a consistent flare during pregnancy so I am really hoping I can get this disease under control before we start trying. I wish you luck!!! Just a warning methotrexate is not okay to take while you try to get pregnant! I believe it can even cause miscarriages. \n\nImuran is not as contraindicated but my obgyn, MFM and rheumatologist thought it would be best to get off it. Remicade will be given with Benadryl for the first few times.", "Inner Ear Symptoms Hi everyone! Does anyone here with Behcet's also experience inner ear symptoms? I have had issues with my right ear since I was an infant. I am wondering whether it is linked to my Behcet's, or if it is just another coincidental medical issue I have to deal with.\n\nI ask because my right ear is usually the first indication of an upcoming flare. I will hear ringing (I have constant tinnitus, but it worsens right before flares), pressure, throbbing, and lots of pain. It usually causes vertigo and nausea, and sometimes \"spreads\" to my throat. Whenever I am on oral prednisone, it goes away instantly with all the other Behcet's symptoms.\n\nBUT I recently saw an ENT who specializes in autoimmune patients, and he suggested I likely just have inner ear problems unrelated to Behcets. I found it hard to believe considering how closely the symptoms are linked to my flares, and how well I respond to Prednisone. But I think it could also make sense since I have been struggling with this since infancy (you cannot have Behcet's as a baby, right??). I have had 2 ear surgeries on the right ear, so maybe it is just bad luck? Does anyone else here with Behcet's share a similar experience? I am most interested in relief (besides prednisone) if anyone has advice! I have similar issues, although I have not had ear issues since I was little - it started at the same time as the other symptoms! \n\nI have major pressure and pain but no infection and it is typically just in one ear. I have had uveitis and ear pain at the same time on the same side so I am not sure if it is related...but I also have throat pain on that side too. \n\nMy ent put a tube in that ear and it helped a lot, but the process of getting the tube was pretty miserable and I am not looking forward to it coming up again soon Yes. I am very similar. I have tinnitus in both ears, but it gets worse around a flare.\n\nAbout 5 years ago, just a couple weeks before getting massive clots in both legs (for the second time) but after years of remission, I got severe labrynthitis in my left ear. It came on out of nowhere. Everything was fine, then I stood up and almost fell over cause my balance was way off. Took a couple weeks to get back to normal. That was my body's way of letting me know that the Behcet's was coming out to play again.\n\nMy doctor initially thought my ear problem was unrelated to Behcet's, too. But I knew better. It can absolutely cause ear inflammation. I am actually going through something similar right now. After months of being dizzy and ringing, they found superior canal wall dehiscence in my right ear after getting a CT scan of them. Essentially a part of my inner ear bones eroded away and they do not know why. They keep asking me if I had head trauma and I have not had any. My rheumatologist says he does not think it is related to the behcets but cannot say for sure. Ask for a CT of your ears maybe they can find something. Thank you so much for the response! It is nice to know I am not alone. I also get inflammation in my right eye whenever the ear starts acting up. It is like the right side of my head is about to explode.\n\nI got ear tubes put in as a baby but maybe I should explore doing it again. I will ask my doc. Thank you! My ears just started to get behcets in it. It feels like a giant wax build up when I get them and its definitely worse during a flare. I have never had ear issues and to this day have never had an ear infection, but the tube helped relieve the pressure. \n\nMy ent said the disease just causes inflammation and it is just another place it effects Thank you for your response! I have learned to trust my intuition and agree that it is definitely related to my disease. Wishing you well. This is fascinating! I actually had a CT of my right ear / temporal bone in 2015, before I ever knew what Behcets was. The doc found a mass behind the bone which he suspected was causing my pain, and when he went in to remove it surgically (mastoidectomy), it was gone. There was just lots of debris leftover which he cleaned up, and I felt so much better. He suggested it could have just been some inflammation, and now that I know I have behcets, it makes more sense to me. \n\nI think I am due for another CT considering the return of symptoms. Thank you so much for the advice! Yes I understand your pain! Have you found any solutions for relief? Just to use q tips as much as I can Whoa, this is absolutely insane! There is so much more to this illness than we are aware of. Yes, middle ear inflammation can occur in Behcet's and is more common in patients who have an onset of symptoms in or near a tonsil or adenoids. Hearing loss (temporary or permanent) can also result from Behcet's. Middle ear symptoms or a sign such as a loss of hearing should be taken seriously and treated aggressively. Tinnitus and vertigo are not always present though middle ear pain typically is. This is a good review article: (\n\nHere are some others:\n\n(\n\n(", "discord? hi everyone- I am new to this sub and to my Behcet's diagnosis (it is been only 2 or 3 months) and I am wondering if there is a discord server for this channel? and if not, if anyone else would be interested in a discord server for support for Behcet's disease I would be happy to make one.

Hi everyone, \nI  am not officially diagnosed with Behcet\u2019s, but it is been tossed around. I have always been prone to mouth ulcers, GI ulcers, and last summer I was misdiagnosed on sight with genital herpes (subsequent negative swab and HSV1&amp;2 blood tests). \n\nThis month has been brutal. I got hit with pretty bad fatigue and dizziness on Aug 3rd that progressed into ice pick headaches behind the left eye and ear pain. Was treated for a sinus infection on the 11th. Woke up with muscle weakness and blurry vision on the 15th, went to ER, CT showed no sinus infection or abnormalities. Normal blood work. Went for an MRI two days later, no abnormalities. SED and CRP normal. Awaiting ANA (also ELISA, I traveled to places with ticks and mosquitoes this summer). Doc would not run an ANCA, but I am ordering my own. \nAlso developed shingles on the 18th. (It is been a blast.)\n\nOnly thing\u2014 I do not currently have any mouth ulcers, genital ulcers, or skin ulcers. \n\nDoes this sound like Behcet\u2019s? (Or NB?)\n\nThanks for any input! It is hard to find knowledgeable providers on this one, and I am so confused about these symptoms! I have neuro behcets. I get more headaches with lack of focus, mimics adhd. Severe anxiety for no reason. And histamine intolerance that causes migraines. \n\nMy everyday symptoms are arthritis, joint pain, red hand Flushing, urticaria, heat sensitivity, skin lesions mouth, nose ears ulcers. I also get MS type numbness and tingling and extreme muscle weakness. \n\nBehcets has a lot of faces but skin lesion biopsy are usually the easiest way to figure out if it is behcet's. Thank you so much for sharing. Some of those everyday symptoms are tough, and relatable. My heart goes out to you. Next time I do have one, I will try to get it biopsies. Hoping for some answers, and more importantly- some relief!, soon. Did you have a skin lesion biopsy? What did it showe? I know the majority of Bechet\u2019s associated cutaneous manifestations actually present histologically as folliculitis, so I am interested to hear if yours was specific! I had a rash on my legs for over 6 month's that they first thought was poison ivy. Then after 3 failed treatments went in to biopsy and found in the lesions on my legs.", "Restless Leg Syndrome &amp; Behcets? Not officially diagnosed however I am on Otezla which seem to be working on my continuous canker sores.\n\nHowever, recently I started developing growing pains in my ankles/legs normally in the evening. After research it seems I might have Restless Leg Syndrome. \n\nAnyone else?\n\nStill working through doctors to find out if I officially have Behcets.... what a process. My mom has both. Do you have fibromyalgia too? I feel like that could relate to both Have not even looked at that....\n\nStill trying to figure out tests. I originally went to doctors for continuous canker sores. Otezla seems to be helping. Been 2.5 weeks since one after started.\n\nStarted noticing RLS and stuffy-feeling joints. I have had restless legs as a side effect of some other meds, and taking magnesium supplements either made it better or I my restless legs got better independently from me taking the magnesium supplements. As I understand it, (though of course this is not medical advice as taking such from a random reddit user is iffy at least), but apparently magnesium deficiency is one of the most common reasons for restless legs, and having a mild deficiency can be ok until you start on some medication, and the medication pushes you over the \"limit\" to trigger your restless legs. So while the medication was what changed, getting enough magnesium in you could still stop it.\n\nYou can also get more magnesium into your body by using Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) in your bathwater and then air drying your skin after bathing. According to the instructions you should not have soap or shampoo in that bathwater to get the effect on your bodies magnesium levels though. Magnesium supplements will be here tomorrow. Thanks for the reply. I will definitely give it a shot. I get major leg aches and have to move them to help with the cramps. I take magnesium at night snd it helps a ton. Just be aware magnesium can help you have a bowel movement so if you are someone dealing with gut issues look into supplement options and chat with your doctor. I just take a generic magnesium pill from Amazon and it does wonder. My bowels were a mess before and adding the magnesium helped more than it hurt so I am not having issues with that either. You will never look back! Magnesium stopped me from spending hours massaging my aching legs each day. Lol! I am dealing with the Otezla side effects of messing with my stomach haha.", "Preparing for the first Rheumatology visit Hey r/Behcets,\n\n\nI have my first appointment with a rheumatologist in a couple months, and I want to be prepared. \n\n\n\nDo you have any recommendations or suggestions? What was your first rheumatology visit like? \n\n\n\nThank you and I hope you are all doing well! The big piece of advice I have is to **document everything.** Behcet's Disease is difficult to diagnose - it is diagnosed through an exclusion of other diseases + an assessment of the symptoms. Since BD oftentimes occurs in episodes/flares, it is VERY IMPORTANT to have a timeline of when flares happen, what the symptoms were, and how it resolved. \n\nThis is a bit extra, but worked very well for me: email/fax your rheumatologist a word doc that includes the following information:\n\n1) A timeline of each BD flare: detailing when it started, what the symptoms were, and how it resolved. \n\n2) A brief family history of autoimmune diseases or genetic ancestry if it is relevant. \n\n3) Pictures of ulcers, rashes, or other physical manifestations. \n\n4) Any bloodwork, tests, and/or medical records. I have had several instances where a doctor never received this information from another doctor's office - so it never hurts to collate it and send it along yourself. \n\nThis made my first rheumatology appointment VERY EASY - the doctor read the report ahead of time - so it was just a couple clarifying questions, then a discussion around the tests, likely diagnosis, and then treatments. \nI used the above form to keep track of my appointment and make sure I have everything answered \nI go in with this history: \nRecurrent Oral Ulcers- How often, how many, and how painful\nSkin Lesions- How often, where, describe what they look like (open sores, scabs, rash)\nRecurrent Genital Ulcers- How Often, how Many, and how painful\nOcular Disease- Do you have dry eye, styes in the eye, excessive tears, pain? is the pain fullness and dull or sharp and stabby\nArthritis / Joint Pain - Do you have sharp stabby pain in any joints or dull and achy. are joints warm to the touch? do they hurt more during a certain time of the day\n\nThe biggest thing is to focus on what you want from the specialist. Is your goal to be symptom-free? That might not be possible on the first visit, but pick one thing to focus on for treatment that is causing you the most upset. All of the above ! Get a proper folder to keep medical records in from all different specialists. Take pictures of everything that you can. I keep a word doc that I update with all flares and symptoms and I use that to fill in my rheumatologist at each appointment. \n\nIts amazing how much we forget or how we just get so accustomed to symptoms that we dont think to mention it.\n\nThey want and need a full picture of your symptoms and even with the above, they may be hesitant to give a definitive diagnosis at the 1st appointment.\n\nDont be discouraged if it does not happen right away. It is a process. Good luck! I had to see 4 rheums over the course of 8 years til I got one that gave me the Dx. My best suggestion (along with everyone above) is documentation and you should type up a medical history in a word document. I send one to the docs office via email prior to the appointment and request the doctor read well before out appt. I have hand delivered when they said they do not have an email. I bring 2 more copies (1-2 pgs max) to the appt w me-one for the doc, one for me. It is amazing what I forget when there! I will even forget to use the one I brought! Also, keep your own notes from the appt. A lot gets covered quickly. In your medical history notes, you can add a list of questions you have for the doc in case you forget in appt. Best of luck! You got this!! So agree with how much we forget and get used to and therefore forget to mention! The more details the better! \n\nHave any and all medical docs available \u2014 any blood tests or other tests/biopsies/etc you have had done whether they were negative or not. It will help weed out other illnesses and get you closer to an actual diagnosis. \n\nGood luck and I hope you get the relief you are seeking very soon!!", "Are your eczema (skin rash) come and go as ulcers? or stay in the same place getting larger for a long time I am wondering if your skin lesions or skin rash appear in different places, come and go, or there is only one for a long time?

Have folks had luck with dietary modifications and if so what seems to be most helpful? Has anyone tried AIP? Definitely. I am on a high meat(grass fed beef and lamb mostly) gluten and sugar free diet. Only veggies I eat are cauliflower, zucchini and onion.. as I am also sensitive to oxalates (something I had not even heard of before looking into the effect of diet on Behcets and general inflammation)... so no nuts, no vegetable and seed oils, among other things. I do eat seasonal fruits.\n \nPlant based does not work for me at all, but taking your time to eliminating gradually will help you figure out what works for you. \n\nI follow the carnivore (Paul Saladino, Shawn Baker) and paleo communities (Terry Wahls).. as well as Sally K Norton who is deep into oxalates. Countless podcasts and nutritional scientists you can watch and read about will help you on the journey. I have been vegetarian for 10 years, pre-diagnosis. With my recent flare up, I have noticed that packaged snacks are affecting me (inflammation, stomach pain). I am trying to figure out if it is the sugar, grains, processing? Cutting those out helps me. More natural foods do not make me feel sick at all. Intermittent fasting helps too, as I get worse symptoms starting when I eat around 2pm. No idea why. I am newly diagnosed, most recent flare up started in August. Dietary modifications help me SO much! It is a really big struggle for me to stick to; (27F) I have been vegan for 8 years but the kind that loves \"junk food\" and bread. Adjusting and sticking to a good dietary routine is incredibly time-consuming. It requires making every meal that you eat basically from scratch.\n\nI have been in what feels like a perpetual flare for a few months, joint pain etc is controlled with prednisone and other meds, but the fatigue and myofascial pain is daily. Then I am a PhD student which takes about 10 hours/day when I am able. This means time and energy for cooking is slim. Regardless of how I am feeling, the one thing I stick to is no gluten and it makes a world of difference. When I do have weak moments and give in I immediately feel bad for the rest of the day - literally within 30 minutes I end up needing to go lay down. I did not realize how much it impacted me until managing to consistently cut it out which meant isolating the moments when I did eat it. \n\nWeeks that I food prep and stay committed are always better without fail. I do not follow the AIP, because genuinely that plus plant-based is too much for me to handle. Maybe when the food routine actually becomes more practiced... My basic goals are:\n\n\\- no gluten\n\n\\- no sugar (this one also makes a MAJOR difference)\n\n\\- no processed foods, chips etc\n\n\\- tempeh over tofu\n\n\\- edamame and peas for high protein veggies, beets and carrots also work for me\n\n\\- quinoa, GF oats, brown rice, or sweet potato in most meals\n\n\\- no coffee (RIP I have also been a barista/coffee professional for a decade)\n\n\\- intermittent fasting does not work for me at all - hunger makes me nauseous but that is partially a reaction to Azathioprine.\n\n\\- turmeric every day\n\nMy list is really different from u/Jess_Minda and u/SisMcChurch ! These things can be really personal, especially based on blood types. I also recommend cutting things out gradually so you can really isolate what makes a difference for you. Wish I had advice on how to best implement it into your lifestyle, but I am still trying to figure that part out too. COVID seems like a good time to make the habit since so many of us are spending more time at home. I like the Oh She Glows cookbook; helps me think outside of my usual box.\n\nGood luck!! And congrats on finally getting a diagnosis - huge step toward feeling better :) I would agree. I would say universal truth is that gluten and sugar are inflammatory. Start with removing them and see how you feel from there.\n\nThat is what I did - gluten and sugar out immediately after diagnosis. After that I removed polyunsaturated fats ... but I was eating potatoes a lot and almonds ...then I got kidney stones and kidney infection realised oxalates really affect me...which meant I needed to exclude potatoes and almonds entirely... as well as soy, okra,sweet potatoes, and many other plant foods. \n\nSo it is been a journey which has led me to the grass fed meats and other animal products as well as select fruits and vegetables. Thank you! When you say sugar you mean added sugars, right? Yes all added sugars. Did you try intermittent fasting? Thank you! Your list is really helpful! This is really good information as I am trying to figure out my own food path. I have some questions, if you do not mind...\n\nI was vegan for like 3 years before switching to vegetarian, does being vegan help your symptoms? Or do you do it by choice? It is a lot more work for me, but if it helps I do not mind going back to it. \n\nWhat is the no gluten thing?? I have read this a few times recently, does gluten cause inflammation? As opposed to all grains? I do not even know what gluten means, do I just follow a basic gluten-free diet (after I Google it)?\n\nI agree no junk food, do you know why? Is there a pattern I should look for? Is it all processed foods?\n\nWhy tempeh over tofu?\n\nWhy no coffee? (I have not noticed this yet)\n\nAnd what do you do for snacks/easy meals? (I used to just grab a kind bar, fig bar, larbar, cliff bar... But now those are seeming to not work for me. Vega protein shake maybe?) Hey! Sorry for the late response...\n\nI have been vegan for 8 years now. I think not eating meat makes the other restrictions more challenging, but dairy is not ideal for inflammation anyway. At this point I do not think I could tolerate meat so I have just maintained it. I wish I could say if it helps or hurts but I could not tell you the difference.\n\nI am no dietician, but every anti-inflammatory diet I have looked into says to cut out gluten. It is a huge component of wheat products, so bread, pasta, anything with flour. Especially beer! A common fact that circulates is that one beer has as much gluten as 7 pieces of bread. Worth fact checking that exact statistic though... Luckily, if you are vegetarian as opposed to vegan there are endless gluten free versions of these foods available! Gluten free bread is rarely the same, but the GF flours and pastas can be pretty indistinguishable. \n\nMaybe all processed foods, but so far I have found it perfectly fine with just cutting out ones with cane sugar or heavy added salt. So I will buy some organic/natural packaged snack foods like kale chips or sweet potato chips and they seem to be fine or at least better than other options.\n\nSnacks can be tough but I really like larabars. They have like 3-5 ingredients depending on the flavor so I think they are fine. Some of the others you have listed like clif bars have a lot more.\n\nCaffeine is another consistent \u201cavoid\u201d on anti inflammatory diet plans. I wish I could explain why, but it is sort of hard on your GI and cardio systems.\n\nTofu and tempeh are processed differently. Tempeh is fermented and the way it breaks down releases ACE inhibitors which are good for regulating blood pressure. Tofu is fine, it is not a huge deal but tempeh is more beneficial. If you are vegetarian one HUGE thing to look out for is seitan!!!! Yes it makes for some incredible fake meats but it is literally processed wheat gluten. Like they isolate the gluten and make the meats out of it. I had no idea just how common it is, but all gardein products are seitan as well as some tofurkey products like the sausages.\n\nI hope this helps! I will check back sooner in case you have more questions :) Wow, that is really good to know! Had no idea gardein was wheat gluten, I love that brand. :( \n\nCould you possibly list some of your food staples? If I cut out gluten (and gardein), I have no idea what to eat besides produce and soy milk. I cannot even think of 5 foods I could eat for a day, let alone enough for a week. \n\nSoy milk\n\nFruits + veg\n\nLarabars\n\nTempeh (need to find this)\n\nBeans and rice? \n\nCorn tortilla instead of wheat?\n\nGreek yogurt\n\nCheese\n\nNuts/spreads\n\nThanks for your help, it is been immense. Sure thing! Here are some staple meals in my house.\n\nBreakfast: GF waffles, Oatmeal, protein/green smoothie, yogurt with granola, tofu scramble, I also really like fried rice for breakfast though I know that is not a typical breakfast food.\n\nLunch: veggie wrap, brown rice bowl with veggies, salad, spiced chickpea wrap with tahini sauce\n\nSnack: apple with peanut butter, banana, corn tortilla chips and salsa or guacamole, larabar\n\nDinner: pad thai (rice noodles), grits bowl with veggies and bbq tempeh, brown rice or quinoa bowl, tacos (yeah, corn tortillas!), soup, stuffed sweet potato, stir fry\n\nDessert: fruit crisp (my topping is oatmeal/almonds and I sweeten with honey), macaroons, peanut butter chocolate bars - Lily's chocolate is sugar-free for baking\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also some frozen dinners that I keep on hand. Not ideal, but on high pain or fatigue days, if I cannot handle cooking they are good to have around. Amy's makes a lot that are vegan and GF, and your options are way expanded if you are eating dairy too.\n\nI suggest making a big pot of brown rice so you can make an easy meal. I also like to have some sauces/dressings available. I keep a tahini sauce and a citrus scallion sauce stocked. Happy to share some recipes or cookbooks :) Thank you, thank you, thank you! \ud83e\udd29\u2728 This is just what I needed. It seemed like a huge change, but this is super doable. Thank you so much!!!!", "Diagnosis help- finding a doctor who listens I have experienced mysterious recurrent genital sores for the last 4 years that hurt so bad I cannot urinate. Every time I see a doctor (tried the gynecologist, primary care, urgent care) the immediate assumption is an STD and they run a panel. The worst part is when they call me 2 weeks later surprised that I am clean and do not offer any additional diagnosis help, or anything to ease my symptoms. The sores do not resolve for weeks and it is incredibly difficult to go about my life and work. I also have experienced eye pain, blurred vision, and sensitivity but never associated the two until I read about Behcet\u2019s. I currently have sores on both my genitals and 1 in my mouth right now (had mouth sores before but never very severe). I was so relieved to find this community and was hoping I could get guidance on the following:\n\n1) Do my symptoms sound like it could be Behcet\u2019s?\n\n2) How to find and explain my symptoms to a doctor who can actually diagnose and treat me instead of just making me spend more $ on unnecessary STD panels. This is in the US where I cannot go to a specialist without a referral \n\nThank you so much! &gt;This is in the US where I cannot go to a specialist without a referral\n\nAre you absolutely sure about that? I thought the same thing, but I was confusing plans. Double check?\n\nTake pictures. This was hard for me to do, positioning wise, and just.. who wants pictures of their genital and oral sores? This helped me with my doctors a lot.\n\nYou need to get in front of a rheumatologist and an eye doctor who hopefully specializes in uveitis (my RA referred me to a regional specialist who ONLY sees uveitis patients, who apparently sees like 25% of the Behcets patients in the US, there are not tons of us)\n\nAnyway, my path looked like this.. After a few basically random STD screens, metabolic panels, etc.. everyting was always fine and it was just something I was going to have to deal with.\n\nThen one excruciatingly hot and humid day, with multiple sores the size of quarters, and a plan to end it once and for all.. I walked into my doctors office, told the first GP that saw me that I am 90% sure this has to be Behcets, he told me it could not be, because I told him I was celebate and all my STD screens came back negative. I basically yelled at him and told him he did not know what he was talking about, useless, and if someone told me to take an oatmeal bath one more time I was going to need to be restrained.\n\nI honestly do not remember how that visit ended, except I was seeing red. So tired of no one listening.\n\nThat evening around 11pm!?! he called me at home, apologized, agreed the symptoms lined up, and referred me to an RA.\n\nI had mostly cleared up by the time I got to see the RA, but I HAD PICTURES! and descriptions, and got me into said eye doctor asap because even though I did not really have eye symptoms, if/when they come it can be quick (Both of them wanted records of my eye health, to compare in the future)\n\nI am still working on treating it, I still get flare ups, they are not nearly as bad, and I have options if it becomes too much. (prednisone, awful stuff, but works like magic on our sores)\n\nSores in places that used to take weeks or a month or more to heal are now gone in 2 or 3 days.\n\nSorry if this is rambling. Just be straight up with your GP. Tell him you are not trying to play doctor google, that you are just trying to be your own best advocate, and you NEED to be seen by an RA. Lie and say you have ancestors who worked the Silk Road... Thank you so much for this! I will need to double check the specialist referral thing. I have taken pictures of all my nasty sores over the past few years and I will just need to be extra assertive at my next visit. Gives me hope that you were finally able to get through to your PCP. To stop all the STD nonsense, my daughter went to a dermatologist and had a vaginal ulcer biopsied. The report came back, no STDs but skin changes are present that are normally seen in Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. She did not have to be tested for STDs after that. First off, if someone says something, believe them. I live in the US and know most insurances will not let you see ~~pay for~~ a specialist visit without it coming from a referral. Moreover you may not even be able to schedule with a rheumatologist without a referral. So please do not say \u201care you sure?\u201d unless you know for a fact something to the contrary. And even then, you can just say \u201ci know you said x and I believe that true most of the time. Here is another way to approach x though\u201d.\n\nPeople come to this page to get help, not to experience the same invalidating rhetoric they experience everywhere else.\n\nOkay now that that is out of the way,  \u2014 you will need to demand a referral to a rheumatologist through your primary care physician. If you happen to have went to the ER at some point, you can ask there, too, but it will likely be more successful coming from your PCP. They must give you a referral if you are having unexplained symptoms. If they do not, you can change pcps. \n\nI also recommend you start writing down your symptoms to get a picture on how frequently they pop up, the severity, and what you have tried already. That way they stop std testing you and explore other root causes. So sorry to hear you are experiencing all this. You are not alone. It took years of self advocacy for me to get a diagnosis and most of the care i need (still need a rhemy and obgyn since i relocated states but i have hope). Good to know! Thank you! Thank you so much for this! Going to try and get an appointment with my PCP asap and steer the direction to the fact that I have unexplained symptoms and need to see a rheumatologist.", "Appointment with doctor tomorrow After two ER visits in a week, I have been searching for an answer and stumbled upon this disease.  I have an appointment tomorrow with my primary care doctor and I am trying to figure out how to bring this up or what to expect.\n\nLong term symptoms:\n\n\\-Joint pain and fatigue\n\n\\-Frequent canker sores\n\n\\-Labia majora ulcers 1-2x annually\n\n\\-Folliculitis\n\nRecent symptoms sent to the ER:\n\n\\-Scleritis\n\n\\-Severe intestinal pain\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy doctor and I have been trying to figure out the reason for the long term symptoms for awhile and I saw a rheumotologist who said it was all just Fibromyalgia but after the recent ER visits, I am not considering this is an option?  How difficult was it to get a proven diagnosis? Ended up getting diagnosed today Best of luck. Get lots of rest during flairs. It took me two years to get diagnosed (diagnosed in 2018) and it was a fight and a roller coaster. Drink lots of fluids. Water, water, water. And rest. I am now getting lots of complications, as stress complicates the disease exponentially. Because my Beh\u00e7et\u2019s presents inside my throat, mouth and eustacian tubes, I am now getting BPPV (crystals dislodging in my ear and causing extreme vertigo) and recurring shingles which is also contributing to the BPPV. \n\nThere is not near enough data about this and do not be surprised if future medial professionals ask what it is or give you a look. It is not widely known yet but it is important to speak up and tell them. Do not let them downplay you because we are always learning new stuff about it all the time. \n\nKeeping a daily health journal will help you track your symptoms and help you keep your sanity. I found that the Anti-inflammatory diet helps me the most but I think that is personal to me and not my place to recommend to you. I do recommend that you talk to your regular physician and your rheumatologist about possible diet changes to help manage the symptoms. Joint pain can drive you crazy, as you know, so get a plan, either CBD pain balm or THC if you can stand it. Epsom salt baths, ice packs followed by warm packs. Just keep trying to find what works for you. \n\nHave you been prescribed Gabapentin or an anti depressant? They actually help a lot of people especially with the joint pain. I was totally against them at the beginning and now they give me decent quality of life with low side effects. I always insist on keeping it the lowest dose possible. Good luck.", "Anyone gotten their 3rd dose Covid Vaccine yet? I started taking azathioprine a couple months ago and asked my rheumatologist if I should consider getting a booster vaccine.  He told me it was definitely a good idea.  I got my flu shot two days ago on Friday and it feels like the side effects are worse now that I am on immunosuppressants.  Flu shots do not normally affect me that much, but I have been feeling very crummy all weekend.  I am curious what to expect from getting my booster vaccine in a few weeks.  Any stories?  Take care everyone I got mine a month or so ago. Mostly just a sore arm and 1 day of very mild symptoms (lightheaded-ness). I had no reaction to the first one and a very similar reaction to the second one. I am on azathioprine also and was advised by a pharmacist that I did not need a third shot (I am between rheums right now). Said they were mostly looking for people on high doses of prednisone, etc. The second dose knocked me down for like a week though, so I assume I had a solid immune response.\n\nI had my flu shot three days ago and feel like absolute garbage also; maybe it is just this year's shot? I have been on azathioprine for years and have never reacted to a flu shot like this. I take 100mg of azathioprine and 2.5 of prednisone currently, and was told to take a 3rd dose.\n\n1st dose was fine, I felt extremely tired and sleepy for 3 days.\n2nd dose I did a big fever in the first night 38.5\u00b0C but that is all.\n3rd dose was some days ago. I felt a bit lightheaded, very tired for the next two days, but otherwise nothing.\n\nFor reference, I took Pfizer always. \nFor the 3rd dose they told me to take paracetamol, preventive: do, to take it as soon as I arrived home. I did not - I wanted to see the effects, like fever. \n\nI was told by the doctors that it is a good thing to have some reaction- means it is working. So I kind of wanted to get a tiny bit sick! I was disappointed I did not have fever on the 3rd dose.\n\nSoon I will do that test to see the level of antibodies I have!\n\nStay safe, and good luck! 38\u00b0C is equivalent to 101\u00b0F, which is 311K.\n---\n^(I am a bot that converts temperature between two units humans can understand, then convert it to Kelvin for bots and physicists to understand) I got mine about a week ago. I got it the same day as my flu shot. I actually think my flu shot arm hurt more although my covid arm hurt for longer. I was mostly just tired and a little achy. My mom got hers about half a week ago (she has Bechets) since she is about to start chemo soon. She told me that she had a fever and was throwing up, but it only lasted a day or so. She is already back to her normal self.\nI hope all goes well for you when you get it. I had the 3rd Moderna about 2 weeks ago. My rheum advised that on azathioprine, you are considered moderate to severely immunosuppressed and advised the shot. He also said to stop taking the med 1 week before and 1 week after. I did. I was hit soo hard by the 3rd shot. 1 and 2 were fine. At worst a super mild hangover. 3 was full blown flu like symptoms. Fever, nausea, exhausted, body pain. \n\nI was not taking azathioprine when I got my first 2 doses, but #3 was a lot. Glad I got it done though. I magically felt 100% better half way through day 3 I got a third dose of Moderna and it was far worse than the second dose. Side effects started around 12 hours after the shot then lasted \\~36 hours after that. They were the same as the second shot, just more severe and longer duration. This flu shot also produced a much more robust response in healthy individuals as well, so I am not sure it can be completely tied to you starting the azathioprine. Do you know if biologics like Humira and Enbrel are considered mild - moderate immunosuppressants? I am hearing alternating things, but I know they are t as immunosuppressive as azathioprine. Definitely this years shot!!", "Weird Leg Symptoms? Hey everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince Thanksgiving, I have been experiencing really weird things with my legs. On 3 separate occasions, part of my lower leg (twice in my calf, once around my achilles) basically \"clamped up\" and got swollen, and it became impossible to walk normally and the area became painful to the touch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought it was a blood clot at first, but one extremely expensive ER visit later and apparently the veins and arteries are completely clear. The Docs were also at a loss for what the cause could be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis does not sound like any Behcet's syndrome symptom that I have heard of before, but I thought it was worth a shot asking on here anyway. Has anyone experienced this before? How are your potassium levels? I get cramps often. I drink Gatorade and eat tons of potatoes to help with this. \n\nAlso, Behcets is a vascular disease. It can basically attack anything at any time. I am not sure if this is too off from what you are describing but are they erythema nodosum?  I get them on my lower legs - they are red, painful and make my legs feel \"tight\" if that makes sense.  And I also agree with what u/Muffinman1111112 said - I have trouble with my potassium levels too, which can cause cramps.  Hope you find some answers. Haha it is funny cause everyone I speak to about this rightfully asks me about my potassium intake. The truth is that since September or so I have been eating a banana daily so it is definitely not that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah I know Behcet's strikes at random, but I am just hoping to discern whether this is Behcet's or an unfortunate new condition I have to deal with. I do not know if the ultrasound I received would reveal whether the blood vessels were inflamed or not. If they were that would almost certainly be BD, if not, idk. &gt;erythema nodosum\n\nI do get that too! But this at least seems different because the skin itself does not change color at all, and it happens at the back of my leg, not at the front. It also feels deeper than skin level, though I realize that that sort of feeling can be misleading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;   Hope you find some answers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you! I do not think a banana is going to cut it haha\n\nI literally eat nothing but potassium and sometimes still have problems. When you went to the ER did the do blood tests (surely they did) No they did not do any blood tests, just an ultra sound, 60 seconds of a doctor telling me that she has no clue what it is but that it is not a clot and will not kill me, and that is it. Wtf kind of ER does not run blood tests?! What the heck!! \n\nI would visit your PCP and have some labs drawn to see if your electrolytes are in normal range. Even if they are in normal range for me, I get super crampy and twitchy \n\nHad you been bitten by a spider or something? Crazy stinking disease Haha I doubt a spider is the cause, though I briefly considered it. In every case the skin was completely unblemished. Whatever this is, it is not outwardly visible, except for the slight swelling. I have actually had almost this exact same thing happen to me during a flare before. No injury, but my ankle swelled up so much I could not even put a shoe on or walk on it. It would randomly feel tingly or go numb every once in a while and it was also bright red and hot to the touch. The only time this happened to me during a flare (I was also experiencing ulcers and eye problems at the time) was before I was diagnosed, so I do not exactly know what it was, but I was convinced it was a blood clot at the time as well.\n\n\n\nActually, after reading some of the other comments maybe what I experienced was not exactly like your symptoms. Hah. Either way, hope you find some relief! The US i think is one of the worst developed countries to have behcets in because almost nobody knows wtf you are talking about, so the ER doc pretty much treats him(and me multiple times) like we are pretty much healthy normal adults. It would feel much safer in France or Japan. I had to tell explain to my rheum wtf was  the pathergy test. And he had this weird impression that hla b51 was really important... it is a struggle. My main symptom is inflammation in my calves. CRP levels get to 80-120, and legs light up like a Christmas tree during a bone scan.\n\nIt is like a dull cramp that lasts a few days instead of a few moments, and I know it is not a cramp because I have had a cramp on top of the calf pain (absolute fucking agony) and it is damn near impossible to walk during a flare, can manage steps of maybe 2, 3 inches at a time.\n\nDoes it generally impact one leg more than the other, and do you also red tender red bumps on your shins? 3 inches is 7.62 cm I am newly diagnosed and in TX. \n\nIt took 6 months just to get in to the rheumatologist. She said Behcets, as did my gyno, and PCP. However, I always wonder because no pathergy test was ever done and like you said, no one seems to know anything about it. \n\nMy allergist was like \u201cwhat is that?\u201d Went and googled it during my allergy test. \u201cAre you sure? It says it is super rare\u201d\n\nUhm okay Same thing is happening with me , and it is usually symmetric in both my calfs , it often goes away in 3-5 days but compared to the genital ulcers and uveitis it is at least much better That does sound similar to what I had, with the exception of the redness! That is what is puzzling to me, so far every behcet's related problem has had obvious red inflammation, but not this A dull cramp is a good way to put it! It is similar in that it feels like it is clamped up, but it is not as strident of a pain as an actual cramp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far it is been mostly my left leg, I have had some slight tightness in my right lower leg, around the achilles, but not to a crippling extent. I do get the shin inflammation thing too,  but that seems separate to me, it usually happens at a different time than the calf stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you end up using crutches when this happens? I have been forced to when it gets really bad, when it is mild I can just limp. I am not sure if moving helps or hurts in this situation, so I have been trying to mostly stay put to not mess anything up. Huh I have actually only ever had it on one side at once, and only on my left, and while it has occasionally been not much of a problem, I actually find it worse than the ulcers, which thankfully have been improving for me lately. Glad it is not too much of a problem for you at least! Not to mention how expensive all the bouncing from doc to doc gets, especially with no insurance. This ER visit alone cost me an outrageous amount, I wish I had not gone. I get it mostly in my leg left too! Sometimes it is worse on the right left, sometimes they are both equally bad.\n\nNo crutches yet, for the most part I have been able to make do with just limping around and having a heavy hand on supporting tables or doorways. The one time I was bad enough that I genuinely could not stand, I went to the ER and was only admitted because I had a temp of 107, not because I was in excruciating leg pain...\n\nI have found that the trick is finding a balance of moving and not moving. Obviously you do not want to spend all day on the go, but if you sit for too long the leg will kind of seize up and you will have a very rough go when you start moving again. It happens to me too! If I had to describe it I would say it feels like I am on the verge of a Charley horse, or the kind of lingering tightness you have after getting over one. I primarily get the cramps in my upper right calf, almost right behind my knee. During a flare it is pretty constant and at times unbearable, but even when I am not in a flare it still pops up every once in a while. It also happens in my ankles and feet - when that is the case I lose a lot of flexion in my ankles and it keeps me from walking normally.\n\nI also freaked out at first thinking that it was a blood clot. I talked to my rheum about it and he did not really know much about it but I had seen a few other people post on this subreddit talking about something very similar and it made me feel way better. Even if a rheum knows Behcet's they will never really know it like we do! But of course, always talk to them, we are all different.... Wow thanks for sharing this makes me feel a lot better. I was anxious that this was likely a whole new illness but it just being another annoying BD symptom is more manageable I had something similar come up in my right Achilles\u2019 tendon last year. 1 week it was just sore, following week it was a mild tight pain, then the following 2-3 weeks it was major pain that intensified if I walked on it too long. I either walked with a limp or did not walk at all, but crutches probably would have been helpful! I was hiking a lot at the time and just chalked it up to overuse or strain, but over time it did not improve, so not entirely sure. \n\nI have behcets and am being assessed for ankylosing spondylitis. Achilles inflammation is common with AS, so I am unsure which disease is causing my own experience.\n\nEventually the pain went away after a month or so. No explanation as to why, it just vanished. A bit confusing, but hopefully you know you are not alone.\n\nI would take warm epsom baths and rub CBD lotion when the pain was worst, and that alleviated the symptoms a little. Best of luck. ", "Could I have a mild form of Behcets? Hi all,\n\nNew here (to reddit and r/behcets!) but have had a build up of mostly isolated symptoms over several years and just wanted to post my experience to see whether others have had similar and whether it could potentially be BD? For context I am a 29 year old white British female living in the UK. \n\nStarting with the most recent symptom, a few days ago I was diagnosed with iritis/anterior uveitis in my left eye. It came out of nowhere and has been extremely painful. Its better with eye drops but now it is subsiding i am noticing my joints are painful (mostly wrists and fingers but also knees/ankles) and also I have got terrible pain in my throat and am really fatigued. \n\nIts not the first time I have had an autoimmune-type condition, in November 2014 I had a really bad case of erythema nodosum. The nodes ulcerated/popped and have left long term scarring on my legs. At the time I had really bad joint pain. I also had a crazy number of mouth ulcers - when I mentioned the ulcers to doctors at the time they thought I was allergic to penicillin and changed the antibiotics they would given me. I also had a strange rash on my face but put that down to reacting weirdly to the meds I was on. \n\nBetween these two potential flares(?) in Feb 2017 I  had a weird period of getting lumps/rashes on my face, hands, chest and legs. At the time they diagnosed my leg lumps  as folliculitis although the doctor was not overly sure. This all seemed to subside after a couple of weeks to a month. \n\nOther than these three major periods that I can think of I am generally healthy, I get joint pains quite a lot but never severe enough that I have bothered getting them checked out. My boyfriend points out that I do get an above average amount of headaches (have one at least weekly) but again not severe I always just put it down to too much screen time/ not enough water.  I am also fatigued a lot and need to nap most days but have been putting this down to getting older! \n \nWhat makes me think it might not be BD is that firstly I have only had a few flare ups and each time it is been something different. I also do not think I get mouth ulcers any more than the next person, excluding the ones I had during my erythema outbreak. I did have tonsillitis and throat problems a lot growing up and am now wondering whether my throat problems are caused by ulcers? I do not think I have ever had any genital ulcers. \n\nAnyway if you have got this far thanks for reading, I am mostly just curious at this point. My optician is writing to my doctor to do some follow-up blood tests after my iritis diagnosis, so I wanted to do some research of my own too. I would be interested if anyone else also has Behcets that does not flare up very often or that does not have ulcers as a key feature? Any advice on getting diagnostic tests also appreciated - thanks in advance! Best to get a referral to a rheumatologist from your primary care physician and discuss your symptoms and suspicions. Minus the throat issues and uveitis, i share your symptoms. I went blind over a weekend and stated that way for a while until i got approved for steroid treatments and they found out it was not just \u201cin my head\u201d. I had optic neuritis ... inflamed my retinas to the point where i could not see. ANA was positive but kept switching from positive to negative. The prick test for bechets came back positive and everything else was ruled out through process of elimination and MANY tests, some repeated over the course of 8 months. Got diagnosed at the end of those 8 months after being admitted to the hospital for total body neuropathy, horrible migraines, body rashes, long hot flashes, and extreme fatigue. My symptoms still are all over the board for a typical Behcets patient which is why i recommend connecting with a rheumatologist so they can track your health and run necessary tests.\n\nGood luck! &lt;3 This is my story... back in june my knees and elbows started to ache, then after 2 days a very big ulcer, more like a burn lesion apperead in my genital area. That dissaperead in 4 days. The aches come and go until september, with a Bad right knee pain in August, i Could barely walk, and terrible headaches for two weeks. Then everything dissaperead. Now i feel just veeeeeery mild joint aches some days , that last for seconds. All my blood test do not indicate something autoimune or Any other problem. Patergy test negative. A single rheum told me is behcet\u2019s for sure, the others did not Say anything, no opinion. \nNow i feel very well , i gave up going to dr. for  the moment. I will just wait. I think it sounds like it could be Behcet's? I never thought I got mouth ulcers more than the average person, but diagnostic criteria is more than 3 in a year, which seemed ludicrously low to me. Honeslty it does sound like it could be BD. I would advise you take an appointment with a rheumatologist and explain really well all your history. Honeslty to me the uveitis here is the deal-breaker together with the throat problems (BD in my case manifested mainly with constant throat inflammation so much they removed my tonsils even tho I was already 16). The past experiences with other auto-immune diseases does mark you up as someone more likely to develop it. Also remember that although you are born with BD, it may stay dormant until something wakes it up: in my case it was mononucleosis, in yours it might have been the erythema. Ahh thanks so much for responding. Your experience sounds really scary, I cannot even imagine. I hope you are doing better now they have diagnosed it? Do your symptoms come and go or are they more constant? Everyone seems to have such different experiences with it its hard to tell but will definitely ask my doctor to refer me to a rheumatologist based on all this. Thanks again so much and really hope you are doing better right now :) Thanks for sharing, its so strange is not it how you can be so bad and then suddenly it all disappears. Sounds like what has happened on the few occasions I have had potential flare ups, and then inbetween I am a bit achy in my joints and get frequent headaches and a bit tired, but never serious enough to go to a doctor about. I think now I have had a few different instances I am definitely going to follow up and see if behcets or something else is underlying it all.\n\nI really hope it was just a one off for you and it does not flare up again! Thanks again for responding, I really appreciate it! Wow, I agree 3 seems ludicrously low to me so maybe I am having them more than average. I will start trying to monitor them better from now on, now I know they could potentially link to an underlying illness. Thanks for your response really appreciate it! Thanks, I think I will definitely be investigating further based on all these comments as well as my optician suggesting further blood tests. I just find it so strange that it only seems to flare up every few years so until now thought they were just unrelated incidents. But given it was the third time I would baffled doctors I thought maybe they could all be linked, then stumbled across behcets and everything seemed to add up! But it seems more mild than a lot of people posting here so then was not sure. \n\nInteresting to see your BD manifested with throat inflammation too though, its another symptom I had not really related until now. \n\nThanks so much for responding and sharing! My symptoms are almost daily but they vary. One day could be a lot of muscle pain throughout my body, another could be sores, and then the next day can be complete exhaustion. I was diagnosed in 2017 (thank goodness) and i just started Otezla with my colchicine. It is an improvement so far but still too early to tell how effective it will be at managing my symptoms. Hoping to find a good rheumy to help me manage it since my dermatologist has been waaaay more helpful than my current rheumy", "Cold weather As the weather gets colder my secondary raynauds acts up. Also carpel tunnel. Does anyone else have this issue? I am still in the early stages of Humira ..only took two doses so I am still a work in progress. But my bones ache lol. I have nitro-bid to help. But was just wondering if it is common for anyone else and does it get better as Humira starts working ? Thank you for sharing !! Nitro bid cream does help :) not sure if you have ever tried it.

It is only just starting to get cold and my body aches all over. I was outside for a few hours today for a birthday party and I was shivering the entire time. Still hours later I am still cold and my body hurts everywhere. My legs, neck, back, everywhere. I always blame Behcet\u2019s whenever something hurts Yeah, I take a lot of hot baths in the winter because I get chilled to the bone and it hurts I might want to start doing that Yep! 100x worse than summer. Even if I am not actually cold, my joints seize up way worse and my arthritic joints swell SO much! Yes. I hate the cold. When it is really cold or really humid, my joints hurt. I grew up just south of Boston and the winters here can be pretty brutal. From like December on, my only goal is to get to April haha Have you been able to figure anything out that helps? Me too! I live in Pennsylvania. I went to college in upstate New York. Worst part of it was the cold. It gets cold here too. I already want it to be summer and it is only November. Have you figured anything out that helps? Yup but weirdly it worst when mostly cold and very humid. If it is  very dry and cold it is  alright, less pain than a very humid and cold day. I feel the same way: ready for spring and it is not even winter yet lol. The only thing that really helps is staying busy. I nearly double my work hours in the winter time. Does not *actually* help, but keeps my mind off how lousy I feel most of the time. And I usually go someplace warm and sunny for a week or two (Miami is my go-to) in the winter. Again, that does not *actually* help with pain, but breaks up the winter and does wonders for my seasonal depression. It really helps! Not yet! To be honest I just try to stay busy (not just physically but more so mentally for me), escapism, some techniques pain docs have taught me (basically meditation) and good pain killers haha! I am already busy and I am still cold! Lol cold all the time", "\u0e13\u0e31\u0e10\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e19\u0e33\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e1a 2 \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e34\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35 \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e32\u0e216 ", "I am back to complain about the Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Facebook page LOL The admin take a break every week now.

You signed up for this! YOU wanted this much control. YOU built this community. STOP feeling the need to police everyone is posts. \n\nThey say the community could be shut down by Facebook. That is BS. like I said, im part of so many other communities that are much larger and they are not moderated like the Beh\u00e7et\u2019s \u201cyou are not alone\u201d page. \n\nTransfer your role to someone else if it is too much for your mental health.

I was wondering if any of you have been pregnant with Behcet\u2019s or know anybody who is/has been. I have been trying for 10 months and have just seen the gyno recently who ordered a bunch of tests. Also, life has been rather stressful for me lately and I have been getting flare ups. I am afraid that my body will fight itself if I get pregnant, resulting in miscarriage. I am unable to stop colchicine because I otherwise have flares at least once a month. My symptoms during a flare are usually meningococcal, mouth/genital/rectal ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, achy muscles and joints, and fatigue.  My symptoms actually went away during pregnancy. I went off my medications before getting pregnant to avoid risks to the baby/my health during. Colchicine was one I believed you HAD to quit, but please confirm with your doctor before stopping or continuing any medications.\n\nYour immune system slows way down as a response to pregnancy, regardless of whether or not you have an autoimmune disorder. Many people enter remission, and I stayed in remission or only had mild symptoms for about six years. The flare I am in right now is the worst I have had since my son was born.\n\nBest of luck, and again, involve your doctor every step of the way! Also, taking 10 months or more to get pregnant is not abnormal if you have irregular periods or just came off birth control. Hard to hear when you are trying, I know. I hope your gynecologist has answers for you soon. I also had no flares while pregnant and it took about a year for a pregnancy to stick. My doctor mentioned that flare ups do tend to go away during pregnancy. I take Colchicine but only during flares, I have not talked to my doctor about switching if needed if/when they return. Thank you all for your input. I will talk to the gynecologist about using colchicine.  I have Behcets and going through ivf. How old are u I am 36. Good luck with IVF, the doctor just ordered testing for my husband and I. Of course the timing is bad because of the holidays so I will have to wait for my next cycle. Good luck with IVF!  I am currently pregnant and dealing with Behcets, I was actually diagnosed at the beginning of my pregnancy. I have heard most women do go into remission with pregnancy but mine has been one awful flare up after the next. \n\nI am hoping it will calm down and not continue throughout the entire pregnancy. I am seeing a specialist next month and am crossing my fingers that she can do something for me to help as it seems that most treatments are not all that safe during pregnancy.  Sorry to hear that, hopefully it does calm down. Congratulations on your pregnancy, sending healing vibes your way.  I have Behcets and I have a 9 months old baby in perfect health. Behcets does not cause miscarriage. Like others said when pregnant your immune system slows down and that helps. Do not stress yourself with this impression. I stopped medication 1 year before getting pregnant since I had no flares for few years. Did not have any flares during pregnancy. But Colchicine was the one safe to use with pregnancy I think. The one to stop is Azathioprine. Your doctor should be more capable to confirm what to take and what dosage. Wish you luck and no flares with your pregnancy :) ", "Caffeine as a trigger? So I ran out of meds a few weeks ago, and happened to cut out caffeine around the same time. I have had almost no symptoms. However every other time I ran out, symptoms started back up within days. \n\nHave you all experienced anything similar with caffeine or other stimulants? I cannot handle stimulants at all! Caffeine makes me really anxious and all of my muscles feel tight.\n\nHow long have you been using caffeine? About 4 years, I do not get any of the anxiety or tenseness, but I was wondering if it sets off any bechets symptoms? I have not gotten many straight answers about caffeine. I think it would affect it.", "Because of the disease my teeth are falling out I have had Behcet's disease since I was 19 years old\n\nMy front tooth was broken due to too much calcium in my blood. This is a problem that causes me depression. I do not know if someone suffers like me\n\nIs this a matter of osteoporosis? Do you have osteoporosis? Have you had a bone density test? Have you taken a lot of steroids or other medications? No, but I am taking immunosuppressant medication Prednisone / steroids? Higher doses over a prolonged period can lead to osteoporosis. \n\nI was able to avoid a lot of the bone wasting associated with prednisone use with higher daily doses of vitamin D combined with vitamin K. It will not fix any current damage, but may prevent any further damage to bones or teeth. I was diagnosed at 16 myself (I am 40 now) and have had a lot of problems with my teeth. I have had several surgeries and later this year am getting full dental implants. It is been a very painful and expensive journey. I feel your pain, both literally and figuratively. I second this. It is probably a good idea for most people to take supplemental vitamin D/K, but especially for people on corticosteroids and several other types of prescription drugs.", "Anyone else had these symptoms with Bechets? I have super annoying eyelid twitching, recurrent mouth ulcers and tiny pimples on my thigh and arms for the last 6 months. My GP thinks I might have Bechets. Anyone else has eyelid twitching with Behcets? \n\n(I am 28, male, and I do not have any stressful time in my life, I rest enough, I do not drink coffee). My eyelid twitches but I have never really associated that with the behcets. Have you seen a rheumatologist yet?", "Possible diagnosis? Hi everyone, I (20/F) just recently learned that I may have Behcet\u2019s. \nI have had some problems with what I thought were yeast infections since last August, I have had about four or five since then. Basically I get an itch and slowly it turns into pain and swelling and lots of no fun. Looking back theyve gotten progressively worse every time. They had not been too bad* (too bad meaning interrupting my day to day function) up until this week, the most recent flare up. I thought I was never going to get relief. \nI was completely unable to urinate from the pain at one point, lasting two days, and I would burst into tears immediately. I have a tender sore spot at the corner of my mouth that makes it difficult to eat, which has scabbed over but somewhat resembles a canker sore. I was seen at an urgent care Sunday, the emergency room Monday, and a gyno Tuesday. \nI was negative for all the STI\u2019s, yeast, my pH was normal, my white blood cells were up, and I was experiencing an odorless discharge. I was so swollen the speculum kept getting pushed out at the ER. It was as if my entire vagina just became infected, leaking discharge and so swollen it hurt to walk and stand for too long. I did not have any pelvic pain, it was essentially my labia and vaginal entrance that hurt.\nNobody was able to help me and it was a really terrible experience overall honestly, until I got to the gyno. There she suspected that it was herpes, despite not having any bumps or sores, but this morning my swab test results came back as negative for both HSV1/2.\nThis is when she suggested it could be Behcet\u2019s, but I am not entirely sure how to solidify a diagnosis. What did the diagnosis process look like for those of you who have confirmed cases? Is there a blood test that can confirm this, or something else?\nI do have pretty bad vision overall, with occasional blurs that require me to readjust my eyes, and I do wear glasses everyday. I do not really experience any bodily chronic pain on a day to day basis, other than my sciatic nerve clamming up on me every now and then. I am not entirely sure what symptoms look like overall for everyone, this is all very new to me. \nAny and all advice is appreciated!! For me BD stayed silent, apart from mouth ulcers which were a constant since birth, until I was 13, when mononucleosis (and a 42\u00b0C fever) awakened it.\n\nStarting then it was hell: every month I would get a throat inflammation, so bad it was hardly possible to eat, toghether with 39\u00b0C fevers.\n\nThe next symptom to arise was epidydimitis recurring every month, which made it hard to walk.\n\nThe last symptom to arise was arthritis in my ankles which again made it hard to walk.\n\nBasically every month I would have one week of fever and throat aches, one week of epidydimitis, one week of arthritis, one week with nothing, apart from mouth ulcers which stayed a constant.\n\nThis went on for several years, where I kept going to all kinds of different specialists who never tried looking at the big picture: they cured me for the single symptom, but eventually it all came back the next month.\n\nI even got my tonsils removed when I was 16, which did remove the fevers, but I would still have throat aches and felt like if the fevers were still there.\n\nLast summer (age 18) one day I woke up blind in one eye. The oculist diagnosed a detachment of the optic nerve and severe damage to the retina. \nWhen I told him the big picture he set up an appointment for the next day with a symptomologist or some thing like that, which was the first to suggest BD.\nThis resulted in a hoard of analyses: blood tests, STDs, MRIs, X-rays, pretty much anything you could think of. Eventually they diagnosed me with BD and put me on Adalimumab 40mg injection fortnightly and Prednisone 50mg daily at the start, now down to 5mg daily for the eye. I managed to go from blind to about half my sight in the eye, but now even if the optic nerve is back to normal, my retina has holes in it which would be possible to heal only with stem cells injections.\n\nNow about your blood test question: long story short, no there is no test for BD.\nWhat can give an indication is testing for the HLA-B51 gene, since people with it have shown a way higher chance to develop BD, but people with the gene might have nothing to do with it, and it is possible having BD without it; basically if there is a chance for BD diagnosis, this may point towards it more. Reading this, my 18 year old self could have written it. This is exactly how my Beh\u00e7ets made itself known (badly enough for me to seek help anyway). \nThere is no blood test etc for Beh\u00e7ets it is more proving your negative for a butt load of other things then observing you with a checklist of symptoms and seeing if you have enough of them often enough to confirm Beh\u00e7ets. \nIn regards to the swollen foof, I found peeing while I was showering my foof in cold water simultaneously made it a little less painful to urinate. Still hideously uncomfortable but I did not want to pass out. I also found that when I was walking my labia would touch a be painful, I invested in a LOT of lube and essentially just lubed up when I had to walk. Not a great long term solution but it allowed me to walk without wanting to cry. \nAlso- keep an eye on that sciatic nerve, if it is inflammation due to the Beh\u00e7ets and becomes more severe it can lead to nerve damage. I was not diagnosed with Beh\u00e7ets when my sciatic nerve started acting up so the docs took too long to figure it out and now I am disabled. Knowing you have Beh\u00e7ets means you will not get to this point but just keep an eye on it. \n\nI was diagnosed when I was 19, nearly 20 so if you have any questions etc please feel free to reach out. I do not have all the answers to everything but I am a real good listener :) x Did you ever get tested for herpes? If your blocked d test keeps being negative it is a big chance you have bech Nope, never being tested for it, also cause mine were clear mouth ulcers definitely not herpes. This has been very helpful, thank you! I plan on talking with my gyno about any other things it could possibly be, but I am sure she will give me a referral to a specialist. Honestly I am surprised and very fortunate and grateful to have some possible answer so soon, the only reason she even suggested BD is because the day after I came through another patient came in with the same (although less severe) symptoms I had and they concluded she had BD. She said she would never seen actual cases, only ever reading about it in books, but for two of them to come in in one week? I think they put her on a medicine commonly used for patients with BD and it worked almost immediately for her, so she is given me a prescription for it as well and I am going to start it soon. \nAnother thing I have come to realize as I explore this possibility is that I was essentially a \u201cbubble child\u201d when I was first born, and allergic to almost everything. Dairy, eggs, fish, nuts, dust, etc., so now I am wondering if I never actually grew out of that and if I just got better at masking it? Is diet something that has an effect on flare ups? Do you have any digestion related issues that pop up? I remember thinking this past fall at one point that I had Crohns or something because of some problems I was having that to my knowledge have since subsided. It is amazing how interconnected it can be.\nSorry if I am overwhelming with questions, this is really a very interesting this to me and I am really glad This is very helpful, thank you! I am sorry this has been so hard on you :-/ \nYour first point about mono actually reminded me of something I totally forgot about! Around January/February I had to go to an urgent care because I felt like I had strep or mono. I was running a fever and I wrote everything down moment by moment (living with COVID as a thing on a college campus has me extra cautious), my throat was swollen, my nasal passages were super swollen, and I could hardly breathe. All of my tests came back negative and I could not understand wtf was wrong, but eventually it went away, lasting about a week. It was very strange and we never really figured it out, but the PA at the clinic I went to presumed it was something viral since the antibiotics did not help and it went away on its own.\nAnother thing that I forgot to mention was Saturday night, after I began to feel the irritation, I was running a low grade fever of around 99.9-100.5 F and was super achey, but it was gone by Sunday morning which is when I ended up going to the urgent care. That kind of inflammation before a flare up seems to be a trend based on what I have seen online, which is really interesting.\nIt is really interesting to me too that so far we (myself and those who have responded) all seem to be pretty young. A friend of mine\u2019s sister with a diagnosed case (I knew of her situation long before this started happening to me) was told she likely had herpes and had to go through what I am currently dealing with, and she is only about 25 at the most. \nWhat a bizarre condition, and yet I am fascinated and almost excited that it is making a lot of sense all at once. Yes, when that doctor started asking me about symptoms it all fell into its place. Whenever he would ask about a new thing it was a \"yes, I never thought about that\"; symptoms I had never even thought about.\n\nStrange feeling in your limbs which feels better if you stretch? Yes.\nGums which bleed frequently when you brush your teeth? Yes.\nRandom small scabs on your skin? Yes.\n\nEverything just made sense. Since having started the medication I have not had any symptoms anymore. Unfortunately I get pretty bad fatigue at random moment; when that happens all I can do is just sit and wait for my energies to come back, but honestly I will take it over all the painful symptoms I had. For me I think diet has a small impact, not as much as other patients have mentioned to me but I know if I consistently eat crappy food I flare up pretty quickly. I also know if I eat more meat/dairy that I experience more symptoms, not necessarily a flare though.  \nI have some digestive issues, I had pretty awful acid reflux and often get stomach ulcers too and when I flare often get a very very upset stomach. Crohns was mentioned to me once of twice before diagnosis too but it was not a good \u201cfit\u201d for my symptoms so was quickly tabled. \nPlease do not worry about overwhelming me with questions, happy to help however I can. I know how frustrating it is not having people to talk to about these experiences and questions! X Do you happen to take any medicine regularly for treatment? I am starting to think that the flare up I described relating to my vagina is only just a part of it, because I am having the same digestion issues again. I just shared another post about those symptoms specifically, but I am waiting until next week to start my meds my gyno prescribed to controlled flare ups, hoping it will work for my gut. This stuffs expensive and I was not ready for it lol. I am of a fair few meds \nPregablin, codeine and amitriptyline for my nerve pain \nLansoprazole for stomach ulcers - this is pretty uncontrolled at the minute as the other meds I was on have had production stopped \nColchicine for the Beh\u00e7ets and I am also on infliximab (aka remicade) and steroid injections when I need them. \nDigestive issues are pretty common in Beh\u00e7ets patients. What meds are you on if you do not mind me asking? \nYeah, must admit if I was not in the UK and the nhs paid for my treatment I would be in BIG trouble! Hi sweet girl, I am sorry you are going through this. Just wanted to give you some tips that have worked for me. \n\nPrednisone. \nFor urinating: Vaseline on all ulcers at all times. If you do this, you likely will not even need the next tip BUT.. cutting the bottom off of Dixie cups, gently placing it between your urethra &amp; ulcers, then pee through the cup. Keeps the urine off the ulcers (so does the Vaseline). \n\nVaseline helps make everything feel better plus helps them heal faster. When I have a genital flare I keep it in my purse. \n\nBelieve it or not, this will make you stronger \ud83d\udc9c good luck", "How is your hearing? Have you considered doing some ear-related tests? Audiograms, tympanograms...? If you already did some of these, how were they? Do feel like you have hearing loss? \nI am asking because I am starting an investigation in this area.", "Fatigue and Behcet's? I have been having episodes of unearthly fatigue off and on the past few months that I think may be connected to Behcet's because my oral ulcers have also been on a rampage during this same time. I have had more issues with headaches, lichen sclerosis, nausea and too much stomach acid, lots of other digestive issues, etc. All of these have been occasional issues for me in the past, but all have been more frequent and intense the past few months and the only solution my doctors have had is to put me on a ton of meds, which I think are making some of the digestive issues even worse. Has anyone else had massive fatigue like this? I thought I was just burned out at first, but I have spent months reworking my life to reduce stress and going to therapy and I am  pretty convinced it is something physiological at this point. I am so tired of being tired but I do not know what to do and neither do my doctors, it seems. In my opinion, your fatigue is almost assuredly caused by Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. I find that prednisone fixes me right up in these situations. I experience a lot of fatigue. Every time I flare, I am extremely fatigued and have a lot of joint/body aches. On top of that, headaches and both oral and genital ulcers. I usually lay down mid day, even if I do not take a nap. It helps me get through the day without feeling like I am completely drained. Days that I do not do that, I will end up ready to pass out by like 6 pm. YEP. This sounds like what I feel. Normally when I have a flare, it is so acute there is no mistaking it. I cannot move for a week or two. But lately I have been having lots of canker sores only, so I went on colchicine, but I still get SO TIRED. I have tried drinking coffee and exercising lightly to force my way through it, but this is not your normal \"I feel cruddy\" day. I have been wondering if maybe the colchicine is suppressing the canker sores, but maybe there is other less-acute issues going on now. I wish I had a doctor who would listen. Every time I have a flare-up they run my blood tests like 2 months later and I am fine by then, so I always thought that it was either acute or in remission, not much in-between area, but now I am thinking there must be. Thank you, I will ask my rheumatologist! For me the only working cure is Adalimumab (Humira or biosimilars). It still gives immense fatigue, but atleast I do not have any more sores or pains. I started on colchicine and could not tolerate it. It made me really sick. I also tried Otezla after that and had very severe joint pain. I have been on methotrexate for about 5 months now and just started Infliximab infusions on Tuesday. Not a noticeable difference yet but I am hoping I get relief from all of these symptoms. Best thing I can recommend is to rest when you can and if you feel a flare up coming on, start resting and do not push yourself to do things. That is one of my biggest problems. I feel a flare up coming and I try to do everything I wanted to do before it hits full force. Never turns out great lol.  The methotrexate has suppressed some of my symptoms. I am still getting oral/genital ulcers but they are not as severe as they usually get so the colchicine might be doing that for you. I know a lot of people have success on it. My rheumatologist also has me taking daily folic acid and vitamin d. Make sure you get your vitamin d level checked because I had a super high deficiency which is weird because I live in Florida. I have had fatigue issues for decades. When it is really bad, I go to the heavy hitters: amphetamines and caffeine. But getting my hormone levels in check and improving my diet made a big difference. Thanks. I do have Adderall now since went back on it for the first time in a decade just a few months ago, so maybe that is something. But I think I had a stomach ulcer after surgery recently and  had to quit drinking coffee. Still stuck with tea because I cannot handle the acidity of the good stuff. \n\nI am going back to a naturopath soon and have wondered for other reasons if my hormones are off, so I will ask about that. \n\nI appreciate you sharing what is helped you! Thanks for sharing! I do take Vitamin D because I live in the Pacific NW, have not paid much mind to folic acid though. My flares are usually so severe it is like getting hit by a bus. Literally. Everything in my body hurts so bad I cannot move. Even the fluffiest pillows feel like rocks and I do not do ANYTHING until it is over. There is only been a couple of times that I have had genital ulcers without the full fever and pain all over and I was not even sure if it was this or lichen sclerosis because sometimes my skin down there just tears easily.", "Red light therapy for oral ulcers? I recently ran across a red light therapy product by a company called Luminance RED that claims to help heal oral ulcers. This red light wand is supposed to reduce pain and quicken healing time.\nHas anyone ever tried light therapy? Unfortunately, not one single medication has been able to prevent my oral ulcers. Even Otezla :( My dentist has been using a red light laser on my ulcers for the past 10 years. It works! Pain relief immediately and the ulcer is gone within days. Good luck! Wow! Really!?\nThis particular red light wand is $350. Do you know what your dentist uses? I have an appointment with him tomorrow. I will ask. Thank you!!! Red light or infrared can help, but I have another solution that I use : a compound script of clobetazol propionate .05% in orobase ointment. If you cannot afford to get the compound script, you could find over the counter products and mix it yourself maybe, but ask a doctor first.\nApply it to the ulcer as soon as you see it form and it will be gone in a day. As a result of this medication I was able to get off prednisone for the first time since my onset.  This is great information! Thank you! So I asked my dentist: he uses a cold laser. He said they are common in most offices. They are mostly used on cold sores, but in my case they work great for ulcers. It changed my life. You do not get to say that often when you have a difficult to treat condition, so I try and let people know it is an option whenever I can. Absolutely! I am taking your recommendation very seriously! I will be seeing my doctor soon. Just a note if you do decide to go for the clobetasol in orobase - results depend on good application. This is what I was taught: Scrape some up with a nail then rub it on your palm to warm it and make it malleable, scrape it up again onto the tip of a finger. Stretch the area you need to apply it to (this hurts a bit, but it is not too bad )and maybe dry it with a tissue and then firmly apply it to the area. It sticks to the inflamed and ulcerated area as that area is not as wet as the surrounding mucosa. The orobase holds the clobetasol in place long enough for it to have an effect. This is good to know.\nI am seeing my doctor on Monday.\nI get sores on my tongue, cheeks, gums and the roof of my mouth. I have at least 10 going at all times, and the ones on my gums/roof of mouth I can definitely feel coming on well before they break. Do you use this every day? I used to, they seemed to settle after a few years doing this but that might have also been the immunosuppressants. Now I only get a few a month, but I remember how bad it gets. With this, I can treat any as soon as they come on (just little lumps, not \"erupted\" yet) and stop them before they really start.", "A lot of things indicate behcets, but do not have a lot of mouth ulcers.. Hi,\n\nI have had joint pain since 17 years old and today it has affected almost all my large joints (24 today) . About 6 months ago I have learned about Behcets and I saw a specialist in that disease in my city. He wants to wait to see if I have more mouth sores because I did not have any during my appointement and my penile sores did not look like sores at all. I also saw a ophthalmologist that did not find inflammation in my eyes but my eyes have been red for like 6 months. I am also scheduled to see a dermatologist soon, that knows about Behcet, (I think). Here is my list of symptoms)\n\n\\-Joint pain and widespread pain \n\n\\-Sores in the mouth that come and go ( about 1 or 2 sores a month) \n\n\\-Genital acne or sores (not sure), that comes and then never leaves. I have had one since 14 years old that just grew bigger recently. \n\n\\-Tinnitus\n\n\\-Bruxism\n\n\\-Acne\n\n\\-red eyes, flotters, flashes and others eyes related symptoms\n\n\\-Restless leg syndrome\n\n\\- Vertigo (come and goes)\n\n\\-Intermittent involuntary movements\n\n\\-HLAB51 is positive \n\n\\-Feeling of neuropathy in my legs and less often arms (intermittent)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have seen a lot of doctors and had a lot of IRMs, and everything comes back normal. I recently had a brain IRM and a bone scintigraphy of all my skeleton and it was normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould it all be behcets and what should I do about it, thanks and sorry for the long post. So... I have experienced all of those symptoms at one point in time or another. I am also HLA-B51 positive. But I also had oral and genital sores for over a decade throughout my teens and early twenties. They make up two of Behcet's three trademark symptoms, the other being eye inflammation. I was diagnosed with Behcet's in 1997 at the age of 16 after years of being bounced around doctor to doctor. \n\nInitially, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Over the years, especially after studying genetics, I have come to understand Behcet's not as its own separate disease, but rather one of many interrelated diseases that share common genes. That is why there is so much variation from one person diagnosed with Behcet's to the next. \n\nDo YOU have Behcet's? I do not know. But you have obviously got something going on. Whatever label gets slapped on it, be it Behcet's, Lupus, or something else, does not matter at the end of the day. The only thing that matters is that you are able to control your symptoms. It is nice to have a name for what ails you, but it is nicer to have your symptoms under control. Thank you for your input, I really appreciate it. It is a broad question, but how did you manage to control your symptoms, what kind of drugs did help you the most, thank you :) Okay, so let us start with prescription drugs. I take azathioprine 200mg/day as an immunosupressant. Numerous studies have shown it to reduce eye problems in Behcet's. I also take Eliquis. It is a newer-generation blood thinner. Since I have had multiple clots in both legs, I am on it indefinitely to prevent further clots. No new ones since starting it. I also take Seroquel (a small dose) for sleep and baclofen for muscle/nerve discomfort. \n\nNon-prescription things include vitamin D (so important for proper immune health, especially with C19 and whatnot), fish oil, cannabis for pain, sleep, anxiety, mood, appetite, and about 5 other things. I also use kratom for pain, anxiety, energy, and mood.\n\nThat is the short version of what I am currently taking. There is more to it, but those are all the major players. I hope this helps! Thank you again. I will be looking into the drugs and supplements. My joint pain is my worse symptom so helping that would go a long way. Thanks and have a nice evening! &gt; He wants to wait to see if I have more mouth sores because I did not have any during my appointement\n\nCannot just take your word for it, eh? Take photos next time you get one.", "Specialists Alright everyone, I hope your having a decent day. I have a question. I finally am getting a referral to go see a behcets specialist for a second opinion. I have been seeing my hometown rheumatologist but now I am going to try to get in to be seen by the best.  One question, who is the best? I am on the east coast so Johns Hopkins or NYU Langone are the front runners right now but if anyone has experience with a particular doctor anywhere in the USA but preferably on the east coast I would l  on be to hear about it. Both good and bad. I have not personally been to a center (love my Rheumatologist and his care), but I have heard NYU is best. Varying experiences on Mayo clinic. It is my understanding that the Mayo in Jacksonville, FL has had some kind of turnover and the BD doctor is not there. Other people I know personally with BD (in my support group) and they have also used UAB, Emory, Vanderbilt, Duke. Hope this helps. Cheering you on. Best to you and your health. I know this is a very late response but I just joined Reddit. I go to NYU and I see Dr. Johannes Nowatzky. He is great! I understand a lot of people want to consult Dr. Yazici but it is my understanding that he is usually preoccupied with research. However, I have not been his patient ever so take that with a grain of salt. All in all, I have been a patient at NYU rheumatology since I was a pediatric patient and they quite literally saved my life.", "Knee, elbows and fingers aches, headache = flare I m not officially diagnosed, But once a month, before my menstruation my body start to ache and Also my head. Is someone in the same blat ? \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f My symptoms got under check with colchicine.  Have not had a major flare in a few years. I finally went to the rheumatologist after I developed Uveitis.  Do you have ulcers too?  That is the only thing I still get around my period. Yup, I get joint pain and ulcers the week before my period starts. I do not have ulcers always, just sometimes and in my mouth. I do not Take Any medication, because this summer started my symptoms that Could lead to behcet\u2019s. Now my only Pack of symptoms is a weird feeling in my body, flu like, joint pain and a different type of headache that only appears with the other symptoms.", "Hey, turns out ive got behcets So im newly diagnosed with behcets. Im 27 and a guy, living in the UK. Ive had uveitis in both eyes, mouth ulcers, fatigue, and most recently a blood clot in my lung. Just thought id stop by, say hi, and if anyone ever wants a new friend to chat with, sling me a PM. Hello, Welcome! Haha. This sub is pretty dead nowadays but I am here if you ever want to chat as well! 23f from the US, been diagnosed for about 6 years now \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb Yeh i noticed it had died, but i suppose like me, someone might come searching and see a few posts down the line. Hey there friendo, this place has been a ghost town since I subscribed, but I am glad to see someone else here.  Hey sorry i havent replied earlier, not been well and dont go on reddit as much as i should do :P Ill always reply at some point or another! Yeh the subreddit was pretty dead when i joined it as well, lol. It is not a surprise, I spend a lot of my days half dead anyway, seems likely it is going around on this sub. Do not worry about response times, real life takes precedence, even though Reddit is often more fun. Yeh they put me on azathioprine and my body had a really nasty reaction to it, even though it was working wonders with my behcets. I had some crazy inflammation of my duodenum?? ended up in hospital for three days because of it. Was shit. Sounds like shit. Proper fucking shit", "How many were told it was just herpes? I had an incredibly painful breakout around my labia at the start of COVID. The pain was unbearable. I could not even walk normal. Combined with oral ulcers that pretty much had me on a soft food/liquid diet and slurred speech. \n\nI went to a NP, PCP, OBGYN, and a dermatologist. They ALL told me it was herpes- did the swab test and blood test. The OBGYN actually told me it was folliculitis.....all the tests came back negative but I was told that no test was perfect and it was still just herpes. Given a prescription for Valtrex and it never got better. I was in HELL.\n\nMy co-worker saw a local dermatologist oaskedpn Instagram and messaged her explaining my symptoms asking if she would be willing to try to help. She was intrigued by my symptoms and happily agreed to see me that same day.\n\nI went in, explained my symptoms to her once again and she asked if she could take a visual look at them. Of course I agreed. I stripped down and sat with the little paper sheet over my lap. She came in with her assistant and examined the sores I had all over my labia. She asked if she could do a biopsy to rule out herpes for sure. She said that it definitely was not folliculitis and was confused how a doctor could even consider that as a diagnosis. \n\nShe did the biopsy (all while apologizing for the painful procedure on a sensitive area) and told me she suspected Behcets. A week later she called me and told me that she was referring me to a  rheumatologist but she would still like to be involved in my care because she had only read about it in medical school and she was fascinated/excited by the diagnosis. \n\nTldr: was told I had herpes by a bunch of doctors. Finally got Behcets diagnosis and being treated by a rheumatologist who I love! Yup, same here - I had the negative swabs and blood tests, too.   \nIt was a miserable experience from start to finish. I disclosed to all of my partners and was super safe because OBVIOUSLY I had megaherpes.... then I stopped dating for a long time, because talking to someone about my ostomy AND megaherpes was just too much. \n\nIt was so frustrating because Valtrex did nothing and I was in so much pain for so long. I had a doctor who straight-up implied that OF COURSE herpes was painful *and maybe I should have made better choices*. Yes! Holy crap the stigma around herpes is so fucking real still! 'oh you have genital sores? Use a condom and do not waist my time....'\n\nI even explained that it had been a long time since I had had sex and all I got was \"you have it for life..... It is not always active. You probably picked it up in college.\" \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude24 My vaginal ulcers are all internal with scarring but I was told by my obgyn that it did not look like herpes as he did the swab. Granted I went to him for suspected bechets to look for ulcers. Guess every experience is different. Bechets is truly poorly understood though. I swear when I googled bechets vaginal ulcers I could barely find anything. Glad you finally got the right diagnosis !\ud83d\ude42 Oh yeah, told it was Herpes. Herpes as a young virgin who had never even kissed a boy. I think I was tested for herpes about 12 times, when I was first getting severe flareups around age 18-20 and not sexually active. I was on a catheter for 2 months because nobody knew what it was. I finally found a rheumatologist who gives me prednisone and the minute I feel a flareup / itch starting (usually in my mouth but sometimes genital onset), I take the prednisone and my flareups are prevented sometimes entirely or at least shortened before extremely painful. yup. 5 different doctors \"diagnosed\" me with herpes even though at **least** a dozen tests, both swab and blood, came back negative. I was on valtrex for probably a total of 6 months on and off, prescribed by all of these doctors, over a 2 year period before I was properly diagnosed with behcets. obviously the valtrex did absolutely nothing, but they still insisted it was herpes. it really was just luck that I ended up seeing a gyno who had encountered behcets before and suspected I had it and finally sent me to a rheumatologist. I have since seen dermatologists and ENTs who are actually familiar with behcets, surprisingly. I am always so baffled by how few gynos know about this disease, even though so many patients with it end up seeing them early on due to their symptoms. I requested literature from The American\u00a0Behcet's Disease Association, including pamphlets, to give to any new doctors I see who may not be familiar with behcets. Hopefully this will help save someone else time and suffering down the line. I was tested for oral herpes more times than I can remember! Tons of swabs, blood tests, one rather large biopsy from my cheek and a \u201cwedge\u201d cut out of my tongue that I was put under anesthesia for...that came back only as ulcerated tissue. I do not know why they are so determined to diagnose it as herpes!!\n\nI was put on valtrex, even with all of the negative results, with the hope that it would treat it in a similar way but it had no effect. \n\nI was 16 when I had my first break out so it was all very embarrassing! It took 4 years for me to get a behcet\u2019s diagnosis. A lot more doctors seem aware of it than they were when I was searching for answers starting in 2006. I am currently trying to get off the herpes train... I know it is going to be difficult. I refuse to take valtrex unless I get a positive herpes test, which I have not. Seeing a dr tomorrow to see what they think (herpes, of course. It is like they are herpes obsessed robots lol \u201cit is... not... herpes? Does. Not. Compute.\u201d) Luckily never got genital ulcers, and never got told it was herpes, being a kissless virgin, but my mouth ulcers were always completely disregarded by all doctors as just \"lack of vitamins\" or \"bad diet\".\n\nAlso, unrelated note, I am pretty surprised by the amount of females in this subreddit, given that the disease does not seem to affect one gender more than the other. Most posts I have seen are made by women. I am at a turning point with this right now..... thankfully my PCP is amazing and thinks it might be behcet's. I have already had a negative hsv test, but we are getting another one to be sure. She is referred me to rheumatology, so....we will see. Oral ulcers my entire life. I had the blood test 5 or 6 times over 2 years and my doctor kept insisting there was something wrong with the test. She also told me once that if I did not want genital ulcers I should never have had sex. Finally referred me to a rheumatologist after 2 years after one of her coworkers suggested Behcet's, and the rheum refused the referral because they would not take anyone with genital ulcers... and said in the refusal message they thought it sounded like herpes. Tested for herpes PCR three times, including my mouth ulcers. IGg test was performed as well. Also my vulvar ulcer biopsy was sent to confirm and rule out herpes. So it is safe to say every step of the way I was tested for herpes. My doc still has not confirmed Behcets because I do not have uveitis, _yet_\nI even had the obgyn doing the PCR tests give me a speech about how herpes is not a big deal compared to HIV and how I might have been abused as a kid and do not remember it and might have contracted herpes then. Even though my partner of fucking 8 years shows no symptoms of herpes whatsoever and I never did either. And of course there was also a suggestion that my partner cheated on me and I now need to have a conversation about that. I understood where they were coming from, but any explanation I provided for the above claims were dismissed until the blood test came back negative as well.\nThankfully my dermatologist has started me on colcrys which is sort of...working. I am still getting outbreaks but they are minor. Only prednisone clears them completely. Ugggh. I am so sorry you had that experience. Docs like that should be reported and named publicly so no one else has to suffer through that. Shame on them. Big hugs to you for getting through that! Thanks for sharing that! I hope to do the same! Did they send you a good amount of pamphlets? I was told the same thing. Being 12 years old and having the gyno tell your pastor father that you are lying about being a virgin and that you have herpes is pretty traumatic. I had not even had my first period yet. I was tested for herpes over and over and tested negative for antibodies every time. Valtrex did squat of course. My first vulvar ulcer was when I was 12 after having oral ulcers my whole life. It was pretty horrifying to be told I had herpes as a 12 year old virgin who had never even kissed a boy. Has anyone had symptoms that mimicked the flu in addition to achey/ swollen joints and ulcers? Me and it took 6 years for diagnosis", "Tips for dealing with ulcer pain? Not sure if this reddit is still active but hi! \n\nIt is been about three years since my last flare up- at that time I had mostly genital ulcers. My doctor wanted to wait for another flare up to officially diagnose me but unfortunately that did not happen till after I moved all the way across the world to Japan. I have had another bad flareup due to the stress  sexual harassment at work. This time, it is mouth ulcers, joint pain, light sensitivity, extreme fatigue and of course, the damn genital ulcers. Due to the language barrier of the hospitals in my countryside town, I cannot get medical treatment for it, so I need help for dealing with the symptoms till I can move home and get properly treated.\n\nAny tips for dealing with the pain of genital ulcers? Last time, I had lidocaine to help but it is only a prescription medicine here (I have seen a few creams I can order from iherb but I do not know which one is strong enough). So far, I have been doing Sitz baths with epsom salt and using antibiotic ointment as a barrier between two of the bigger ones just to keep them from touching. I can barely sit up and walking is agony. \n\nIf anyone is out there still, please help me!  Not a doctor but in my experience I have learned that mouth ulcers AND genital ulcers are a dead giveaway for Behcets. I think proper medication ASAP is crucial. In any case, if you are in a pinch and need home remedies, im not really sure. I have a steroid paste for mouth ulcers and there is a skin cream equivalent that I think would work for the skin lessions but I think they are both prescription. I think the best I could do prior to my diagnosis was bandaging the skin lessions with antibiotic cream so they would not be infected and the bandage kept them from oozing too much. But I never found anything suitable for the mouth ulcers other than that steroid paste. My initial phase with behcets was severe so living without medication scares me. If you think you can wait till you go home then hopefully yours is not as bad. \n\nNot a lot of people have behcets and only a few seem post on here. Sometimes I check other autoimmune forum for tips on symptom management though, so maybe you could try that. Sorry I cannot be more helpful Thank you so much! The difference in what is OTC and what is not is killing me in terms of pain management. I am trying to see if I can get to a doctor while I am here to at least keep things at bay pain wise, if not get a diagnosis in full.  The mouth ulcers are not as painful as the genital ones, and I cannot seem to find anything here that I can use to numb that area so I can go about my life. \n\nThank you for your post! It helps to know someone else is out there.  If you are on Facebook, there is a really active group with great Admins:  Thank you!! I will check it out! Have you tried tacrolimus? It is what I use for the fissures I get on my fingers and in mucous membranes. It has definitely helped everywhere except my hands, which I wash too much for any ointment to be effective. Not sure it is available in Japan- I managed to get an ointment from the doctor which did help me though! Thanks for the suggestion! What did you get? My doc is very good about researching my suggestions, which I offer him when I find something on my own. Dimethylisopropylazuleneguaiiazylene. Is what google translate says for the chemical name but I dunno. Everything\u2019s in Japanese so it makes it hard. I have never heard of it, but it worked.  Lemon and salt with water BUT hydrogen peroxide gargle has been best thing ever for curing the sores quicker  Are you having problems urinating?  I will just share my tip I wish someone would have shared with me. \n\nSome people have to cath if they are too close to the urethra, usually how I deal is to pee in the shower and hold a finger over the ulcer. The touch is a horrible sting but nothing compared to the lightening near black-out pain that comes from peeing on it. I was young and afraid it was herpes, so I did not seek treatment.\n\nI am on humira now and I barely get them. There is hope.  Lidocane cream and Domeboro soaks. Domeboro is a solution you can put in your bath water. When i have a flare up i take long hot baths and try to keep the area as clean as possible.  Aveeno bath happened to be the most soothing thing for such a horrible experience. It is worth a try, it worked for me I never wanted to get out", "How do doctors know that we all have Behcets and bot just a bunch of super rare unnamed diseases? For everyone here Behcets acts so differently and so do the reactions to the treatments. And it is not like there is a specific factor that gives in if it is behcet or not.  How do they know we all have the same thing even with different symptoms and reactions to medicine? I wonder that too. Honestly I just trust my docs opinion because she is Indian and familiar with it. I was diagnosed with Churg Strauss Syndrome for about 8 years before a new rheumatologist decided Behcet\u2019s fits better. HLA-B51 positive. Early on I decided what you called it did not matter as long as we were working toward a treatment plan. \n\nBut I agree fully, I feel like docs are just shooting into the dark sometimes. I think about this often! Only been diagnosed for 14 months, but I sometimes question the diagnosis when I compare myself to others on this subreddit.\nBut eventually, I realize that my current treatment is working, and I feel soooo much better today than I did a year ago, so why question it?\nI was taught to \u201cworry when it is worry time\u201d, so I will set aside the questioning until I have reason to believe I am no longer receiving adequate treatment :) It is kind of vicious cycle if you think about it. Rare diseases suffer from research funding and drug development(orphan drug status is a marginal incentive at best) by virtue of their rarity. It is not in the interest of most entities to pool too many resources in something that affects  few people. Given past research, groups of physicians(rheumatologists here in our case)  gather and try to set guidelines on how to diagnose the disease. Like for instance epidemiological studies since the 1920s show a consistent pattern of oral ulcer/genital ulcer and uveitis appearing together and voila a syndrome is born.  I could go on. So they might not get it exactly right but thankfully autoimmune diseases exist in very wide spectrums and share a lot of similarities and treatments, so even if it turns out you do not \"have\" Behcet's it is useful to know that should something bad and WEIRD happen to you, bringing up behcet's may nudge doctors treating you in the right direction instead of them running in circles with regards to treatments. One experience that has triggered the \\*\\*\\*\\* out of me the  in the US is the over reliance on HLA-B51 and completely misunderstanding its significance. Fun fact some countries are purported to have an incidence of HLA-B51 ranging between 12 to 25%  of the general population yet have Behcet incidences in the the 10s/100 000. The term Behcet's Disease is arguably a misnomer because it implies consistent pathophysiology, or in other words, the same mechanism(s) causing disease in all patients. This is not the case with Behcet's so it is more properly referred to as a \"syndrome,\" which is a \"group of signs and symptoms that occur together and characterize a particular abnormality or condition\" but which have different causes.\n\nThe mechanics of the autoimmune response that occurs in Behcet's Syndrome (BS) is not uniform.  Multiple cellular and molecular pathways interacting with the environment are involved and may affect individual patients singly or in combination.  A genetic variation,   HLA-B\\*51, is strongly associated with the occurrence of BS in some patients but is absent in others. In fact,  the  HLA-B51 genetic variation is thought to be a predisposing a factor only in 20% of Behcet's cases. Similarly,  non-HLA Behcet's susceptibility genes, notably ERAP1, have been identified as predisposing towards Behcet's. Environmental factors such as infection with the bacterium S.  sanguinis, viral infections, dysbiosis of the gut or oral microbiome, and possible exposure to chemical toxins can trigger BS in genetically susceptible people. Many BS patients have no known genetic variations that are associated with its occurrence.  Some patients have evidence of B cell involvement and the cytokine and other inflammatory markers vary between patients and with the organs/tissues affected and the severity of the disease.\n\nBS is often characterized in the literature and in textbooks as being \"protean\" in nature, meaning that it frequently presents in many different ways and transforms in the signs and symptoms it exhibits -- as well as the tissues or organs it attacks.  Some patients will have devastating eye involvement, others will experience large vessel (arterial, venous, or both) damage, CNS involvement, and damage to multiple other organs.  The frequency and severity of organ and tissue involvement are not only non-uniform among patients they often increase over time.  Some patients have evidence of B cell involvement and the chemokines, cytokines and other inflammatory molecules produced can vary between patients and with the organs and tissues that are affected. Behcet's also shows the ability to adapt and overcome successful drug treatment. For example, specific chemokine and cytokine inhibitors often have a limited period during which they are effective after which the disease-causing T cells, possibly aberrant gamma delta (*\u03b3\u03b4*) T, Th1, Th 17 and Tregs, evolve to escape the control of the drug(s) being used or up-regulate allowing the disease to recur or progress. So, Behcet's is an illness with multiple causes at the molecular-cellular level which all lead to a systemic attack on the vascular system and in many cases on different organs and tissues.\n\nThis distinction between a discrete disease and a syndrome may not seem important, and, to the extent that treatment does not differ, it is not. However, it is very important in terms of understanding the various underlying causes and thus in developing targeted treatments, including treatments individualized to specific patients.\n\nUntil very recently it was not possible to understand the different cellular and molecular-level causes of BS, so therapy was almost entirely empirical. It is now possible to design specific drugs and treatments to inhibit the diverse causes of diseases such as BS by interfering with the pathological process at the molecular and perhaps even at the genomic level. This is probably the most informative post i have read on here I would be surprised if you told me you were not  a clinician or immuno/pathology scientist. I would like to expand on something in the interest of not freaking out the community. Concerning the devastating eye/large vessel/cns involvement. Certainly behcets as it is understood today can have outcomes with high morbidity/mortality. But epidemiological data while varied and often with really large inaccurate ranges, point towards the general rarity of said devastating scenario in most populations. The statistics seem to imply most of us are going to lead fairly productive normal lives. I am not trying to instill a false sense of security, but really devastating life threatening organ involvement is quite rare(eg. Vascular involvement overwhelmingly presents as venous DVTs of lower extrems as opposed to much scarier PAA or larger arterial pseudo/aneurysms.). Still we all need to be vigilant, and check your eyes. Alot.\n\n  Lastly i have read some papers about refractory cases developing some resistance to various monoclonal antibody treatments but i got the feeling the big picture take home was strong optimism with regards to treatment options as compared to a few decades ago. Also i thought most experts corroborated that behcets actually waned with time instead of intensifying as we progress to older age in most cases, any data on that would be appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n Last note to all of you on here with bad organ involvement, i am in no way trying to diminish your pain and suffering by minimizing behcets, i mean that could be me next month, i am just trying to provide a bit of statstical persepective for new diagnoses not to lose their minds in fear( said fear crippled me for a year and i sought so much care and imaging to no avail, even probably radiated myself a path to cancer :( ) Formally diagnosed BS is rare in the US with an incidence of \\~0.3 per 100,000. This likely implies that many cases go undiagnosed because clinicians lack the familiarity with it that docs in countries with a much higher incidence have. That, in turn, probably means that formally diagnosed cases with multiple pathologies (oral and genital aphthous ulcers, eye involvement, etc.) have a worse prognosis. Because the number of diagnosed patients is so small the reliability of the statistics is also likely to be lower. So, yes, the prognosis is probably more optimistic than the published data indicate.\n\nMost patients will not develop the required number of clinical signs until years after the onset of the disease. This begs the question of whether or not they had Behcet's during the interval from the onset of the first clinical sign, say oral aphthous ulcers, to the development of multisystem disease? This is ever the problem with diseases that are diagnosed based on a collection of clinical signs rather than on the basis of laboratory findings and a discrete pathology. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of research going on to identify objective biochemical parameters in BS. A better definition of BS is probably going to be along the lines of a vasculitis with many manifestations that are the result of a comparatively small number of T cell pathologies. So, people who only ever have oral aphthous ulcers and people with multiple severe manifestations and who have the same underlying T cell pathology(ies) will likely be classified as having the same disease.\n\nSo, what we will probably see with BS is what we are seeing with targeted molecular therapy in cancer such as what the current TV ad says about Opdivo + Yervoy \"for treating patients whose small cell lung cancer tumors are positive for PD-L1 but do not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene.\" This is not a treatment for \"lung cancer,\" but rather for a specific type of lung cancer that has a specific genetic profile. Blocking multiple escape pathways from treatment will likely result in still more robust and durable control of the disease. The same is likely to be true of  BS. The more we understand about the precise mechanics of its different (but related) molecular pathologies the better we will get at treating, arresting, or even curing the disease,", "5 Interesting Facts About Behcet's Disease *( posted on my website August 6, 2021.]*\n\n**5 Interesting Facts About Behcet's Disease**\n\nAs much as it sucks being diagnosed with Behcet's disease, I have to admit: it *is* one interesting illness. Over the 25+ years since my diagnosis, I have amassed quite a collection of Behcet's info. Now I am going to share some of the disease's most interesting facts with you. \n\n***1. You are more/less likely to be  than diagnosed with Behcet's***\n\nIn the United States, it is estimated that roughly 0.38 out of every 100,000 people have Behcet's disease. That is about 1 out of every 260,000 people. So the odds of having Behcet's are about 260,000:1. Not quite one in a million: More like four in a million. \n\nThe good news is, if you are just some random American with no signs or symptoms of Behcet's disease, it is incredibly unlikely you have it. The bad news, of course, is for people like me who definitely do have it. Well, not so much bad news as it is just plain old bad luck. \n\nExactly how unlucky are we? What other rare events are more common than a Behcet's diagnosis? How about less common? When comparing the unlikelihood of a situation to something known to be rare, two things come up more than anything else: winning the lottery and getting struck by lightening. Let us see how Behcet's stacks up next to them. \n\nIn any given year, the odds of being struck by lightening in the United States are about 1 in 1.2 million. But over the course of an entire lifetime (~80 years), the odds of getting struck are 1 in 15,300. That means you are 17 times more likely to get struck by lightening at some point in your life than to be diagnosed with Behcet's disease. \n\nWhat about winning the lottery? This one's harder to calculate because it is impossible determine the odds of winning over the course of a lifetime, as there are many variables to consider (games played, frequency of play, etc.). However, we can compare winning any one drawing with getting diagnosed. \n\nTake Powerball, easily one of the most popular lottery games (if not the most popular). The odds of winning the jackpot is 1 in 292 million \u2013 give or take a few hundred thousand. That means you are more likely to have Behcet's disease than to win the Powerball jackpot with a single ticket \u2013 a lot more likely: 1,123 times more likely, to be precise. \n\nHere are a few more comparisons: \n\nThe odds of dying in a motor-vehicle accident are 1 in 107. That means you are 2,430 times more likely to be killed in a car crash than diagnosed with Behcet's. \n\nThe odds of dying in an earthquake are 1 in 159,890. That means you are almost twice as likely to die in an earthquake than be diagnosed with Behcet's disease. \n\nThe odds of being killed by a hurricane are 1 in about 62,000. That means you are about 5 times more likely to be diagnosed with Behcet's. \n\nAnd lastly, the odds of being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the US are about 8.3 per 100,000. That means you are about 22 times more likely to be diagnosed with MS than Behcet's. \n\nAs you can see, Behcet's disease is rare. It is not as rare as winning the lottery or being killed in an earthquake, but it is rare. So if you have been diagnosed, you are either really lucky or really unlucky \u2013 depending on how you look at it. \n\n***2. Behcet's disease does not discriminate***\n\nBehcet's disease is a type of vasculitis, a group of disorders that cause inflammation in blood vessels. There are many different types of vasculitis including Kawasaki disease, Takayasu's arteritis, Buerger's disease, among others. \n\nOne thing all these different types of vasculitis have in common is that they either affect arteries or veins \u2013 but not both. Behcet's disease, on the other hand, does not discriminate: it can affect arteries and veins. In fact, Behcet's is the only type of vasculitis that can affect both. \n\nArteries are vessels that pump blood away from your heart and supply oxygen to your body. Then the deoxygenated blood travels through your veins, vessels that carry blood back to the heart. \n\nThe different types of vasculitis are divided into three groups based on the size of the vessels they affect: large, medium, and small-vessel vasculitis. Though Behcet's disease is classified as a small-vessel vasculitis, it can cause inflammation in arteries and veins, small, medium, and large. \n\nIn general, Behcet's disease affects veins more than arteries and small vessels more than large ones. But inflammation in large arteries is possible. In that respect, Behcet's does not discriminate. \n\nHowever, Behcet's disease can be a tiny bit sexist. Although it affects both men and women, vascular involvement is more frequently seen in men. That does not mean women with Behcet's do not experience blood-vessel inflammation, too \u2013 just not as often as us guys (lucky us!). \n\nWhat about other Behcet's symptoms? Do some affect guys more than gals? Do some affect the ladies more than the fellas? Up next, we will explore some gender differences in Behcet's disease. \n\n***3. Behcet's disease does discriminate***\n\nBoth men and women can be diagnosed with Behcet's disease. And while either gender can experience any of Behcet's symptoms, some are more common in one or the other. \n\nAs mentioned above, vascular involvement is more common in men with Behcet's than women. And, unfortunately for us guys, so is serious ocular (eye) and neurological involvement. \n\nA study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology looked at 880 patients with Behcet's uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, part of the eye). After 5 years, the risk of losing useful vision in male patients was 21% and 10% in women. After 10 years, the risk was 30% for men compared to 17% for women. The researchers concluded that Behcet's uveitis is (generally) more severe in men and more likely to result in vision loss. \n\nAnother study published in the same medical journal looked at childhood-onset Behcet's uveitis. The researchers found that uveitis was more common among males diagnosed with Behcet's disease than females. \n\nBehcet's disease can affect the nervous system (including the brain). This is referred to as Neuro-Behcet's. Estimates vary widely as to what percentage of people diagnosed with Behcet's experience neurological involvement, anywhere from 2.2-50%. \n\nThough Neuro-Behcet's can affect both men and women, it is more commonly seen in men. The men:women ratio for Neuro-Behcet's is 2.9:1. In other words, men diagnosed with Behcet's disease are about 3 times more likely to experience Neuro-Behcet's than women. \n\nWhen it comes to some of the other common symptoms of Behcet's disease like oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and arthritis, men and women are affected at roughly the same rate. But there is one more way Behcet's discriminates \u2013 mortality rate. While Behcet's has an overall mortality rate of about 5%, men are a lot more likely to die from Behcet's-related complications than women. \n\n***4. You are saying it wrong***\n\nI will never forget the day in 1997 that I got diagnosed with Behcet's disease. I was at the Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston being seen by one of the leading retina specialists in the country. He sat me down and said in a matter-of-fact tone, \u201cYou have Behcet's disease,\u201d as if all sixteen-year-old kids are supposed to know what that is. \n\nThis doctor \u2013 who is name I will not mention \u2013 pronounced it buh-shets disease. And the rheumatologist I began seeing soon after also pronounced it buh-shets. So, naturally, I assumed they were saying it correctly. These men were, after all, highly accomplished doctors. \n\nWell, they were both wrong. And so have most of the doctor's I have seen since. You see, Behcet's disease was named after the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Beh\u00e7et. You may notice that little mark under the letter c. That is called a cedilla (sometimes spelled cedille or cedilha) and it changes the pronunciation of the letter. \n\nCedillas are a little hook or tail under certain letters and are used in several languages. In French, a cedilla under the letter C gives it a s- sound. However, in Turkish, a cedilla under the letter C gives it a ch- sound. \n\nSince the written word was the most common form of communication in Dr. Hulusi Behcet's day, a lot of people had only seen his name in writing. And a lot of those people assumed the cedilla in his last name was French, not Turkish. \n\nBecause of this, the disease he wrote extensively about became known over time as buh-sets or buh-shets. But that is not the way Dr. Hulusi Behcet's family name was pronounced. Since it is a Turkish name, the C-cedilla follows the Turkish rules: it is pronounced not like s- but like ch-. So, if the name of the disease stayed true to the doctor it is named after, it would be pronounced bay-chets disease. \n\n***5. To B or not to B \u2013 HLA-B, that is***\n\nThe cause of Behcet's disease is believed to be at least partly genetic. And no other gene has received nearly as much attention as the HLA-B51 gene (HLA stands for human leukocyte antigen). \n\nNearly 40 years ago in 1982, researchers published a paper that demonstrated a close association between Behcet's disease and the HLA-B5 series of genes, particularly B51. Since then, as genetic science has progressed, lots of other research has been done on HLA-B51 and other genes related to Behcet's. \n\nIt is estimated that between 50-80% of people diagnosed with Behcet's disease are positive for the HLA-B51 gene. However, just because you test positive for HLA-B51 does not mean you necessarily have Behcet's. In fact, 20% of healthy individuals (people with no signs or symptoms of Behcet's or anything else) have the HLA-B51 gene. \n\nAnother gene associated with Behcet's disease \u2013 though much less strongly \u2013 is HLA-B52. A study done in Israel, a country with a high prevalence of Behcet's, found HLA-B51 present in 63% of patients with Behcet's and HLA-B52 in 21%. While that might not sound like a high percentage, it is more than twice that of the control group. \n\nLastly, I will mention the HLA-B27 gene. This one is associated with several diseases including reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and anterior uveitis. HLA-B27 has also been shown to be associated with Behcet's disease, though not nearly as strongly as HLA-B51. \n\nI am not sure about HLA-B52, but I personally have the HLA-B51 and HLA-B27 genes. I did uncover a bit of good news for those of us with both genes. At least according to one study published in 2007, patients diagnosed with Behcet's uveitis who tested positive for both HLA-B51 and B27 had more favorable prognoses.\n\n*Thanks for reading! If you would like to read the full article with all 10 facts and references, you can do so here: ( Interesting, thank you!  I have read that some of these things (like the likelihood of having certain systems involved in men vs women) is different depending on your heritage. I think women are more likely to have it than men in western countries and people with no silk-road heritage and also more likely to have neuro-behcets and eye involvement is much less likely as well. Wish I had the source, but would love to see more about this since it is much less common in these groups, there is not a lot of information. You are absolutely right. It is *is* more nuanced than this. But this post already came out three-times longer than I would originally planned. The truth is, there is conflicting data when it comes to a lot of things Behcet's related (and medicine related in general). I did my best to present the most current evidence in the simplest way possible. If you are interested in where I got my information from, I heavily cited the article as it exists on my website if you follow the link. But again, you are right. Like most things in life, it just are not that simple :)", "Rash? Anyone get a rash associated with their disease?  I have had a skin rash that looks like a sunburn (red splotchy like) and has a rough texture (sandpaper like) but not raised.  It started around my breast and has moved to my armpit area and up my chest to the base of my neck.  It is been there since April (6months). It seems to get worse during flares and better when not, but never really goes away.  Itchy, and burns sometimes.  \n\nRheumatologist said psoriasis, dermatologist said not psoriasis, but did not know what, GI said not related to drugs, so I am just left with this rash.  Sigh.  \n\nHard to Google rashes, and behcets bc it is just not that common.  \n\nThanks! You could post it at /r/Dermatology but since you are disease is already pretty rare I do not think they are able to figure it out.  I get strange rash\u2019s all the time. Mainly they look like red dots all over the place plus my skin is so dry with brown patches. I believe it is just part of the disease, They do get it she also yet no doctor has said psoriasis. I have been getting a rash similar to what you described, and it is been occurring only since my diagnosis so I have suspected that it is behcets but I am not sure and have not been to a dermatologist. In any case I have had some relief success using skin lotion with colloidal oatmeal Hmm thanks, yeah I will try that. \n\nI have had some success with Aveeno sensitive skin, which has a lot of perfumes, which I thought would be bad, but it is best at relieving the red itchiness after a shower. Any updates with your rash? I was just looking for answers myself. I have had rash like outbreaks before that generally went away with a steroid topical cream but now I have a patch on my face and nothing is working. No not really. No one knew much about it (gi, rheumatologist, dermatologist)  I had it for about a year and a half and it only went away when they out me on Prednisone (40mg) for about a month.  Still on Prednisone, tapering down now that I am back on remicaid.  No sign of the rash coming back for now.  \n\nAveeno stress relief with oatmeal worked somewhat to keep it from being slightly less red and angry looking.  But that was about all that worked.  ", "Community compendium/pictures of behcets's symptoms Mods please chime on the feasibility of this.\n\nGoogling images when I first started suspecting the disease was miserable so I was wondering whether people with diagnosed Behcets(complete/incomplete) would considering posting non-revealing(let us skip any private parts out) . I think it could be useful but also a double edge sword since they could maybe make people assume they have behcets. Personally I would like to see what pseudofolliculitis looks in other patients. Just an idea since its so rare to find behcets patients all in one place.  Thoughts? I really like this idea, it is really difficult to find images of what rare symptoms actually look like. I suspect I get pseudofolliculitis but I have no idea what it would look like... probably normal folliculitis tbh lol \n\nI think it would be important to tag images as \u201cdiagnosed\u201d \u201csuspected\u201d etc Oh god I have some truly awful pictures.,.\n\nIf they can help, just tell me where to send them.\n\nHorrifying pictures. All behcets related. Took them all myself.\n\nAlready feeling 1st through 7th hand embarrassment about them.\n\nMostly ulcers though. But I am a walking case of pseudofolliculitus. I like this idea. I have been working with several members of the community on creating some shared resources - mostly compendiums of symptoms, treatments, and summaries for this subreddit. However, one thing we have found is that pictures of the described symptoms are largely non-existent - so this might be a unique resource. \n\nIt might be a quarterly thread to share pictures of symptoms (sores, rashes, etc) - that way we can mark it appropriately if folks do not want to see that type of content - but also have ways for members to share these things pseudo-anonymously as well.", "Tonsil stones, gluten, aphthous ulcers, Behcet's?  I have seen people mention that gluten can cause inflammation with Behcet's. I have also started having tonsil stones the past couple years, and I am wondering if there is a link. A Google search for tonsil stones and gluten came back with a lot of results; wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Also says gluten sensitivity can cause mouth ulcers, which is another main symptom of Behcet's. While some people here have said they noticed some connection between gluten and mouth sore, I for example have not. My diet is composed of mainly gluten (being Italian I eat pasta at least once per day). Not saying they are wrong by any means, I just think this specific thing might be subjective.\nIn any case, if you did have still to diagnose and therefore uncured Beh\u00e7et's your mouth ulcers would come up anyways, whatever you ate, diet might reduce their frequency and severity but not remove them completely.\nAs far as tonsil stones go, I cannot say since my tonsils got removed a few years back due to constant inflammations which we did not know we are caused by Beh\u00e7et's. As far as I can read tho they are not caused by inflammations, and since Beh\u00e7et's is a vasculitis, I really cannot imagine any link. My acupuncturist recommended I hold off on the gluten once we recognized all of my bad beh\u00e7ets flare ups happened after a night of beeeeeeer. Rip beer. She is an md in Chinese medicine, and there is actually a lot more Information on beh\u00e7ets in Chinese medicine than in western medicine. It has a different name, but is the \u201cSilk Road\u201d disease. I have noticed a HUGE difference once I lay off gluten. Unfortunately haha", "Almost 20 years! That is how long I have been asking doctors to help me connect the dots. Today I finally saw a rheumatologist! And I had an ulcer to show her. She did not dismiss me with \u201cyou are just sensitive\u201d or \u201cit is an allergic reaction\u201d or, my favourite, \u201cnobody has that\u201d. My aunt passed away from Behcets complications and I have been trying since then to get help. Today was a good day. What were her complications? I have hypertension that despite being young has so far failed to be controlled on 2 different meds, and fast pulse/shortness of breath. I am thinking it is related to the Behchets and not sure what to do about it. She had many. The more serious we are bowel resections, retinal abscesses, and eventually brain abscesses. Poor thing!", "Remicade approval by insurance? Tips? I have failed every medication that I have tried this far. For the past (almost) 3 months, I have been on methotrexate. My rheumatologist wanted me to begin taking it and the plan was to start Remicade shortly after. My insurance has denied coverage twice now as it is off label use. I recently went to the ophthalmologist and even with my eye symptoms, it is not enough to say I have uveitis which would guarantee approval.\n\nHas anyone had luck with getting around the red tape? Any tips or advice? My rheumatologist's next step may be to send me to Mayo Clinic so that they can sign off stating I need Remicade. He said that if they sign off on it, the insurance will have to approve it. Your rheumatologist needs to reach out to the drug company for compassionate usage. There are more avenues to explore. Always red tape.  Just keep pushing. God, this is the second time I see a post like this one. Guess I was really lucky being born European and needing nothing more than one doctor saying I need Humira to get it instantly with nobody making any sort of problem.\n\nBest of luck.", "Nose sores anyone?  25, f , no official diagnosis. I had my first episode of behcet\u2019s like symptoms last summer, genital Sore, healead in 3 days, joints aches and left knee pain untill september and maybe some nose sores, i did not see them Even if i tried, But my nose Felt strange, like during a cold when you wipe your nose too often. The aches came back almost every month, for a day or two, around my menstruation and were very mild. \n   Now i m 10 weeks pregnant and sooooo scared. I m having those mild aches and my nose feels painful, still cant see the sores. My blood work from last autumn is normal, negative Ana , negative Ana panel, normal CRP, normal reumathoid factor, negative hlab51, negative patergy test. But what i m afraid of is lupus, i heard lupus cause nose sores? Does behcet\u2019s cause them too? Can it be lupus with negative Ana? Please , someone answer me ! I was diagnosed with Behcet's 25 years ago and I used to get nose sores all the time, especially during my late teens/early 20s when the disease was most active. Sometimes I could see them, sometimes I could not. Sometimes they would really hurt, sometimes they would not. \n\nThere are so many overlapping symptoms (and underlying genetics) between the various autoimmune diseases. Lupus and Behcet's have much in common. A lot of people with Behcet's have comorbidities (other diagnoses). While it is possible to have Lupus with a negative ANA, the odds are quite slim (like 2% or something like that. It is been a long time since I have researched it so I could be wrong). \n\nSo yeah, I used to get nose sores. And I have talked to several others with Behcet's that get them, too. I hope that helps. Be well! The only thing I know about lupus is that it causes huge red spots on the skin? Do you have them? If not it most likely are not lupus.\n\nNose sores are possible with BD, but negative everything does not point towards it.\n\nAlso, you are pregnant, it is normal that random stuff is going to happen since your body is going through huge changes to adapt to the baby. Yes behcets can cause nose sores. It does with me, but it is main symptoms and the ones you have to have to get diagnosed with are ongoing multiple genital sores, mouth ulcers, skin pathergy and eye uveitis. My nose bleeds from ulcers that seem to be trying to drill a hole from one side to the other and up into the sinuses. Lovely illness. Autoimmune diseases are all very similar, it does not really matter what you call them, it is your body beating itself up. Yep, I get these nose sores too. I did not have them when I was on birth control but since I have come off that I get them sporadically (I have PCOS so no regular menstrual cycle) and I have made a tenuous link between the sores and fluctuations in hormones. I get the nose sores too.  Not much really helps them except putting a little water soluble (aquaphor) in my nose.  You do not want to use any petroleum based lubricants where you breathe out of. I get nose sores. Most autoimmune issues are mild when pregnant. Ask your OB to test you for Ro/La antibodies for lupus. They are important during pregnancy and can cause heart issues for the fetus.\n\nMy BD was in remission while pregnant-- my son had a mild heart issues and congenital issue that is benign but they did the tests for me around 20 wks and I saw a maternal fetal specialist.\n\nI did flare post weaning from breastfeeding and I think if I did not breastfeed the sudden drop in hormones would have been a trigger. Hormones are my biggest trigger.\n\nLuckily pregnancy does not seem to make most AI diseases significantly worse or better. I am 2 y postpartum feel free to ask any questions. I also was going to say nasal passages can get dry during pregnancy due to hormonal changes. I found that Ayr saline gel is helpful. Thicker than nose spray so it stays but not vaseline. Most doctors will not treat anything (or diagnose anything) when pregnant because your body does so much random stuff when pregnant. I know it is so annoying, but your best bet will be to follow up after delivery if it is just as persistent. This will definitely point to an issue not associated with pregnancy. I get nose sores too. I was told by my doc (Professor Fortune / London Behcets clinic) that it is not a symptom of behcets, and made her investigate other autoimmune /inflammatory conditions.  My mum gets them too and she has Crohn's, vasculitis &amp; Sjogrens (not sure which Crohn's is linked to).", "The worst of both worlds I hate it here.

I was thinking some personal things that she would like but also bath bombs because I heard baths help with symptoms (or would bath bombs irritate things?). Please let me know, thank you in advance! The best way to be supportive is by learning about the disease. Check out Behcets connection. They have great info about behcets. Bath bombs may be irritating, just depending on their symptoms. \nAll of us are a little different but comfort items are key.

One in my thigh and one in my lower leg. I get pretty bad canker sores inside my mouth, on my tongue, and on my lips. I also have eye pain sometimes. I have enlarged tonsils but I guess not bad enough to get them removed. I am not a doctor but based on your description it sounds like you could have behcets. I was diagnosed after my first blood clot when I was a kid because they tested me for just about everything else (crohn\u2019s, lupus, and some more), and there is no test for behcets so basically process of elimination. Going to a hematologist and rheumatologist will be good! All of my doctors had to work together to agree on a diagnosis. Good luck! Ok but I do not want to be you \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d if it is Beh\u00e7et\u2019s, what is it like, you do not get the famed \u2018genital ulcers\u2019 do you? Like I am kind of scared haha I had them once when I was really young and never again. There is a huge spectrum of how bad it can be with behcets. It can be super severe or very mild. It sucks because it is so uncommon and there is no treatment, but it can absolutely be maintained. There was a part of my life where I was on many medications, but now I am off of all of the ones that were for behcets. I was on some for blood clots and inflammation. I need to go to a rheumatologist and an eye doctor yearly. I had to go to a hematologist every year too but I am done with that! Thank you soooooo much. I will get back to you in this post after my appointments! Also I love your name Yes definitely do keep me updated! It might not be behcets. And even if it is, there are things you can do. The worst part I think for me are the canker sores...they hurt so much. I am still figuring out a way to maintain those. Good luck! I am so sorry you are going through this. Diagnosis is so hard and so often is just a guessing game. Whatever you have is obviously some sort of inflammatory autoimmune condition. My rheumatologist doesnt think naming things is really needed as the treatment is basically the same. Immunosuppressant medication. Ive ended up being named with having behcets, crohns , Sjogrens, celiacs, fibromyalgia, Gerd. And probably a host more Ive forgotten but i still feel there is a base reason for it all going wrong that isnt understood yet.  \nFor you, yes i think Behcets could be a possibility. You do not have to have all the symptoms but usually you need to have three out of the four main ones i think. Eyes, mouth, genitals, skin lesions and pathergy \nI hope you get some sort of help soon. Best of luck Yup I have GERD aswell... I do not have eye issues but I see black spots (scotoma) and have pain in the back of my eye etc I can go on but will not as I will wait for my doctors opinions. Thank you so much for your reply Hope your doing ok bud", "Behcets and Hallucinations Has anyone experienced hallucinations related to Behcets or treatment for Behcets? I do with hydroxychloroquine, when falling asleep/waking up/in the middle of the night. I think it is a known side effect for that, but my rheum had me do an MRI anyway (normal). I get them while I am falling asleep! Almost like a night terror. I always see bugs in my bed or in my room I have olfactory hallucinations thinking l smell smoke.", "Crawling feeling on my skin? Ok so I have got a behcets diagnosis and I have been treated with imuran since last fall and things have gotten a lot better. However, most of my life I have experienced a sensation of things crawling on my skin many many times a day. I thought this was normal until I brought it up with some of my friends and they were completely baffled and had never heard of anyone having that issue. It is been like this most of my life. Does anyone else have this type of thing? It feels like an insect is crawling on me but there is never anything there. Sun? Are you asking if it only happens when I am out in the sun? Nope. I get that! I have assumed it was from fibromyalgia, since it is a nerve sensation and it is lessened by cymbalta. That is interesting!! I know some behcets has a nerve component so I was curious to hear how many other people had similar weirdness. Oh my god. I thought it was alone \ud83d\ude02. I totally know what you mean by this, no fun It makes me feel so much better to know it is not just me!!! I have actually ignored real bugs before by mistake because I thought it was just that skin tickle. I get this occasionally, but only in certain areas. Usually, it happens on my legs or feet. You are definitely not alone :) Thank you for answering! It happens the most on my arms, legs, hands and feet. Heat and sun can trigger the itching for me, but yes!! God awful itching.", "Anyone had the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine? Hi everyone,\n\nIn my country the Oxford Astra Zeneca covid vaccine is the one we will be offered..  I have not seen anyone on here say that they have had that one so far, so I am wondering..?\n\nI also have not had a chance to see my rheumatologist since I have to normally travel to the US for treatment   and my virtual consultation (at which I planned to discuss vaccine) was pushed back another month. \n\nAnyone has experience with this one? Or spoken to a rheumatologist who had discussed this one in particular? \n\nThanks! I had this vaccine in the uk 2 days ago, as I am considered to be in a \"high risk\" category. At the moment in uk, its mainly over 70s and high risk who are receiving it. (And also people in health care and social care) Ok, and are you on any immunosuppressants? Just wondering what the general consensus is about AstraZeneca safety for those of us with BD on immunosuppressant meds? I am on Azathioprine and Colchicine. I am currently on a immunotherapy treatment which makes me immunocompromised and I am in the first 8 million people vaccinated in the uk i believe.\nI had a fever and chills for a day but I am feeling normal again now. Good news, thanks for replying and stay safe! Will you update if you get any reaction/ flare ups please?", "Which Vaccine? H\u2019ok deep breath.\nLittle background: \nI have had behcets since forever and I am 26 now. Mostly mouth ulcers and flares exacerbated by stress. I have been on Remicade for several years and still have the occasional flare but it is not as bad as it used to be. \n\nWaiting for my doctor to tell me what vaccine to get, but my state is also letting people just schedule to get a vaccine at local pharmacies. \n\nDoes anyone know the consensus as to what vaccine we should get? The pros and cons of each? The side effects seem to be different for everyone. \nSorry if this is a silly question or has been asked before. \nThanks guys Hey! I am 26, too. I have Beh\u00e7et\u2019s and it is not really being treated right now because I wanted to wait until I was vaccinated. My main issue is cankers, I also get genital lesions, and sometimes severe GI issues. \n\nI got the Pfizer vaccine! All went well. I had some minor headaches, sleepiness, dizziness, low HR, pounding heart, but it was nothing too earth shaking considering I deal with that crap from the Behcets a lot of the time. I also had a genital flare. 4 sores at one time (most I have ever had) a few days after vaccine two. \n\nI had my rheumatology blood work done and my C-Reactive Protein was 133.8 a week after the vaccine. I would have never known! It was 1.7 in December. \n\nI am still doing fine and it is been almost 2 weeks after vaccine #2. I would do it again. I used to get really bad genital ulcers, but I ended up taking birth control but just skipping the placebo week (dr recommended) so I did not need to wear pads because the chafing made it SOOOO much worse! I get weird cramps sometimes and other weird symptoms but it is always a game of \u201cis it behcets or just an anxiety thing?\u201d \n\nI have heard good things about the J&amp;J vaccine but I legit have no idea how Michigan is planning on doing stuff lol \nI have a rheumatology appointment coming up but I will probably have to get the vaccine before then.\nSo glad you got yours and got through all the weirdness afterwards! \nHaving a pre-existing thing and living through a pandemic is uh really difficult! It is so funny you say that! My gynecologist upped my BC dosage so I would not get as many periods. I told my rheumatologist another reason I wanted to hold off on taking any stronger meds was to see if it was a hormonal issue! She was like yeah, no. You are still going to get the ulcers LOL \nI am glad that helped! I stopped wearing pads and switched over to period panties. They are expensive, but I love them. They are so much more comfortable!\n\nI will be curious to hear which one you get and how it goes for you! Keep us updated and good luck! I did the Pfizer and it was fine.  You will be fine with whatever just plan to maybe have your body flare. I actually got an IUD to try to help with my hormone issues! My behcets flairups are always worse around my period. Got an IUD on monday and my Pfizer vaccine yesterday (Thursday). No major problems after the first dose. (BTW, I am in Michigan and I was surprised that I could get it!) FWIW when the only known available vaccines were Pfizer and Moderna I was told by my RA either was fine and sooner was better than later. Dunno about the other vaccines, did not have to look as I got my first shot of Pfizer 2 weeks ago, and FINALLY got scheduled for my second dose next week. (we had to find our own way to a first and second dose in my state) I am 29 and also am on Remicade for Behcets- I got Johnson and Johnson because it was the option that was available to me. I have heard mixed things about the efficacy rate- the two dose shots have shown higher rates from their studies, but the J&amp;J one was tested later with all of the variants included so it is not really fair to compare efficacy against the first ones that were only tested with the first COVID strain. I did appreciate that J&amp;J was just 2 weeks until the antibodies are built up, compared to waiting 6ish weeks for two shots and the build up time on the others. I have heard J&amp;J only has a 2% chance of causing flu like symptoms, but I was sick for a day after I received it (I have a post on here sharing my experience). I would happily take any of the vaccines, I do not think you can go wrong. Glad you have the opportunity to schedule in your state! I got the moderna shot about two weeks ago Is the remicade effective for you? If you do not mind, what made your doctor suggest it? I am in the trial stage of meds now and just looking for some experiences Yes, I am on the weight-based dose plus one extra vial and I get infusions every 8 weeks. I still experienced joint pain and fatigue (they call them breakthrough symptoms) when I was on the basic dose but have been doing well now that I have the extra vial added. I tried Azathioprine first and had a toxicity reaction that landed me in the hospital, but from what I understand that is pretty rare. I also was on prednisone for quite awhile and Meloxicam for joint pain too. With Remicade I was able to quit everything else. With my Behcets onset I primarily had ulcers in my GI tract kind of like Crohns, and Remicade is an effective treatment for that condition so I think that may have informed their choice to start me on this drug. Remicade was not covered by insurance as a treatment for Behcets, but it is covered as a Crohns treatment so my doctor went ahead and submitted a dual diagnosis for me and insurance approved the drug. Good luck trying meds- I know it is a pain but it is worth it once you get settled on something that works! That sounds really similar to me! What GI symptoms were you having? I am yet to get an endoscopy/colonoscopy so I am just curious I had ulcers throughout my full GI tract. My mouth had some ulcers but they were worse down my throat and my tonsils swole up. Then for my lower GI I had a few visible ulcers but my main symptom started as an upset stomach and food moving through me quickly. My symptoms accelerated to the point where I was not eating much, but when I did eat it either rushed through me or came back up. It was bad enough that I would wake multiple times a night to go be sick and I just kept my door closed at work so I could throw up and get back to work. I ended up very fatigued and anemic from the whole experience. (Actually I had to go in for an IV and the site would not heal, it had a pathergy response to the needle so that was interesting.) I had upper and lower endoscopies which showed the ulcers and scarring. After being on the Remicade for a year I had the endoscopies redone and they showed the ulcers had healed- yay! My biggest takeaway from the experience was that many symptoms started incrementally building on each other and I had not realized how sick I had become and how serious the situation is- please learn from my mistake and follow up on symptoms before they get out of control! I am definitely guilty of waiting until things get unbearable, but I am trying to be on top of it. It is hard because I am starting a new job, but I will definitely keep pushing! Thanks so much", "Intense night sweating How many of you have this symptom? It happened to me this night, I have been like a test without symptoms, and this is like a warning. \nHow many of you think that their behcet may be deeply related to their mental state? I think most of my flare-ups appeared after strong psychological stress, and I have passed through really bad days lately I think this is spot on for me. Psychological stress wrecks me and causes flare ups (pretty sure) and I get night sweats pretty often. Like my side of the bed is stained. And all night I go between tearing off the covers to shivering cold. It sucks. Ha Disclaimer: Behcet's is the working diagnosis for me, not full-blown.\n\nI have had night sweats for as long as I can remember. I am still not sure what causes it, but my top two theories are simply too warm or stress. I never thought it was Behcet's but maybe. I have tried sleeping as cold as I can stand but I gave up on it. I forget why. Proly still got night sweats. I have mentioned it to doctors but nothing. I should mention it to my sleep doc I am going to talk to soon.\n\nIf you keep getting night sweats, some things you can do are keep a towel by the bedside to towel off quickly to get back to sleep, and wear pajamas/pants to bed. Well I mostly sweat from my legs.\n\nAs far as I know, *my* Behcet's is not related to my mental state. My one and only major flare-up happened shortly after one of the best nights of my life (which involved MDMA) with exciting plans ahead. I was at a high point in my life. And while I was hospitalized, I maintained a very positive attitude. But my mental state went to shit after months of high-dose corticosteroids. Anyways I do think stress will worsen any medical condition and health in general.\n\nI am sorry to hear you have been having bad days. I hope you can carve out time for self-care. Get some greenspace, cardio, pet therapy, talk therapy, ( Avoid stressful activities &amp; people. It is good that you are expressing yourself somewhere. You might even consider antidepressants or something. Consult a medical professional. Well, I would say MDMA is very related with your mental state. When I say stress I do not necesarily mean long hours at work, etc. Feeling very Happy, with many plans, working out a lot... That put stress in your mind and body too. Drugs, sex, feeling excited... Those are things that put a lot of stress on you. \n\nThanks for your answer. Thanks, maybe doctor should have this into consideration. I have only been diagnosed recently, but I have had symptoms for like... One year and a half (light ones).\nI would say night sweats are a thing for me recently. But I do not really see them as a warning sign, but more like a \"post\" reaction Never thought of this as a symptom. It happens sometimes, and yea, around flareups!\n\nI have had a dozen ulcers try to form the last week, and night sweats every other night, and just overall restless sleep. And I am under more stress than probably ever. I have Behcets and have suffered from this as well! I have been fortunate enough to get the disease under control with Humira, but before that I would have intense night sweats almost every night during flares. Sometimes stress-related, but sometimes it seemed random too. To combat it, I would sleep on top of the covers with the fan on, and would sometimes put a cool migraine patch on my head to soothe the overheating. Invest in a mattress protector lol. My rheum once suggested taking Tylenol before bed to regulate the body temperature but I have not tried it since feeling better on the biologic. Maybe that could help you? It is probably related more with stress ad anxiety than with Beh\u00e7et itself, but stress can probably cause and be caused by flareups... I think that, for many of us, this syndrome is very related with stress. Good luck with that. Yeah me too... I have been a year completely without symptoms after humira... and yesterday I had that night sweating like the other times... and now I feel scared. I hope I do not sweat this night. I am fine now, I ran today and my body did well, but I fear a flareup coming.  \n\n\nI do not think it is related to temperature, I mean, I sweat at night even if I am cold. And this amount of sweat is not normal, I mean, even if I workout very hard, if I am under the sun at the beach or whatever... I never sweat this way, I think the bed would be less wet if I peed on it. Thanks for the advice though! I may ask my rheum if I keep this way. Perhaps could you be sleeping with fevers and waking up without them? Or having fevers during sleep? Many times I wake up soaking wet at night because my fever just had gone down... Maybe, It was a month ago and I am fine now though. \n\nStress is the worse, try to take care of your mind :)", "behcets hi everyone! i am a 19 F who was just told i most likely have beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, as all my symptoms match and all the rest of the tests were negative. the one really odd thing i have that i was wondering if anyone else had is hypersensitivity to medication. over the course of the last year i have seen 18 doctors of different specialties, and naturally they gave me different types of medication to try and treat my symptoms before they knew i had behcets. about a year ago, i was given amoxicillin, as i had a chronic sore throat, and right after i began to get sores and ulcers in my mouth as well as gum bleeding. after this, i was given acyclovir and reacted to this as well. i have also had reactions to multiple other medications, and had other medications such as steroids cause my symptoms to get worse. i was told that this was hypersensitivity to medication, and was curious if this is something that others with behcets experience or not. thanks for reading!", "I am (17 M) have canker sores for a long time and started getting genital ulcers 6 months before  I am not eating packaged food right now and have a lot of improvement in ulcers is my condition caused due to any allergies or bechets and what if I do not take medication I have no other symptoms I live in India but I know my ancestors are middle eastern many of my relatives used to get ulcers but all of them stopped having in their early 20s I am just worried about the eye thing I have no problem right now but am worried if I do not take medication it will develop. Question, are you also vegetarian or vegan?\n\nI am noticing on the forums, and myself included, there seems to be a very high correlation between b12 deficiency and beh\u00e7et\u2019s (probably other chronic inflammation diseases as well). \n\nI highly recommend a sublingual b complex regardless. If you can get a baseline from the dr- I would. \n\nSince I have corrected my b12, I do not get ulcers anymore. I hate vegetables but when I started I must tell you my ulcers are almost goneatfer I started eating vegetables before I never eat vegetables But genital ulcer are still there it get worse when I walk a lot and get sweaty B12 deficiency is actually part of the differential diagnosis of oral ulcers because it is a known symptom! When I first got tested at my rheum(25), she did run it but failed to take it into account or follow up. (349 at the time). \n\nThe only other mention I have heard with genital\nUlcers was from my gastro who had told me how crohns can cause that as well. \n\nSo here I am, 33 finally dx with pernicious anemia- which was an absolute fight (Bc of my age and looks) for them to even test my b12 in the first place, get the correct loading dose, and an adequate dosage for my age and how active I am. Having two miscarriages within 6 months, severe neuropathy, severe confusion, coordination and speech problems were clearly not enough for them to consider a b12 deficiency and they just pushed prednisone and told me to get back on my immunosuppressant (colcrys which did not help this whole thing haha)\n\nI see you are going to school (also was going to do PA but struggle with my energy and memory) please do not judge your healthier looking patients and please keep pushing for earlier b12 detection. \n\nThank you for your answer.", "Why is it always the lower body (or is that just me)? Has anyone ever been given an explanation as to why so many behcets symptoms occur around the lower body? Besides oral sores, virtually every major inflammation occurs from my crotch down. Right now my left knee hurts when I bend my leg and I have got 2 huge red swollen stretches on both my shins. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll I get from the waist up is the occasional bad case of folliculitis or minor lesion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there a reason for this? Is this just the way mine manifests or is there a pattern amongst all of us? I am thinking it might be because of how much blood runs through the lower body, but that is just pure speculation Interesting observation. There are several manifestations higher up. Uveitis. Scalp sores. Lesions in the nose, ears. CNS involvement affecting the brain, notably brain stem. With that said, there are a lot in the lower body as well. Personally, I have had my major outbreaks of Erythema Nodosum below the knees, genital ulcers, pseudo folliculitis on legs, abcesses on groin area/derriere.\n\nOne thing is for sure... this disease does not quit, and does whatever the heck it wants. :( Given I had uveitis and finger arthritis I can say it is your Behcet which is primarily affecting the lower body. When I was younger, I noticed that most of my Behcet's symptoms happened on the left half of my body (clots, eye inflammation, sores, etc). But now that I have had time for Behcet's to wreak havoc on my entire body, I realize it was just a coincidence. \n\nIn your case, I think the same is true. Since everyone gets different symptoms, for some people those symptoms will happen mostly in the lower half of the body. But believe me: Behcet's can  with your entire body :) It is actually mostly the left lower body for me! My poor left leg is just crippled non-stop. Though I guess that is preferable to it happening everywhere, I hope that does not happen I must have been lucky so far, no eye symptoms for me and my upper joints are fine too. Hoping it stays that way I hope it stays that way for you. Would not that be great if Behcet's only affected one quadrant of the body haha!", "Misdiagnosis? Psoriasis and ulcerative colitis or something else? Hi, since I was about 12 I have been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. At age 14 I was put on infliximab infusions, which I understand is also a treatment for beh\u00e7ets, and was only just taken off it last year, I am now 19. Since I came off the infusion I broke out in a strange rash all over my tummy, legs and arms. I have had one quite large sore/ scab appear on my leg and then lots of little just red dots and you can see in the pictures. I was told by the doctor it sounded like psoriasis over the phone due to covid they would not see me.  Majority of that cleared up I still do get the odd spot. I also have quite sore joints, my jaw often becomes stiff and unable to open past a certain point, I got a mouth guard to try and help ease this. I also get pain in my neck and ankles. Another thing I have experienced since coming off treatment is sometimes sore eyes. In one case it got very inflamed and red. I often get severe headache and migraines, and even since my UC has been in remission I have struggled to keep a steady weight and am very below average weight. Most recently and concerning me the most is I have ulcers on my genitals. I have been to the doctor and they suggested it may be herpes. I was tested and it came back negative. I know herpes tests can sometimes not be accurate so I decided to go ahead with some treatment anyway. The symptoms are still here but I have not completed treatment yet. I do sometimes get ulcers in my mouth but I have never thought too much of it having ulcerative colitis. However, after doing my research on the symptoms of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease and reading other people\u2019s posts on Reddit about misdiagnoses of herpes and crohns I am now considering it could be a possibility I have beh\u00e7ets. I am very unsure and honestly feel a bit embarrassed to go to the doctor incase I am totally reaching with this diagnosis as I understand it is a rare condition. If you read all of that thank you! And any comments or opinions  would be really appreciated and helpful. This is my first time using Reddit and I am slightly unsure how to add pictures of my eye, and rash. Thanks :) In my opinion, if you have a bunch of symptoms that match Beh\u00e7et, it is never silly to go to your doctor with this idea. Many times, doctors are just not familiar with Beh\u00e7et, and it does not cross their minds really. I was told this by my doctor in my country, after being diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et in France. My rheumatologist told me straight: with your history, if you had been here, no one in the hospital would have known. You would be treated for lupus\n\nSo, if you think it could be, tell. Maybe it is not, but it is good if your doctor is aware of it. Since it is rare stuff, in some places where there are few cases like my country, there is always a chance they do not even know about it much. My former cardiologist, a friend of the family, did not even know it existed for example. It is never silly to advocate for yourself. The genital ulcers that are not herpes seem like a pretty important factor on top of your other symptoms. If you believe you have been misdiagnosed, push for them to look into things more. I was told I had herpes as a 12 year old Virgin, so trust me not all doctors listen or even give a crap. Thanks for your reply! I feel they have not been bothered at all with this. I would really like a more firm diagnosis so I know how to proceed and that I am receiving the correct treatment! I am going to phone Monday and hope they will do some further investigation. Thanks again! Thank you! I am going to contact the doctor on Monday and explain my concern. Hopefully they will know what it is and take it seriously! Thanks again. I wish you luck! Unfortunately neither UC or Behcets are super fun things to have.", "Getting tired and feeling sleepy ", "Gastro Behcets - anyone try intermittent fasting? I am so sick and tired of the stomach pain.  Every time I have a flare, I gain 10 pounds, have diarrhea for a week plus, and have a painfully bloated and gassy stomach the entire time.  I have already tried low carb.  Has anyone tried intermittent fasting?  As much as I hate the joint pain, this is probably my least favorite symptom and I am desperate to do something about it. I naturally intermittent fast by intuitively eating. I wake up, drink coffee, eat my first meal at 11:00am or 12:00pm, then my last meal at around 8-9pm. I do not always follow this exactly, but tend to not eat my first meal until 12-12:30pm or so a few days a week. \n\nIntuitively eating is eating when you are TRULY hungry. When you do not use your body's resources on digestion (a massive use), you can do \"spring cleaning\" on your body's cells and vitalize your energy sources b/c that energy normally spent on digestion is diverted to other bodily systems. \n\nI eat 90% or more fruits, veggies, wild fish, organic meat, and some legumes with minimal organic dairy or feta cheese once in a while. \n\nDiet is everything! Anti-inflammation diet and removing processed foods from 90-100% of your diet. You can take a high quality turmeric as well to reduce inflammation/joint pain. Three suggestions that helped me: 1)go through the tedious but insightful process of a structured food reactivity testing program. It will take a couple of months to do it. I learned from it just how severely all forms of peppers ravage my GI system. Additionally: any type of bean, eggplants, dairy products, lettuce and grains. I fought doing this, but working around these foods keeps me out of pain most of the time now. 2) Do you have SIBO also? Get tested. My doctor has me take a round of xifaximin when I get diarrhea. 3) I wore a continuous glucose monitor (NutriSense) for 6 months. Combined with the food reactivity, very helpful. Reduced bloating, pain and theoretically in inflammation. I look pregnant when I get that painfully bloated ..sigh I hate it. It does not personally work for me for many reasons ..mostly the meds I take I like yogurt as my breakfast as it helps with nausea and stomach discomfort for me... also it affects my sugar (not a diabetic but I have issues with low blood sugar &amp; most of my family are diabetics) &amp; that affects my BP \ud83e\udd2a\u064bbut on a positive note: my mom does it &amp; she has Crohns and works well for her \u2764\ufe0f hope you find something that works for you!! Yah I wonder if you have a food intolerance. \n\nThere is a fair amount that react awful to night shades. You said you did low carb, but did that also eliminate sugars?\n\nOnce I cut sugars everything cleared up. Including most fruit too.\n\nAlso get yourself on a good probiotic. I have been doing exactly this- first meal around 11-12pm, then eat dinner before 9pm. Eat as many fruits/veg as possible and minimal dairy and it is really been helping me personally. For me it was cutting out gluten, nightshades and dairy that did the trick. Takes 4-6 weeks to \" heal\" after every  stomach \"flare\".. If the world is ending I am running to get a pizza!", "Has anyone identified specific triggers? Background: I have mild symptoms all the time, but then have episodes or flare ups where my symptoms are very severe, which usually ends up with me on medication.\n\nI woke up this morning and I think I am about to have another flare up of severe symptoms, particularly joint pain. I am upset because I do not understand why, I cannot think of anything I have done to cause it.\n\nI know it might just be random, but has anyone managed to identify any triggers that bring on or worsen symptoms? Any triggers for joint pain?\n\nThanks! I flare when I am sick or stressed, and I flare with my menstrual cycle (although with slightly different symptoms, which I think is kind of odd). I usually chalk anything unknown up to stress because I am very bad at de-stressing.\n\nI think my joint pain gets worse with rain/pressure changes, but in my experience doctors do not really believe in that as a concept. It is definitely not the only trigger though. Diet. Diet. Diet.\n\nHuge triggers for me are increases in gluten intake sugar and alcohol. \n\nI have just delved into understanding the role of oxalates as well, as they are hugely contributory to inflammation. \n\nCannot recommend enough examining your diet and questioning what you may have been taught are healthy foods vs unhealthy.\n\nInflammatory disease sufferers need to remember their bodies do not function like others' do and therefore it is reasonable to assume we are not absorbing minerals as others do. Our bodies have different needs and none of my medical doctors ever steered me down the path of looking at my diet. I find it frustrating that there isnt a more holistic approach to improving our health. A thanks for replying!\n\nI agree I think stress is a trigger, but I have been stressed for weeks so idk why it is happening now. I have heard the menstrual cycle idea before, I have not noticed any correlations myself but think it is very interesting and will keep an eye out.  Thank you! I cannot think of anything I have eaten recently that is different to usual, but I have been trying to keep a food diary recently so will keep that up. Stress and not eating a healthy, real food diet. Alcohol and poor sleep, too Stress and my menstrual cycle seem to be big triggers. As well as diet. \n\nWeather seems to trigger some bodily aches and headaches. \n\nHeartburn and any sort of mouth trauma seem to be a huge triggers for mouth sores. Diet is huge for Behcets. Even if your doctor says there is no connection, there is. I find foods with certain toxins in them like onions, red wine, peppers are big triggers for me. And also, stress. Is it different for everyone? Do I have to work out the right diet for me? I would say definitely try elimination dieting to figure out what is toxic for you, but may not be for others.\n\nAs I say, I have just discovered the role oxalates play in my diet. I was eating potatoes and almonds every day thinking they were healthy alternatives to bread or pasta, and to granola I used to eat, because they were gluten and sugar free. Turns out they are so high in oxalates which are inflammatory foods. I am now trying to get onto a low oxalate diet as well as gluten and sugar free. \n\nIt is been a journey and I am learning and unlearning every day. There is lots and lots of information out there on anti inflammatory diets and their role in autoimmune diseases. \n\nIf you are looking for somewhere to start:\n\nTerry Wahls and the Wahls protocol\n\nMikhaila Peterson, Shawn Baker, Paul Saladino - Carnivore diet\n\nOxalate toxicity - varieties of sources \n\nMediterranean diets- high in healthy fats, fish, etc\n\nHope that gives you some direction to begin the diet journey. Thank you so much for the advice! I will look into it. Stress... and diet. When I do not eat right or have no time to eat I get sooo tired then BAM a mouth ulcer... stress for me causes it to flare. I avoid ALL nightshade foods anything inflammatory. I am on a nightshade free diet ,I avoid dairy,alcohol, sweets. It helps me a lot Hello, I usually have mild symptoms as well and my main trigger is any kind of stress or anxiety. The worse it is, the worse will be the symptoms and how fast it develops. As I am always kind of stress, I am always as well feeling kind of sick and my mouth flares weekly. But when something out of common happens (like an important test) flares become numb legs and high fevers really fast. Medication helps, but I do not get better completely until I calm down.\n\nMaybe it could be your trigger too? I think stress must be a trigger because my worst flares have been when I have been very stressed. That is quite frustrating, as I usually cannot control getting stressed out.", "Could this be Behcets? Started suddenly like a virus - body aches worst around the joints for 48 hours...fever...then yellow leukoplakia spreading on the tongue and ulcers all over the tongue and other parts of oral cavity. Swollen, red and bleeding gums. It all was so painful I could hardly eat or drink for 10 days and everything had to be liquid and served room temperature.\n\nI saw 6 specialists who all had high suspicion of autoimmune flare. Positive ANA. Thanks to an Otolaryngologist I got some Magic Mouth wash and everything disappeared but it keeps trying to come back if I stop the Mouthwash.\n\nCannot get into Rheumatology until November. Anyone else present like this?", "Newly diagnosed! Only took 20 years! What do I do now? Hi all-\n\nI am new to this group and newly diagnosed within the last month with presumptive BD. I have been on this health quest for almost 20 years now, and more specifically the last 5, full desperation, on my third round of specialists and finally got this \u201csomewhat\u201d diagnosis. If you count when my symptoms started, age 8, its actually 32 years later and only just now getting some real answers. \n\nI thought the skies and the seas would part when diagnosis day came but alas, it was just another day of what do I do next? \n\nThis new rheumatologist suggested Azathioprine as a first line of treatment. I already did prednisone for a few years (obviously realizing that was not sustainable). I had started hormone therapy with the goal of getting pregnant right before the worst flare of my life and had to stop everything to focus on just getting \u201cbetter.\u201d I am back on the upswing a year later but I am nervous and confused if this is the right course of treatment for me because I am hoping to try to get pregnant again soon (within the year). My RA says it is fine. The majority of my care team says do not go on it, I am getting conflicting messages online and not sure what to do. What is the deal? I can read all I want online or research till my eyes cross but I trust that hearing from you-real people-and your experiences will help me make the best decision.\n\nWhat is your experience with Azathioprine? How does this medication impact fertility &amp; pregnancy? Is it crazy to start this medication during the Covid times? How bad are the initial side effects? Why did she opt for this med vs the TNF inhibitors? Should I get a 2nd opinion from one of the Beh\u00e7ets centers?! \n\nI am open to any and all feedback and beyond grateful to have finally found my people! My doctor added it in addition to Humira because apparently that combo helps with GI issues, but I honestly cannot tell a difference. I have had it on it is own as well (in the very beginning) and it did not do much beyond help with oral ulcers. My doc did say that I have to stop taking it if I want to get pregnant. I believe the approach is to start with meds that are easier to prescribe and to see if those help before moving onto more expensive drugs like biologics. It is a long tedious process unfortunately. Personally I am going to talk to my doctor about removing it from my med cocktail because I do not believe it outweighs the risk. Doc says it is increases risk of skin cancer as well. Messaging you", "My introduction &amp; Question about vision loss? Hello everyone! I was just diagnosed today. I am 29F and I had symptoms of vaginal ulcers, chronic mouth ulcers and many skin lesions, but no vision symptoms. \n\nI have been doing a lot of research and I am feeling super worried about eventually losing vision to this disease, I was wondering if anyone has any information about how much is preventable and what is inevitable... I read on wikipedia that 20% of people with behcets have permanent vision loss throughout the disease. My vision is by far my most important sense, far above hearing for me, all my work is visual, my hobbies are all visual and creativity based, my whole life, I depend on my eyes more than anything. Also I have been told that visually they are my best feature, so the idea that they will eventually turn red or ugly is pretty heartbreaking. Hey there! \n\nI am 21(m) and was diagnosed about 3 or 4 months ago. My symptoms have always been pretty mild. Thankfully the sores I get are only localized to my mouth and not my gentilals or GI tract, and my flare ups happen very infrequently. \n\nIn fact the only reason they diagnosed me was because of my eyes. I have vasculitis and uveitis due to the condition. It started out as a bit of a white blur and progressively got worse. I have those little \"floaters\" in my vision pretty much constantly. The blurriness comes and goes with seemingly no reason at all. \n\nSometimes my vision gets very bad as to where I am unable to read slides while in lectures. Most of the time however my vision is actually pretty good, as they have me on azathioprine and that seems to keep the symptoms down well enough that I do not even really notice it anymore. \n\nIf you are worried about your vision I would suggest talking to an ophthalmologist and figuring out a treatment plan with your rheumatologist.  Thankfully from what my doctors have told me is that complete vision loss is not particularly likely with this disease and that symptoms can be easily managed for the most part, depending on the severity of your condition. \n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to PM me or ask here. ", "behcets hello my girlfriend has been diagnosed with behcets at the end of last year there are days where she feels almost normal then there are days she is just in so much pain either it be her knees hurting or has skin lesion / ulcers all over she was 17 when she was diagnosed and she is 18 now she has been taking steroids for the past couple weeks because she had a crippling flair up but she takes colchicine daily it works but every couple months they have been upping her dose does anyone have any ideas on something that i can do to help her day a little easier when she has flair ups or just something new she should try? First of all, good for you for wanting to help your girlfriend. I cannot help but sympathize. I was 16 when I was diagnosed, so I know how scary it can be at that age (any age, really). \n\nThe most important thing you can do is exactly what you are doing: accept that she has a legitimate medical condition and try to be as supportive as possible. It is not easy being with someone with a chronic illness. Just being there for her, a shoulder to cry on, an ear to vent to - that is the single best thing you can do. \n\nAnother thing you can do is help to keep her stress levels down. By stress, I mean both psychological and physical, but mostly the former. Stress can make symptoms worse. Do what you can to help ease some of her stressors, especially when her symptoms are bad. \n\nAnd lastly, educate yourself about Behcet's disease. Learn all you can about it. And connect with others who either have the disease themselves or family that does. This community is awesome and there are several great FB groups dedicated to Behcet's. \n\nI would encourage your girlfriend to connect with others with the disease. I am sure you want to do everything you can for her and that is admirable. But the one thing you cannot do is know what it is like to have Behcet's. Only others with the illness really know. So encourage her to reach out - but do not be pushy. Maybe she is not ready. It can take time to fully accept something like Behcet's. \n\nAgain, I am proud of you for wanting to help. Dating someone with a chronic illness is not easy. Just that fact that you are sticking around tells me a lot about you. You are on the right track. Keep doing what you are doing. And if she is not already on here, tell your girlfriend she is more than welcome to join this subreddit. Best of luck to you both. I hope this helps. that was really nice of you thank you, but yes she is in facebook groups and she knows almost everything there is to know about it she is a really smart girl she research\u2019s everything to a T i just feel bad when she goes through her flair ups because there is almost nothing i can do but comfort her and i just wish there was more i can do but thank you for the help! You are welcome. Just being there for her, being supportive and understanding, does a lot. Like *a lot* a lot. Probably more than either of you realize.", "Easily one of the worst ulcers of my entire life (2018)  Oof! I hope you are seeing a doctor for the flare. I cannot imagine that healing in less than a month, maybe two, on it is own. My Behcets has actually been in complete remission for a few years now, thanks to medicinal cannabis! My uvula still never grew back though lol I missed the date! Glad you are feeling better!", "What is been your experience with the vaccine if you have had it? (Here is mine) Hi! I have had BD since the age of 1 (I am now 41), in remission. Got 1st Moderna shot 1/7 &amp; have been having symptoms since (12 days now). Daily chills, fevers (99.5-100), bad headache (starting to lessen), extreme dizziness, nausea. A few days ago started getting slight runny nose &amp; plugged ears. Took 2 COVID tests to rule that out (both negative).\n\nToday was my first day feeling awesome. Thought I was in the clear, but then all the symptoms hit like a train in the evening for a few hours. \n\nAnyone else having similar experience? I live in Italy so no vaccine for me yet. They are still vaccinating all medical staff and the elders (I am only 18), but I will honestly take fevers and headache over possible lungs collapse. Hey man, just want to let you know that the chance of your lung collapsing is basically 0%. You are 18. Most people your age do not even get symptoms. I am in my 40s and I had the sniffles for 3 days. I live in Michigan and I do not see the vaccine being available to me anytime soon.  I have read up on the side effects and I still honestly cannot wait to get it. I have been living in fear of covid for way too long. I just want some sanity back and a peace of mind. Wow. Sucks that you have been feeling the effects for that long. I have had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and aside from some flulike symptoms that lasted about 48 hours, I had no trouble with it. I have experienced a flare that seemed to be triggered by a flu shot, so I feel like it is possible that some people with BD can experience reactions to vaccines. Do you feel like there is any chance it could be unrelated to the vaccine? Thanks. Yeah, I took two COVID tests to rule that out (both negative). Today I finally had a good day, so I am hoping I am just an outlier \ud83e\udd1e", "Free, Virtual Behcet's Conference on 10/17 Found this on Facebook:\n\nBehcet\u2019s UK will be hosting the 2020 virtual Behcet\u2019s Conference on Saturday, October 17th.

I am dealing with a nasty flare and somehow at no point in time before today did I think to check what the time difference was.

I am so glad I have this space to help when the brain fog kicks in.", "Doctor said on the fence of diagnosing me with Behcet... what can I do? Hello everyone,\n\nMy doctor recently told me it is highly likely I have Behcet disease, as there is no test to diagnose it. Like many here I was happy to know something was found after over a year of going to doctors inside and outside the USA. I was not happy with this, but at least it feels like a step forward.\n\nI am 22/m and wonder if anyone has had similar problems to mine. I have the common ulcers in my mouth, stomach pain, and instead of ulcers in my genital area I have constant inflammation. My doctor also found some ridiculously high IgE leves, so he does not want to label me as a Behcet patient yet, until we rule out the allergies causing most of the symptoms. I have also been having swollen lymph nodes for quite some time with no signs of bacteria, virus, etc. So that also does not match the symptoms, but after checking for mono, Epstein, strep, and all kinds of similar diseases which turned out negative, we are still thinking it is Behcet.\n\nI would like to know what most of you do to control it? I am currently outside the US and will have a hard time going to the doctors once I am back due to having no insurance and the cost overall, what kind of over the counter products work well with the various parts this disease affects?\n\nI had to leave school for the past 2 years because of the pain I keep getting. But knowing this is something I might have to deal with for my entire life, I want to go back and try to handle the pain best as I can. I will keep reading older post and working with my doctor before heading back to the US. Thanks! It could be behcets but the only definite symptom you have is aphthous ulcers and you need like 4 more symptoms to definitely be called behcets \n\nFor me I had:\nMouth ulcers\nGeneral ulcers\nPathergy\nErythema nodosum\nUveitis\nJoint pain\nGI inflammation \n\nAnd I was diagnosed and reconfirmed by 5 doctors including Yusuf Yazici who was running a behcets research clinic at NYU before returning to turkey.\n\nAs far as treatment I am not currently in any, I spent two years doing every trial medication available and I did not respond to any of them so I am just waiting for something new \n\nI am also in the US, 24/f and I have been legally disabled since winning my case in January.\n\nYou can message me any time Thanks for the insight!\nWhat you said is exactly why my doctor does not want to label me with Behcets yet, but is looking at it as a likely candidate.\n\nI had a colonoscopy and endoscopy which showed a quite a lot of inflammation of the GI tract, but again it can be due to anything else.\n\nI am sorry you are going through such a tough time with no luck from medicine.\n", "Eye issues with Behcets Hello BD peeps! I woke up this morning with a bunch of redness in my eye, and am curious if it looks similar to eye involvement from Behcets that others have had. My rheum asked me to get checked out by an eye doctor if I had eye stuff again, but it does not look like I will be able to get in before the weekend. Does this ( look familiar to anyone? Thanks! Hi :) I have BD too. Yes, maybe uveitis. Hope this helps. Feel better soon. It does not look my eye when I get uveitis, but everyone is different. My eye does look like that when I get episcilieritis though, so it could be that. Are you experiencing pain? The tip off that it is an emergency for me is the level of pain I have. It is a little tender (kind of feels dry and burns a bit?) but nothing major. I definitely was not thinking it was an emergency Thank you! It does not sound like uveitis most people experience if there is not some level of pain. When I have had flare ups before I have had like, nearly agonizing pain and it hurts to move your eye and light hurts it and so on. If it feels dry maybe it is dry and some artificial tears could help? Definitely get it checked out though, even if it is episclieritis they can give you medicated drops for it. \n\nAgreed with Newblog, uveitis is a sharp stabby pain with lots of redness. However, many people with Behcets have chronic dry eye due to inflammation but thankfully that can be managed more simply with eye drops :) \n\n( Hey! I have BD and my eyes will get like that and burn. Like every time I blink it feels like I have a bit of soap in my eyes. I have not been able to talk to my doc about it yet and was planning on making a post like you. Idkif someone else can provide clarity for the both of us! Ha. Yeah, that is a good description, mine feels the same! I have had it a couple of times before. My doc was not too worried, but did want me to get it checked out if it happened again, but of course it had to happen right before a weekend \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Thank you!! Definitely my eye gets like that.. not painful just inflamed and irritated (and irritatING!) Glad to know it is not just me, but sorry you have it too! My uveitis looks like that and burns but is not crazy painful. The key for me is that I specifically get iritis, so my pupil does not dilate and constrict equally compared to the healthy side, and my vision gets quite blurry.", "Newly Diagnosed and I am lost \ud83d\ude31 Hello, I have been recently diagnosed with Behcet; weirdly I am AA...(not so weird) 43, female. So apparently this is not so common in AA\u2019s. I\u2019be been doing research just to get familiar with all of this. It is a bit overwhelming, to say the least. However, I am glad to have found a place created to share and help others understand. \n\nMy question is, has anyone experienced difficulties breathing. I have been tested for C19 several times and all negative. Yet, I have developed this new symptom that mirrors asthma. It is so frustrating because it seems I go from one issue to the next. Can anyone share an experience of breathing related issues and how did you manage it?\n\nThanks What does \"AA\" mean? I have not been diagnosed yet but I am treated as if I am, Drs are just hesitant. I have the same breathing difficulty, sometimes it feels like I inhaled campfire smoke and my lungs are burning and I am short of breath. Sucks, it is worst in the morning when it is bad. No asthma, just assumed to be subacute lung inflammation. Meloxicam did put a dent in the symptom when it was bad, but I had to stop due to stomach issues. I think African American. I apologize, I am African-American. My providers were very skeptic and hesitant about my diagnosis. But as months passed, I kept showing up with new symptoms that were all pointing to BD. Now keep in mind this has been over a period of 10 years, and as of recently more symptoms and illness group together more frequently. So basically, I have the years it started with one issue. That issue was \u201cresolved\u201d then a new issue would show up, get \u201cresolved\u201d, then a new issue...This was continuously happening until over the past few months I started having multiple symptoms together (mouth ulcers, GI problems, joint pain, skin irritation, uveitis, etc. AND NOW adding breathing complications. So finally they went ahead and diagnosed. Well the breathing is especially concerning me since Covid. Mine causes more problems at night during bedtime or when I hit the air outside. It is pretty annoying and concerning all at the same time. It impacts my ability to get sleep; some days it is so bad I am just so scared I will not wake. You can take 1800mg daily of NAC (900mg am/900mg pm) to help with breathing/lungs and overall helping your body\u2019s detoxification pathways.\nMessage me if you would like to chat more! I know it is overwhelming but there are ways to help yourself \u2665\ufe0f Yes. I have had shortness of breath daily since January 2019 combined with chest pain. I was diagnosed with pericarditis, but it has just continued. It is miserable. I am so sorry you are experiencing this too. So far the only thing that helps is colchicine, but it is starting to mess with my kidneys two years later. It is not ideal. When I am having a bad flare I cannot walk ten feet without being completely out of breath. My voice gets weak too, and talking sometimes feels like the most exhausting thing I have ever done. Eating too, I will have to take breaks just to breathe. \n\nI am not sure if this mimics what you are experiencing but I hope it helps. Oh my I am sorry that you are now having the kidney issue. I have not had chest pain\u2019s significant enough to where it bothers me a whole lot. Or maybe it is just I am sick of things happening I try to ignore as much as I can. I will ask about the colchicine, and see what the doc says. Thanks. Exactly THIS! I was just mentioning to someone how it is even hard to eat without getting winded. This is so wild to me. I am so glad I found this thread. I was really starting to believe it was all in my head, and that stress and anxiety was causing all of these issues. Yes, my voice gets weak and sometimes I go into a full blown coughing fit where I cannot stop coughing from shortness of breath. \n\nWhat is even more weird is how ppl look and react to my response of saying I have BD. Because it is not so common, most are like \ud83d\ude0f yeah ok, sounds like Covid to me. Thanks for sharing and offering the extra help with understanding all of this. I will grab some tomorrow. I will also do some reading on it this evening. TBH it is causing some depression or is that also part of this. It is like every day I find something new or learn of a new symptom that could be on the way. This is awful guys. I really hate this for us. Makes me sad. I mean, I know this is not the only disease in the world but with lack of research I feel like we have to suffer each episode in it is entirety. Just draining!!! Many of your symptoms sound like lupus, which has many overlap symptoms with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. I have both but this is quite rare. Lupus is not uncommon in the AA community. Have you been thoroughly checked out for lupus? Yes, I have been checked, twice actually. I was even told many Churg Strauss. But all roads have led back to BD. I have noticed multiple people on this forum that had good luck with colchicine (brand named colcrys). I still get ulcers and such while taking it, but it does help with the chest pain. Just out of curiosity, how often do you get ulcers? (If you do not mind sharing). I had them 4 times last year but they covered my entire mouth and lasted several weeks. Maybe some relief after about 3 weeks with heavy doses of prednisone. The first time I had them, the prednisone cleared it in about a week. But then it started taking longer to go away. Now, I almost have anxiety when I feel any strange feeling in my mouth. It is terrible and I can barely talk, swallow, or eat. I really just want to be left alone. My ulcers have always been a fairly regular occurrence. I have only had rare instances where it was most of my mouth at the same time, but any bite or scrape inside my mouth always turns into a big nasty ulcer. I have the same anxiety any time I feel anything out of the ordinary inside my mouth or on my labia, but honestly I am so used to the mouth ulcers they are more annoying than debilitating. They do get bad enough sometimes that its hard to talk. I have had them for as long as I could remember. When I was a kid we kept chloraseptic(sp?) Spray in the bathroom all the time so that my sister (also has behcets) and me could spray our mouths before eating so we could eat properly when we had really bad ulcers. Oh wow. I have not had any on my vagina, but I think possibly once or twice right on my rectum and it was very painful to use the bathroom. This was early on when it was speculation that this was BD. Since being diagnosed I have not had any. My doc did prescribe a oral rinse that is like a numbing agent. It helps, but after about 30 minutes I am frustrated again from the pain. I am so sorry that both you and your sister have dealt with this for so long. ((HUGS)) Ouch!!! Rectum sounds awful! I thankfully have not had any vaginal ulcers in about a decade. \ud83e\udd1e it sounds like your mouth ulcers are seriously bad though. I hope your doc can come up with a treatment plan to attack them more aggressively.", "mouth sores that are not like canker sores?? So I am still in the process of a potential diagnosis based on skin lesions/recurrent genital ulcers but I do not get ulcers in my mouth that are painful or like canker sores. I do get what looks like a cold sore around the time of a flare up, it usually doesnt last more than a day though and I have been tested for herpes during my last genital ulcer flare (came back negative). I also get little bumps in my mouth sometimes that are almost like pimples. Not painful or anything, just strange. I was wondering if anyone experiences mouth sores/bumps like these? My Dr seems to agree I need to see a rheumatologist to discuss behcets as I fit a lot of other symptoms that are not mouth ulcers. I get the bumps too. My mouth sores are open red wounds, with a pale circle around them. It can depend alot on what you eat and how crunchy it is. Do you have ocular issues?\n\nThe mouth sores are the hallmark of Beh\u00e7et's and from my understanding, the only other thing can pop up first (in a small amount of cases) is ocular issues, like ocular hemorrhage and vision loss (when you look up Beh\u00e7et's, one of the top images is a blood eye -- that is the type of ocular issues caused by Beh\u00e7et's). My understanding of the diagnostic criteria (I actually JUST discussed this with my doctor like, three hours ago, haha) is that either ocular or oral ulcers must be present and cannot be substituted for any other symptoms. They are like the \"stepping stones\" of sorts in diagnostic criteria that if you do not hit, you cannot keep going.\n\nOtherwise, Beh\u00e7et's belongs to a class of diseases (generally) known as vasculitis. Vasculitis in general cause lots of sores and lesions in various places on the body -- it is possible if you fit many of the more vague symptoms, you might just have a different type of vasculitis. There are dozens, and Beh\u00e7et's is actually one of the more rare forms, so its entirely likely you are in the correct disease family (depending on what your symptoms are, anyway) and just focussing on the wrong disease. Rheum would help you out for sure, so definitely follow up on that referral. I do get random inflammation in my eyes where they get really red and just feel generally inflamed. Its actually happening right now. I still need to get into a rheumatologist to discuss all the symptoms further", "15 yo son w Beh\u00e7et\u2019s oral ulcers - advise please "]
